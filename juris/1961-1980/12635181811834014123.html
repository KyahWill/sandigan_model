				<BR><STRONG>CASTRO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an original petition for certiorari, prohibition and
injunction with preliminary injunction to oust the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City of jurisdiction to try, hear and decide ci­vil
case Q-12580, which is an action for annulment of sale with preliminary
injunction filed by the respondent La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Food
Products, Inc.</p>

<p class="BODY">The present litigation evolved out of a labor dispute that arose
way back in 1951 between the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span> Ng <span class="SpellE">Mga</span> <span class="SpellE">Manggagawa</span> Sa La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> (hereinafter referred to as the <span class="SpellE">Ka­isahan</span>),
on the one hand, and the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Coffee Factory,
Inc. and a certain Tan Tong, who was then doing business under the name of La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> <span class="SpellE">Gaugau</span> Packing, on the
other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that dispute, the jurisdiction
of the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) to take cognizance of the case
against the coffee corporation was posed in issue before us on the ground that
the 30-complainants rule prescribed by Commonwealth Act 103 was not complied
with, there being then only 14 persons employed in the coffee factory, only 5
of whom were members of the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span> and that, more­over,
the permit of the union was suspended by the Secretary of the Department of
Labor.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Holding that the CIR had jurisdiction to entertain the case, we
said, with reference to the first point raised, that</p>

<blockquote>“... This contention loses force when it is noted that, as found by
the industrial court - and this finding is conclusive upon us - La <span class="SpellE">Cam­pana</span> <span class="SpellE">Gaugau</span> Packing [which
was the business name and style used by Tan Tong as proprietor of this
particular investment] and La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Coffee Factory,
Inc., are operating under one single management, that is, as one business
though with two trade names.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True, the
coffee factory is a corporation and, by legal fiction, an entity existing
separate and apart from the persons composing it, that is, Tan Tong and his
family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it is settled that this
fiction of law, which has been introduced as a matter of convenience and to <span class="SpellE">subserve</span> the ends of justice cannot be invoked to further
an end subversive of that purpose."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">We then remanded the case for trial by
the CIR, where subse­quently other allied cases involving the same litigants
arose and were jointly heard.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1956" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1956</st1:date>,
however, while those cases were pend­ing adjudication, Ramon <span class="SpellE">Tantongco</span> (or Tan Tong) died, for which reason, the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span> moved for the inclusion of Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Tantongco</span>, who was appointed administrator of the estate of
the deceased, as party defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
the CIR granted this motion, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Tantongco</span> asked
the said court to dismiss the cases then pending against the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> <span class="SpellE">Gaugau</span> Packing and the La
<span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Cof­fee Factory, Inc., on the ground that
they were mere money claims that should be filed with the probate court having
jurisdic­tion over the estate of Ramon <span class="SpellE">Tantongco</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on <st1:date year="1956" day="12" month="11">November
 12, 1956</st1:date>, the CIR rendered a partial decision in the main case
between the parties, the <span class="SpellE">dispo­sitive</span> portion of
which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the Court finds the management of
the respondent La <span class="SpellE">Cam­pana</span> Starch &amp; Coffee
Factory [the name by which the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span> chose to
refer to the coffee corpora­tion and the <span class="SpellE">gaugau</span>
packing factory] guilty of un­fair labor practice under Section 5 of Common­wealth
Act No. 312, and for having dismissed the said workers and admitted new ones,
without first securing authority from this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>..."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This decision was followed, on February 18, 1957, by another
order, relative to the other allied cases, directing the management of the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> <span class="SpellE">Gaugau</span> Packing and the La
<span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Coffee Factory, Inc. (or, as referred to by
the <span class="SpellE">Kai­sahan</span>, the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span>
Starch and Coffee Factory) as well as the administrator of Ramon <span class="SpellE">Tantongco's</span> estate to reinstate the laborers therein
mentioned, with back wages.</p>

<p class="BODY">This order of February 18, 1957 and the previous order of the CIR
<span class="SpellE">impleading</span> Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Tantongco</span>
(as administrator of the estate of Ramon <span class="SpellE">Tantongco</span>)
as party-defendant, were appeal­ed to this Court by certiorari in G. R.
L-12355, but this appeal was summarily dismissed by minute resolution of June
12, 1957.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 10, 1957, due to the termination of the intes­tate
proceedings re the estate of Ramon <span class="SpellE">Tantongco</span>, Ricardo
<span class="SpellE">Tantongco</span>, acting as representative of the legal
heirs of the de­ceased, wrote a letter to the employees of the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Starch Packing with address at 74-76 <span class="SpellE">Luskot</span> Street, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City,
notifying them that the "LA CAMPANA STARCH PACK­ING, which is the business
name used in connection with all the business of the deceased Don Ramon <span class="SpellE">Tantongco</span>, is now to be closed on Saturday, September 14,
1957, on the ground that the Intestate Estate Proceedings of the deceased Don
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Tantongco</span>, under Special Proceedings No. Q-1879
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City is
already closed."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1957" day="13" month="8">August 13, 1957</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span> petitioned the CIR for the execution of
its decision of <st1:date year="1957" day="18" month="2">February 18, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Tan­tongco</span>,
however, refused to comply with the writ subsequently issued which directed him
and/or the management of the coffee corporation and the starch packing factory
to reinstate the work­ers affected in the case and deposit with the CIR the
latter's <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> which then amounted to P65,534.01,
contending that he was no longer the administrator of the estate of Ramon <span class="SpellE">Tan­tongco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this
refusal, the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span> sought to have Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Tantongco</span> declared in contempt of court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter thereupon filed a petition for
certiorari and prohibition with this Court for the purpose of enjoining the CIR
from proceeding with the hear­ing of the contempt proceedings against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We, however, de­nied his petition on <st1:date year="1959" day="22" month="9">September 22, 1959</st1:date>, in the following
terms:</p>

<blockquote>"In conclusion, we find and hold that the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Starch and Food Products Company which stands for
the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Starch and Coffee Factory are entities
distinct from the personality of Ramon <span class="SpellE">Tantongco</span>;
that after the death of Ramon these two entities continued to exist and to
operate under the <u>management</u> of petitioner [referring to Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Tantongco</span>] and that consequently he is the proper person
and <u>official</u> to which the orders of the CIR are addressed and who is
duty bound to comply with the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>..."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Then, on <st1:date year="1960" day="11" month="2">February 11,
 1960</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span> filed an <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> motion for the issuance of a writ of execution
as prayed for in its motion of <st1:date year="1957" day="13" month="8">August
 13, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this motion,
the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span> also sought to have the name of "La
<span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Food Products, Inc." included in the
writ, alleging that "the name of the respondent company [ob­viously
referring to the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Starch and Coffee
Factory] has been changed to La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Food
Products, Inc." Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Tantongco</span> and the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Food Products, Inc. came to know of this motion of
the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span>, however, and accordingly filed a joint
opposition thereto, the former reiterating that he was no longer the
administrator of the estate of Ramon <span class="SpellE">Tantongco</span>, and
the latter, on the ground that it is a "corporation duly organized under
and by virtue of the laws of the Philippines sometime on January 31, 1953 and
had acquired a juridical personality distinct and separate from other entities,
particularly the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Starch and Coffee
Factory."</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on the motion of the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span>,
the Acting Clerk of the CIR issued, on <st1:date year="1960" day="8" month="3">March
 8, 1960</st1:date>, the writ of execution prayed for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant thereto, the Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, on <st1:date year="1960" day="10" month="3">March
 10, 1960</st1:date>, levied upon eleven trucks which were claimed by La <span class="SpellE">Cam­pana</span> Food Products, Inc. as its properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before the Sheriff could effectuate the
execution of the judgment, however, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Tantongco</span>
and the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Food Products, Inc., filed a
petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction with the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City to enjoin the said execution, on the basis of
which, on <st1:date year="1960" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1960</st1:date>,
the CFI issued a temporary restraining order.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <span class="SpellE">Decemberber</span> 13, 1960, by virtue of this
restraining order, the Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City returned
the writ unsatisfied.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, on <st1:date year="1960" day="10" month="11">November
 10, 1960</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span> filed with this
Court a petition to declare the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City without jurisdiction to issue a writ of preliminary injunction and
prohibition against the CIR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1961</st1:date>, we held in this case
that as the CIR is equal in rank to the CFI, the latter cannot issue this kind
of writs against the former.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Before our decision in the above-mentioned case was rendered,
however, the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span> filed another motion for an <u>alias</u>
writ of execution with the CIR for the enforcement of its orders of <st1:date year="1957" day="18" month="2">February 18, 1957</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1957" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1957</st1:date>, which mo­tion was
granted on <st1:date year="1961" day="13" month="5">May 13, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant thereto, the Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, on <st1:date year="1961" day="28" month="7">July
 28, 1961</st1:date>, levied upon six motor vehi­cles which were, again,
claimed by the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Food Pro­ducts, Inc. to be
its properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Sheriff scheduled
the sale of these vehicles on <st1:date year="1961" day="5" month="8">August 5,
 1961</st1:date>, ignoring the protest of the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span>
Food Products, Inc.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 1, 1961, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Tantongco</span>
and the La <span class="SpellE">Campa­na</span> Food Products, Inc., to forestall
the sale, filed a petition for certiorari, prohibition and injunction with this
Court to de­clare the writ of execution issued on March 8, 1960 by the Act­ing
Clerk of the CIR and the <u>alias</u> writ of execution issued on July 5, 1961
by the CIR null and void.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Tantongco</span> ar­gued that as under our decision
in L-13119, promulgated <st1:date year="1959" day="22" month="9">Septem­ber 22,
 1959</st1:date>, <u>supra</u>, the deceased Ramon <span class="SpellE">Tantongco</span>
was de­clared not a party respondent to the cases pending before the CIR filed
by the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span>, therefore, the aforesaid writs
should not be directed against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the other hand, the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Food Products, Inc.
contended that it was never a party respon­dent in any of those cases and hence
should not also be made to respond to the <span class="SpellE">CIR’s</span>
decisions in said cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="3" month="8">August 3, 1961</st1:date>,
we resolved this petition as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"After a study of the allegations of the peti­tion for
certiorari, prohibition and injunction filed in case L-18671 (La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Food Products, Inc., et al. vs. Hon. S. Bautista,
etc., et al.), with pray­er for preliminary injunction, IT IS FOUND that the
petition should be, as it is hereby, DISMISSED for lack of merit.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on the same date that the above decision was rendered,
the Development Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
filed a third-party claim to the assets of the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span>
Food Products, Inc., on the basis of a mortgage loan to the said entity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On May 31, 1963 the CIR <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>,
reversing an order of its Presiding Judge, ruled that the lien of the DBP, as a
third-party claimant, should be respected, and that the complainants (referring
to the mem­bers of the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span>) should post a bond
in order to effect the sale of the panel trucks which were registered in the
name of the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Food Products, Inc. to protect
the rights of the DBP.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1965</st1:date>,
the CIR, upon motion of the <span class="SpellE">Kaisa­han</span>, issued an order
allowing the issuance of a writ of execution against the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span>
Starch and Coffee Factory and Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Tantongco</span>, as
administrator of the estate of the deceased Ramon <span class="SpellE">Tantongco</span>,
Pursuant thereto, a writ of execution was issued on <st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span>, however, later moved for the
amendment of the writ, specifically praying for the "enclosure of La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Starch and Coffee Factory, La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gaugau</span> Packing Co., La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span>
Coffee Factory, Inc., La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Food Products, Inc.
and/or Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Tantongco</span> as the parties against whom
the <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> and remedies delineated in the writ
should be directed and implemented." This motion was granted by the CIR on
<st1:date year="1967" day="3" month="7">July 3, 1967</st1:date>, and, pursuant
thereto, the Clerk of Court on <st1:date year="1967" day="1" month="8">August
 1, 1967</st1:date>, issued an amended writ of execution the pertinent portion
of which reads as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">In compliance with the above writ, the Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City levied upon several parcels of land (claimed by

was issued without due process of law as it was made to apply to the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Food Products, Inc. which was never a party in any
of the cases mentioned in the said writ.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It also asked that the projected sale be restrained.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pending study of the merits of the motion of the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Food Products, Inc., the CIR stayed the prospective

denied the said motion for reconsideration, holding that the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Food Products, Inc. "has been, in
contemplation of law as well as by judicial pronouncement particularly in the light
of the Supreme Court's resolution in G.R. No. L-18671 dated <st1:date year="1961" day="3" month="8">August 3, 1961</st1:date> dis­missing for lack of

request that the sale be held in abeyance until it received the decision of the
CIR on its mo­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Sheriff, however,
went through with the sale just the same on the scheduled date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the auction, the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span>
ap­peared as the only bidder, and bought the parcels of land for P255,258.88.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Food
Products, Inc. filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City dat­ed <st1:date year="1968" day="9" month="11">November
 9, 1968</st1:date> for annulment of sale with damages with preliminary
injunction against the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span>, the Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Que­zon</span> City and the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
April 19, 1969, pending adjudication on the merits of this complaint, the
herein respondent Judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City issued an order restraining the Sheriff from issuing a cer­tificate of
sale to the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span> and the Register of Deeds from
accepting and/or registering any document in connection with the said sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span> then filed the petition at
bar, assailing the jurisdiction of the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City to take cognizance of the complaint of the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span>
Food Products, Inc., mainly on the ground that a civil court cannot pass upon,
alter, correct and/ or modify a writ or decree emanating from the Court of
Indus­trial Relations and that the proper forum in which to quash a writ of
execution is the very court which issued the writ.</p>

<p class="BODY">The La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Food Products, Inc., one
of the respon­dents herein, contends, on the other hand, that there is nothing
specified in its complaint that it seeks to be reviewed and/or re­versed by the
Court of First Instance, much less any order, de­cision, mandate or any
actuation of the CIR, as it is only the official actuations of the Sheriff in
connection with the sale which are questioned in the said CFI.</p>

<p class="BODY">The La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Food Products, Inc.
maintains that the questioned sale is null and void, for the following reasons:</p>

<p class="NUM">(a) The properties sold were worth P10 million but were sold for
the unconscionable price of only P255,258.88.</p>

<p class="NUM">(b) The writ did not authorize the sale as the mandate there is
merely to reinstate the dismissed employees and col­lect their <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> and to return the same within 15 days from
compliance.</p>

<p class="NUM">(c) Even if the sale were authorized by the writ, the She­riff
violated the procedure laid down in Rule 39 of the Rules of Court in that -</p>

<p class="2Q">1) the sale on <st1:date year="1968" day="5" month="11">November 5,
 1968</st1:date> was beyond the 60-day period <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of the writ as provided in Section 11 of Rule 39;</p>

<p class="2Q">2) the sale made was in violation of Section 18, Rule 39 as the
requirement of posting of notices for 20 days in three public places was not
complied with, because while the Second Notice of Sheriff's Sale is dated
October 22, 1968, the sale actually took place on November 5, 1968, a
lapse-period of only 14 days, and the notice, moreover, was posted only at one
place;</p>

<p class="2Q">3) the required newspaper publication was not made because the
first and only newspaper publication for the sale was on October 19 and 26 and
November 2, 1967 for the sale scheduled on November 10, 1967; no such
publication was made for the questioned sale of November 5, 1968; and</p>

<p class="2Q">4) the Sheriff did not comply with Section 9, Rule 39 of the Rules
of Court, that is, he did not attach a certified copy of the judgment to the
writ.</p>

<blockquote>(d) Lastly, there was no valid levy since the <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span> entered in the titles of its
properties is not allowable under the Torrens System and should be stricken out
inasmuch as the basis of the same is an amended writ of execution enforcing a
judgment for reinstatement of employees and back wages, and not against the
titled real properties concerned nor involving the said proper­ty (citing
Section 79, Act 496; Section 24, Rule 14, Rules of Court; and <span class="SpellE">Biglang-awa</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Constantino</span>,
L-9965, August 20, 1960).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the course of the consideration of the instant petition, this
Court received a motion to dismiss from the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span>
dated October 2, 1969, ostensibly in representation and on behalf of the
aggrieved individual members thereof, on the ground that the par­ties, that is,
the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span> and the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span>
Food Products, had entered into a compromise agreement settling all existing
dis­putes between them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this
agreement, the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span> admits and concedes that (1)
the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Food Products, Inc. has a dis­tinct
legal personality from the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Starch and
Coffee Factory; (2) the award to the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span> by the
CIR has no legal va­lidity against the said foods corporation; (3) the said
foods corporation was never a party to the proceedings before the CIR in the
aforementioned cases; (4) the writ did not authorize the sale of the real
properties of the corporation and, as it has already ex­pired, should be
declared null and void; (5) the notice of levy of execution (which the
respondent corporation prefers to call "<span class="SpellE">lis</span> <span class="SpellE">pendens</span>") annotated on the certificates of title of
the properties registered in the name of the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span>
Food Products, Inc. is unlawful and should be cancelled; (6) the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City has jurisdiction over the annulment case; and
(7) the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span> was in default in the court
below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span>
therefore agreed to withdraw the jurisdiction issue now pending before this
Court; the respondent company, on the other hand, waives all claims for damages
against the union.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 22, 1969,the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span>
informed this Court through a written manifestation of its incumbent officers
that it had terminated the services of Atty. Antonio B. <span class="SpellE">Abad</span>,
its coun­sel of record, and that in view of the compromise agreement between
the petitioning union and the respondent company, the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span>
is no longer interested in the further prosecution of this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1969</st1:date>
some of the laborers directly af­fected by the adjudications made by the CIR in
the aforemen­tioned cases filed a written manifestation with this Court through
Atty. Antonio B. <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> whereby they declared that they
never authorized the said incumbent officers of the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span>
to inter­vene or represent them in connection with the said decided labor
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They, therefore, prayed that the
motion to dismiss filed by the union be denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1970</st1:date>,
for failure of the respondents to submit a reply memorandum as required by us,
we considered the present petition submitted for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">1. The first material question that confronts us is whe­ther or
not the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over an action predicated upon
certain irregularities in procedure al­legedly committed by the Sheriff in the
sale of certain proper­ties where such sale was made pursuant to a writ of
execution issued by the Court of Industrial Relations.</p>

<p class="BODY">The powers vested by law in the Court of Industrial Rela­tions
include those powers that generally pertain to the courts of justice,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
and one of these, as stated more concretely by the Industrial Peace Act,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
is the power "To control, in the furtherance of justice, the conduct of
its ministerial officers, and of all other persons in any manner connected with
a case before it, in every manner appertaining thereto." Within the
framework of the facts heretofore mentioned, the Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City was undoubtedly acting solely in his capacity as a ministerial officer of
the CIR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, therefore, he commits any
error in the procedure or mode of executing his ministerial duties, the po­wer
of control of the CIR over him requires that any question regarding his
actuations in executing the court's order result­ing in prejudice to a party
litigant should be ventilated with the same court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were we to sanction the taking by the CFI of
jurisdiction over the complaint of the respondent company, we will in effect be
curtailing the effective exercise by the CIR of part of its powers vested by
law. Such a situation undoubtedly cannot be brought about unilaterally by this
Court without express grant of authority by Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proper step, therefore, that the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Food Products, Inc. should have taken, being the
party directly liable to respond to the adjudications of the CIR of November
12, 1956 and February 18, 1957 - its liability <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>
having been finally determined in the decision of the said court dated January
10, 1968 and affirmed by us in G. R. L-29031, promulgated on June 25, 1968 -
was to file with the CIR either a motion or a separate action to set aside the
said execution sale.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We now come to the
motion to dismiss filed by the pe­titioner union with this Court on <st1:date year="1969" day="2" month="10">October 2, 1969</st1:date> in relation to its
written manifestation of <st1:date year="1969" day="22" month="10">October 22,
 1969</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In our view, the compromise agreement submitted by the petitioner
union as basis for the motion to dismiss is not a pro­per ground for the
dismissal of the present petition, nor does it bar the prevailing individual
members of the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span> from ask­ing for the
enforcement of the above-mentioned adjudications of the CIR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The admissions made by the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span> through its in­cumbent officers are pure matters
of law which only the courts can determine with conclusive effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, some of the admissions contained
therein have already been finally adjudicated in the previous related
controversies between the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
the admission by the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span> that the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Food Products, Inc. has a distinct legal
personality from the La <span class="SpellE">Campa­na</span> Starch and Coffee
Factory can no longer be compromised since as determined by us in <u>La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Coffee Factory, Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span>
Ng <span class="SpellE">Mga</span> <span class="SpellE">Manggagawa</span> Sa La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span></u> (93 Phil. 161), the <span class="SpellE">gaugau</span>
or starch factory which is known as the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> <span class="SpellE">Gaugau</span> Packing and managed by Tan Tong as sole proprietor
is, for purposes of the claim of the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span>, not a
business entity separate and distinct from the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span>
Coffee Factory, Inc.; and as decided by the CIR in its resolution dated January
10, 1968 and affirmed by us in <span class="SpellE"><u>Kaisahan</u></span><u> Ng <span class="SpellE">Mga</span> <span class="SpellE">Manggagawa</span> Sa La <span class="SpellE">Cam­pana</span> vs. La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Starch
and Coffee Factory, Inc., et al</u>. (L-29031, June 25, 1968), the assets of
the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Food Pro­ducts, Inc. can legally be
subjected to execution under the <span class="SpellE">CIR's</span> adjudications
of November 12, 1956 and February 18, 1957.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, our own examination of the records of L-29031 shows that the
name "La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Food Products, Inc." came
about only by vir­tue of an amendment of the articles of incorporation of the
La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Coffee Factory, Inc. filed with the
Securities and Ex­change Commission on March 23, 1953, by virtue of which the
name of the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Coffee Factory, Inc. was
changed to La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Food Products, Inc.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other admission made by the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span>
in the said agreement, to wit, that the notice of levy of execution was unlaw­ful
and that the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City has jurisdiction over
the an­nulment case filed by the corporation, are matters which the union
cannot determine for itself since whether or not the said levy of execution was
unlawful depends on what the courts apply­ing the law will have to say about
that issue; and, on the other hand, as to the jurisdiction of the CFI over the
annulment case, the same cannot plainly be conferred by the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span>
upon the said court since only Congress can determine, apart from what the
Constitution provides, which court has what jurisdiction over what matters and
subjects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, as we have stated
earlier, the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City has no jurisdiction
to take cognizance of the said annulment case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The said compromise agreement, therefore, cannot be considered
binding against the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the same reason, the corporation cannot
also be considered bound by its pledge to waive its claim for damages, if there
be any due from the union arising out of the sale of the corporation's
properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the union's manifestation that it is no longer
interested in the prosecution of the case against the La <span class="SpellE">Campa­na</span>
Food Products, Inc., suffice it to say that, as held by us in a case decided
recently,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
this is not a sufficient reason for dismissing the claim of the union against
the employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The labor union as a
body in reality has not so great a material interest in the controversy as
would prejudice it in the event of dismissal." It is, indeed, the prevailing
union members for whose benefit the unfair labor practice case was prosecuted
to a successful conclusion who stand to suffer tremendous losses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The recognition of the right of working men to join, or assist in
the formation of, an association for the purpose of de­manding reasonable
concessions from their employer, and of their legitimate aspiration to work and
live decently, did not come by an Aladdin's lamp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No greater perfidy can be conceived than that
after a union has emerged victor in a bitterly-fought struggle, its officers,
by the simple expedient of a stroke of the pen, become <span class="SpellE"><u>particeps</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>criminis</u></span> in the betrayal of the union's
aggrieved members.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the termination of
the services of Atty. Antonio B. <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> to represent
the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span> in the present case and in any
subsequent case in which the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span> may be involved
against the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Food Products, Inc., it must
be em­phasized that the laborers in whose favor the decisions of the CIR were
rendered and which are now final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, ma­nifested
to this Court that they never authorized the incumbent officers of the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span> to intervene or represent them in con­nection with
the said decided labor disputes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view
of the lack of interest of the <span class="SpellE">Kaisahan</span> which is
acting as a representative party for and in behalf of its members, to face the
La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Food Products, Inc. in court for the final
settlement of the said decided labor cases, the proper procedure to follow in
any rela­ted cases that may arise as a result of the said decisions, is for the
affected laborers to be made parties thereto in accord­ance with Section 3,
Rule 3 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the respondent Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, being without jurisdiction to try, hear and de­cide
civil case Q-12580, is hereby directed forthwith to dismiss the said case; and
the compromise agreement between the <span class="SpellE">Kai­sahan</span> and
the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Food Products, Inc. is hereby declared
null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against the La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Food Pro­ducts, Inc.</p>
