and for accounting was filed on <st1:date year="1954" day="3" month="2">February
 <span style="">3, 1954</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> (Civil Case No. <span style="">3397-R).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appearing therein as plaintiffs were:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jose, Francis­co, Pedro, Jr., Ignacio, all
surnamed <span class="SpellE">Abuton-Celdran</span> (children of the deceased
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Celdran</span> by the first nup­tial) and, as the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Celdran</span>
(another brother), <span class="SpellE">Modesta</span> Rodriguez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants were:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pablo <span class="SpellE">Celdran</span>
(child of the deceased by the first marriage who refused to join as plaintiff),
<span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Celdran</span> (spouse of the deceased
by the second marriage), Manuel, Antonio, Pedro III, Jesus, Vicente and Miguel,
all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Fortich-Celdran</span> (children of the
deceased by the second nuptial).</p>

<p class="BODY">After the defendants answered on <st1:date year="1954" day="28" month="5">May 28, 1954</st1:date>, a motion to withdraw as co-plaintiff was
filed on <st1:date year="1957" day="24" month="5">May <span style="">24, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It was signed "Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Celdran</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
motion has been marked as <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">B-<span class="SpellE">Josefa</span>.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, with leave of court, the plaintiffs (excluding
Ignacio) filed an amended complaint <span class="SpellE">implead­ing</span>
Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Celdran</span> as defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Celdran</span>
filed an answer and, later, on <st1:date year="1959" day="16" month="2">February
 16, <span style="">1959</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>an amended answer with counterclaim
and cross-claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial but before judgment, Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Celdran</span>
had the document <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B-<span class="SpellE">Josefa</span>
(the motion to withdraw) examined by the Police Department of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The po­lice
were of the view that the same (signature therein) <span style="">was falsified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alleging </span>newly
discovered evidence, Igna­cio <span class="SpellE">Celdran</span> asked for new
trial, which the court denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">All the parties, except Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Celdran</span>,
thereafter entered on <st1:date year="1959" day="6" month="5">May <span style="">6, </span><span style="">1959</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>into an amicable settlement, re­cognizing
as valid the aforementioned extrajudicial par­tition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Celdran</span>, the court
rendered judg­ment on <st1:date year="1961" day="19" month="7">July 19, 1961</st1:date>,
declaring the same extrajudicial partition as valid for having been ratified by
him (Ignacio).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, the court
found among other things that Ignacio signed the motion to withdraw (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B-<span class="SpellE">Josefa</span>) after he received
P10,000<span style=""> </span>of the agreed P20,000
and two residential lots to be given to him in return for his aforesaid
ratification of the partition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said decision was later amended to require Pedro III, <span style="">Antonio, Jesus, Miguel and Vicente, </span>all
surnamed <span class="SpellE">Fortich-­Celdran</span>, to pay Ignacio the balance
of the P20<span class="GramE">,000</span> <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
and to deliver to him the promised two parcels of land.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Celdran</span> appealed <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> to the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And said appeal was docketed as CA-G.R. No.
30499-R, shown in the record before <span class="GramE">Us</span> as still
pending.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now on March 22, 1963, at the instance of Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Celdran</span>, an information for falsification of a public
document - that <span style="">is, </span><span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B-<span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> or the
abovementioned motion to withdraw in the civil case - was filed by the City
Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Ozamis</span> in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accused therein were:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pedro III,
An­tonio, Manuel, Vicente, Miguel, and Jesus, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Celdran</span>
(defendants in the civil case); Santiago <span class="SpellE">Catane</span>, as
subscribing officer; <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span>,
as the person who filed the motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">As private complainant, however, Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Celdran</span>,
on <st1:date year="1962" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1962</st1:date>,
moved before trial to suspend the proceedings in the criminal case on the
ground of pre­judicial question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
reason given in support thereof was that the alleged falsification of the same
document is at issue in the civil case pending in the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Declaring that there was no pre-judicial question, the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental denied on <st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1963</st1:date> the motion to
suspend the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It ruled that
the alleged forgery was not an <span style="">is­</span>sue
in the civil case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Assailing the above ruling, Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Celdran</span>
filed in the Court of Appeals on <st1:date year="1963" day="21" month="2">February
 21, 1963</st1:date>, a petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction
(CA-G.R. No. 31909-R) to enjoin the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Occidental and the City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Ozamis</span> from
proceeding with the prosecu­tion of the criminal case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="18" month="2">February 18, 1964</st1:date>
the Court of Appeals decided said petition for certiorari, ordering the
suspension of the criminal case due to pre-judicial question.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pedro III, Jesus, Manuel, Miguel and Vicente, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Fortich-Celdran</span>; Santiago <span class="SpellE">Catane</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span> -
accused in the criminal suit and respondents in the petition for certiorari -
appealed to Us from the decision of the Court of Appeals dated February 18,
1964.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants would contend that there is no pre-judi­cial question
involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that, as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, the Court of First Instance ruled that Ignacio
<span class="SpellE">Celdran</span> ratified the partition agreement; among the
rea­sons cited by the trial court for said ruling is that Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Celdran</span> received P10<span class="GramE">,000</span> <u>and
signed the motion to withdraw as plaintiff in the suit</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Disputing this, <span class="SpellE">Celdran</span>
assigned as error in his appeal the finding that he signed the aforementioned
motion (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B-<span class="SpellE">Josefa</span>) and
maintains that the same is a forgery.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since ratifica­tion is principal issue in the civil action pending ap­peal
in the Court of Appeals, and the falsification or genuineness of the motion to
withdraw - presented and marked as evidence in said civil case - is among the
ques­tions involved in said issue, it follows that the civil action poses <span style="">a </span>pre-judicial
question to the criminal pro­secution for alleged falsification of the same
document, the motion to withdraw (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">B-<span class="SpellE">Josefa</span>).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Presented as evidence of ratification in the civil action is the
motion to withdraw; <u>its authenticity is as­sailed in the same civil action</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resolution of this point in the civil
case will in a sense be determinative of the guilt or innocence of the accused
in the criminal suit pending in another tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, it is a pre­judicial question which
should first be decided before the prosecution can proceed in the criminal
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">A pre-judicial question is one that arises in a case, the
resolution of which is a logical antecedent to the issue involved therein, and
the cognizance of which per­tains to another tribunal; that is, it is
determinative of the case before the court and jurisdiction to pass upon the
same is lodged in another tribunal.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It should be mentioned here also that an administra­tive case
filed in this Court against Santiago <span class="SpellE">Catane</span> upon the
same charge was held by <span class="GramE">Us</span> in abeyance, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"As it appears that the genuineness of the document allegedly
forged by respondent attorneys in Administrative Case No. <span style="">77 (Ri</span>­chard Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Celdran</span> vs. Santiago <span class="SpellE">Catane</span>,
etc., et al.) is necessarily involved in Ci­vil Case No. <span style="">R-3397 </span>of the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
Court of First Instance, action on the herein com­plaint is withheld until that
litigation has finally been decided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant
<span class="SpellE">Cel­dran</span> shall inform the Court about such
decision." (Supreme Court minute resolution of April 27, 1962 in Adm. Case
No. <span style="">77, </span>Ri­chard Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Celdran</span> vs. Santiago <span class="SpellE">Catane</span>,
etc., et al.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the procedural question on Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Cel­dran's</span>
right as private offended party <span class="GramE">to</span> file thru coun­sel
a motion to suspend the criminal case, the same exists where, as herein, the
Fiscal, who had direction and con­trol of the prosecution, did not object to
the filing of said motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And <span style="">its </span>filing
in this case complied with Sec. <span style="">5 </span>of
Rule 111 of the Rules of Court which provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. <span style="">5.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="GramE"><u><span style="">Suspension by reason of
pre­judicial question</span></u><span style="">.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- </span>A
petition for the sus­pension <span style="">of </span>the
criminal action based upon the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of a
pre-judicial question in a civil case, may only be presented by any party
before or during the trial of the cri­minal action."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Denial of the motion to suspend the prosecution was therefore
attended with grave abuse of discretion; and the issue having been squarely and
definitely presented before the trial court, a motion for reconsideration,
which would but raise the same points, was not necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither was appeal the remedy available,
since the order denying suspension is interlocutory and thus not yet <span class="SpellE">ap­pealable</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals un­der
review - ordering suspension of Criminal Case No. <span style="">5719, </span>People v. Pedro <span class="SpellE">Fortich-Celdran</span>,
et al. pending before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
