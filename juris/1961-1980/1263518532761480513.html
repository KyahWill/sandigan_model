				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In the brief for plaintiffs <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> <span class="SpellE">Okol</span> and <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span> <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>, now appellants, from an order of dismissal by
the lower court, there is an admission that what motivated their complaint was
their desire to prevent the execution of a judgment final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They did
absolutely nothing about the plight into which they had fallen when there was
time enough to do so, but waited until the stage of execution <span style="">was </span>reached with a presentation of
this complaint that was dismissed, the only justification for refusing to be
bound by the decision being an asserted assignment of rights to a third party,
the relationship of whom to the creditor, <span class="SpellE">Tayug</span> Rural
Bank, being alleged but not quite supported by the very annex attached to such
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They ought not to have been
surprised when <span style="">a motion to dismiss
based on a bar by prior judgment was filed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They ought not to have been surprised either when such motion to dismiss
was granted by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now they
would want us to reverse such order of dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They ought to have known better.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law is against them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have no choice but to affirm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint, which was subsequently dismissed, was filed by
appellants on <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In all <span class="GramE">candor</span>, they
acknowledged that such case was instituted "principally for the purpose of
securing a judgment from the lower court releasing them from their obligation
on the promissory notes, subject-matter of the decision in Civil Case
No.T-1070."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>They would
seek exculpation from a<span style=""> </span>liability
already adjudged by including in such complaint a deed of assignment allegedly
executed by them in favor of defendant <span class="SpellE">Tayug</span> Rural
Bank, now <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, not directly but through a
certain Enrique Co Sue.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For appellants,
this deed of assignment extinguished by <span class="SpellE">novation</span>
their obligation, subject matter of the aforesaid civil case, the judgment in
which had already reached the stage of finality and was therefore <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere
in such deed of assignment attached to their complaint is there any mention,
express or <span class="GramE">implied,</span> that such <span class="SpellE">CoSue</span>
was acting for and in behalf of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Bank.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It must be noted that appellants received copy of the decision in
Civil Case No. T-1070 on <st1:date year="1966" day="17" month="2">February 17,
 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deed of assignment
was dated <st1:date year="1966" day="4" month="1">January 4, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surprisingly, they did nothing to seek relief
from such judgment or to appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
just folded their hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision
became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, and an order for a writ
of execution came from the lower court on <st1:date year="1966" day="21" month="4">April 21, 1966</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Prior to defendant deputy provincial sheriff, <span class="SpellE">Valeriano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Magnaan</span>, now <span class="SpellE"><span style="">appellee</span></span><span style="">, </span>proceeding with the scheduled <span style="">sale </span>at public auction of the personal properties of appellant, <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Okol</span>, on October
18, 1966, this case, as above noted, <span style="">was
</span>filed with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>,
Branch V, <span style="">on </span>September 23, 1966
against the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">appellees</span></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Again,
it <span style="">was </span>reiterated in their brief
that appellants seek "a decision releasing the appellants from their
obligations sought to be enforced in Civil Case No.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">T-1070 and to temporarily
restrain the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, <span class="SpellE">Valeriano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Magnaan</span>, deputy sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>,
from proceeding with the scheduled <span style="">execution
sale, </span>until the termination of the case."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There was a motion to dismiss based, among others, on bar by
prior judgment, favorably acted on, as mentioned by the lower court, in its
order of <st1:date year="1967" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">A reconsideration</span>
was sought, but it was unsuccessful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this appeal on a question of law.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>We repeat that no error of <span style="">law was </span>committed by the lower court
in its challenged order of dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the controlling facts as set forth in the very brief
for plaintiffs-appellants, the lower court had no other choice but to grant the
motion to dismiss filed by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Tayug</span> Rural Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
could not act otherwise, as to allow the complaint to go on would be to deprive
of force and <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> a judgment that had become
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellants ought to have been aware that if such a stage were reached,
it was due to their fault and to their fault solely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They could have invoked the appropriate legal
remedies before it was impressed with finality.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They failed to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly,
it would be a disservice to the legal order if they could still seek to
restrain the enforcement thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
is <span class="GramE">worse,</span> is that the very complaint which was
dismissed on its face failed to show convincingly that the third party, whose
actuations they would impute to the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Bank,
was in fact duly authorized to act on its behalf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing could be plainer, therefore, than
that the lower court did precisely what in law it had to do.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principle on which such a doctrine is based <span style="">is </span>succinctly summarized in the
authoritative work of former Chief Justice Moran on the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"It has been held that it is a general rule common to all civilized
system of jurisprudence, that the solemn and deliberate sentence of the law,
pronounced by its appointed organs, upon a disputed fact or a state of facts,
should be regarded as a final and conclusive determination of the question
litigated, and should forever set the controversy at rest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it has <span style="">been </span>well said that this maxim is more than <span style="">a </span>mere rule of law; more even than an
important principle of public policy; and that it is not too much to say that
it is <span style="">a </span>fundamental concept in
the organization of every <span class="SpellE">jural</span> system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Public policy and sound practice demand that,
at the risk of occasional errors, judgments of courts should become final at
some definite date fixed by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
very object for which courts were constituted was to put an end to
controversies."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
According to this work, this is the reason for the rule:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The fundamental principle upon which
the doctrine of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>
rests is <span style="">that parties </span>ought not
to be permitted to litigate the same issue more than once; that, when a right
or fact has been judicially tried and determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction, or an opportunity for such trial has been given the judgment of
the court, so long as it remains <span class="SpellE">unreversed</span> should be
conclusive upon the parties and those in <span class="SpellE">privity</span> with
them in law or estate."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of dismissal of <st1:date year="1966" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1966</st1:date> is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Without costs.</span></p>
