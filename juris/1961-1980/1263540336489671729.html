Gonzales filed on <st1:date month="7" day="26" year="1957">July 26, 1957</st1:date> against Felipe Jimenez, Sr., et 
al. a complaint for the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of a parcel of 
land situated in <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.</st1:place></st1:country-region> The material 
allegations of the complaint are: the land was sold to plaintiff in 1930. On 
<st1:date month="8" day="15" year="1951">August 15, 1951</st1:date>, Felipe 
Jimenez, Sr. caused his son to file a free patent application with the Bureau of 
Lands covering the same land alleging certain fraudulent statements in his 
application and by-reason of which Free Patent No. V-2706 was issued to his son 
on <st1:date month="2" day="4" year="1953">February 4, 1953</st1:date>, as well 
as Original Certificate of Title No. 11. Plaintiff was totally unaware of the 
filing of the application for patent as well as the issuance of the patent and 
the certificate of title abovementioned which he came to know only in October, 
1956 when, in the absence of his caretaker, defendant Jimenez, Sr. caused the 
fencing of the land and asserted <span class="SpellE">proprietory</span> rights 
over the same.</p>
<p>Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied, <span class="SpellE">afterwhich</span> they filed their answer. After plaintiff had 
closed his evidence, defendants submitted a second motion to dismiss on the 
ground that the action, based on fraud, should have been presented within four 
years from the issuance of the patent, and not from the discovery of the fraud. 
The court a quo upheld this contention dismissing the complaint. In substance 
the court said that from the issuance of the title on <st1:date month="3" day="15" year="1953">March 15, 1953</st1:date> to the filing of the complaint on 
<st1:date month="7" day="26" year="1957">July 26, 1957</st1:date>, more than 
four years had already elapsed and so plaintiff's action has already prescribed. 
Plaintiff took the present appeal.</p>
<p>It appears that the land in question was purchased by plaintiff from 
defendant Felipe Jimenez, Sr. in 1930 <span class="GramE">who</span> executed in 
his favor the corresponding deed of sale and delivered to him the possession of 
the land. However, thru fraudulent representation, defendant Felipe Jimenez, Sr. 
was able to obtain from the Director of Lands the issuance in favor of his son 
Felipe Jimenez, Jr. on February 4, 1953 Free Patent No. V-2706, and on <st1:date month="3" day="16" year="1953">March 16, 1953</st1:date> Original Certificate of 
Title No. 11 covering the same land. In spite of the fact that it is alleged in 
the complaint that Plaintiff came to know of the fraud of which he was a victim 
only sometime in October, 1956, the court a quo dismissed the complaint on the 
ground that the action has already prescribed in that the prescriptive period of 
four years should be computed, not from the actual discovery of the fraud, but 
from the date of the registration of the title in the register of deeds. Said 
the court a quo:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"The registration of the title in the office of the Register of Deeds is a 
notice to <span class="GramE">all the</span> world. Everybody including the 
plaintiff is presumed to know every fact which the public records show. This is 
a rule of law and is absolute (<span class="SpellE">Legarda</span> &amp; <span class="SpellE">Prieto</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Saleeby</span>,<span class="GramE">&nbsp; 31</span> Phil. 550, Rep., pages 600-601).&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>"From the issuance of the title on <st1:date month="3" day="16" year="1953">March 16, 1953</st1:date> to the filing of the complaint on 
<st1:date month="7" day="26" year="1957">July 26, 1957</st1:date>, more than 
four (4) yean have already elapsed. Consequently, the plaintiffâ€™s cause of 
action has already prescribed."&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>Appellant now contends that the court a quo erred in dismissing the complaint 
by computing the prescriptive period from the registration of the title in the 
office of the register of deeds.</p>
<p>We believe, however, that this case is covered by Article 1456 of our new 
Civil Code which provides: "If property is acquired through mistake or fraud, 
the person obtaining it is, by force of law, considered a trustee of an implied 
trust for the benefit of the person from whom the property comes." Since it 
appears that the land in question was obtained by defendants thru fraudulent 
representations by means of which a patent and a title were issued in their 
name, they are deemed to hold it in trust for the benefit of the person 
prejudiced by it. Here this person is the plaintiff. There being an implied 
trust in this transaction, the action to recover the property prescribes after 
the lapse of ten years. Here this period has not yet elapsed.</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"The case at bar involves an implied or constructive trust upon the 
defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>. The Court of Appeals declared 
that <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span> held in trust the 1/2 legally belonging 
to the plaintiffs, of which condition, the defendants had full knowledge. The 
sale made by <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span> in favor of the defendants, was 
not void or inexistent contract, action on which is <span class="SpellE">imprescriptible</span> (Art. 1450, N.C.C) It is <span class="SpellE">voidable</span>, at most, and as such is valid until revoked within 
the time prescribed by law for its revocation, and that is undoubtedly the 
reason why the Court of Appeals pronounced that 'the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> had the right to ask for a <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of their share, unless the action is barred by 
prescription.' The <span class="SpellE">prescriptibility</span> of an action for 
<span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> based on implied or constructive trust is 
now a settled question in this jurisdiction. It prescribes in ten (10) years 
(Banana vs. <span class="SpellE">Soler</span>, et al. G. R.
