				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Separate appeals, by the same petitioner, Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span> Don Pedro, from two (2) decisions of the Court of
Tax Appeals, the first (CTA Case No. 1273) holding it liable for the payment of
the sum of P1,507.30, as 1/2% monthly (6% per annum) interest on the deficiency
income tax assessed against it for the fiscal year ending August 31, 1954; and,
the other (CTA Case No. 1278) denying its claim for refund in the total amount
of P2,307.10, already paid and collected, as 1/2% monthly (6% per annum)
interest on the de­ficiency income taxes assessed against it for the fiscal
years ending August 31 -1955, 1956, 1957, and 1958.</p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as these two (2) appeals involved the same parties and
identical issues; and the Solicitor General, upon motion, was allowed by this
Court to file a consolidated brief in these two cases, we will consider them
jointly.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In G. R. No.</span> L-23236 (CTA Case No.
1273), the undisputed facts are:</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span> Don Pedro,
<span style="">a </span>domestic
corporation with office at <span class="SpellE">Nasugbu</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, had been filing its income tax re­turns on the
"fiscal year" basis ending August 31 of every year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Within the period allowed it under Section 46
of the National Internal Revenue Code, petitioner filed, on <st1:date year="1954" day="24" month="10">October 24, 1954</st1:date>, with the Bureau of
Internal Revenue, its income tax return for the fiscal year ending <st1:date year="1954" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1954</st1:date>, for which it paid
the total sum of P491<span class="GramE">,038.00</span>, as income tax, computed
on the basis of <span style="">said </span>return.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1959" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1959</st1:date>,
respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed against petitioner the
amount of P167<span class="GramE">,935.00</span>, <span style="">as </span>deficiency income tax for the
abovementioned fiscal year, but he did not assess and impose any interest
thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner protested, in a letter dated <st1:date year="1959" day="26" month="10">October 26, 1959</st1:date>, said deficiency income tax
assessment and requested that the same be cancelled.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on this letter-protest, respondent finally ascertained and
assessed, in a letter dated December 20, 1961, against petitioner the amount of
P10,062.00, as deficiency income tax, to which was added the sum of P1,509.30,
as 1/2% monthly interest thereon, which interest was imposed pursuant to
Section 51(d) of the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended by Republic Act
No. 2343 (ef­fective June 20, 1959), and computed from June 20, 1959 to
December 20, 1961 <span style="">which was </span>the date of the revised assessment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same letter, respondent required
petitioner to pay said revised assessment and interest thereon on or before <st1:date year="1962" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span style="">was </span>satisfied with the revised assessment of said deficiency
income tax proper; and, accordingly, it paid, on January 16, 1962, the said
amount of P10<span class="GramE">,062.00</span> to respondent; however, it
objected, <span style="">in
a letter protest </span>dated January 18, 1962 , to the demand and imposition
of interest which was assessed and included for the first time in respondent's
letter of December 20, 1961.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent decided said protest in a letter dated <st1:date year="1962" day="22" month="9">September 22, <span style="">1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, maintaining the </span>correctness
and validity of the imposition of the interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">In due time, petitioner went to the Tax Court in a petition for
review, claiming that the imposition of 1/2 % monthly interest on its
deficiency income tax for the fiscal year 1954, pursuant to Section 51(d) of
the Revenue Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 2343, is illegal, because the
imposition of interest on deficiency income tax earned prior to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the amendatory law (Rep. Act 2343) will be
tantamount to giving it (Rep. Act No. 2343) retroactive application.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent filed his answer to the petition, and there being no
genuine issue raised therein as to any material fact, petitioner presented a
motion for summary judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
did not oppose the mo­tion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Tax Court found that the only issue involved in the case is
purely legal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It ordered the parties to
submit their respective memo­randa and, upon so doing, the case was deemed
submitted for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1964</st1:date>,
the Tax Court rendered its decision, upholding the ruling of respondent
Commissioner.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In G. R. No.</span> L-23254 <span style="">(CTA </span>Case No. 1278), the undisputed
facts are as <span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The same petitioner (Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span>
Don Pedro) filed its income tax returns within the prescribed period for the
succeeding fiscal years ending August 31 - 1955, 1956, 1957, and 1958, for
which it paid the corresponding income taxes, based on said returns.</p>

<p class="BODY">After verification and examination of petitioner's income tax re­turns
for the <span class="SpellE">abovestated</span> fiscal years, respondent
Commissioner ascertained and assessed, for each of said fiscal years, against
peti­tioner, deficiency income taxes in the total amount of P21<span class="GramE">,330.00</span>, and interests thereon in the total sum of
P2,307.10, which interests were likewise imposed pursuant to Section 51(d) of
the Internal R<span style="">evenue </span>Code, as
amended by Republic Act No. 2343.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner paid said deficiency income taxes and interests with­in
the period prescribed by respondent to pay the same; however, on January 19,
1962, it filed with the latter a claim for refund or tax credit of the
aforesaid sum of P2<span class="GramE">,307.00</span>, which was paid as
interests, claiming that said payment was erroneous and the collection thereof
by respondent was illegal, which contention is similar to that all alleged <span style="">in </span>its previous protest (now CTA Case
r o. 1273).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent
Commissioner was unable </span>to decide immediately this claim for refund, and
in view of the fact that the two-year prescriptive period provided for in
Section 306 of the Revenue Code was <span style="">ab</span>out
to expire, petitioner filed, on October 23, 1962, its petition for re­view in
the Court of Tax Appeals, disputing the legality and validity of the imposition
of interests on taxable incomes earned prior to, although assessed after, the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of Republic Act No. 2343, and praying that the
said sum of P2,307.10, which it paid as in­terests, be ordered refunded.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent answered the
petition, maintaining, among other </span>things, that the imposition of said
interests is in accordance with law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">issues </span>having
been joined, the case was set for hearing wherein the parties presented their
respective evidences which were entirely <span class="GramE">documentary</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the case was submitted for
decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1964</st1:date>,
the Court of Tax Appeals rendered its deci­sion, sustaining the ruling of
respondent Commissioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">In both cases, the Court of Tax Appeals ruled that Congress had
power to impose interest on deficiency income tax due on income earned prior to
the amendatory law, but assessed after its enactment; that the deficiency
income tax in the case at bar was assessed after the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of the <span style="">new law </span>(Rep. Act No.
2343), and inasmuch as the interest imposed thereon has been computed only from
June 20, 1959 (which was the date of <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of
said new law), Republic Act No. 2343 is not being applied <span style="">retroactively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It </span>also ruled that the provision of
Section 13 of <span style="">Republic </span>Act No.
2343 providing that <span style="">its new tax rates
should apply to income earned in 1959, did not in­</span>dicate that <span style="">Congress intended </span>to limit the
applicability of the interest prescribed in Section 51(d) of the Revenue Code,
as amended by Rep­ublic Act No. 2343, to the deficiency income tax on income
earned <u>after</u>, the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">effectivity</span></span><span style=""> </span>of
the new law, since said Section 51(d) does not distinguish between taxable
income earned prior to, or after, the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of
said Republic Act No. 2343.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner appealed in both cases to this Court, insisting on
<span style="">its </span>original stand previously
outlined.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">common issue </span>posed
in both cases is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>whether or not the
interest of <span style="">six </span>per centum <span style="">(6%) </span>per annum (or 1/2% monthly
interest), provided for in Section 51(d) of the National <span style="">Internal Revenue </span>Code, as amended by
Republic Act No. 2343 (effective June 20, 1959) is imposable on deficiency
income tax due on income earned prior to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of said Republic Act No. 2343, but assessed after it.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that petitioner is a domestic corporation
which <span style="">filed </span>its income <span style="">tax </span>returns on a fiscal year basis;
that it filed its <span style="">income </span>tax
returns and paid the corresponding income taxes, based <span style="">on said </span>returns, within the period prescribed therefore; that
the taxable <span style="">incomes, in these </span>two
<span style="">cases, were earned before, but were as­sessed
after, the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> on June 20, 1959 of Republic
Act No. 2343; that the deficiency income tax assessments proper, including the
interests in the later case (CTA Case No. </span>1278) <span style="">were paid by petitioner within the period prescribed by respondent
Commissioner to pay </span>the same; and that these deficiency income tax
assessments were made on account of petitioner's erroneous (but not fraudulent
or false) returns.</p>

<p class="BODY">When petitioner filed its income tax returns and paid the corres­ponding
income taxes, based on said returns, the pertinent provisions of the Tax Code
then in force (before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of Rep. Act
2343) read -</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">and</span> insofar as
the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of said Republic Act No. 2343 is con­cerned,
Section 13 thereof provides -</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 13.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Act shall take effect upon its
approval:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>, <span class="GramE">That</span> the rate hereinabove stipulated shall apply to income
received from January first, nineteen hundred and fifty-nine, and for the
fiscal periods ending after June thirty, nineteen hundred and fifty-nine."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From a perusal and comparison of the <span class="SpellE">abovequoted</span>
sections of the Tax Code, before and after its amendment, it will be observed
that, although the Commissioner (formerly Collector) of Internal Revenue, under
the old, Section 51(a) was required to assess the tax due, based on the
taxpayer's return, and notify the taxpayer of said assess­ment, still, under
subsection (b) of the same old Section 51, the time prescribed for the payment
of tax was fixed, whether or not a notice of the assessment was given to the
taxpayer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the new provision, the
time of payment is also fixed and pre-determined (usually coinciding with <span style="">the filing of the </span>return) without the
necessity of <span style="">giving not</span>ification
of the assessment to the taxpayer by the Commissioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should further be observed that, under the old Section 51(e),
the interest on deficiency was imposed from the time the tax became due; while
under the new Section 51 (d), said interest is imposed on the deficiency from
the date prescribed for the payment of the tax.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus evident that petitioner's contention that
"interest on such deficiency accrued only when the taxpayer failed to pay
the tax within the period prescribed <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> by
respondent (Commissioner of Internal Revenue)" is not correct; said interest
was imposable in case of non-payment on time, not only on the basic income tax,
but also on the <span style="">deficiency tax, </span>since
the deficiency was part and parcel of petitioner's income tax liability.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appearing that the new Section 51(d) under Republic Act 2343
expressly provides that the interest on deficiency <u>shall be assessed at the
same time</u> as the deficiency income tax; and that respondent Commissioner of
Internal Revenue imposed and sought to collect the interest only from June 20,
1959, which was the date of <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of said
Republic Act No. 2343; that the deficiency income taxes in question were
assessed and unpaid when said Act was already in force; the Tax Court correctly
held that said Section 51(d), as amend­ed, is not being applied retroactively
as contended by petitioner herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the application of said Section 51(d), as amended, in
the cases at bar, operated and worked in favor of petitioner-appellant, since
instead of imposing the rate of one <u>per</u> <u>centum</u> (1%) monthly interest
prescribed in the old Section 51(e) from the time the tax became due, i.e.,
from January 15 - 1955, 1956, 1957, 1958 and 1959, respectively, respondent
Commissioner merely imposed the new 1/2% monthly interest from January 20,
1959, which interests, as computed, are less than what would be due under the
old law.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the petitioner's contention that the application
of the amended provision (now Sec. 51-d of the Tax Code) to the cases at bar
would run counter to the constitutional restriction against the enactment of <u>ex</u>
<u>post</u> <u>facto</u> laws, it is to be noted that the collection of interest
in these cases is not penal in nature, thus -</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">the</span>
imposition of <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>interest is but a just compensation to the
state for the delay in paying the tax, and for the concomitant use by the
taxpayer of funds that rightfully should be <span style="">in the government's </span>hands (<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>

charged is made proportionate to the period of delay constitutes the best
evidence that such interest is not penal but compensatory." <span class="GramE">(Castro <span style="">vs. </span>Coll. of
