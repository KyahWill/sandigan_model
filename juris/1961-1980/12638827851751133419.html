of the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission reversing the award
made by Acting Referee of Regional Office No. 5, <st1:place><st1:placename>San
  Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> in
favor of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span> <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>
granting her compensation benefits.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner was employed by respondent Republic of the Philippines
(Bureau of Public Schools) as a public school teacher from 1932 up to the
Japanese Military Occupation, and then from 1948 up to September 1974.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon assumption of her position as a
classroom teacher she was found to be in perfect health.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But sometime in 1972, she had an attack of
severe dizziness and fell unconscious.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When she regained consciousness she continued have a feeling of weakness
in her left and lower <span class="SpellE">extremeties</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her attending physician diagnosed her illness
as "<span class="SpellE">Oartic</span> Insufficiency."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Then sometime in June 1974, petitioner felt frequent sore, itchy throat and
hoarseness of voice, with slight fever everyday, thus constraining her to stay
at the Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> Provincial Hospital at <span class="SpellE">Calapan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> until September
1, 1974 where she was found to be suffering from <span class="SpellE">Pharyngitis</span>,
Pulmonary Tuberculosis and Essential Hypertension.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Later, she was confined at the Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital where upon
consultation with an E.E.N.T. expert, she was advised to take a complete bed
rest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With such condition of her health,
petitioner was constrained to apply for retirement, which was in due time
approved on <st1:date year="1974" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1974</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1975</st1:date>,
petitioner filed her Notice of Injury or Sickness and Claim for Compensation
with the Workmen's Compensation Unit No. 5 in <st1:place><st1:placename>San
  Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said notice she alleged that she had given
her employer, the Director of Public Schools, a notice of her illness since <st1:date year="1974" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1975" day="13" month="1">January
 13, 1975</st1:date> respondent Republic filed an Employer's Supplementary
Report of Accident or Sickness with a certification of the Senior Resident
Physician of the <st1:place><st1:placename>Oriental</st1:placename> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>Provincial</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> that the illness of the
petitioner resulted in a permanent partial disability.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due hearing, the Workmen's Compensation Unit, Regional
Office No. 5, in San Pablo City rendered its decision awarding to petitioner
compensation benefits for a total disability for labor from September 16, 1974
up to March 16, 1975 and for permanent partial disability due to <span class="SpellE">Hypertrophic</span> <span class="SpellE">Pharyngitis</span>,
Essential Hypertension and Pulmonary Tuberculosis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, upon review of the award by the
respondent Commission, the same was reversed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In reversing the award of the Workmen's Compensation Unit No. 5, the
respondent Commission concluded that the petitioner's ailment has no causal
relationship with the nature of her employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner submits that her ailments of <span class="SpellE">Hypertrophic</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pharyngitis</span>, Essential Hypertension and Pulmonary
Tuberculosis are compensable under the Workmen's Compensation Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The report of the Chairman, Division
Investigating Committee on Claims under the Workmen's Compensation Act states
in clear and unequivocal term:</p>

<blockquote>"Inquiries made by the committee revealed that Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> experienced
dizziness, headaches and chest compression prior to an attack of severe
dizziness and unconsciousness in school sometime in August, 1972.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Buhay</span> Medina,
her attending physician diagnosed her case as OARTIC INSUFFICIENCY.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> had
been suffering from occasional sensation of fullness of the throat for quite a
number of years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had been confined
in the <st1:place><st1:placename>Oriental</st1:placename> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
from August 24 to <st1:date year="1974" day="1" month="9">Sept. 1, 1974</st1:date>
due to PHARYNX CONGESTION and body weakness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to the findings of Dr. Carmen <span class="SpellE">Leido</span> <span class="SpellE">Solitario</span>, the claimant's attending physician at the
Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> Provincial Hospital, as revealed in
the herein Physician's Report of Sickness the claimant is suffering from
essential hypertension, <span class="SpellE">pharyngitis</span> and PTB Minimal
and that the probable cause is the nature of employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being a teacher she is subjected to hard
work, tension and over use of her voice which predisposed her to hypertension
and infections of the pharynx and lungs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Per physician's report the claimant's ailment has caused her total disability
for labor for indefinite length of time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is the opinion of the committee that Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span>
B. <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> suffered from her illness due to the
nature of her employment."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">From the foregoing report it is evident
that her ailments intervened during the course of her employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well settled is the rule that once the
illness supervened at the time of the employment, there is the <span class="SpellE">rebuttable</span> presumption that such illness arose out of the
employment or at least aggravated by such employment.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The burden to overthrow the presumption and to disconnect, by substantial
evidence the injury or sickness from employment, is laid by the statute at the
door of the employer.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
And so there is no more need for the claimant to carry the burden of proof, to
establish his case to the point of demonstration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is sufficient to show that the hypothesis
on which he bases his claim is probable.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The claimant is relieved from the burden of proving causation once the illness
or injury is shown to have arisen in the course of employment<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
which in this case, the respondent Republic has failed to discharge.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
It also appears of record that claimant was constrained to retire at the age of
62 because aside from her weak physical condition, she could no longer make use
of her voice for teaching purposes because of her <span class="SpellE">Hyperthropic</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pharyngitis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words she was physically incapable of performing her usual work
and disabled for that purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides,
her retirement at the age of 62 after having rendered long years of service to
the government would not have been approved if she had not complied with the
conditions prescribed for optional retirement pursuant to Memorandum Circular
No. 133 issued by the Office of the President which among others provides that
"all applications for optional retirement under Commonwealth Act No. 180,
as amended by Republic Act No. 1616 and No. 4968 shall not be recommended for
approval unless funds are available in the bureau or office concerned for the
payment of applicant's retirement gratuity over and above the fund requirement
of its programmed projects and activities and provided any of the following circumstances
or conditions is present:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>; (2) The employee is below 65 years of age, is physically
incapacitated to render further efficient service." The fact that her
retirement at the age of 62 was approved simply shows that petitioner was
physically incapacitated to render further efficient service and therefore she
should be entitled to disability benefits allowed by the Workmen's Compensation
Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Commission in opposing the claim of petitioner for
disability compensation benefit makes capital of the tardiness in the filing of
the notice of claim for compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is insisted by respondent Republic that the notice of claim was dated <st1:date year="1975" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1975</st1:date> and therefore the same
could have been filed on or after said date.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It appears on record, however, that although the notice of claim was
dated <st1:date year="1975" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1975</st1:date>,
petitioner made a reference in said notice of claim that respondent Republic
had been notified of her illness as of <st1:date year="1974" day="24" month="8">August
 24, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides respondent
Republic has long been aware of the illness of petitioner long before her
retirement on <st1:date year="1974" day="14" month="9">September 14, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In one case, this Court held that
"failure on the part of the employee or claimant to comply with the
requirements of Section 24 of Act No. 3824 is non-jurisdictional and that
failure or delay in giving said notice is not a bar to the proceeding in the
claim for compensation if it is shown that the employer, his agent or
representative has knowledge of the injury, sickness or death, or that the
employer did not suffer by such delay or failure."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>
