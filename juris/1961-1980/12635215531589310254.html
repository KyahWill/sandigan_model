Motion for Reconside­ration filed by respondents Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>.
and/or Hacien­da <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span> and Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span> with leave of this Court, (2) the same respondents'
Supplemental Second Motion for Reconsideration and Second Supplement to the
Second Motion for Reconsideration, and (3) peti­tioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino's</span> Motion to Order Respondent Judge to Respect and
Comply with the Decision of this Court in this case dated June 30, 1967.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before proceeding to discuss the issues raised at this stage by
the parties involved in this case, this Court deems it prudent, in order that
it will be better understood why this consensus of opinion was arrived at, to
refer back to the jurisprudence squarely applicable to, and in fact, the
background of, the case, source of this special civil action.</p>

<p class="BODY">In cases CA-G.R. Nos. 24186-87-R of the Court of Appeals entitled
<u>Antonio <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, et al., vs. Juan de G. Rodriguez as
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
Sr., et al.,</u> the said court, in resolving the issue of whether or not
possession in or good faith by virtue of a <span class="SpellE">torrens</span>
title acquired in good faith does not lose this character except in the case
and from the moment the said title is adjudged null and void by a proper court,
ruled that such an issue should be re­solved in the affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said Court of Appeals, pur­suant to this
ruling, then made the pronouncement that, <span class="SpellE">corollarily</span>,
a possessor whose possession has been found to be one in good faith by virtue
of such <span class="SpellE">torrens</span> title acquired in good faith, is,
therefore, entitled to reim­bursement by the owner of the parcels of land, the
govern­ment of the Philippines in that instance, for the necessa­ry and useful
expenses made thereon, with the right of re­tention until such reimbursement is
made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This resolution of the Court of
Appeals, which modified the decision pre­viously rendered by it on October 31,
1961, was promulgated on August 20, 1962, (in the said cases CA-G.R. Nos.
24186-87-R) and was elevated on appeal by <i>certiorari</i> to this Court,
which appeal was docketed as cases G.R. Nos. <span class="GramE">L-20300-01 and
L-20355-56.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, on <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1965</st1:date>, affirmed <u>in <span class="SpellE">toto</span></u> the said resolution of the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, prior to the promulgation of the above-men­tioned
resolution of the Court of Appeals on <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="8">August
 20, 1962</st1:date>, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>,
then pre­sided over by the Honorable <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span>, promulgated its decision in Civil Case No. 373,
source of this special civil action, on <st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="6">June
 2, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its said
decision, the court <u>a quo</u>, on the question of compensatory damages claim­ed
by plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> therein, Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr., merely relied on the decision of the Court
of Appeals in the aforementioned cases CA-<span class="SpellE">G.R.Nos</span>. <span class="GramE">24186-87-R which was promulgated on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="10"><span class="GramE">October 31, 1961</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, and which was then not yet modified by the said resolution of </span><st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="8"><span class="GramE">August 20, 1962</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the
defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> therein were consi­dered by the
court <u>a quo</u> as liable for the fruits of Lot 360, <span class="SpellE">Psd</span>
40891, which the said plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> could have
received from March 11, 1954 (Record on Appeal, G.R. No. L-20950, pp. 258-259).</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision of the court <u>a quo</u> in Civil Case No.373 was
appealed directly to this Court where it was docketed as <span class="SpellE">G.R.No</span>.
<span class="GramE">L-20950.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Speaking through Mr. Justice Jesus G. Barrera, we there held that:</p>

<blockquote>"However, as we have ruled in this case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Dizon</u></span><u>,
et al., vs. Rodriguez, etc., et al., </u>there being no showing that defendants
<span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> are not purchasers in good faith and for
value, they have a right to retention of the property until they are reimbursed
of the necessary ex­penses made on the land, which must properly be <span class="SpellE">extablished</span> and determined.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It also follows that as such possessors in good faith, the
defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> cannot also be held liable for
damages allegedly suffered by other parties on account of their possession of
the property.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, thus modified, the decision of the lower court
appealed from is hereby affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After our decision in the said case G.R. No. L-20950, May 31,
1965, had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, the court <u>a
quo</u> on December 27, 1965, issued a writ of execution commanding the Sheriff
of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> to, among others, cause the defendants,
private respondents herein, to jointly and severally pay plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr.,
petitioner herein, compensatory damages in the sum of P3,000.00 a year per
hectare of Lot 360 (which con­sists of 29.8634 hectares) from March 11, 1954,
until he is placed in lawful possession of the said lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This writ of execution, obviously, was based
on the impres­sion of the court <u>a quo</u> that since paragraph (c) of its
judgment in the said Civil Case No. 373 ordered <u>all</u> the defendants to
jointly and severally pay <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr., such compensatory damages, and since the decision
of this Court in the said case G.R. No. L-20950 appears to have absolved only
the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> from the payment of such compensatory
damages, then the other set of de­fendants therein, i.e., Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>., Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span> and/or
Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>, private respondents herein, remain <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable to pay <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr., the compensatory damages
awarded to him by the court <u>a quo</u> in its said decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon motion of co-defendants Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>.,
Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span> and/or Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>,
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, on <st1:date year="1966" day="18" month="1">January
 18, 1966</st1:date>, temporarily suspended the enforcement of the said writ of
execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February 2, 1966, His Ho­nor,
the respondent Judge, issued an order quashing the writ of execution of
December 27, 1965, on the ground that nowhere in the decision of the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> of June 2, 1962, nor in the decision of this Court in case
G.R.No.L-20950, is there any pronouncement that defendants Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>., Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span> and/or
Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span> have been found to be possessors in bad
faith and, therefore, liable for the payment of damages to Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> further based its order quashing the said writ of exe­cution
obviously on the ground of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>, i.e., that, pre­cisely,
on May 31, 1965, plaintiff and <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> Miguel <span class="SpellE">To­lentino</span>, Sr., filed a Motion for Reconsideration in case
SC­-G.R.L-20950 wherein he insisted that all the defendants be declared
possessors in bad faith and liable for compensatory damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Motion for Reconsideration, however, was
de­nied by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr., then came up to this Court in this Special
Civil Action for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> for the issuance of an
order for the respond­ent Judge to execute the decision of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
in Civil Case No. 373 against herein private respondents and to annul the
orders of the court <u>a quo</u> suspending the enforce­ment of the writ of
execution of December 27, 1965 (order of January 18, 1966); quashing the same
writ of execution (order of February 2, 1966); denying the motion of plaintiff
Republic of the Philippines and <span class="SpellE">Intervenor</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> for the issuance of another writ of execution of
paragraph (a) of the decision in the said Civil Case. 373 (order of <st1:date year="1966" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1966</st1:date>); and denying the
motion for reconsideration of these orders of February 2 and 8, 1966 (order of <st1:date year="1966" day="13" month="4">April 13, 1966</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="30" month="6">June
 30, 1967</st1:date>, this Court rendered a decision in this case annul­ling
the said orders of respondent Judge of January 18, Feb­ruary 2 and 8, and <st1:date year="1966" day="13" month="4">April 13, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A Motion for Partial Reconsideration under
date of <st1:date year="1967" day="3" month="8">August 3, 1967</st1:date>, was
filed by counsel for the respondents, Attys. <span class="SpellE">Jalandoni</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Jamir</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This motion was denied by our resolution of <st1:date year="1967" day="13" month="9">September 13, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="19" month="9">September
 19, 1967</st1:date>, a Second Motion for Reconsideration was filed by the respondents
through the same counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A supple­mental
Second Motion for Reconsideration under date of <st1:date year="1967" day="22" month="9">Sep­tember 22, 1967</st1:date>, was also filed for the same
respondents, this time by Atty. Rafael Recto.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A Second Supplement to the Second Motion for Reconsideration under date
of <st1:date year="1968" day="12" month="10">October 12, 1968</st1:date>, was
likewise filed by the said respondents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since then, many pleadings, motions, memoranda, etc., have been filed
before this Court with respect to the incident of the said Second Motion for
Reconsideration of the private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We are now called upon to resolve the issues raised by all these
pleadings, motions and memoranda.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful and painstaking study of all the said pleadings,
motions, memoranda and other pertinent papers, as well as the record of this
case, with respect to the is­sues which this Court is now called upon to
resolve, it is our considered opinion that the decision of this Court pro­mulgated
on June 30, 1967, should be reconsidered and set aside, not only on the grounds
of law and justice but also on the ground of equity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is because we can find no justifica­tion
for an award of compensatory damages in favor of peti­tioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr.<span class="GramE">,</span> much less make the
private res­pondents herein liable for such damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the lessee of the government, his cause of
action was necessarily against his <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> due to the
failure of the latter to place him in peaceful possession of the property
leased to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By analogy, when a lessee
rents a building which turns out, however, to be oc­cupied by another person,
and the former cannot obtain pos­session, his (the lessee's) cause of action is
against the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> for breach of contract in that the
latter violated the obligation of delivering to him the peaceful possession of
the leased premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lessee has no
cause of action against the possessor because he has no relation, contractual
or <u>ex­</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>delicto</u></span>, with the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">A study of the Record on Appeal in Civil Case No. 373 of the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> case G.R. No. L-20950 of this <span class="GramE">Court,</span>
shows that there is nothing therein to support a construction or interpretation
of the judgment of the lower court in the sense that it makes the private
respondents in this special civil action liable for the compensatory damages
awarded to peti­tioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In point, there is nothing in the findings of
fact or conclusions of law of the decision of the lower court in the said Civil
Case No. 373 which could form the basis for an award of damages in favor of
petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr., and against the private
respondents in this special civil action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pursuant to these findings, it inextricably becomes our considered
opinion that to construe the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of
the decision of the lower court in Civil Case No. 373 otherwise would mean the
rendition of a verdict or judgment with absolutely nothing to support it, and
in fact would constitute a plain and open contradiction of the conceded and
admitted facts of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a ver­dict
or decision, therefore, would be void (Edwards vs. McCoy, 22 Phil. 598, 601).</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, a minute scrutiny of the same Record on Ap­peal in
case SC-G.R.No.L-20950 reveals the fact that the amend ed complaint of
plaintiff Republic of the Philippines in that case is made up, by way of
summary, of the following allega­tions:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(a)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;

alleges, in brief, the irregular registration of close to 2,500 hectares of
public land by defendant Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(b)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The second cause of action (pp. 5-6, Record on
Appeal) alleges the fraudulent and malicious sale and/or lease of the lots in
this public land to other persons, including the defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(c)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The third cause of action (pp. 7-10, Record on

Agriculture and Natural Resources of the fishpond application of, among others,
herein petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr. Paragraph 19
of the same amended complaint of the Republic of the Philippines under this
cause of ac­tion (p. 10 of the said Record on Appeal) alleges damages of approximately
P500,000.00 <u>in the form of uncollected rentals from the <span class="SpellE">permittees</span>
and awardees of the applicants to the said fishponds</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This allegation of damages in the form of
uncollected rentals, clearly, cannot be construed as applicable to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tolentino's</span> claim for damages or to the award of
compensatory damages in his favor since his claim is for unrealized earnings
and profits for prawns, crabs and milkfish (pp. 24-25, Record on Appeal);</p>

or lessees to the use, enjoyment and possession of the lots, subject matter of
Civil Case No. 373 of the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, the amended complaint of plaintiff Republic of the
Philippines in Civil Case No. 373 of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> cannot be
construed or interpreted in such a manner as to constitute a basis for an award
of compensatory damages in favor of petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
Sr., since the damages claimed therein are alleged to be uncollected rentals
from the <span class="SpellE">permittees</span> and awardees, or lessees, of the
lots, subject matter thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the complaint-in-intervention of peti­tioner

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(e) Paragraphs 17

them to vacate the public fishponds; arguments dwelling on <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>; and his (plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino's</span>) alleged
right to the enjoyment or possession of the lot he applied for as a basis for
his additional prayer for the issuance by the court <u>a quo</u> of a writ of
preliminary injunction against the defendants from committing acts of
dispossession and usurpation against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, therefore, there is no allegation for damages made by
petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr., in his complaint-­in-intervention
in Civil Case No. 373 of the court <u>a quo</u> against the private respondents
in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His allega­tion that he
suffered damages in the form of unrealized earnings and profits as quoted above
does not satisfy the requirement of allegation of ultimate facts constituting
the act or omission of the respondents in this case in violation of his legal
rights and for which, consequently, the latter should then be ordered to pay
him compensatory damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In brief, while
it is true that he alleged that he suffered damages, yet he did not allege who
caused him to suffer these damages; who is responsible <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>;
and why precisely or additionally the respondents in this case should be liable
<span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Implicitly and necessarily, at the most, his allegation of having
suffered the said damages must be construed as directed against whoever was in
posses­sion of the said fishpond-lots at the time he should have started to

dispute over the fact that only the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> were in
possession of these fishpond lots at that time or on <st1:date year="1954" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1954</st1:date>, when petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr., filed his fishpond lease application with
the Bureau of Fisheries.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be remembered that every complaint must state at least
the ultimate facts upon which a party relies for his cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, since there is no allegation of ulti­mate
facts by petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr., in his com­plaint-in-intervention
against the respondents in this case regarding what act or omission by the
latter caused him dam­ages, how can there be, in effect, an award of damages
against the private respondents in the case, source of this special civil
action?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must also be remembered that
every ordinary civil suit must be based on the presence of a cause of

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">As stated above, there is no allegation
in the said peti­tioner's complaint-in-intervention that the private respond­ents
in this case committed an act or omission in violation of his legal
rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his third cause of action (p.
24, Record on Appeal, G.R. <span class="GramE">No</span>. L-20950), he merely
alleged damages due to the "defendants' stubborn refusal to vacate the
portion of the public land x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>",
Lot 360 of <span class="SpellE">Psd</span> 40891.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This allegation, even if construed to satisfy the third element of a
cause of action, can apply only to the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> who
were the owners and possessors when petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
Sr., applied for a lease of that lot on <st1:date year="1954" day="11" month="3">March
 11, 1954</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the same
allegation clearly cannot be construed or considered to constitute an ultimate
statement of any act or<i> </i>omission on the part of the private respondents
in this case (Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>., et al.) in violation of <span class="SpellE">Tolentino's</span> alleged right of possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, conceding an instance of fol­lowing
events to their natural conclusion, i.e., granting that the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>
immediately turned over the possession of Lot 360 to petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr., when the latter filed his fishpond lease
application on March 11, 1954, and acknow­ledged the title of the government
over that same lot, could petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
Sr., validly sue the respondents in this case, Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>.,
et al., for damages?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Obviously
not.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, neither could he
have sued the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> also, for he then would not have
any cause of action against both the respondents in this case and the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Granting, however, the foregoing pronouncements to be not
indubitable, still the fact remains that this Court should not base its
impressions on a merely casual reading of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision of the lower court in Civil Case No. 373.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we have stated in the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Policarpio</u></span><u> vs. Philippines Veterans Board, et al</u>.,
106 Phil. 125, 131, to get the true intent and meaning of a decision, no
specific portion thereof should be resorted to but the same must be considered
in its entirety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, in order to
arrive at a just and equitable solution to the issues presented to this Court
by this special civil action, we must read the decision of the lower court in
Civil Case No. 373 as a whole.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, in
the said decision of the lower court, there is a finding of fact or conclusion
of law that the private respondents herein, who were co-defendants along with
the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> therein, were included in the liability
for compensatory damages to herein petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
Sr., then we may say that our decision in this special civil action should
stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But if, as may be found after the
said thorough and painstaking study of the issues and background of this case,
the said decision of the lower court (particu­larly pp. 218-219, and 257-259,
Record on Appeal, G. R. No. L-20950, quoted <u>verbatim</u> hereafter)
considered only the <span class="SpellE">Di­zons</span> as liable to <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> for damages, then the necessa­ry implication

</span>In other words, it is clear from the above-quoted portions of the

and not herein private respondents as well, were intended by the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> to be liable for compensatory damages to peti­tioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr., for the reason, as stated by the same court

40891, and not herein private res­pondents also, at the time when petitioner

<p class="BODY">The foregoing pronouncements find support in the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Locsin</u></span><u>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>
et al</u>., 63 Phil., 87, 91-92, where­in this Court allowed a judgment that
had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> to be "clarified"
by supplying a word which had been inadvertently omitted and which, when
supplied, in ef­fect changed the literal import of the original phraseolo­gy,
thus:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> it
clearly appears from the allegations of the complaint, the promissory note
reproduced therein and made a part thereof, the prayer and the conclusions of
fact and of law contained in the decision of the respondent judge, that the
obligation contracted by the petitioners is <u>joint and several and that the
parties as well as <span class="GramE">the<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>trial</span> Judge so understood it</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the juridical rule that the judgment should be in accordance with
the allegations, the evidence and the con­clusions of fact and of law, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of the judgment under consideration <u>should
have ordered that the debt be paid severally, and in omitting the word or
adverb 'severally' inadver­tently, said judgment became ambiguous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This am­biguity may be clarified at any time
after the decision is rendered and even after it had become final (34 Corpus <span class="SpellE">Juris</span>, 235, 236.</u>) The respondent judge did not,
therefore, exceed his juris­diction in clarifying the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of the judgment by supplying the omission".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This is so because, in the <u>first</u> place, if an already
final judgment can still be amended to supply an omission committed through
oversight, this simply means that in the construction or interpretation of an
already final decision, the <span class="SpellE"><u>fallo</u></span> or <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion thereof must be correlated with the
body of such final decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
precisely what happened in the above-cited case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <u>second</u> place, granting that an amendment may be
limited to the supplying only of an omission, then it may be correctly argued
that a perusal of the <span class="SpellE"><u>fallo</u></span> of the lower
court's decision, in relation to the body there­of, shows, by simple logic,
that the letters "se" were in­advertently omitted from the word
"the" in paragraph (c) of the decision of the court <u>a quo</u> in
Civil Case No. 373.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such omission,
therefore, may be supplied to conform <span class="GramE">with</span> the spirit
of the decision as contained in the body thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, paragraph (c) should have
read "ordering all these defendants x <span class="SpellE">x</span> ",
hence, a clear case of omission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
the only logical conclusion applicable to this is­sue in this case because the
succeeding paragraph (d) of the <span class="SpellE"><u>fallo</u></span> of the
lower court's decision which restrains and enjoins the exercise of further acts
of ownership and pos­session again uses the phrase "all the
defendants".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since, even prior to
the time of the filing of Civil Case No.373 before the lower court, only the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> were the registered owners and possessors of Lot
360, <span class="SpellE">Psd</span> 40891, cause of the award of damages by the
court <u>a quo</u>, this paragraph (d) of the judgment in the said Civil Case
No. 373 could then apply only to the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, therefore, it is ob­vious that in
this paragraph (d), of the judgment of the court <u>a quo</u> in Civil Case No.
373, the word "these" was the one intended to be used by the lower
court, and not the word "the"; hence, a case of omission again of the
letters "se" from the word "the" in that paragraph
(d).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This observation is conclusively
supported by the fact that the last paragraph (e) of the said decision of the
lower court which orders the defendants to jointly and severally pay the costs
of the suit does not contain the word "all" anymore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this paragraph (e) was clearly
intended by the lower court to apply also to the private respondents in this
case, as well as the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>, since all the defendants
lost their case before the court <u>a quo</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fine, the word "all", therefore, was clearly meant by the
lower court to apply only to the several defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>
as specifically identified in the second paragraph (b) of the <span class="SpellE"><u>fallo</u></span> of its decision, Of course, it could also be
that the word "said" should have been placed between the words
"the" and "defendants" in the said paragraph (c), but was
inadvertently omitted by the trial Judge or his typist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is especially so considering the fact
that paragraph (a) of the judgment of the court <u>a quo</u> ends with a period
as shall be shown and discussed hereafter.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <u>third</u> place, if an already final decision can still
be amended by means of supplying an omission, there is no reason why we cannot
take the reverse proposition as also true, i.e., that words which were not
really intended by the body of the decision to appear in the <span class="SpellE"><u>fallo</u></span> thereof should also be stricken off or, at the
very least, interpreted in a manner so as not to refer to what was, in the
first place, not intended by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As the said case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Locsin</u></span><u> et al.
vs. <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>, et al. supra</u>, states, ambiguity is
not merely confined to a literal one, but may arise where the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the judgment under consideration is
not in accordance with the allegations and the evi­dence of the parties, and
the conclusions of fact and of law of the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <u>fourth</u> place, if an amendment may be allowed after
a decision has already become final, such amendment may consist either in the
supplying of an omission (as in the said case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Locsin</u></span><u>,
et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>, et al., supra</u>); the striking
out of a superfluity (the word "all") in the <span class="SpellE"><u>fallo</u></span>
thereof; or the interpretation of an ambiguous phrase therein in relation to
the body of the decision which gives it life.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But the body of the lower court's decision does not say anything about
the private respondents in this case being liable for damages in favor of
petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The spring cannot rise higher than the
source.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The decision in case <span class="SpellE">G.R.No</span>.</span>
L-26112 pronounced that the judgment in Civil Case No. 373 (G.R.No.L-20950) has
been affirmed except only as regards subdivision (c) there­of which should be
modified so as to read, in effect, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"(c) Ordering
the defendants, except the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>, <span class="GramE">to</span>
jointly and severally pay x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
and except also insofar as the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> have pursuant
to the decision, as amended -- the right of retention therein stated." <span class="GramE">(p. 5, Decision, <span class="SpellE">G.R.No</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">L-26112).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">After a mature deliberation upon that
pronouncement of this Court as contained in the said decision in this case, we
now do not agree with the observation that the decision in G.R. No. L-20950 is
confined to these two (2) modifica­tions only.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Paragraph (b) of the said judgment of the court <u>a quo</u> which
orders the defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> to vacate <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
360 in favor of petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr., is
also necessarily modified so as to make them vacate the said <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
360 only from the moment they are reimbursed the necessary and useful expenses
they incurred thereon. Paragraph (d) which restrains and enjoins "all the
de­fendants from further acts of ownership and possession over Lot 360",
etc., is also necessarily modified in the sense that the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>,
who are the present posses­sors of the said Lot 360, cannot be restrained or en­joined
from exercising acts of possession thereon until their right of retention is
terminated by, again, their being reimbursed their said necessary and useful
expenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These observations only go to
show that, really, this Court cannot just fold its arms and react in a merely
passive manner by confining itself in this present case to consi­dering
paragraph (c) of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the
decision of the lower court in Civil Case No. 373 as standing alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>A</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>contrario</u></span>,
it should read such <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> por­tion as a
whole.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the whole decision
itself, in­cluding the opinion portion thereof, should be read in order to
arrive at the true meaning of any of its parts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And in so doing, especially as revealed by the body of the decision in
Civil Case No. 373 of the court <u>a quo</u> (particularly the previously
quoted potions appearing in pp. 218-219 and n. 258, <u>et seq</u>., of the
Record on Ap­peal in case G.R.No.L-20950) the wording of the same decision was
clearly for only the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> to pay damages to
petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In brief, to say that the
decision in case SC-<span class="SpellE">G.R.No</span>.</span> L-20950 modifies
only paragraph (c) of the decision of the lower court in Civil Case No. 373
would be inconsistent with the obvious effects of the former decision upon
paragraphs (b) and (d) of the latter decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is because, unques­tionably, the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>
can neither be made to vacate nor be restrained from exercising acts of
possession over the lots in question in Civil Case No. 373 of the lower court
until they are reimbursed their expenses thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Going now to the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of
the judgment of the court <u>a quo</u> in Civil Case No. 373 as reproduced in
pp. 259-260 the Record on Appeal in Case SC-G.R. No. L-20950, it should be
noted that paragraph (a) thereof ends with a period, whereas paragraphs (b),
(c) and (d) respectively end with a semi-colon.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This fact is being brought out here to stress the fact that an
examination of the said Record on Appeal shows that the said parag­raph (a) of
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> really ends with a
period, and not with a semi-colon as the decision in this case of June 30,
1967, erroneously reproduces there­in, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(<span class="GramE">a</span>)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Declaring as null
and void Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-9550 (or Exhibit '24’) of the

<p class="BODY">Hence, paragraph (a) of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision of the lower court, which paragraph declares as null
and void Transfer Certificate of Title No.T-9550 of the Registry of Deeds for
the Province of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> "and other subdivision
titles issued in favor of respondents Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>.,
and/or Hacienda de <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span> over the areas outside
its private land covered by TCT No. 722, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" was obviously intended by the lower court to be a
ruling entirely distinct and separate from the succeeding parag­raphs of the
same <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the said deci­sion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This can only be so since the said paragraph
(a) refers exclusively to the private respondents in this case, while the
succeeding paragraph (b), which is an order to vacate, refers only to, and in
fact specifi­cally names and enumerates, the defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>,
namely, <span class="SpellE">Antonino</span>, Lucia, <span class="SpellE">Adelaida</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span>,
Ruben, <span class="SpellE">Amoranda</span> and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>,
all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This paragraph (b), obviously, does not refer to Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>., Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span> and/or
Hacienda de <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span>, private res­pondents herein,
for the simple reason that they are not in possession of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
360, Psd-40891, as stated therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, paragraph (c), the issue in this special civil action, of
the same <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision of the
lower court which orders "all the de­fendants to jointly and severally pay
compensatory dam­ages x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"
to Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr., which paragraph is
necessarily connected to the preceding paragraph (b) since the latter ends with
a semi-colon, can only refer to the defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">To reiterate, it should be noted that the damages awarded in this
paragraph (c) of the judgment of the court <u>a quo</u> in Civil Case No. 373
are compensatory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, these damages
refer only to, at the earliest, when <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> al­legedly
suffered them or when his cause of action accrued on <st1:date year="1954" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1954</st1:date>, when he filed his fishpond lease
ap­plication with the Bureau of Fisheries.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But at that time, only the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> were the
possessors and registered owners of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 360, Psd-40891,
subject matter of petitioner Mi­guel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr.'s
complaint-in-intervention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, such
order to pay damages could only have been meant against the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, to award damages in favor of petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr., and against herein private respond­ents
would violate the cardinal rule that a judgment must conform to and be
supported by both the pleadings and the proofs, and should be in accordance
with the theory of the action on which the pleadings were framed and the case
was tried <u>(<span class="SpellE">secundum</span> <span class="SpellE">allegata</span>
et <span class="SpellE">probata</span></u>).<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Dwelling now on the issue of the alleged bad faith of herein
private respondents, granting, <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span>, that
the latter were the ones who caused error by using the magnetic survey method
resulting in the inclusion of Lot 360 of Psd-40891 of the <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>
Cadastre in their cer­tificate of title (due to their causing the preparation
of a composite plan which led to the issuance of TCT No. 20), still they should
not be made liable for damages to petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
Sr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the <u>first</u> place, to follow
such a theory would lead to absurd consequences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This because in such a case, the surveyor and
even the manufacturer of the magnetic-method surveying equipment <span class="GramE">himself,</span> would, if such a contention is to be upheld, be
also liable for damages to petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By analogy, where a pedestrian is injured in
an automo­bile accident, to follow such a theory would lead to the absurd conclusion
that the manufacturer of the automobile should also be liable for damages in
favor of that pedes­trian because by manufacturing such automobile, this act
provided the occasion for the accident to happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, this would lead to an unbroken chain
of liability going back to the very first material used in the manufacture of
that automobile, i.e., the steel manufacturer or, even further, the iron ore
liner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the <u>second</u> place, it s
a fact that magnetic surveys can lead to error like, for example, where the
survey should actually result in a curve, what appears is a straight line.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The private res­pondents in this case,
therefore, are not guilty of bad faith.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, and in any event, bad faith is a cause of action based on tort
which, as applied to the case, source of this special civil action, has already
pres­cribed, particularly with respect to petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
Sr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is because the alleged
fraudulent survey facilitated by the said composite plan was per­formed during
the year 1949 (Decision, Record on Appeal, <span class="SpellE">G.R.No</span>.
L-20950, p. 169), and therefore, an action based on such a <span class="SpellE">tortious</span>
act, if tenable, would have prescribed in 1953 or four (4) years thereafter
(Art. 1146, Civil Code).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">As previously stated above, the decision of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> on this issue of
damages in Civil Case No. 373, source of this special action, relied entirely
on the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R Nos. 24186-87-R, </span><st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="10"><span class="GramE">October 31, 1961</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, awarding damages in fa­vor of Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
Sr., and against the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said decision of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> was promulgated on <st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This date was prior to the date of the
resolution of the Court of Appeals of <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="8">Au­gust
 20, 1962</st1:date>, modifying its above-mentioned decision of <st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1961</st1:date>, in the said cases
CA-<span class="SpellE">G.R.Nos</span>. <span class="GramE">24186-87-R.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that resolution and as previously
expounded upon above, plaintiffs-appellants Antonio <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>,
et al., were even­tually absolved from liability for damages, in favor of Mi­guel
<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr., who is also the petitioner in this
case, and the former were given the right of retention of the properties,
subject matter of those cases, until they are reimbursed the useful and
necessary expenses they made thereon.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The said resolution of the Court of Appeals of <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="8">August 20, 1962</st1:date>, was affirmed <u>in <span class="SpellE">toto</span></u> by this Court in G.R.Nos.L-20300-01 and
20355-56.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is there­fore the opinion
of this Court now that were it not for this circumstance of fate regarding
dates, i.e. that the said resolution in cases CA-<span class="SpellE">G.R.Nos</span>.
24186-87-R was promulgated subsequent to the decision of the court <u>a quo</u>
in Civil Case No. 373, there would surely be no dispute about this matter since
the lower court would then not have relied for its ruling on this issue of
damages upon the original decision of the Court of Appeals in those cases as
cited above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In brief, the court <u>a
quo</u> would not have made any award of damages in favor of petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr. in Civil Case No. 373 if its decision had
been promulgated after the issuance by the Court of Ap­peals of its said
modifying resolution as affirmed later or by this Court in cases G.R.
Nos.L-20300-01 and L-20355-56.</p>

<p class="BODY">The damages now being sought to be, in effect, awarded to
petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr., being compensatory,
such damages must be only against those responsible <span class="SpellE">there­for</span>
when his cause of action accrued, that is, the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the latter were absolved by us from
such liability our decision in case G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-20950.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In point, it should be borne in mind that a case may be filed
only when there is a cause of action present or upon the accrual of a cause of
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no dis­pute that the
cause of action of petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolen­tino</span>, Sr.,
arose at the earliest, from the time that he flied his fishpond lease
application for Lot 360 of Psd-40891 in 1954, a time when only the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> were in pos­session and were the registered owners
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from the fact that the
cause of action of petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">To­lentino</span>, Sr.,
as stated previously above, was against his <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
(the Government) for the latter's inability to com­ply with its obligation to
place him in possession of what was leased to him, a ruling which, in effect,
would make the private respondents herein liable for damages to the petitioner
would be tantamount to this Court's giving sanction to the allowing of a case
to be filed and decided fa­vorably by a lower court, although the cause of
action there had not yet accrued or where none exists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, had the said petitioner filed a
case in the nature of the one he did file in Civil Case No. 373 of the Court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> against the private respondents herein at the time when the latter
were still the registered owners and possessors, his com­plaint would, at the
very least, have been premature since his fishpond lease application had not
yet been filed by him with the government at that time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, there absolutely is no reason
for awarding compensatory damages against a prior possessor and registered
owner (the res­pondents in this case), even assuming that the latter were in
bad faith, in favor of a person who did not have a cause of action against
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The filing of a fishpond lease ap­plication
by petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr. was a <u>condition</u>
<u>sine</u> <u>qua</u> <u>non</u> for his cause of action to accrue or come
about.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, damages in his favor, if
any, can be assessed only against those who deprived him of his right of
possession of the said Lot 360 of Psd-40891 at the time he filed the said fishpond
lease application on May 11, 1954, provided, of course, that the latter are
found in bad faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, even if the
predecessor of the present possessors were in bad faith, they cannot be held
liable in favor of a person who did not have a cause of action against
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is an elementary rule of civil
procedure.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the equitable aspect of this case, the injustice
of, in effect, an award of damages against the respondents in this special
civil action is very obvious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated
above, neither the decision of the lower court in Civil Case No. 373 nor the
decision of this Court in G.R. No.L-20950 has made any finding as to the amount
of the necessary and useful expenses that will have to be reimbursed to the
present possessors, the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The decision in the said
case G.R. No.</span> L-20950, in fact, stated that those expenses have yet to
be properly established and determined.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither did it say who is to make such reimbursement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, so long as reimbursement is not made
to them, they (the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>) will retain their right of
possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the
private respond­ents in this special civil action will continue to be lia­ble
for damages to petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr. for
about P90<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> a year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from such obvious injus­tice and
inequity, how much then will the private respond­ents in this case <span class="GramE">be</span> made to pay perpetually to petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr.? How much should the clerk of the lower
court state in each writ of execution that he is called upon to issue as should
be paid by the private res­pondents in this special civil action to petitioner
Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr., when the basis for the
compensatory dam­ages is deprivation of possession, and such deprivation of
possession cannot be terminated, that is, possession cannot be given to <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> until the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> are
reim­bursed their expenses?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And such
expenses have yet to be established and determined as stated by us in the said
Case G.R.No.L-20950.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And after the
five-year prescriptive period for a judgment to be enforced by an ordinary
motion for execution, may this amount of practically P90,000.00 a year be still
considered enforceable a matter of course or without need of a new court action
pursuant to Section 6 of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These uncertainties which readily reflect the
obvious injustice of the effects of our decision in this case is borne out by
the Writ of Execution itself as issued by the lower court, which states to the
Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> that:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>,
you cause the said defendants to jointly and severally pay Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> com­pensatory damages in the sum of <u>P3,000.00
a year per hectare of Lot 360 (which consists of 29.8634 hectares)</u> from
March 11, 1954 <u>until he is placed in lawful possession of the said area;</u>
to collect the lawful fees x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Clearly, therefore, the damages which are
required to be specific in amount, i.e., "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>, and the amount <u>actually</u> due thereon if it be for
money" (Sec. 8, Rule 39, Revised Rules of Court), are incapable of
accurate estimation so as to put an end to all the incidents of Civil Case
No.373 of the lower court, in fact, petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
Sr., need not or can hardly be expected to obtain possession of the said lot at
all since he will be paid P90,000.00 a year without any sweat or effort on his
part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a similar situation to
that contemplated in a positive <span class="SpellE">potestative</span>
conditional obligation which is void under the civil law. e.g., <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> will enter into possession when he wants to, and
only from that time will the respondents in this case cease to be liable in the
payment of about P90<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> to him annually.</p>

<p class="BODY">If this Court, therefore, would not reconsider its decision in
this case, the result would be clearly unjust and will lead to the iniquitous
consequence of, in effect, ordering the respondents to pay alimony to
petitioner Mi­guel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In brief, the respondents would then have to
pay P3,000.00 per hectare a year of Lot 360, Psd­-40891, or about P90,000.00
annually to petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr. so long
as the latter desists from entering into possession of the said lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In return, the former get nothing from the
said petitioner as cause or consideration for such desistance, but, on the
contrary, have to continue paying him this alimony; – a clear case of adding
insult to Injury.</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming now to the contention of one of the counsel for petitioner
Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr. during the oral argument last
August 11, 1970, that the decision of this court in this case of June 30, 1967,
is already final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> based on the fact that
herein private respondents filed their motion for partial reconsideration on
the day of the 15-day period before the judgment in this case to become final,
and that, therefore, the second motion for reconsideration which was filed the
next day after the receipt of the resolution of denial of June 13, 1967 by said
counsel, was filed out of time or one day late, suffice it to say that the
decision of this Court in the case of <u>Mara, Inc. vs. the Honorable<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Court of Appeals and Ace Lumber Co., Inc</u>.
G.R. No. L-26584, <st1:date year="1969" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1969</st1:date>
(28 SCRA 1075), squarely refutes this conten­tion on all its four corners. We
there held that a party who files a motion to reconsider on the last day of the
pe­riod allotted by the Rules of Court may still validly take further steps to
protect his interest the day after receiv­ing the notice of denial of such
motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tolenti­no</span>
insists, nonetheless, that what should be applied here is Sec. 1 of Rule 52,
which provides that "[a] second motion for reconsideration may be
presented within fifteen (15) days from notice of the order or judgment
deducting the time in which the first motion has been pending," and not
Sec. 3 of Rule 41, which was applied in <span class="SpellE">Lloren</span>, etc.
vs. <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>, etc., et al., G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-13929,
</span><st1:date year="1962" day="28" month="3"><span class="GramE">March 28,
 1962</span></st1:date><span class="GramE"> (4 SCRA 637), and, later, in <u>Mara</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>A similar argument was raised in <u>Mara</u>,
and we there said that nothing but confusion would be gained by not applying a
uniform rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, to accord
merit to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tolentino's</span> contention would
render nugatory - whenever the first motion for reconsideration is filed on the
last day of the 15-day period - the above-quoted provision of Sec. 1, Rule
52.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, even if it may be
considered that the decision in this case of June 30, 1967, has already become
final pursuant to the said contention of petitioner's coun­sel, still, there is
nothing to prevent this Court from ap­plying the doctrine in the aforesaid case
of <span class="SpellE"><u>Locsin</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Pareredes</span>,
supra</u>, to the effect that even if the decision of the Court <u>a quo</u> in
Civil Case No. 373 is already final, this Court may still clarify the ambiguity
contained in the judgment of the lower court in its decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By such clarification, there is no partial
modification of the said judgment, but rather, and at the most, a mere interpretation
thereof for purposes of clarifying an ambiguity.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, justice and equity now compel this Court to depart
in this case from the general rule that for pur­poses of execution, only the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of a de­cision should be referred to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This course of action is not only justified
by precedents but, in fact, is ordained by the Constitution itself which
requires a decision to be in writing and to state the findings of fact and
conclusions of law as bases for the judgment. Needless to say, a lower court
may commit errors in its findings of fact and/or con­clusions of law, but that
does not affect the validity of its decision once it becomes final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, a judgment or <span class="SpellE"><u>fallo</u></span>
without any basis at all in fact and in law or in the opinion portion of the
decision from which it draws its breath and life can only be considered as null
and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Emphatically, such a judgment
can never be elevated to the dignity of a judicial act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The final and true decision that should be
considered, therefore, is the decision of this Court in <span class="SpellE">G.R.No</span>.
<span class="GramE">L-20950.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, even the decision of this Court in the said case <span class="SpellE">G.R.No</span>. L-20950 states, as its <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion, the words:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, thus modified, the decision of the lower court appealed
from is hereby affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted, therefore, that the above-quoted <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the said decision in case <span class="SpellE">G.R.No</span>. L-20950 itself, has seen fit to implement a
practice where­by the actual judgment of a court is also to be found in the
opinion portion, and not in the <span class="SpellE"><u>fallo</u></span> thereof
always.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">And since it
is the decision of this Court in Case G.R. No.</span> L-20950 which should be
considered as the more authorita­tive and final one regarding the rights and
liabilities of the parties to Civil Case No. 373 of the Court a <u>quo</u>, re­ference
should therefore be made to the contents of the said decision of this Court in
said case G.R.No.L-20950 in order to determine the decisive question as to how
the judgment of the court a duo was modified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To this end, and for convenience, the following portions of the said
deci­sion in case G.R. No. L-20950 <span class="GramE">are</span> pertinent:</p>

<blockquote>"We have gone over the evidence presented in this case and
found no reason to disturb the factual findings of the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been established that certain areas
originally portions of the navigable water or of the fore­shores of the bay
were converted into fishponds or sold by <span class="GramE">defendant company</span>
to third persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is also no
controversy as to the fact that the said defendant was able to effect these
sales after it has obtained a certifi­cate of title (TCT No. 722) and prepared
a ‘composite plan’ wherein the aforesaid fore­shore areas appeared to be parts
of Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants-appellants do not deny that there
is an excess in area between those delimited as boundaries of the hacienda in
TCT No. 722 and the plan prepared by its surveyor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, however, was justified by claiming that
it could have been caused by the system magnetic survey used in the preparation
of the ori­ginal titles, and anyway, the excess in area (536 hectares,
according to defendants) is with­in the allowable margin given to magnetic
survey.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"But even assuming for the sake of argument that this
contention is correct, the fact remains that the areas in dispute (those
covered by per­mits issued by the Bureau of Fisheries) were found to be
portions of the foreshores, beach, or of the navigable water itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, it is an elementary principle of law
that said areas not being capable of <span class="GramE">registration,</span>
their inclusion in a certificate of title does not convert the same into
properties of private ownership or con­fer title on the registrant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See G.R.No.L-8654, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span>, et al.,
</span><st1:date year="1956" day="28" month="4"><span class="GramE">April 28,
 1956</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">; also G.R. No.</span> L-20300-01
&amp; L-20355-56, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, et al. vs. Rodriguez, etc.,
et al., <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1965</st1:date>.) In
the present case, as the lots covered by TCT No.T-9550 issued in the names of
defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> (and which were purchased by the
latter from defendants Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>. and/or Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>) were found to be por­tions of the foreshore or of
the territorial waters, the lower court committed no error in rendering
judgment against said defendants and ordering the reversion of said properties
to the public domi­nion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"However, as we have ruled in the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Dizon</u></span><u>,
et al. vs. Rodriguez, etc. et </u>al.,(Said purchasers who relied on the
efficacy of their certificate of title, cannot be considered pos­sessors in bad
faith until after the legality of their said titles has been finally
determined.), <span style="">&nbsp;</span>there being no showing
that defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> are not purchasers in good
faith and for value, they have a right to retention of the property until they
are reimbursed of the necessary expenses made in the land which must properly
be established and determined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also
follows that as such possessors in good faith, the defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> cannot also be held liable for damages allegedly
suffered by other par­ties on account of their possession of the property.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In view of the foregoing, the revocation of the writ of
preliminary mandatory injunction previously issued by the lower court, and the
suspension of the delivery of possession of the properties to plaintiff and <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, were in
order.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, thus modified, the decision of the lower court appealed
from is hereby affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above-quoted portion of the said decision in case
G.R.No.L-20950 clearly shows that what was really in issue with respect to the
question of the compensatory damages awarded by the court <u>a quo</u> to
petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr., was the question of
whether or not the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> were liable <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
necessarily follows, therefore, that it was never in the mind nor in the
contemplation of this Court that the private respondents in this case were also
considered by the court a quo as liable for the compensa­tory damages in
question to petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr., for the
simple reason that it was only the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>, as
previously stated above, who were in possession and were the registered owners
of Lot 360, Psd-40891 of the <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> Cadastre, at
the time petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr. filed his
fishpond lease application on March 11, 1954, the date when his cause of action
accrued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is even conceding the
proposition that petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr. ac­quired
the right to possess the same lot on that date and not at the time of the
approval of the said application on February 10, 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And since the Torrens Titles of the <span class="SpellE">Di­zons</span> served to shield them against any stigma of bad
faith, the same legal rule must obtain as respects any imputation of bad faith
against the private respondents herein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, there is no reason why the reliance of the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> upon the indefeasibility of their Torrens Titles
should vary in its effect from the reliance of Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>.,
Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span> and/or Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>,
or, for that matter, of any other person upon theirs.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, the respondents, motions for
reconsideration as stated in the first part of this resolution are hereby granted,
and the motion of peti­tioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sr.
mentioned also thereat is denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
decision of this Court heretofore rendered in this case <span class="SpellE">G.R.No</span>.
L-26112 is hereby set aside and the pe­tition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>
in this case is dismissed without costs.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BARREDO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the whole, I
agree with the main opinion, but I would like to explain my reasons for doing
so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Incidentally, I believe it is not amiss
for me to state first why I have taken part in this case notwithstanding my
having been co-signer of the basic petition herein, as Solicitor General then.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that as Solicitor General, I co-signed with petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> the petition in this case made me hesitate at
first to take part and vote in the disposition of the present incidents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On second thought, however, (a) realizing
that this is one of the matters that have been purposely deferred to await the
completion of the membership of the Court, and (b) discerning from the
manifestation of counsel for said petitioner of January 30, 1969, shortly after
Mr. Just­ice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span> and the writer joined this
Court, which submits "for the convenience of the Court, <u>especially of
those new members who have not participated in any of the incidents relative to
the matter under consideration</u> (naturally, including me) a brief history of
this case," that there would be no objection on their part to my
participation herein, much less, has petitioner asked for my inhibition, and
(c) above all, it being evident that even when the writer co-signed the peti­tion
herein, it could not have been his intention to own and support any allegation
or theory of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> favorable
exclusively to said petitioner's private interest, since it would be officious
and illegal for any Solicitor General to represent and take common cause with
any party on points in which such party's interests are separate and distinct
from those of the Re­public, hence the writer's signature under the petition
was for and on behalf exclusively of the Republic, I have opted to act with the
Court here.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be clear to anyone that the <span class="SpellE">joinder</span>
of the Republic and <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> as co-petitioners in
this case did not necessarily put them in the same shoes; the personali­ty of
the Republic in this case is rooted in its being plaintiff and prevailing party
in G. R. No. L-20950 while that of <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> is in
his being <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> and, as such, also a prevailing
party therein; as to the <span class="SpellE">separability</span> of their
respective interests in this case, it is possible that <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
cannot succeed if the Republic fails, but the Republic can succeed even if <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> does not; so, it is obvious, there are matters in
which <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> may be interested but wherein the
Republic is not and cannot be interested, but this does not mean they cannot
file a com­mon pleading alleging their respective separate interests, which is
exactly what was done in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, the common petition did not make the Solicitor Ge­neral the
counsel of <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> as to matters in which his
interest is separable from that of the Republic, which is exactly the case with
respect to the damages claimed by <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> in the
pending incidents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be said,
therefore, that as to these incidents, the writer is act­ing in a case in which
he has been counsel, within the contemplation of Section 1 of Rule 137.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, it is recalled that the legal
staff of the Solicitor Gene­ral's Office firmly recommended against the office tak­ing
part in this case and it was only on the insistence of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> to allege in the petition certain matters <u>affecting
the Republic</u> that helped prevail upon me to co-sign the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As far as the Solicitor Gene­ral's Office was
concerned, it would have gone along with the order of Judge de <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">los</span> Angeles</st1:place></st1:city> that the writ of execu­tion
is unnecessary until after any of the present title holders have refused to
surrender their titles for cancel­lation or the Register of Deeds has refused
to cancel the corresponding titles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be
that as it may, at the present stage of the proceedings, all matters affecting
the Re­public in this case have already been resolved, the judgment in this
case ordering Judge de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Angeles to issue the writ
of execution for the cancellation of the annul­led titles being now final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> because respon­dents have not asked for
reconsideration in respect there­to, and there being nothing before the Court
in the pre­sent incidents that could directly or indirectly affect either
favorably or adversely any interest of the Repub­lic, it is believed that there
can be neither legal, ethical nor moral grounds for me to refrain from acting
and voting as a member of the Court here.</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming now to the incidents submitted for the Court's resolution,
I take it that the problem commonly posed by them has its root in the following
basic antecedent facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">In Civil Case No. 373 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, entitled Republic of the Philippines versus Ayala
y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>, et <span class="SpellE">als</span>., with Miguel
<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> as plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>,
which was an action to annul the titles of the defendants over certain lands in
<span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> claimed
to be portions of the territorial waters of the public domain and to recover
possession thereof, with da­mages, the said court of first instance rendered
judgment over the pen of Judge <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span> on June 2, 1962 as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Declaring as null and void Transfer
Certificate of Title No. T-9550 (or Exhibit '24' ) of the Register of Deeds of
the Province of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> and other subdivision titles
issued in favor of Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>. and/or Hacienda de <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span> over the areas outside its private land covered
by TCT No. 722, which, including the lots in T-9550 (Lots 360, 362, 363 and
182) are hereby reverted to public dominion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ordering Defendants Anto­nio <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, Lucia <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Adelaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> Reyes, <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> <span class="SpellE">Degollacion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, Ruben <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Amorando</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, to vacate <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
360 in favor of <span class="SpellE">Intervenor</span> Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ordering all the defend­ants to jointly and
severally pay <span class="SpellE">Intervenor</span> Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
com­pensatory damages in the sum of P3,000.00 a year per hectare of Lot 360
from March 11, 1954, until he is placed in lawful possession of the said area;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(d)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Restraining and enjoining all the defendants
from further acts of ownership and possession over Lots 360, 362, 363 and 182
of Psd­-40891;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(e)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ordering the defendants to jointly and
severally pay the costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"IT IS SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the appeal taken to this Court from said decision by the
losing parties docketed as G. R. No. L-20950, the following judgment was
rendered on <st1:date month="5" day="31" year="1965">May 31, 1965</st1:date>:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, thus modified, the decision of the lower court
appealed from is hereby affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After this judgment became final and the case was re­manded to
the trial court, upon motion of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tolen­tino</span>,
the said court, respondent Judge Jaime de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
Angeles, presiding, ordered the issuance of a writ of execution and pursuant
thereto, bank deposits and real properties of re­spondents Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span> and Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span> and the
Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span> were garnished and levied
upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereupon, said respondents filed
a motion to quash the said writ of exe­cution, which motion the court promptly
acted upon by or­dering the temporary suspension of the writ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner moved for reconsideration of this
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their opposi­tion to this
motion, said respondents raised as a main is­sue that neither the judgment of
the trial court nor that of this Court, both hereinabove quoted, adjudged them
liable for the damages claimed by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
and even assuming that the trial court's decision had made them so liable, they
were later absolved together with the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> by the <span class="SpellE">modificatory</span> decision of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> contended that (1) "the decision of the
Supreme Court is perfectly clear and needs no extraneous interpretation; and
(2) that any doubt that may arise at the extent and purport of the modification
made by the Supreme Court of the lower court's decision may be resolved by a
perusal of the body of the Supreme Court's decision and of the decision of the
lower court." (Par. 14, pp. 6-7, Petition in this Case).</p>

<p class="BODY">Resolving the issues thus raised by the parties, on <st1:date month="2" day="2" year="1966">February 2, 1966</st1:date>, the trial court
issued the order now under review, the pertinent portions of which read thus:</p>

<blockquote>"From the above-contentions of the parties, it is thus obvious
that their present controversy merely hinges on the interpretation of the
decision of the lower court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Principally, the parties disagree on whether or not the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> por­tion of the lower court's decision re­quiring
all tie defendants to pay the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> compensatory
damages had been only modified or revoked <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the contention of the plaintiff that a
perusal of the decision of the Supreme Court will clearly disclose that only
the defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> were absolved from the payment
of compensa­tory damages although aside from said defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>, the decision of the lower court has also ordered
Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>., Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span>
and/or Alfon­so <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span> to jointly and severally pay <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> compensatory damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plain­tiff concludes therefore, that follow­ing
the decision of the Supreme Court, the Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>,
Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span> and/or Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>
must now pay <span class="SpellE">in­tervenor</span> Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
the compen­satory damages awarded to him by the lower court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"However, it is the considered opi­nion of this Court that the
interpreta­tion of the Supreme Court's decision cannot be made by a mere
mathematical process of subtraction but rather by understanding its rulings
which will control in the interpretation of the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For instance, it cannot be disputed that the
decision by the Su­preme Court lays from only three prin­cipal things,
namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) areas found to be portions
of the foreshores, beach, or of the navigable river itself are not capable of
registration and their inclusion in the certificate of title does not convert
the same into properties of private ownership or confer title on the registrant
(2) purchasers who relied on the efficacy of their certifi­cate of title,
cannot be considered possessors in bad faith until the le­gality of their said
titles had been finally determined; (3) possessors in good faith cannot be held
liable for damages suffered by other parties on account of their possession of
the property.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As regards the first ruling, the parties properly understood
its appli­cation to the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, as regards the second and third rulings there is a difference
of opinion bet­ween the parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiffs are of the belief that defendants Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>.,
Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span> and/or Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>
has been found to be possessors in bad faith and therefore liable in the pay­ment
of damages.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This Court cannot share with this belief of the plaintiff and
<span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nowhere in the decision of the Supreme Court is there such a
pronouncement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, it will
be remembered that after the promulgation of the said deci­sion on <st1:date month="5" day="31" year="1965">May 31, 1965</st1:date> plaintiff and <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> filed a motion for reconsidera­tion wherein they
insisted that all, the defendants be declared possessors in bad faith and
liable for compensatory damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
tried to prove by lengthy reference to the findings of the low­er court that
Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>., Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span>
and/or Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span> are posses­sors in bad
faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, said motion for
reconsideration was denied by the Su­preme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the Supreme Court, in citing the
case of <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> vs. Rodriguez, et al., in its decision
of <st1:date month="5" day="31" year="1965">May 31, 1965</st1:date>, reiterated
the principle that holders of certificate of title are considered pos­sessors
in good faith until after the le­gality of their certificate of title had been
finally determined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, to hold
Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>., Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span>
and/or Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span> possessors in bad faith and
liable for compensatory damages from March 1954 would run counter against the
very principles laid down in the repeat­edly mentioned decision of the Supreme
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is so because these defend­ants
would be paying for the produce of the properties which according to the
Supreme Court, their co-defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> had a
perfect right to hold and enjoy, they being possessors in good faith and for
value.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the writ of execution dated <st1:date month="12" day="27" year="1965">December 27, 1965</st1:date> is hereby re­voked and the
notice of garnishment dated <st1:date month="1" day="3" year="1966">January 3,
 1966</st1:date> is ordered lifted."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the decision of this Court of June 30, 1967, it was held:</p>

<blockquote>"The basic facts are not disputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents seek to justify the orders
complained of upon the ground that the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of our decision in Case G. R. No. L-20950 is rather vague and requires a
clarification, because:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘x x <span class="SpellE">x</span> Since defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> were held <u>not liable</u> for the alleged damages,
it follows that the <u>joint and several character</u> of the ob­ligation
imposed by this Ho­norable Court was <u>extinguished</u>, because the other
defend­ants herein will no longer be able to claim from defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> the share which cor­responds to the latter (2nd par.
Art. 1217, Civil Code.)'</p>

<blockquote>"This contention is absolutely de­void of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To begin with, Art. 1217 of our Civil Code,
cited by respondents, refers to the effect of <u>payment</u> by one of the <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> debt­ors.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No such payment having been made in the case at bar, said Article is
clearly inapplicable thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only
provision which respondents might have had in mind (on the assumption that
their reference to Art. 1217 was due merely to a misprint) is Art. 1215 of said
code, reading:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘x x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">Novation</span>,
com­pensation, confusion or re­mission of the debt, made by any of the <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> cre­ditors or with any of the <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>
debtors, shall ex­tinguish the obligation, without prejudice to the provisions
of article 1219.</p>

<p class="2Q">'The creditor who may have executed any of these acts, as well as
he who col­lects the debt, shall be liable to the others for the share in the
obligation corresponding to them.'</p>

<blockquote>"Neither is this Article in point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The aforementioned decision of this Court
cannot be regarded as remitting a <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> obligation
of the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>, because, as possessors in good faith,
they were and are <u>entitled by law</u> to retain the property in question, un­til
the indemnity due to them is paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, they were <u>never</u> under obligation to pay damages to <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, either jointly or <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span>,
and, hence, there was no <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> obliga­tion on
their part that could have been remitted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The decision of the Court of First Instance holding all of the
defendants herein jointly and <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable for
the payment of said damages, did <u>not</u> create a <span class="SpellE">solid­ary</span>
obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was no more than an <u>attempt</u>
to declare the existence of said obligation, which <u>attempt</u> - <u>not</u>
the <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> <u>obligation</u> - was <u>frustra­ted</u>
by our decision establishing that such obligation did not and does not exist.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In this connection, it should be noted that the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of the decision of the lower court, which
was the object of the appeal in G. R. No. L-20950, provided:</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As can be seen, paragraph (b) clearly refers, because of the
mention of their names, to none other but the defen­dants <span class="SpellE">Antonino</span>,
Lucia, <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span>, Ruben, <span class="SpellE">Amorando</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Zenai­da</span>, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>,
and <span class="SpellE">Adelaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> Reyes
and <span class="SpellE">Conso­lacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> <span class="SpellE">Degollacion</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Paragraphs (c) and (d), on the other hand, do not make reference to any
defendant by name but merely says "all the defendants".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Examined by itself alone, the said phrase
"all the defendants" would admitted­ly mean all those named as
defendants in the complaint, which would necessarily include Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span> and Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zo­bel</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering, however, that it is indisputable
that Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span> and Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>
could not have been commit­ting any longer any acts of ownership or possession
over any of the lots enumerated, namely Lots 360, 362, 363 and 182 of
Psd-40891, at the time of the filing of the com­plaint, much less when the
judgment was rendered, inasmuch as they had already sold the same when this
suit was began, and the only ones exclusively exercising such rights then were
the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>, one is left wondering if Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span> could have had in mind in paragraph (d) to enjoin
also the defendants Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span> and Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span> who could not have been committing the acts he was
ordering to be enjoined.</p>

<p class="BODY">The argument, therefore, that the phrase "all the de­fendants"
used in paragraph (c) necessarily includes the defendants Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span> and Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span> is
untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such contention would make
the same phrase "all the defendants" employed in paragraphs (c) and
(d) signify differently for each of said paragraphs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That would be absurd.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, there would be consistency
and uniformity in the use of said phrase, if it were to be understood as re­ferring
in both paragraphs only to the defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it is more likely that His Honor
inadvertently omitted the word "said" between the words
"the" and "de­fendants" in the paragraphs in question, or
perhaps, His Honor must have meant to say "all these defendants."</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, in paragraph (e), His Honor makes reference only to
"the defendants" and not to "all of the defendants".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet, this is precisely the paragraph that
does contem­plate all the defendants, the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>,
Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span> and Al­fonso <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>,
for the simple reason that since all of them have lost, Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span> and Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>, by virtue
of pa­ragraph (a) and the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> by virtue of
paragraphs (b), (c) and (d), all of them are naturally liable for the
costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is apparent then that there is
looseness in Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco's</span> language that creates
room for uncertainty as to the exact import of the judgment, if read by itself
without re­gard to the considerations discussed by His Honor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, unless all the paragraphs of said
judgment are construed together, having in view the corresponding
pronouncements in the body of the decision, they would even appear to be
lacking in consistency.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the punctuations used by His Honor are seem­ingly
significant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be noted that
paragraph (a) ends with a period, whereas the other paragraphs end with
semi-colons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His Honor appears to have
separated in the judgment the matter of title from those of possession and the
exercise of the rights of ownership.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, paragraph (a) is concerned exclusively with the question of title
and pa­ragraphs (b), (c) and (d) all refer to possession and the commission of
the acts of ownership only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
tanta­mount to the segregation of the judgment against all the de­fendants,
including Ayala and <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>, in so far as the nul­lity
of their respective titles is concerned in paragraph (a) from the judgment
against the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> only in regard to the possession
of and acts of ownership over the disputed lands in paragraphs (b), (c) and
(d).</p>

<p class="BODY">At best, therefore, if somehow it can be argued that the words
used in the judgment are in themselves clear and definite, there is no doubt
that they suffer from latent am­biguity literally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While ordinarily, the phrases "the defen­dants"
and "all the defendants" are unequivocal and have a readily
comprehensible uniform import, yet when examined in the light of the actual
facts contemplated in the other por­tions of the respective paragraphs wherein
they are used in this judgment, they cannot possibly convey, as already ex­plained,
the same meaning or connotation in all of the said paragraphs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, to be able to do justice and equity to all
concerned, there is imperative need to depart in this case from the usual rule
confining resort only to the <span class="SpellE">dispo­sitive</span> parts of
the decisions concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
justified by precedents<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and even petitioner does not entirely exclude this possibility.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
More, as will be explained anon, the provision of the Constitution of the
Philippines regard­ing the form of judgments constitutes the conclusion and
findings of facts and law of the court as integral parts of the judgment, so
that the judgment must be in accordance therewith,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
hence it can be said that there is constitu­tional warrant to examine the other
parts of a decision when­ever it is necessary to determine the meaning of its <span class="SpellE">dispo­sitive</span> part.</p>

<p class="BODY">Be that as it may, in the case at bar, it is more important to
consider the full length and breadth of the decision of this Court in G. R. No.
L - 20950 than of the appealed decision of the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, it is the more authoritative and
final one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the said judgment
modified that of the trial court, the decisive question is, how was said
judgment modified?</p>

<p class="BODY">To answer this question, the following portions of the decision
are pertinent:</p>

<blockquote>"We have gone over the evidence pre­sented in this case and
found no reason to disturb the factual findings of the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been established that certain areas
originally portions of the navigable water or of the foreshores of the bay were
converted into fishponds or sold by defendant company to third persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is also no controversy as to the fact
that the said defendant was able to effect these sales after it has obtained a
certifi­cate of title (TCT No. 722) and pre­pared a 'composite plan' wherein
the aforesaid foreshore areas appeared to be parts of Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>De­fendants-appellants
do not deny that there is an excess in area between those delimited as
boundaries of the hacienda in TCT No. 722 and the plan prepared by its
surveyor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, how­ever, was justified
by claiming that it could have been caused by the system (magnetic survey) used
in the preparation of the original titles, and anyway, the excess in area (526
hectares, according to defendants) is within the allowable margin given to a
magnetic survey.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"But even assuming for the sake of argument that this
contention is cor­rect, the fact remains that the areas in dispute (those
covered by permits issued by the Bureau of Fisheries) were found to be portions
of the fore­shores, beach, or of the navigable water itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, it is an elemen­tary principle of law
that said areas not being capable of registration, their inclusion in a certificate
of title does not convert the same into properties of private ownership or
confer title on the registrant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See G.
R. No. L-8654, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span>,
et al., <st1:date year="1956" day="28" month="4">April 28, 1956</st1:date>;
also G.R. No. L-20300-01 &amp; L-20355-56, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, et
al. vs. Rodriguez, etc., et al., <st1:date month="4" day="30" year="1965">April
 30, 1965</st1:date>.) In the present case, as the lots covered by TCT No.
T-9550 issued in the names of defendants <span class="SpellE">Di­zons</span> (and
which were purchased by the latter from defendants Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>,
and/or Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>) were found to be portions of
the foreshore or of the territorial waters, the lower court committed no error
in rendering judgment against said defendants and ordering the reversion of
said proper­ties to the public dominion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"However, as we have ruled in the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Dizon</u></span><u>,
et al. vs. Rodriguez, etc., et al.</u>, (Said purchasers who relied on the
efficacy of their certificate of title, cannot be considered possessors in bad
faith until after the legality of their said titles has been finally
determined.) there being no showing that defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>
are not purchasers in good faith and for value, they have a right to retention
of the property until they are reimbursed of the necessary expenses made on the
land, which must properly be established and determined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also follows that as such possessors in
good faith, the defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> can­not also be
held liable for damages allegedly suffered by other parties on account of their
possession of the pro­perty.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In view of the foregoing, the revo­cation of the writ of
preliminary man­datory injunction previously issued by the lower court, and the
suspension of the delivery of possession of the pro­perties to plaintiff and <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> <span class="SpellE">To­lentino</span>, were in
order.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, thus modified, the deci­sion of the lower court
appealed from is hereby affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As can be seen, the lower court's resolution of the question of
nullity of the titles of all the defendants was affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
respect to the matters of pos­session and damages, however, again, it must be
said that the above-quoted portions of the decision, by themselves alone, are
rather ambiguous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is said therein
that "there being no showing that the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> are
not purchasers in good faith and for value, they have a right to retention of
the property until they are reimbursed of the necessary expenses made on the
land." Nothing, however, appears on the face thereof as regards the
consequences of the finding of good faith on the part of the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> upon the joint and <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>
liability of the Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span> and Alfonzo <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span> with the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>, which, it
is now alleged, the lower court found and declared in its judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, as petition­er himself points out,
it is not stated who is supposed to make the required reimbursement to the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, un­less
closely studied and properly understood, the decision of this Court would
appear to be vague and even incomplete.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The truth, however, is that the said decision did set the guide post for
the complete comprehension of the modifica­tion it has made of the decision of
the trial court, ir­respective of what meaning might be derived from the lat­ter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court's decision definitely says,
"as we have ruled in the case of <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, et al.
vs. Rodriguez, et al."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> are possessors in good faith, they have
the right of retention until reimbursed and they need not pay any damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, these points:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) who are possessors in good faith in
situations like those at bar, and (2) who is supposed to reimburse possessors
in good faith like the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>, were squarely passed
upon in that decision in the Rodriguez case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These were the holdings of this Court there:</p>

<blockquote>"On the matter of possession of plain­tiffs-appellants, the
ruling of the Court of Appeals must be upheld.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no showing that plaintiffs are not purchasers in good faith and
for value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such title-holders, they
have reason to rely on the indefeasible character of their certificates.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the issue of good faith of the plaintiffs, the Court of
Appeals reasoned out:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The concept of possessors in good faith given in Article 526 of
the Civil Code and when said possession loses this character under Art. 528,
needs to be reconciled with the doctrine of indefeasibility of a Torrens
Title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such re­conciliation can only be
achieved by holding that the possessor with a Torrens Title is not aware of any
flaw in his Title which in­validates it until his Torrens Title is declared
null and void by final judgment of the Courts.</p>

<p class="2Q">'Even if the doctrine of indefeasibility of a Torrens Title were
not thus recon­ciled, the result would be the same, considering the third
paragraph of Art. 526 which provides that:</p>

<p class="3Q">" ART. 526.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></p>

<p class="3Q">"' Mistake upon a doubtful or difficult question of law may be
the basis of good faith.'"</p>

<p class="2Q">'The legal question whe­ther plaintiffs-appellants' possession in
good faith, un­der their Torrens Titles ac­quired in good faith, does not lose
this character except in the case and from the moment their Titles are declared
null and void by the Courts, is a difficult one. Even the mem­bers of this
Court were for a long time divided, two to one, on the answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only after several sessions, where the
results of exhaustive re­searches on both sides were thoroughly discussed, that
an undivided Court finally found the answer given in the next preceding
paragraph. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Hence, even if it be assumed
for the sake of argument that the Sup­reme Court would find that the law is not
as We have stated it in the next preceding para­graph and that the plaintiffs?appellant
made a mistake in relying thereon, such mis­take on a difficult question of law
may be the basis of good faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
their possession in good faith does not lose this character ex­cept in the case
and from the moment their Torrens Titles are declared null and void by the
Courts.'</p>

<blockquote>"Under the circumstances of the case specially where the
subdivision plan was originally approved by the Director of Lands, we are not
ready to conclude that the above reasoning of the Court of Ap­peals on this
point is a reversible er­ror.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless
to state, as such occu­pants in good faith, plaintiffs have the right to the
retention of the property until they are reimbursed of the neces­sary expenses
made on the lands.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With respect to the contention of the Republic of the
Philippines that the order for the reimbursement by it of such necessary
expenses constitutes a judgment against the government in a suit not consented
by it, suffice it to say that the Republic, on its own initia­tive, asked and
was permitted to inter­vene in the case and thereby submitted itself
voluntarily to the jurisdiction of the court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In view of the foregoing considera­tions, the decision
appealed from is hereby affirmed in all respects, with­out costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, it is clear that while the decision in G. R. No. L-20950
does not say so in so many words, the questions posed in the present case were
not really left unanswered thereby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
closer examination of the said decision reveals that the main issue now before
Us was actually resolved therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
will be noted that in said decision this Court quoted and adopted the reasoning
and holding of the Court of Appeals in its decision then under review regarding
the reconciliation between the concept of possessors in good faith under the
Civil Code, on the one hand, and the doctrine of indefeasibility of a <span class="SpellE">torrens</span> title, on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From such holding of the Court of Appeals,
adopted by this Court, the inescapable conclusion is that this Court's finding
in G.R. No. L-20950 that the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> are posses­sors
in good faith, carries with it the lack of bad faith of Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span> and Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, since their Torrens Titles
served to shield the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> from any stigma of bad
faith, the same legal rule must obtain as respects any imputation of bad faith
against Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span> and <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no reason why the reliance of the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> upon the indefeasibility of their Torrens Titles
should vary in its effect from the reliance of Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>, or, for that matter, of any other person
upon theirs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the fact that this
Court pointedly added to the considerations invoked by the Court of Appeals the
observation that the subdivision plan of Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span> was approved by the Bureau of Lands, a
circumstance relevant only to the good or bad faith of Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span> and <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span> but not to that of
the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>, indicates abundantly that in the mind of
this Court there is no disparity between the position of the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> and the original title holders, Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span> and <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In consequence, on the assumption that Ayala
y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span> and <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span> were
contemplated by Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span> as included in the
phrase "all the defendants" in paragraph (c) of his judgment, I hold
that the modifica­tion of the lower court's decision has the effect of absolv­ing
not only the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> but also the other defendants,
Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span> and Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>,
not because of Articles 1217 and 1219 of the Civil Code invoked by said
defendants-respondents, but for the reason that justice and equity demand that
the reference by this Court to the ruling in <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
vs. Rodriguez, <u>supra</u>, should apply equally to all the defendants who, by
the common circumstanced that they all have Torrens Titles, must be deemed to
be similarly situat­ed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words,
in view of the reference made by this Court to the doctrine of good faith of
holders of Torrens Titles in the Rodriguez case, it is inconceivable that the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>, on the one hand, and Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>, on the other, may be treated differently.</p>

<p class="BODY">Incidentally, it may be added that that decision also resolved,
by such reference to and <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the deci­sion
of the Court of Appeals, the question of who is ob­liged to make the required
reimbursement to the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, by such reference and <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>, that decision also pointed out for what and to
whom herein re­spondent might be held liable, and, definitely, it is not for
damages, but for reimbursement of necessary expenses, and not to petitioner,
but to the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, it is not clear to me how respondents Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span> and <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span> can be considered
to have been ad­judged by Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span> as liable for
damages to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> when there is not one
word in the body of the decision regarding any <span class="SpellE">privity</span>
between petitioner and said respondents, not to speak of any finding of fact or
conclu­sion of law therein in reference thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His Honor held that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> is entitled to the fruits re­ceived by the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> during the period of their possession subsequent to
the filing of <span class="SpellE">Tolentino's</span> application for leas,
citing in this respect <span class="SpellE">Petargue</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Zorilla</span>, 92 Phil. 5,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
but there is complete silence as to the part in said liability, whether joint
or several, or, merely joint, of the other defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As earlier indicated, the Constitu­tion and
the Rules of Court require courts of record to state in their decisions
"clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which (they are)
based" (Section 12, Art. VIII, Constitution; Section 1, Rule 36).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The apparent purpose of these provisions is
precisely to insure that judg­ments have definite bases in fact and in law, so
much so that without such conclusions and findings, a decision be­comes, if not
invalid, at least, subject to return to the lower court so that the judge may
make the necessary find­ings and conclusions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In a case, therefore, as the one before Us, wherein there are several
defendants and the find­ings of fact and conclusions of law made in the
decision refer only to some but not to all of the defendants, a judg­ment
therein saying, in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part, that it is
against the defendants, without particularizing any of them, or even if it were
expressly against "all" the defendants, is to be deemed a judgment
exclusively against the defend­ants as to whom there are findings and
conclusions in the body of the decision and, surely, not against all of
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, I submit, is the view most
consistent with the intent and spirit of the Constitutional mandate, the
purpose of which is to avoid arbitrary and unintelligent decisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judge may err in his findings and
conclusions, that would not affect the validity of his decision; but a judg­ment
without any stated bases in fact and law, in violation of the Constitutional
injunction, should never be accorded the status of an enforceable judicial act.</p>

<p class="BODY">The view I have thus taken of the main question before Us - that
is, what exactly is the judgment to be executed by respondent judge - makes it
unnecessary for Us to determine what exactly is the intent of Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco's</span> decision in so far as the liability of the
respondents Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span> and <span class="SpellE">Zo­bel</span>
is concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already explained, I believe
that this resolution should be based mainly on the judgment of this Court in G.
R. No. L-20950 and the doctrine in Rodriguez it has adopted by express
reference, including, of course, what both of these two decisions necessarily
imply, without at­tempting in any way to alter or modify the latter, since ad­mittedly
such <span class="SpellE">endeavour</span> is not legally permissible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cause for the heated and extended debate
and sharp differ­ences of opinion during our repeated deliberations on the
present motions, regarding the true import and exact sense of the decision of
Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span> is thus avoided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this way, the Court is also relieved from
having to pass on any matter of substantive law, particularly, the point as to
whether or not these respondents can be held liable for damages to petitioner
on the theory that the acquisition by them of their titles which incorporated
the lands in question was a <span class="SpellE">tor­tious</span> act even as to
said petitioner, <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of the fact that at the time
petitioner came into the picture by filing his application for lease,
respondents had already conveyed the said lands to the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>,
as well as the fact that peti­tioner knew, when he so applied for lease rights,
that respondents had already existing titles over said property and that,
therefore, controversy regarding the validity of said titles was inevitable,
since petitioner's application was premised, on the other hand, on the
assumption that the lands in question are public lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Parenthetically, in this connection and as
additional argument against the me­rits of petitioner's claim, I seriously
doubt the propriety, at least, in equity, of awarding damages to one who, for
all practical purposes, has wittingly acquired something that is
controversial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, delving
into such matters at this stage would amount to somehow reopening the main
case, which cannot be legally done anymore.</p>

<p class="BODY">After this opinion was prepared, Mr. Chief Just­ice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> and Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>
submitted their separate dissenting opinions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is but fitting that proper respects be paid to said opinions,
formidable as they are and displaying once more as they do the industry and
sagacity of their authors.</p>

<p class="BODY">The most important point to be noticed in both dis­senting
opinions is that the same seem to give more impor­tance to what is submitted in
them to be the correct in­terpretation or construction of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision or of the judgment of
Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span> than to the proper understanding of the
decision of this Court in G. R. No. L-20950.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That the meaning attributed by the distinguished dissenters to the
judgment of Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span> may have rational basis
cannot be denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The arguments advanced
in both dissenting opinions on this point amply demonstrate this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I reiterate, however, that such discus­sion
is not decisive of this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact,
whatever dis­cussion there is in this opinion of the true import of the <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span> judgment, the same is not intended to be the <u>ratio</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>decidendi</u></span> hereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only purpose of such, discussion is to
emphasize that the language of the judgment of Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span>
is not as happy and as unequivocal as it should have been, and that there being
possible debate as to its exact import, it is justifiable to resort to a
construc­tion thereof in the light of the other portions of the whole
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated differently, I hold
that it is not imperative, in deciding the present incidents, to indulge in any
effort to determine the precise terms of the <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span>
decision, considering that the <span class="SpellE">modificatory</span> decision
of this Court can itself be adequately understood, independ­ently of what His
Honor might have intended to mean, and since, after all, the latter is the one
controlling, the dissection of the <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span> judgment is
of very little rele­vance.</p>

<p class="BODY">As already stated, I hold that because of the re­liance by Mr.
Justice Barrera in G. R. No. L-20950, on the doctrine in his own decision in <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> vs. Rodriguez, <u>supra</u>, regarding the effect of
the issuance of a Torrens title upon the question of the good or bad faith as
pos­sessor and/or owner of the land described therein of the person to whom it
is issued, there can be no way of apply­ing to respondents Ayala and <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span> who were also Torrens title holders like the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>, a different yardstick from that applied to the
latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, it is but rea­sonable,
if not inevitable, to conclude that upon the authority of the decision of Mr.
Justice Barrera in Rod­riguez, the position of Ayala and <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>
in their briefs in G. R. No. L-20950 on this point had been upheld.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, it can be said that there is no
explicit state­ment to this effect in this Court's decision, but can it not be
equally said that such eloquent silence only pa­ralleled by Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco's</span> not making any express and un­ambiguous holding as
to the supposed liability of the re­spondents Ayala and <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>
in his decision?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, if it
is fair to conclude that merely because Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span>
made findings of fact from which the illegality of the inclusion of the areas
of the sea herein in question within the Ayala title or titles might be
deduced, it was no longer necessary for him to make any express holding that
such inclusion was made by said respondents in bad faith or that they had
thereby committed a <span class="SpellE">tortious</span> act for which they
should be liable to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
irrespective of whether they had acted in good faith or in bad faith, it should
also be logical and reasonable to hold that by merely referring to the ruling
in <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> vs. Rodriguez, <u>supra</u>, to the effect
that bad faith can be im­puted to the holder of a Torrens title only from the
time of the judicial declaration of the nullity of such title, this Court had
virtually considered the respondents Ayala and <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>
as not having been in bad faith until<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>their titles were annulled, which was when the decision of this Court
was promulgated and after the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> were already the
ones holding said titles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More
specifically, if Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco's</span> reference to
"all the defendants" in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of his decision can be understood as in­cluding the respondents Ayala and <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span> only because there are findings of fact which would
justify such a conclusion, notwithstanding that he has made no express holding
as to their liability, much less the nature thereof, why would it be untenable
to consider this Court's judgment which says "thus modified" as
inclusive of the absolution of the said respondents from any possible liability
under the lower court's judgment, since, as above demonstrated, there is ample
legal basis for such <span class="SpellE">absolvitory</span> holding? In any
event, it is to be noted that nowhere in the dis­senting opinions is the
position of the majority on this point regarding the import and effect of the
ruling in Rodriguez discussed, much less refuted.</p>

<p class="BODY">The point of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>adjudicata</u></span> discussed in the dis­sents has not
escaped my attention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither am I over­looking
the point of the Chief Justice regarding the dan­gerous and inimical
implications of a ruling that would authorize the revision, amendment or
alteration of a fi­nal and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I want to emphasize that my position in this
opinion does not detract a whit from the soundness, authority and binding force
of existing doc­trines enjoining any such modifications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The public poli­cy of maintaining faith and
respect in judicial decisions, which inform said doctrines, is admittedly of
the highest order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am not advocating
any departure from them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor am I trying
to put forth for execution a decision that I believe should have been rather
than what it is.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All I am doing is to
view not the judgment of Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span> but the
decision of this Court in G. R. No. L-20950, as it is and not as I believe it
should have been, and, by this opinion, I would like to guide the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> as to what, in my honest view, is the true and correct meaning and
im­plications of the decision of this Court, not that of Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco's</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">True, as pointed out by Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>,
the respondents Ayala and <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span> did raise the issue
of what is the import of Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco's</span> decision in
their brief in G. R. No. L-20950, but it is entirely a different mat­ter to say
that Mr. Justice Barrera's decision overruled the contention of respondents in
respect thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pre­cisely, that is the
issue in this case, and for the rea­sons set forth above, it is my considered
view that, on the contrary, they were upheld, at least impliedly, hence the
point of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>adjudicata</u></span>
would seem to have no invulne­rable basis here.</p>

<p class="BODY">In conclusion, I hold that respondent Judge acted in accordance
with law and sound discretion in issuing the order complained of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Herein respondent judge's rul­ing which, in
effect, held that respondents Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span> and Alfonso
<span class="SpellE">Zobel</span> have not been adjudged by this Court liable for
damages allegedly suffered by petitioner is correct, hence, the latter has no
right to an execution in the sense prayed for by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I vote to grant respondents' motion for
reconsideration and to deny petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tolentino's</span>
motion.</p>

It is not true that the ruling in the case of <span class="SpellE">Petargue</span>
<i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Zorilla</span>, <i><u>supra</u></i>, is to the
effect that an applicant for lease of a public land is entitled to juridical
posses­sion thereof from the date he files his application and that, therefore,
he may recover damages from the one in actual possession of the land applied
for until such possession is surrendered to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He do not be­lieve that such is the sense of
that decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, such
interpretation of the ruling in that case does not appear sound and is pregnant
with fearful possibilities of opportunism and graft.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is essentially inequitable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More accurately, what this Court held was
this:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.25in;">"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place><st1:placename>PUBLIC</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>LANDS</st1:placetype></st1:place>; JURISDICTION OF COURT
THEREON; FORCIBLE ENTRY AND DE­TAINER. - Courts have jurisdiction to entertain
an action of forcible entry instituted by a <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> ap­plicant
of public land, who is in oc­cupation and peaceful possession thereof and who
has introduced im­provements, against one who deprives him of the possession
thereof before award and pending investigation of the application."</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 9pt; text-indent: 0in;">Surely, this
ruling does not imply that if an applicant is not in possession, he is entitled
to damages from the time he files his application up to the date he act­ually
secures possession of the land applied for.</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">CONCEPCION, <i>C.J.</i>:<u><span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is called upon to pass upon the Second Motion for
Reconsideration and Supplemental Second Motion for Reconsidera­tion - filed by Ayala
y <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Cia</span></span>. and/or Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span> and Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>,
hereinafter referred to collectively as the respondents - of the decision in
the case at bar, promulgated on June 30, 1967, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Wherefore, said orders dated January 18, Feb­ruary 2 and 8,
and April 13, 1966, should be, as they are hereby, annulled, and respondent
Judge is directed to order the issuance of a writ of execution for the en­forcement
of the decision in question, with costs against respondents herein, except
respondent Judge, Honorable Jaime de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
Angeles."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The decision therein alluded to is that rendered by Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span> in Civil Case No. 373 of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, as modified by this Court in G.R. No. L-20950,
on <st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue in the present action is
simply:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is the aforesaid decision,
as thus modified?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To answer this
question, we must determine specifically:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) what was the decision of the trial court in said Case No. 373; and
(2) to what extent such decision has been modified by ours in L-20950.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><u><span style="font-weight: normal;">The Decision of
Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span><o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of said decision
consists of five (5) paragraphs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Paragraph (a) nullifies respondents' TCT No. T-9550 "and other
subdivision titles" issued in their favor "over the areas outside its
private land covered by TCT No. 722, which, including the lots in T-9550 (Lots
360, 362, 363 and 182) are hereby reverted to public dominion." Paragraph
(b) commands the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> "to vacate <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
360 in favor of x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>." Paragraph (c) sentences "all the
defendants to jointly and severally pay x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> compen­satory damages
in the sum of P3,000 a year per hectare of Lot 360, from March 11, 1954, until
he is placed in x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
possession of the said area." Paragraph (d) restrains "all the
defendants from further acts of ownership and possession over" the four
(4) lots aforementioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Paragraph (e)
orders "the defendants to jointly and severally pay the costs."</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute as regards the meaning of paragraphs (a), (b)
and (e).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue is focused on
paragraph (c) - although paragraph (d) has likewise, been brought into the
orbit of said issue - inasmuch as respondents maintain:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the phrase "all the
defendants" should be understood to refer <u>exclusively</u> to the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>, and said phrase appears, also, in paragraph (d);
and (2) that, assuming that said phrase includes respondents herein, they
should be deemed, in consequence of our decision in L-20950, exempted from the
payment of the damages mentioned in paragraph (c) and placed beyond the pale of
the injunction contained in para­graph (d).</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.3in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Meaning
of Paragraph (c)<o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At the outset, it should be noted that we are called upon, <u>not</u>
to decide whether or not it would be just and fair to hold respondents liable
for damages to <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, but merely to interpret and
apply the aforementioned decision, which has long become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>; that the cardinal purpose of all rules of
interpretation and construction is to ascertain the <u>intent of the writer or
framer</u> of the object of interpretation; that, when the language thereof is
plain and unequivocal, there is no room, much less justification, for the
application of said rules, the clear and obvious meaning being con­trolling<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>;
and that "what is <u>controlling</u>" in a decision "is what
appears in the <span class="SpellE"><u>dispositive</u></span><u> part</u>"
thereof<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>,
"<u>irrespective</u> of <u>all</u> seemingly contrary statements" in
the body or text of the decision.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear that respondents were meant to be and <u>are included</u>
in the phrase "all the defendants" used in paragraph (c) of the <span class="SpellE">dis­positive</span> part of Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco's</span>
decision, and <u>subject</u> to the liabi­lity therein provided, for:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(1)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The language of said paragraph is plain, simple
and clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants in the main
case being, not only the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> but, also, Ayala y <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Cia</span></span> and Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>, it follows that "all the defendants"
include Ayala and <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(2)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The intent to embrace them within the purview of
para­graph (c) is made more apparent by paragraph (b) of said <span class="SpellE">disposi­tive</span> part which refers to the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>
only.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The phrase "all the defendants" in paragraph (c) - immediately after
the command in paragraph (b) addressed <u>solely</u> to the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>
- was evidently used in paragraph (c), by way of <u>contrast</u>, to <u>distinguish</u>
its coverage from that of paragraph (b) and leave no room for doubt that para­graph
(c) applies, <u>not</u> <u>only</u> to the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>,
but, also, to respondents herein.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(3)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->This purpose is, further, underscored by the

sentenced "'the defendants," in paragraph (e),<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> to pay the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the trial court prefixed to

respon­dents herein, under paragraph (c) of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part, becomes readily understandable when we consider two (2) circumstances,
namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span>
adopted the theory of the Government and <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> -
in their respective complaints - to the effect that respondents and the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> are jointly and severally liable to them (Government
and <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>) for damages, on account of the usurpa­tion
of Lot 360 by respondents and the occupation thereof by the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>,
in consequence of the sale made in their favor by the res­pondents, after they
(respondents) had illegally increased, by about 2,500 hectares, the area of
Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span> by causing the same to be
"resurveyed" in 1949; and (b) <u>respondents had not<span style="">&nbsp; </span>questioned in their pleadings the logic of
the conclusion thus drawn from these premises</u> by the Government and <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span> did not <u>explicitly</u>
justify his aforementioned conclusion because respondents had limited them­selves
to assailing the <u>factual bases</u> thereof, and <u>the court had found that
the facts were substantially as alleged in said complaints</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether such facts sufficed to justify the
joint and several <span class="GramE">liability</span> of respondents, pursuant
to paragraph (c), is beside the point.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> The important thing is that <u>Judge
<span class="SpellE">Tengco</span> evidently believed that they did suffice</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, several members of this Court enter­tain
such belief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, the intent of
the party whose writing is sought to be construed constitutes the only
objective of every rule of interpretation.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(8)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is argued that - despite the clear language
to the con­trary in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco's</span> decision - the same could not have meant to
include Ayala (and <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>) in the award for damages,
because neither said decision nor that of this Court declares or suggests that
Ayala's possession, prior to the sale to the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>,
was tainted with bad faith; because Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span> had
not - in discussing the matter of damages - made any reference to the previous
possession of Ayala, and because said Judge had confined his discussion
concerning damages to the issue of good or bad faith in the possession of the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The

Judge was inclined to doubt respondents' good faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the rendition of his said decision, the
Government and the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> had filed a motion for
an alias writ of preliminary mandatory injunction, and a joint motion for

the decision - insofar as it did not award damages to the Government and the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>, <u>other</u> than <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
- as well as for a new trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting
upon these motions, Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span> ruled, on October 5,
1962, that "although believing that the defendants" - referring to
respondents herein - "<u>could have been in bad faith</u> when the
subdivision of the lands were made and cor­responding titles were issued, as
stated in the findings" made in his decision, it was best to maintain the <u>status
quo</u> "in order to avoid serious incidents,” in view of the substantial
amount paid to respondents herein by the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> and
the additional amounts spent by the latter to improve the fishponds in question
and to operate the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words,
were it not for these circum­stances, the alias writ of preliminary mandatory
injunction, sought by the Government and <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
would have been issued, for Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span> believed
that <u>there could have been bad faith</u> on the part of respondents in
effecting the subdivision survey of Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span>
and in securing title to the subdivision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Inasmuch as the decision had not, as yet, become final, and Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span> made foregoing statement in resolving, <u>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></u>, motions for recon­sideration of his decision, the

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In our decision in G.R. No.</span> L-20950, we
declared that, after going “over the evidence presented" therein, we had
"found no reason to disturb the factual findings of the trial court";
that "there be­ing no showing" that the "<span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>
are not purchasers in good faith and for value, they have a right to retention
of the property until they are reimbursed of the necessary expenses made on the
land"; that "as such possessors in good faith," the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> "cannot also be held liable for damages
allegedly suffered by other parties on account of their possession of the
property"; that, accordingly, the trial court had correctly revoked the
writ of preliminary manda­tory injunction it had previously issued and
suspended meanwhile the delivery of Lot 360 to <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>;
and that, "thus modified," Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco's</span>
decision was "affirmed."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear, to my mind, that the said decision had been thereby
modified in two (2) respects only, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(a) that we acknowledged the right of the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>
to retain Lot 360, until re­imbursed of the necessary expenses made thereon;
and (b) that, until so reimbursed, the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> were
not liable to pay damages to <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>all</u> other respects, Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco's</span> decision <u>was</u> affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since - as demonstrated earlier in this
opinion, and impliedly admitted by respondents in their motion of January 8,
1966, to quash the writ of execution issued by the trial court, on December 27,
1965 - paragraph (c) of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of Judge
<span class="SpellE">Tengco's</span> decision - “ordering <u>all the defendants</u>
to jointly and severally pay x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> compensatory damages" -
includes respondents herein, it is clear that the effect of our decision in G.R.
No. L-20950 upon that of Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span> was merely to
so modify said paragraph (c) as to order "all the defendants <span class="GramE"><u>except</u></span><u> the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span></u>"
to jointly and severally pay damages to <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
and to uphold the right of the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> to retain the
possession of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 360, <u>until</u> the necessary
expenses shall have been refunded to them.</p>

from Respondents<o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class="BODY">It is urged that, in consequences of our decision in G.R. No. L-20950,
<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> had, <u>also</u>, lost the right to recover
<u>any</u> damages whatsoever, because such right springs from his right of
possession, which, in turn, is suspended by the right of retention of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Dizons</u></span>, pending reimbursement of their necessary
expenses, so that, until then, <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> has no right
of possession and, hence, is "not enti­tled to damages <u>at all</u>.”</p>

<p class="BODY">The flaw in this process of reasoning becomes apparent when we
consider that - independently of the aforesaid right of reimburse­ment and
retention of the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> - <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
is unquestionably enti­tled to recover damages from his <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>,
the Government, owing to its failure to deliver the possession of the area
leased to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This goes to show that <span class="SpellE">Tolentino's</span> claim for damages against <u>other</u> parties
is <u>not</u> suspended or affected by the right of retention of the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">And the reason is simple.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The right of reimbursement and retention of the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>
is <u>not</u> a <u>negation</u>, but <span class="GramE">a <u>recognition</u></span>
of <span class="SpellE">Tolen­tino's</span> right of possession, for the former
would not exist if the latter did not.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is more, the former exists <u>because</u> of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, there would be no reason for the
right of reim­bursement and retention of the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>
if <u>nobody were entitled to dispossess them</u> and they were not <u>bound</u>
to <u>yield</u> their possession.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> is entitled to the possession
of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 360, because, being part of the public domain, it
has been leased to him by the Government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Vis-a-vis</span> the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>
- but, <u>insofar only as they are concerned</u> - said right of possession of <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> is subject to the qualification that the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> cannot be ousted unless and until their necessary
expenses shall have been reimbursed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That is why, <u>despite</u> said right of the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>,
and without reimbursing those expenses, <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> may
demand from the <u>Government</u>, as his <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, the
payment of indemnity for damages, on account of its failure to deliver to him
the possession of the thing leased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, <u>insofar as the Government is concerned</u>, <span class="SpellE">Tolentino's</span>
right of possession is <u>not</u> subject to the qualification, limitation or
condition resulting from the right of reimbursement and retention of the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This right
belongs to the latter - and to <u>no</u> others - because of a circumstance
peculiar to them (the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>) - their good faith
resulting from justifiable <u>reliance</u> upon the subdivision Torrens Titles
illegally secured by respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">This justification is, however, <u>absent</u> insofar as respon­dents
are concerned, they being <u>the very parties responsible for said illegality</u>,
which was committed by <u>not adhering</u> to the tech­nical description in
their TCT No. 722, and, in effect, <u>disregard­ing</u> the same and the area
therein set forth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to res­pondents
herein, <span class="SpellE">Tolentino's</span> right of possession is not
subject, therefore, to the limitation imposed by the right of reimburse­ment
and retention of the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither may this right of the latter inure to
the benefit of respondents, for <u>they do not derive their rights or
obligations from the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, as buyers of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
360, the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> are the ones who succeeded to what­ever
right or interest respondents had in said lot, and, hence, acquired <u>no</u>
right or interest whatsoever therein, because respondents had <u>none</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right of reimbursement and retention of
the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> exists, <u>not because</u> of the
aforementioned <u>sale</u> by res­pondents - who had <u>nothing</u> to sell -
but, <u>despite</u> this fact and by operation of <u>law</u>, which protects
the rights of possessors in good faith, regardless of their lack of a valid
title.</p>

<p class="BODY">In short, <span class="SpellE">Tolentino's</span> right of
possession is qualified insofar <u>only</u> as the <span class="SpellE"><u>Dizons</u></span>
are concerned, but <u>not</u> <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> either the <u>Government</u>
or <u>respondents</u> herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As regards
both, it is <u>not</u> subject to any limitation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
may demand from respondents the corresponding indemnity for damages on account
of his failure to enjoy said right of possession because of their acts.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents maintain that they cannot be held liable for damages
to <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, inasmuch as his inability to take
possession of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 360 took place when they (respondents)
were completely out of the picture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am
unable to accept this premise, much less the inference drawn <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tolentino's</span>
interest in the disputed area was derived from one <span class="SpellE">Gabino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lachica</span>, who - like the other <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>
in the main case - had filed, with the Bureau of Fisheries, his applica­tion
for lease in <u>1949</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents
then caused <span class="SpellE">Lachica</span> and other similar applicants to
be ejected from the disputed area.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Evidently to defeat the claims of said applicants, respondents,
moreover, caused a resurvey and a composite subdivision plan, supposedly of the
Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span>, to be made, which plan included <u>ille­gally</u>
said disputed area, together with other areas, aggregating 1,091 hectares,
located outside the boundaries of the Hacienda, as set forth in its TCT No.
722.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, based on said resurvey and
composite plan, the Hacienda, or respondents herein, unlawfully secured
transfer certificates of title to the subdivision lots <u>outside</u> its
perimeter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>In 1952</u>, the Bureau of
Fisheries demanded - upon the theory that the disputed area forms part of the
public domain - that it be vacated by those who held it upon the authority of
respon­dents herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, that same
year of 1952, <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> - as assignee of <span class="SpellE">Lachica's</span> interest, under the lease application filed by
him in 1949 - filed his own lease application, followed by ano­ther in
1954.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, those required by the
Bureau of Fish­eries to vacate the disputed area, including the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>, had <u>ob­jected</u> to the lease applications
aforementioned, alleging that said area is part of the Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span>, covered by said TCT No. 722.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Upon due investigation</u>, conducted in
1954, this contention was <u>found to be false,</u> in view of which, that same
year, <span class="GramE">the</span> Director of Fisheries <u>officially declared</u>
that the disputed area is <u>part of the public domain</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This action was sustained by <span class="GramE">Us</span> in <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> v. Rodriguez and
Republic v. Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> as well as in Republic v. Ayala.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, despite the fact that, <u>as early as 1949</u>, <span class="SpellE">Lachica</span> and others had claimed the right to hold the area
aforementioned, pur­suant to lease applications filed by them with the Bureau
of Fish­eries, and questioned respondents' authority to possess that area, and
that, as <span class="SpellE">Lachica's</span> assignee, <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
as well as others, had, in <u>1952</u>, filed similar lease applications with
said Bureau, <u>which then bade respondents' lessees to vacate said area</u>,
and in 1954 <u>rejected their claim that the same is part of respondents'
property</u>, on February 3, <u>1954</u>, respondents sold Lot 360 to the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, this illegal sale was made <u>by respondents</u> almost two years <u>after</u>
<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> had personally and officially entered into
the picture, and about five (5) years after his predecessor-­in-interest, <span class="SpellE">Lachica</span>, had done so.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Insofar as the impediment
to <span class="SpellE">Tolentino's</span> assumption of possession of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
360 is concerned, respondents were <u>not</u> com­pletely out of the picture,
even <u>after</u> the sale by them made to the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the latter's possession was a <u>necessary</u>
legal and factual consequence of that sale.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is more, as the successors­-in-interest of respondents herein, <u>the
<span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> were their alter ego</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> had
stepped into respondents' shoes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
the former represented the latter, in the sense of exercising such right of
possession as respondents illegally claimed to have, and which they must have
known they did not have, because:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a)
Lot 360 was <u>outside</u> the area covered by their TCT No. 722 and, together
with other "subdivision" lots, supposedly of Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span>, <u>far exceeded</u> the area thereof; (b) they
had been <u>advised by the Bu­reau of Fisheries</u> to vacate it; (c) the
Department of Agriculture had <u>declared it part of the inalienable public
domain</u>; and (d) its being part of the shore and territorial waters <u>manifestly
revealed that status to the whole world</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Vis-a-vis</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
respondents stood in the same condition they would have been had the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> merely leased Lot 360 from them, for, in that case, <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> would have, likewise, been pre­vented by the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> from taking possession of said lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would then be more evident that the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> held the lot <u>on behalf</u> of respondents, in the
sense that the former would be exercising, although temporarily, an alleged <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> right <u>of the latter</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the possession by the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>, under such hypothetical lease, would inure to the
benefit of respondents herein, for purposes of acquis­itive prescription of
ownership, if the lot were alienable, which it was and is not.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span> It is true that no <u>contractual</u>
relation exists between res­pondents and <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, contract is <u>one</u> only of the legal
sources of obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One other source
thereof is <u>quasi-delict</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> Hence, Art. 2176 of our Civil Code
explicitly provides that "who­ever by act or omission causes damage to
another, there being fault or negligence, is obliged to pay the damage
done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such fault or negligence, if there
is no preexisting contractual relation between the parties, is called a quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."
In the case at bar, by illegally causing Lot 360, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, to be included in its subdivision title -
although not really covered by its TCT No. 722, and actually forming part of
the public domain - and by conveying said Lot 360 to the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>
- knowing that it was claimed by the Government and its lessee, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, apart from the fact that, being part of the
"foreshore, beach or x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
navigable waters," it is manifestly "not x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> capable of registration" and its "inclusion
in a certificate of title does not convert the same into" property of
"private ownership or confer title on the registrant"<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> -
respondents herein had performed acts constituting "fault" or
"culpa," in consequence of which <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
as govern­ment lessee of said lot, had sustained damages, which respondents are
bound to indemnify under said Art. 2176.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an attempt to show that this rationalization is legally unten­able,
it has been argued that by such process a pedestrian injured in an automobile accident
may sue the manufacturer of said car.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instead of accomplishing its purpose, the argument reveals its basic
flaw.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, in the absence of fault or
negligence in the manufacture of the car, its manufacturer cannot possibly be
held liable for the damages resulting from said injury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, if the accident took place <u>on
account of a defect in the manufacture of the car</u>, the injured party <u>would
certainly be entitled to recover</u> said damages from the manufacturer,
pursuant to the aforementioned Art. 2176.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such is, also, the established rule under the common law,<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">Consistently with the philosophy underlying the Common Law and
said Art. <span class="GramE">2176 of our Civil Code, Art.</span> 2187 thereof de­clares
that:</p>

<blockquote>"Manufacturers and processors of foodstuffs, drinks, toilet
articles and similar goods shall be liable for death or injuries caused by any
noxious or harmful substances used, although no contractual relation exists

<p class="BODY">Similarly, if a building or structure collapses totally or par­tially,
owing to a defect in its plans and specifications, or in the ground, or in the
construction, or to the use of materials of in­ferior quality, the engineer or
architect who drew up the plans and specifications, or supervised the
construction, or the con­tractor who built it, may be sued <u>directly</u> by

pursuant to Art. <span class="GramE">2192 of said Code.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the action to exact liability from respon­dents
herein had been based upon a stronger legal and moral ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, in the illustrations given above,
there was merely a <u>possi­bility</u> or <u>probability</u> of somebody being
harmed accidentally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
360, its sale to the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> <u>necessarily</u>
resulted in the assumption of its <u>possession</u> by the latter, and, hence,
in the <u>cer­tainty</u> of a denial of such possession to the Government and
its lessee, <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, <u>respondents knew
positively</u> that, by selling the lot, they were acting in derogation of the
rights or claims of the Government and <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, <u>of
which they had pre­vious notice</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Independently of the foregoing, the fact is that respondents had
performed several unlawful acts - such as, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
<u>ille­gally securing title to 1,091 hectares of the public domain</u>, includ­ing
the territorial waters of the State; <u>illegally causing said portion of the
public domain to be subdivided, and certificates of title to be issued</u> for
the subdivision lots; and <u>illegally selling and/or leas­ing a number of said
lots</u> and other parts of that segment of the public domain, including Lot
360, to third persons.</p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, they performed an <u>unlawful invasion of the
public domain</u>, which is a tort,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> commonly known as trespass,<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a>

The Common Law furnishes abundant authority to the effect that bad faith is <u>not</u>

in the following language:</p>

<blockquote>"In order to be liable for a trespass on land . . . it is

possession of his land and, therefore, that he <u>know</u> his entry to be an
intrusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the actor is and intends
to be upon the particular piece of land in question, it is immaterial that he <u>honestly</u>
and <u>reasonably</u> believes that he has the consent of the lawful pos­sessor
to enter, or, indeed, that <u>he himself is its possessor</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unless the actor's mistake was induced by the
conduct of the possessor, it is <u>immaterial</u> that the mistake is one such
as a reasonable man knowing all the circumstances which the actor knows or
could have dis­covered by the most careful of investigations would have
made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One who enters any piece of land
takes the risk of the existence of such facts as would give him a right or
privilege to enter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So too, <u>the actor
cannot escape liability by showing that his mistaken belief in the valid­ity of
his title is due to the advise of the most eminent of counsel</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, <u>even though a statute expressly

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">As above indicated, <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>

investigation, <u>with notice to all parties concerned</u>, a Committee created
<span class="SpellE">therefor</span> by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources, <u>found</u> that the disputed area was <u>not</u> within said
Hacienda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> and their co-protestants filed, with the Court of
First Instance of Manila, an action for prohibition to enjoin said official and
the Director of Fisheries from acting upon said fishpond applications, until

Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> and his daughter <span class="SpellE">Clemencia</span>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, or on September 28, 1959, the Republic of the
Philippines had instituted said Civil Case No. 373 of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, against "Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span> and/or Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Jacobo</span> <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>" and the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>, to annul the transfer certificate of title issued

the subdivision titles thereafter issued for areas not covered by TCT No. 722,
to oust said defendants from the disputed areas, to recover damages from said
defendants, and to restrain them from exercising further acts of dominion over
the aforementioned areas, and for such other relief as may be meet and proper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Presently, <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
filed a complaint in interven­tion, and, thereafter, other applicants-awardees
of fishpond permits joined the Republic and <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
in seeking the <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> prayed for by both.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="6"><u>June
 2, 1962</u></st1:date>, Hon. <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span>, as Judge of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>,
rendered the decision involved in the present case, which was <u>affirmed</u>
by <span class="GramE">Us</span> in G.R. No. L-20950, on <st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="5"><u>May 31, 1965</u></st1:date>, subject to the modification
already adverted to.</p>

<p class="BODY">The points relevant to the equities of the case are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that on April 28, <u>1956</u>, this Court
had declared<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a>
that, if the disputed area is part of the beach or foreshore - as respondents
knew it was - said area <u>could not be registered</u> under the Torrens
System; (2) that this pronouncement <u>was reiterated</u> in the decision of
Judge Vasquez, dated January 30, <u>1958</u>, which <u>further</u> declared
that said area is not and was not part of the Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span>
and that the subdivision titles thereto, of the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Sy-Juco</span>, et al., are null and void; and (3) that
said pronouncement and declaration were<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>affirmed</u>
by the Court of Appeals, on October 31, <u>1961</u>, <u>rei</u>­<u>terated</u>
by Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span> on June 2, <u>1962</u>, and <u>affirmed</u>
by the Supreme Court, on April 30, and May 31, <u>1965</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, despite a final decree of the Supreme Court, as early as <u>April
28, 1956</u>, declaring clearly that respondents and the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>
<u>cannot</u> possibly have a valid Torrens Title to the disputed area; despite
the decision of Judge Vasquez, less than two (2) years later, declaring, in
addition thereto, that said area <u>is not</u> and <u>was not</u> part of
Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span> and that the Torrens titles
covering said area are null and void; despite the reiteration of these decla­rations
by Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span>, and the <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>
thereof by the Court of Appeals and by two other decisions of the Supreme
Court; and, despite, therefore, these six (6) decisions - two (2) of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, one (1) of the Court
of Appeals, and three (3) of the Supreme Court - which rendered liability for
dam­ages caused to <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> inescapable, respondents
did nothing - for the fifteen (15) years and a half that had elapsed, since the
rendi­tion of our decision in <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span> - to undo or minimize the wrong they had done, and
are still doing to <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, as an <span class="SpellE">awardee</span> of fishpond permits granted by the Government.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is next contended that, under <span class="SpellE">Tolentino's</span>
theory, he would collect P90<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> a year from
respondents until he recovers the possession of Lot 360, which he cannot have
unless the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> are reimbursed of the necessary
expenses made thereon by them, so that, by not making such reimbursement, he
would be receiving indefinitely the aforementioned sum, at the expense of
respondents herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, however, <u>within
respondents' power to see to it that possession is forthwith given to <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span></u>, and they could have done so, <u>at any time</u>,
had they been so minded, by reimbursing the neces­sary expenses due to the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <u>respondents
have themselves to blame</u> for their inaction in this respect, <u>despite the
clear message</u> of our decision in <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> v. Bayona,<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a>
since <st1:date year="1956" day="28" month="4">April 28, 1956</st1:date>, <u>to
which they have turned deaf ears</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">If, using a Torrens Title he has counterfeited in his name, one
sells the land of another to a third person, who acquires it in good faith and
for value, and, as its possessor in good faith, has a right of reimbursement
and retention, can there be any doubt about the legal and equitable right of
the true owner and/or the successor-in-interest to his right of possession over
the land, to recover the resulting damages from the author of the
falsification, as the proximate cause of said damages?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Would it be just and fair to exempt him from
liability, upon the theory that the damages were sustained <u>after</u> the
falsification and sale made by him, when he was "completely out of the
picture," and that he may avail - which he cannot<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> -
of the rights of said buyer and possessor in good faith?</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been argued that, since the damages suffered by <span class="SpellE">Tolen­tino</span> consist of the fruits received by the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>, which the former cannot recover from the latter,
because of their right of reimburse­ment and retention, there is no reason why
respondents should be held liable for such damages, considering that said
fruits were not received by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
flaw in this process of reasoning has already been shown in the preceding pages
of this opinion.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a>
It may not be amiss to add, however, that, in consequence of the sale of Lot
360 to the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>, <u>the price paid by the latter
took the place of the land, insofar as respondents are concerned</u>, and that
t<u>he interest</u>, profits and other benefits derived by respondents from the
<u>posses­sion and use of said price, partook of the nature or assumed the role
of the fruits of said lot</u>, which did not belong to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Al­though the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>
are entitled to recover said price from respon­dents, <u>the latter are not bound
to pay interest thereon to the former</u>, because they (the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>) have actually received the fruits or in­come
derived from the operation of the fishpond in Lot 360, which are the
counterpart of the benefits derived by respondents from the possession and use
of the price aforementioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch
as, <u>not being owners of Lot 360, respondents are not entitled to keep said
benefits; the same should, pursuant to the elementary prin­ciples of justice
and equity, be turned over to the party who would have received them as
possessor and operator of the fishpond, had it not been for the illegal and <span class="SpellE">tortious</span> acts of said respondents</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apart from being implemented in Article 2176
of our Civil Code,<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> those principles are incorporated, <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, in Articles 20 and 21 of the same Code,
which provide:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 20.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every person
who, contrary to law, <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span> or negligently causes

the subdivision title of respondents herein and were entitled to continue
relying thereon until a judgment annulling said title shall have become final -
neces­sarily implied that respondents herein are, likewise, entitled to such
reliance, and, hence, to the exemption accorded to the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>,
because justice and equity demand that the doctrine laid down in <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> v. Rodriguez be applied equally to those similarly
situated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents herein are not, however, so situated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> were
entitled to rely on the aforementioned subdivision titles of respondents herein
and had no obligation to inquire about the circumstances under which said
titles had been issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other
hand, respondents herein were not only aware of these circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>They were the ones</u> who ordered the
resurvey and the subdivision that led to the issuance of said titles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They knew that the area thereof exceeded, by
over 1,000 hectares, the area covered by their TCT No. 722.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the Court of Appeals had repeatedly held
in its decision in <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> v. Rodriguez - which
"we affirmed in all respects" - the subdivision plan of the Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span> "was prepared <u>in disregard</u> of the
technical description contained in TCT No. 722."</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, nothing was said in our decision, either in G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-20950, or in G.R. No.</span> L-20300-01 and L-20355-56, which may

of said res­pondents, from the obligation to pay damages until such time as the
<span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>, lessees or assignees, shall have been

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><u><span style="font-weight: normal;">Acquisition of
Something Controversial<o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The propriety, in equity, of awarding damages to <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> has been put in doubt, upon the theory that he
had "wittingly ac­quired something that is controversial," referring,
presumably, to the fact that his interest in Lot 360 had been acquired by
assign­ment of the rights therein of <span class="SpellE">Gabino</span> <span class="SpellE">Lachica</span> - as the original appli­cant of a fishpond permit
from the Government - which were con­tested by respondents herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">The status of said <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 360 as a portion of
the public domain and not a part of Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span>
is not, however, controver­sial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being a
portion of the territorial navigable waters in <st1:place><st1:placename>San­tiago</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Bay</st1:placetype></st1:place>, it is <u>obvious</u> to the
whole world that said lot is not and cannot be a private <span class="GramE">property,</span>
much less belong to the Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span>, whose TCT
No. 722 explicitly stated that <st1:place><st1:placename>Santiago</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Bay</st1:placetype></st1:place> constituted one of its southern
<u>limits</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the Bay
was not and is not part of the Hacienda.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is more, jurisdiction over said portion of the Bay was
asserted by the Bureau of Fisheries as early as <st1:date year="1952" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1952</st1:date>, and reiterated in 1954.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before the close of that year, such action
was sustained by Judge <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span>, who, in turn, was, in
April 1956, upheld by the Supreme Court, which declared positively that areas
that "are really part of the sea, beach or foreshore x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> cannot be registered x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> in the name of any one, for <u>they are not <span class="SpellE">registrable</span></u>, are <u>non-alienable</u> and <u>belong to
the public domain</u> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."
There could have been, therefore, no possible doubt that <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
360 and the other lots found in the <st1:place><st1:placename>Santiago</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Bay</st1:placetype></st1:place> form part of the public
domain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted, also, that
owing mainly to the initiative and resolution of <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
the State recovered more than 1,091 hectares of the public domain and the
transfer certificates of title thereto of respondents herein and their assigns
were annulled.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question, therefore, is whether it is just and fair to deny <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> the right to recover damages from the party who
caused them, despite the manifest public nature of Lot 360; des­pite the fact
that it is beyond the boundaries set forth in respondents' TCT No. 722, despite
the notices sent and demands made by the Bureau of Fisheries in 1952 and 1954;
despite the decision of Judge <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span> in December,
1954 and that of the Supreme Court in 1956<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a>; despite the decision of Judge

<p class="BODY">Granting, for the sake of argument, that <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
had ac­quired something controversial - whether Lot 360 was or was not a part
of Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span> - thereby assuming the risk of
losing and sustaining damages, the fact is, however, that he was <u>not only
right</u>, but, also, that he thereby <u>rendered a service to the nation</u>,
by establishing its title to over 1,000 hectares of the public domain
appropriated by respondents herein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, <u>respondents had</u>, <u>also</u>, performed something much
more "controversial" - to put it mildly - and <u>assumed a greater
risk</u> - by causing a resurvey and a composite plan to be made of the
Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span>, dis­regarding the boundaries set
forth in its TCT No. 722, and by claiming title and performing acts of
ownership over more than 1, 091 hectares which are beyond said boundaries - and

"susceptible of two constructions." They are inap­plicable to the

<p class="BODY">This case was one for the recovery of P16<span class="GramE">,417.25</span>
"repre­senting the proceeds of a <u>joint and several</u> promissory
note." Although the defendants therein "<u>admitted</u> the existence
of said debt <u>in accordance with the promissory note</u>," the judgment
sen­tencing them to pay said amount did not declare them "jointly and
severally" liable <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the decision had become final, the
lower court - on motion of the judgment creditor, based upon the theory that
the failure of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of the decision
to order that the debt be paid "severally" was due to an <u>omission</u>
committed "inadvertently" - amended said part of the decision by
specifying the "several" nature of the payment therein decreed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A petition for certiorari filed by the
judgment debtors to annul this amendment was denied by the Supreme Court, upon
the ground that the lower court had not exceeded its jurisdiction in acting as
it did, because "it <u>clearly appears</u> from the allegations of the com­plaint,
the promissory note reproduced therein and made a part thereof, the prayer <u>and
the conclusions of fact and of law contained in the decision of the respondent
judge</u>, that the obligation contracted by the petitioners is joint and
several and that <u>the parties as well as the trial judge so understood it</u>."<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, the obligation involved therein was <u>concededly</u>
joint and several in nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was so
stated plainly in the corres­ponding promissory note.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was so alleged in the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>De­fendants "never denied" it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, they "admitted" its
existence “<u>in accordance with the promissory note</u>." They
"defended themselves merely by alleging that the action was <u>premature</u>."
The “<u>conclusions of fact and of law contained in the decision</u>"
showed "<u>clearly</u>" that respondent <u>judge</u>, like <u>both
parties</u>, had "understood" defendants' obligation to be
"joint and several" in character.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the Supreme Court concluded that his failure to so state it in
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of the decision was due "<u>clearly</u>"
to an "<u>omission</u>" committed "<u>inadvertently</u>."</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>None</u> of these circumstances exists in the case at
bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here we are concerned, <u>not</u>
with an "omission," but with an "addition" or insertion,
which, unlike the former, cannot be and is not due to “inadvertence," but <u>must
have been and was intentional and deliberate</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Republic and <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
had prayed for a judgment against "the defendants," and the trial
judge rendered judgment against "<u>all</u> the defendants," thus <u>stressing</u>

is more, <u>this judgment is in accordance with the theory of the Repub­lic and
<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> in their respective complaints, as well as
in their pleadings, briefs and memoranda</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;

that of the case at bar - <u>was</u> ambiguous or susceptible of several
interpretations.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Velez case, the question was whether the defendant,
sentenced, in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of a decision, to
pay a certain sum to the plaintiff, was bound to do so in his <u>personal</u>
capacity or <u>as administrator</u> of the estate of a deceased person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said <span class="SpellE">dis­positive</span>
part did <u>not</u> state in what capacity the defendant had been so sentenced.</p>

<p class="BODY">The De <span class="SpellE">Ralla</span> case involved a decision
of the Court of Ap­peals in a land registration case, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of which decision declared that petitioner had established a fee simple
title, not over the "entire" property applied for and covered by the
deed of purchase Exhibit D, but over a "portion" only thereof, which
could not be adjudicated, as yet, to the applicant, because the "true
boundaries" of said portion were not indicated in the plan submitted to
court, which, accordingly, remanded the case to the trial court for resurvey,
which should not include the areas covered by certain homestead and free patent
applications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part further provided that "after the amended plan shall have been duly
approved and the lower court is satisfied as to its identity" - referring
to the portion belonging to the appli­cant - "it shall be
adjudicated" to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part was assailed as incongruous, in that it
denied the registration of even the portion to which the applicant had
established her title and that, by directing the exclusion of the areas covered
by homestead and free patent applications, "the applicant would be
deprived of a part of the property which has been declared to be <span class="SpellE">registrable</span> in her favor." It was held that the
alleged incongruity in the <span class="SpellE">disposi­tive</span> part should
be resolved by considering "the decision below x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> as a whole x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." No similar contradiction or incongruity exists in
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of the decision of Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span> in­volved in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of the judgment on
the pleadings ren­dered in the <span class="SpellE">Villones</span> case
sentenced the defendant therein to accept a given sum of money - payment of
which had been tendered by the plaintiffs - which, together with another
specified sum, already paid by the latter, represented "the full purchase
price of <u>the land sold" by the defendant</u> to the plaintiffs, and to
execute the corresponding deed of conveyance in their favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the proceedings for the execution of this
decision, the issue arose as to the area of the land to be conveyed to the
plaintiffs, <u>said area not having been given in said <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of the
decision in the <span class="SpellE">Morelos</span> case - rendered on <st1:date year="1952" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1952</st1:date> - ordered the
defendant to pay to the plaintiff P1<span class="GramE">,023</span> a month from
February 1950 "up to the pre­sent time." This decision was, on <st1:date year="1957" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1957</st1:date>, affirmed by the
Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1957" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1957</st1:date>, the trial court issued
a writ of execution directing the sheriff to cause the defendant to pay P1<span class="GramE">,023</span> "a month" from February 1950 to January
1957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant objected thereto,
alleging that the decision sought to be executed merely directed the payment of
said sum "from February 1950 up to the present time," which - he
claimed - was <st1:date year="1952" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1952</st1:date>,
the date of promulgation of the lower court's decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This pretense was overruled, it appearing
from the body of the decision that the issue between the parties was the term
of a lease in favor of <span class="SpellE">Morelos</span>, which was held to be
eight (8) years from <st1:date year="1949" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1949</st1:date>,
or up to January 1957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the
phrase "the present time" used in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of the trial court's decision could mean either the date of its rendition
- which was long <u>before</u> the expira­tion of the term of the lease - or
the date when the decision became final - <u>after</u> the expiration of said
term - or the date when the lease expired, which was several months <u>before</u>
the decision had become final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of the decision was -
unlike that of Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco's</span> decision or of ours in G.R.
No. L-20950 - open to several interpretations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Speaking through Justice <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>, this

errors, or mistakes or omissions <u>plainly</u> due to inadvertence or

Freeman's postulate<a style="" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> to the effect that:</p>

<p class="BODY">Particularly relevant to the question whether or not the <span class="SpellE">Loc­sin</span> case justifies the granting of the relief sought in
the second motion for reconsideration of respondents herein is the fact that,
like the <span class="SpellE">Locsin</span> case, that of Contreras involved the
question whe­ther the judgment debtors, under a given final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> deci­sion, are jointly and severally liable <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>, despite the <u>silence</u> thereon of its <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part, which was allegedly "due to <u>inadver­tence</u>
on the part of the court." Commenting thereon, this Court added, in the
Contreras case:</p>

<blockquote>"In truth, there is no proper and sufficient showing here that
the alleged mistake was due to inadvertence on the part of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have been through with the de­cision and
have not detected in it any <u>clear</u> purpose or intention to make the
defendants jointly and severally lia­ble.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>In all probability, the nature of defendants' liability (whether
joint or joint and several) was not touched upon at all by the parties and was
not even given thought by them or by the court</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The point was involved in obscu­rity</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the judgment of the lower court plainly
indi­cates, the case was very intricate, complicated by a multiplicity of
claims and counterclaims arising from different juridical acts and sought from
different parties who sustained diverse relationships to the plaintiffs and to
each other with reference to the separate items.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not to be wondered at if the finer
point of solidarity among the defendants was swallowed up and lost in the maze
of these claims and counterclaims over the valid­ity of which the
three-cornered contest was centered and bitterly waged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x"<a style="" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a></blockquote>

<u>for administration</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as
the <span class="SpellE">Arces</span> had failed to render accounts since 1946
and had leased the property to another, the Edwards filed an action to recover
possession of the lot and for an accounting and liquidation of said
administration.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that <u>prior thereto</u>, the <span class="SpellE">Arces</span>
had sued the Ed­wards <u>to compel them to execute a deed of conveyance of said
lot</u>, in compliance with a promise to sell made by them to the <span class="SpellE">Arces</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due
course, a decision was rendered <u>declaring that the <span class="SpellE">Arces</span>

portion of 137 square meters of said lot is concerned, with­out the
improvements thereon, and <u>not with regard to the remain­ing</u> area of said
lot, containing 43 square meters, and that, since the complaint sought the
conveyance of the whole lot, with a total area of 180 square meters, judgment
was rendered <u>absolving</u> the Edwards from said complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">After this decision had become final, the Edwards com­menced the

lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Arces</span>
prayed, accordingly, that the Edwards be sentenced to execute the deed of
conveyance thereof and to pay damages for their fail­ure to do so, despite the
decision in the first case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of
First Instance rendered, in the second case, a decision sentencing the Edwards <u>to
execute said deed of sale</u> in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Arces</span>
and requiring the latter to render an accounting to the former, under the terms
set forth in said decision, which was substantially affirmed by the Court of

<p class="BODY">In several actions for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of
tenants instituted in the City Court of Manila, on April 27, 1954, the
defendants filed mo­tions to dismiss based upon Rep. Act No. 1162 (approved on
June 18, 1954), pursuant to which, from the approval thereof and until the
expropriation therein provided, "no <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
proceedings shall be instituted or prosecuted against any tenant or occupant of
any landed estates or haciendas" therein authorized to be expro­priated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1954" day="14" month="7">July
 14, 1954</st1:date>, the court denied the motions and sus­pended the
proceedings for two (2) years from the approval of said Act or until further
order of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on <st1:date year="1955" day="13" month="4">April 13, 1955</st1:date>, the municipal judge
ordered the cases set for hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
reconsideration of this order having been denied, the tenants filed with the
Court of First Instance of Manila a petition for certiorari and prohibition alleging
that the order of <st1:date year="1954" day="14" month="7">July 14, 1954</st1:date>,
had already disposed of the action and determined the rights of the
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The CFI dismissed the petition
upon the theory that said order was merely interlocutory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although in the body of the order the
municipal judge declared that, "from the approval of Rep. Act No. 1162 no <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> proceeding should be instituted or prosecuted
against any tenant," thereby indicating apparently, that the motion to
dismiss should be granted, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of
the order clearly and unequivocally denied the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court affirmed the order of
dismissal appealed from, stating:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> It
is argued x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> by
appellants that the body of the order recognized the prohibition laid down by
Republic Act No. 1162 against the<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>institution of <span class="SpellE">eject­ment</span> proceedings after
the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of said Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an elementary principle of procedure
that the resolution of the Court on a given issue as embodied in the <span class="SpellE"><u>dispositive</u></span><u> part</u> of the decision or order is
the <span class="SpellE"><u>investive</u></span><u> or controll­ing factor</u>
that determines and settles the rights of the parties and the questions
presented therein, <u>notwith­standing the existence of statements or
declarations in the body of said order that may be confusing</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, considering that the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of the order merely <u>suspended</u> the
proceedings without touch­ing on the merits of the case or disposing of the
issues involved therein, said order cannot be said to be final in character but
clearly an interlocutory one which in this case cannot be the subject of an
action for certiorari.”<a style="" href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The defendant subsequently tried to appeal from said decision,

be­ing substantial in nature, in that the original decision did not require the
plaintiff to make a payment to the defendant, which the amended decision
did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Commenting on plaintiff's argument
to the effect that the body of the original decision already stated that

<p class="BODY">In a decision rendered on <st1:date year="1954" day="2" month="8">August
 2, 1954</st1:date>, the CIR sentenced the employer corporation to pay its
policemen a given additional compensation "together with all the <u>privileges</u>
and <u>facilities</u> hither­to enjoyed by them." These policemen having
been laid off, in the meantime, and, thereafter, refused reinstatement, their <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
filed with the CIR a petition for reinstatement and for contempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due course, the CIR rendered judgment on <st1:date year="1957" day="9" month="12">December 9, 1957</st1:date>, ordering the
reinstatement prayed for, with back wages, "without loss of seniority and
other privileges they have hitherto enjoyed x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." Still later, the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
filed a "petition for execution of judgment re privileges,
facilities".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that these
"facili­ties" included free khaki suiting, shoes, helmets and
ponchos, which the employer did not furnish them upon reinstatement, alleg­ing
that said items were given for official use during their official tour of duty,
while rendering actual police work, which they had not rendered while laid
off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch, however, as the decision
sought to be executed had eliminated the "facilities" from the award
made therein, the claim of the policemen was overruled because:</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 30, 1961, <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> Pac &amp; Co.
was adjudged by the CIR guilty of unfair labor practice and ordered to pay back
wages to certain workers from the date of their unjust dismissal - by stop­ping
the work in the old <span class="SpellE"><u>carro</u></span> to which they were
assigned - to the date of finality of the CIR decision, which was affirmed by
the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
having later moved that said <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> be computed,
the matter was referred to the chief examiner of the CIR, who subsequently
submitted his assessment of the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> from <st1:date year="1957" day="20" month="1">January 20, 1957</st1:date> (date of dismissal)
to <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1962</st1:date> (date
of finality of the decision).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
report was, on <st1:date year="1966" day="9" month="11">November 9, 1966</st1:date>,
approved by a CIR Judge, but modified by a resolution of the CIR <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>,
on <st1:date year="1966" day="9" month="11">November 9, 1966</st1:date>,
reducing the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> to six months.</p>

<p class="BODY">Assailed as an attempt to modify a decision already final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, the validity of this resolution was sought to be
jus­tified upon the ground that "to reinstate the workers concerned when
there is no work to be done would be injustice to the com­pany, because management
would be forced to give salaries to the workers even if they have nothing to
do." In said resolution, the CIR <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> concluded,
therefore, that whatever <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> the workers were
entitled to should not extend beyond the time when, had they been reinstated,
they would have nevertheless ceased working due to the legitimate shutting up
of the <span class="SpellE"><u>carro</u></span> in which they were working.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Supreme Court rejected this view upon the ground that while
the body of a decision, order or resolution might create some <u>ambiguity</u>
regarding which way the Court's reasoning prepon­derates, it is the <span class="SpellE"><u>dispositive</u></span><u> portion</u> thereof that <u>finally
invests rights upon the parties</u>, sets conditions for the exercise of these
rights, and imposes the corresponding duties and obligations."</p>

<p class="BODY">We have thus consistently adhered to the rule that the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of a decision is the judgment properly
speaking; that the same prevails over the opinion set forth in the body of the

former is controlling, "regardless of any possible injustice in a

<p class="BODY">This is good law and no reason has been given to depart <span class="SpellE">there­from</span> in this particular case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now more than ever, it is necessary to define
or state, with the greatest possible precision, the extent to which courts may
go in the interpretation or enforcement of judg­ments and decrees that are
already final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shall we keep on upholding the restrictive
policy above set forth, or should we favor a liberal one, and allow greater
flexibility in the exercise of the <u>ministerial</u> duty to execute said
final judgments or decrees?</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be trite to note that the latter policy tends to encourage
litigations, that one of the pressing needs of the Philippines is the adoption
of measures tending to <u>minimize judicial controversies</u>; that there are
thousands of cases pending in our inferior courts; that any increase in the
number of cases in such courts would neces­sarily connote a corresponding
increase in the number of cases brought to appellate courts, that in view of
the big number of cases now pending in our courts of justice, such cases must
necessarily consume many years before they are finally disposed of; that a fur­ther
increase in the number of court litigations would surely cause greater delays
in the disposition of cases; and that such delays inure principally to the
benefit of unscrupulous litigants, to the detriment of the <u>people</u> and of
their <u>faith in the Rule of Law</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">I suggest that the restrictive policy is the best, from the view­point,
not only of society, but, also, of the individual litigants; that the community
is mainly concerned with public order, the interests of which are better served
by the <u>prompt</u> settlement of justifiable controversies; that so is the
litigant, who needs, more than the col­lectivity, to know what his rights are,
in the simplest terms possible and as soon as it may be feasible; that, at any
rate, most of the issues raised in connection with the execution of final
judgments or decrees involve fine and hair-splitting distinctions, which it is
the bounden duty of the parties to avoid by seasonably filing motions for
reconsideration aimed at securing the necessary clarification; and that said
restrictive policy would compel the parties and their coun­sel to exercise
great care in studying said judgments and decrees <u>before they become final
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span></u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The error of law or injustice that would allegedly result from
holding respondents herein liable for <span class="GramE">damages,</span> is
negated by what has been said in the foregoing pages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted, moreover, that there
would have been no such damages, had respondents not performed illegal acts,
namely, the appropriation of extensive portions of the public domain, including
the territorial waters, and the sale thereof to third persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>They are, accordingly, the ultimate cause
of said damages</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">One other factor should not be overlooked in disposing of the
issues now before the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a
number of years now, certain events or incidents here and there have led to the
belief or feeling that there must have been a good number of certificates of
title illegally issued, covering extensive areas of the public domain, includ­ing,
sometimes, lands previously decreed in favor of parties whose titles are still
subsisting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Heretofore, such belief or
feeling had been seemingly based upon judicial controversies or administrative
investigations involving relatively small parcels of land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Latest developments, however, indicate that
the magnitude of the irregu­larities in connection with the illegal issuance of
transfer certifi­cates of title and the consequent usurpations of portions of
the public domain may have reached considerable, if not alarming, proportions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apart from its adverse effect upon the stability of judicial
decisions and the condition of court dockets in the Philippines, the resolution
of the issues now pending determination before Us has a bearing on the duty of
courts of justice to afford effective relief against irregularities
jeopardizing, not only the efficacy of our Torrens System, but, also, the
defense of our national patrimony, if not of our national security.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question, insofar as the pre­sent case is
concerned, is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shall we exempt the
authors of said irregularities from responsibility for damages, upon proof that
the lands thereby usurped have been conveyed to purchasers for value, who
relied on certificates of title <u>illegally</u> secured by their prede­cessors
in interest?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Would not the grant of such
exemption <u>encour­age</u> said irregularities and <u>foster the <span class="GramE">simulation<span style="text-decoration: none;"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>-</span></span></u> difficult to prove in

<p class="FOOTNOTES"><a style="" href="#_ftnref59" name="_ftn59" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> "We find merit in the contention of the
petitioners <u>much as we sympathize with the plight of respondents</u> for,
while it is true that in the decision in civil case No. 123 the court made a
finding that respondents were <u>entitled to demand the fulfillment of the
contract of sale</u> regarding the portion of the lot containing an area of 137
square meters, such however is <u>not controlling</u> for the purpose of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> but <u>what
appears in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of the decision</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, <u>the only portion of the decision
that be­came the subject of execution is what is ordained or decreed in such <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>Whatever may be found in the body of the decision can only be
considered as part of the reasons or conclu­sions of the court</u> and while
they may serve as <u>guide</u> or enlighten­ment to determine the ratio <span class="SpellE"><u>decidendi</u></span>, <u>what is controlling is what appears in
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of the decision</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in one case it was held that 'The
presumption of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>adjudicata</u></span>
cannot be de­duced from the grounds of the order, but from the <span class="SpellE"><u>fallo</u></span> or from the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of the order, which is the real judgment in the case in litigation.'
(Archbishop of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> <i>vs.</i>
Director of Lands, 35 Phil. 339).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
another case it was also held that, 'In a case decided by the court on appeal,
the true judgment of legal effect is that entered by the clerk of said court
pursuant to the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of its decision.'
(Gutierrez <span class="SpellE">Hermanos</span> <i>vs.</i> De la Riva, 46 Phil.
827).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the reason why the same issue
cannot be litigated again is that, 'Public policy and sound practice demand
that, <u>at the risk of occasional errors</u>, judgments of courts should
become final at some definite date fixed by the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The very ob­ject for which courts were
constituted was to put an end to contro­versies</u>.' x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 9pt; text-indent: 27pt;">"<u>It may
be contended that the court in civil case No. 123 committed a mistake</u> in
dismissing the case outright or in not mak­ing a partial adjudication in favor
of respondents as regards the portion of the lot containing an area of 137
square meters <u>in line with the finding it has made in the body</u> of the
decision, <u>but such error, if any, cannot affect the applicability of the
principle of <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span>
for the same attaches even when the prior decision is erroneous</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it is a well-settled rule that 'a final
judg­ment or order on the merits, rendered by a court having jurisdic­tion of
the subject-matter and of the parties, is conclusive in a subsequent case
between the same parties and their successors in interest litigating upon the
same thing and issue, <u>regardless of how erroneous</u> it may be.' x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 9pt; text-indent: 27pt;">"<u>On the
other hand, the plight of respondents can only be attributed to themselves or
their counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Knowing well that an
omission has been committed by the court, they should have filed a motion for
reconsideration or appealed from its decision in order that the error or
omission may be corrected, but they failed to take either action and instead
allowed the decision to become final</u> and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J.</i>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">I fully concur in the masterly and comprehensive dissent of the
Chief Justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I fear that the majority
resolution, which in effect reviews and overturns the long final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment of this Court in Case G.R. No. L-20950,
May 31, 1965, has so far departed from the well nigh-universal doctrines and
principle as of <u>finality of judgments</u> and <u>law of the case</u>
extensively discussed in the Chief Justice's dis­sent - without specifically
defining the factors and elements that would exempt the case at bar <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> or at least synthesizing <u>why</u> it is an
exception - that I must unburden myself of the following ob­servations:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To begin with, there is no question that the
lower Court's decision affirmed by the Court in Case L-29950, <st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1965</st1:date>, and sought to be
executed in this proceeding has long become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
<u>judgment having been entered since </u><st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="12"><u>December 11, 1965</u></st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon petition filed in this case on May 27, 1966, the Court issued on <u>June
30, 1967</u> its decision herein, directing respondent judge to order the
issuance of a writ of execution for the enforce­ment of the decision affirmed
in Case L-20950.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court in its
Resolution of <st1:date year="1967" day="13" month="9"><u>September 13, 1967</u></st1:date>
denied respondents' Motion for Reconsideration of <st1:date year="1967" day="3" month="8">August 3, 1967</st1:date> "<u>because the points stressed
therein are dependent upon a question settled by a former judgment that is
admittedly final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span></u>."<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon consideration now of respondents' second motion for re­consideration
of September 19, 1967 and supplemental second motion for reconsideration of
September 22, 1967 and other pertinent pleadings subsequently filed by the
parties, the majority resolution would now set aside the decision of <u>June
30, 1967</u> rendered in this case and dismiss the herein petition, by the
simple expedient of holding belated­ly and tenuously that "since the <span class="SpellE">torrens</span> titles of the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>
served to shield them against any stigma of bad faith (in Case L- 20950), the
same legal rule must obtain as respects any imputation of bad faith against the
private respondents herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, there is no reason why the reliance of the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>
upon the indefeasibility of their <span class="SpellE">torrens</span> titles
should vary in its effect from the reliance of Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>
Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span> and/or Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zabel</span>,
or, for that matter, of any other person upon theirs."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court's decision in said Case G.R. No. L-20950 is bereft of
anything that would warrant this imputation or conclusion of the majority reso­lution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, said respondents' titling of
an estimated 2,500 hectares of the public domain, including over 400 hectares
of the beach, foreshore and territorial sea, which was declared null and void
in the decision, negates any such imputation and conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, the Court, citing the
antecedent 1956 case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Dizon</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
found in said Case L-20950 that "In the present case, as the lots covered
by TCT No. T-9550 issued in the names of defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>
(and which were purchased by the latter from defendants Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>, and/or Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>) were <u>found
to be portions of the foreshore or of the territorial waters, the lower court
committed no error in rendering judgment against said defendants and ordering
the reversion of said properties to the public dominion</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">If we were to go by the expressly cited case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Dizon</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span></u>
involving exactly the same <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> (purchasers from
Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>. and/or Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>
and occupants up to now of the <u>illegally titled lots of the public domain
duly leased by the Government to, but wrongfully withheld from, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span></u>) the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> could
not be deemed as "purchasers in good faith." <u>As far back as 1956</u>
when the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> were contesting the Government's
grant of the fishpond permits over the same lots to <span class="SpellE">Tolen­tino</span>
on the ground that they had purchased the same from Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>
which had wrongfully titled the same, the committee named by the Secre­tary of
Agriculture and Natural Resources for the purpose had after due investigation
with notice found that "<u>the land where these fishponds were located was
... part of the public domain</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court had then already put on notice the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>
and herein respondents that their titles derived from Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>. were null and void, since they covered non-alienable
and non-<span class="SpellE">registrable</span> land of the public domain,
thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"But even if they should
succeed in showing that their Torrens certificates of title describe parcels of
land which are comprised within the area of the tract of land known as Hacienda
<span class="SpellE">Cala­tagan</span>, owned by and registered in the name of
Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>., as evi­denced by Torrens transfer
certificate of title No. 722, <u>still if said lots Nos. 1 and 49 of
subdivision plan Psd-27941 are really part of the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>sea, beach, or foreshore, the same can not be
registered under the Registration Act (Act No. 496, as amended) in the name of
anyone, for they are not <span class="SpellE">registrable</span>, are
non-alienable and belong to the public domain to be administered and managed by
the State for the benefit of the people.</u>"<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the April 1965 cases of <span class="SpellE"><u>Dizon</u></span><u>
vs. Rodriguez</u>, G.R. Nos. L-20300-01 and 20355-56, <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1965</st1:date>, likewise expressly cited by the
Court in Case G.R. No. L-20950, "which involved exactly similar
circumstances as the present case except that the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>
were the ones who initiated the judicial action (and failed) to confirm their possession
of the lands therein in question (derived from the illegally secured titles of
herein respon­dents covering navigable waters of <span class="SpellE">Pagaspas</span>
Bay)”<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5-a</span></span></a>
the Court emphasized to the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> and herein
respondents that “it is an elemen­tary principle that the incontestable and
indefeasible character of a Torrens certificate of title does not operate when
the land thus covered is not capable of registration."</p>

<p class="BODY">But since the Court had found in Case L-20950, however erron­eously
and contrary to the cited notice of the nullity of their titles given since
1956 to the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> and herein respondents in <span class="SpellE"><u>Dizon</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span></u>,
that "there (was) no showing that defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
are not purchasers in good faith" and "that as such possessors in
good faith, the defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> cannot also be held
liable for damages allegedly suffered by other parties on account of their
possession of the property", such final find­ing in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> is already beyond revision, modification or
correction even by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">By the same token, and <u>a fortiori</u>, it is respectfully
submitted that the corollary imputation and finding of bad faith correctly made
in the same Case G.R. No. L-20950 against herein respondents as the source of
the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>' void titles - which then sentenced <u>herein
respondents exclusively</u> to pay <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> the
awarded compensatory damages of P3,000.00 yearly per hectare wrongfully
withheld from him - is be­yond revision or modification even by this
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court express­ly confirmed
the lower court's factual findings that "<u>certain areas originally
portions of the navigable water or of the foreshores of the bay were converted
into fishponds or sold by defendant company</u> (herein respondent Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>.) <u>to third persons</u> (the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>,
among them)"<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a>
when it wrongfully expanded by magnetic survey the boundaries of its original
title to Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span> to include these <u>non-alienable
and non-<span class="SpellE">registrable</span> "portions of the foreshore
or of the territorial waters</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It defies logic for respondents to now claim that as the very
source of the void and illegal titles of the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>
to <u>non-<span class="SpellE">registrable</span> lands of the public domain and
portions of the territorial waters</u>, they should be shielded from the
liability for damages attributable to their wrongful act of selling without
right such property to the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>, simply because the
<span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> were held to be shielded from such liability
precisely because they (the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>) had depended
allegedly in good faith on the conveyance to them by respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one, such as respondents, who wrongfully
secures title to patently non-<span class="SpellE">registrable</span> and
non-alienable and clearly visible portions of the public domain, such as the
sea, beach and foreshore, notwithstanding due notice and admonition given by
the government authorities, (<u>supra, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span></u>) can possibly claim to have obtained such
illegal title, or to have disposed of it, in good faith.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority resolution would thus overturn
the final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> decision affirmed in Case
L-20950, notwithstanding the clear and categorical judgment, as set forth in
its <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part, <u>expressly sentencing the
respondents herein to jointly and severally pay petitioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> the compensatory damages therein awarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, it is acknowledged that it is not

has to do, is to issue an order addressed to the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> direct­ing him to cancel the title in question
pursuant to said paragraph of the final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>."
<u>Yet, the majority resolution would sustain even this unjustified refusal of

at bar and deny the peti­tion, notwithstanding the clear ministerial duty on
the part of respondent judge to execute this undisputed portion of the judgment</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">9.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority resolution totally setting aside
the Court's decision <u>at bar</u> of <u>June 30, 1967</u> which merely granted
the original and ancillary petition for mandamus filed with us for the issuance
of a writ of execution of respondent court's basic decision of <u>June 2, 1962</u>,
as affirmed with modification in the Court's decision of <u>May 31, 1965 in
Case G.R. No. L-20950</u>, leaves in shambles the said basic decision which has
been long final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> <u>since entry of our
judgment</u> in said Case G.R. No. L-20950 on <st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="12"><u>December 11, 1965</u></st1:date><u>.<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">As shown above, (<u>supra</u>, paragraph 5), the Court's modifica­tion
of respondent court's basic decision of <u>June 2, 1962</u> reserved the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>' right to retention of the property (Lot 360) until
they are reimbursed of their necessary expenses thereon and excluded them from
the award of damages to <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such modification was made precisely at
respondents' instance and insistence in their ap­pellants' brief in Case G.R.
No. L-20950, where they submitted the <u>alternative</u> prayer, not on their
own behalf, but <u>on behalf of the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span></u>, that
should the lands be held, as actually they were held, to be parts of the
inalienable public domain "that defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>
be declared entitled to <u>reimbursement by Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span></u>
for all their necessary expenses, and <u>that they be allowed to retain the
lots</u><i> </i>in question until they have been <u>fully reimbursed <span class="SpellE">therefor</span></u>." Clearly, in such event, since respondents,
as vendors and source of the lots illegally titled, remained as the parties
liable to pay the damages awarded to <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, the
latter in turn would out of such damages reimburse the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>'
necessary expenses and effect their surrender of the pro­perty.</p>

<p class="BODY">But now with the majority resolution setting aside the foregoing
antecedents of record and exempting respondents Ayala et al. from their final
judgment liability for such damages, there is no longer any one <u>bound</u> to
reimburse the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> for their expenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> to all
intents and purposes may now retain for all time the property, notwithstanding
that in the Court's very decision in said Case G.R. No. L-20950, it expressly
found that the subject lots were "portions of the foreshore or of the
territorial waters" and affirmed respondent court's judgment
"ordering the reversion of said properties to the public dominion."</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">10. The decision at
bar expressly reminded the respondent judge that it was his ministerial duty to
order the issuance of the writ of execution, even if he entertained the doubts
pointed out in his questioned orders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>It
is indisputable doctrine, grounded on public policy and sound practice that
there must be a point of finality to judicial controversies, so that not even
this Court can revise, much less reverse, its final decisions</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In pursuance thereof, the equally
indisputable doctrine has been evolved that the judgment or decree, as
distinguished from the body of the opinion, is set out in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of the decision and pre­vails over the
opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>So once final judgment is
rendered, the lower court is called upon to execute the judgment or decree as
embodied in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of the decision, as
affirmed or modified on appeal by this Court, regardless of any inconsistency between
the decree and the body of the opinion or of any defi­ciency, be they real or
imagined.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, this Court has
always ruled that the lower courts cannot review or interfere with any matter
decided on appeal, or give other or further relief, or assume supervisory
jurisdiction to <u>interpret</u> or reverse the final judgment of the higher
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, the respondent judge did
just this in his Order of <st1:date year="1966" day="2" month="2">February 2,
 1966</st1:date>, stating "that the <u>interpretation</u> of the Supreme
Court's decision cannot be made by a mere mathematical process of <span class="SpellE">substraction</span> (of the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>) but
rather by <u>understanding its rulings which will control in the interpretation
of the decision</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">21</span></span></a> The majority resolution's
sanctioning of this action of respondent judge and upholding of <u>his</u> <u>interpretation</u>
of this Court's decision as correct - instead of enforcing <u>the cardinal
principle that his is the ministerial duty to issue the writ of execution of
the judgment as embodied in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of
the decision and any alleged doubts as to the correct interpretation of this
Court's judgment in the case must be obtained from this Court exclusively by
the party adversely affected thereby - opens the floodgates to endless
litigations and judicial chaos</u>, with the litigants exploiting every little
gap in the decision on appeal, and <u>each judge making his own subjective
interpretation</u> of the same in accordance with his understanding of the
rulings, and reviewing, as respondent judge did, even the motions for
reconsideration filed with this Court in the appealed case and the
pronouncements, or lack thereof, of this Court on the litigants' respective
contentions.</p>

<p class="BODY">I vote, therefore, to maintain the decision at bar and to deny
respondents' second and supplemental second motions for reconsideration.</p>
