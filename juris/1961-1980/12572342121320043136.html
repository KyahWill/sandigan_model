<p>This case was forwarded here by the Court of Appeals as involving questions 
of law exclusively.</p>
<p>Both Romulo de la Merced y Cruz and Jose Almorin were originally charged with 
the crime of serious physical injuries through reckless imprudence in the 
Municipal Court of Quezon City by an information dated 4 June 1957. Jose Almorin 
pleaded guilty, and was sentenced accordingly. Romulo de la Merced y Cruz 
entered a plea of not guilty, and, upon conviction, appealed to the Court of 
First Instance of Quezon City. In the latter court, he was likewise found to 
have driven his bus in a reckless and imprudent manner and sentenced to 2 months 
and 1 day of <i>arresto mayor</i>. No civil liability was awarded the offended 
party as the latter reserved his right to file a separate action. From this 
decision of 21 June 1960 Romulo de la Merced y Cruz appealed to the Court of 
Appeals.</p>
<p>The findings of fact of the trial court were as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"From the evidence submitted by the prosecution, it appears that the accused 
Romulo de la Merced was the driver of a De Dios bus on February 16, 1957; that 
on said date the said bus driven by the said accused was cruising along Quezon 
Boulevard, near the Jusmag Officers' Open Mess, Quezon City, when it bumped a 
Flash Taxicab with plate No. 2981 (QC. 1957); that at the time the De Dios bus 
with plate No. 4508 (Mla. '57) bumped the Flash taxicab, the De Dios bus was 
coming from behind the said taxicab and it bumped the same at the middle portion 
of its body in the portion encircled with blue ink in the sketch marked as 
Exhibit B; that the driver of the Flash Taxicab was then at a stop in front of 
the Jusmag Officers' Mess, as its passenger, Atty. Eliseo Tenza was to attend a 
meeting to be held in the said Open Mess; and that as a result of the said 
accident, the passenger of the taxicab, Atty. Eliseo Tenza, suffered 
"Concussion, cerebral, mild; contusions, multiple, parietal, ocapular region and 
lower thigh, right and shoulder and chest, left" (Exh. A), which incapacitated 
him fop about a month.</p>
<p>The accused only offered in evidence Exhibit 1, wthich is the sentence of the 
Municipal Court as regards the accused Jose Almorin, and rested his case.</p>
<p>In effect, the accused, in resting his case on the basis of the sentence of 
the Municipal Court as regards the accused Jose Almorin, argues that by virtue 
of the plea of guilty of the said accused Jose Almorin, the other accused Romulo 
de la Merced cannot be held responsible for the crime charged. The Court cannot 
sustain this stand of the said accused de la Merced. <i>It should be noted that 
from the evidence for the prosecution, it is obvious that the said accused de la 
Merced, was the one at fault for the accident. The bus driven by him bumped the 
Flash taxi-cab behind. Furthermore, the said taxicab was bumped while it was a 
complete stop. As a matter of fact, the passenger Atty. Tenza was about to 
alight already when the incident happened (pp. 54 and 55 tsn). </i>In the face 
of these facts as already established which the Court cannot ignore, the Court 
cannot sustain the theory of the defendant de la Merced. In this particular 
instance, mention should be made that it seems obvious that the plea of guilty 
of Jose Almorin is tainted with collusion." (Italics supplied) </p></blockquote>
<p>Appellant advances the theory that he may not be convicted of the offense 
charged, or be found to have driven his bus recklessly, after his former 
co-accused in the collision in question had already pleaded guilty, in the 
Municipal Court. Obviously, appellant's contention is untenable.</p>
<p><i>First,</i> there is nothing in the plea of guilty of Jose Almorin which 
would in any manner imply that he is the only one solely answerable for the 
collision, thereby exonerating appellant from any criminal responsibility. On 
the contrary, the information filed alleges clearly that <i>both</i> Almorin and 
de la Merced drove their respective vehicles in such a careless, reckless, fast, 
and imprudent manner, that it resulted in injury to complainant Eliseo Tenza. 
Collisions do happen every day which are caused directly by the gross negligence 
and recklessness of both chauffeurs involved.</p>
<p><i>Second,</i> the appellant alone stood trial before the Court of First 
Instance of Quezon City, and it was entirely <i>de novo</i>, independently of 
the trial had in the municipal court. </p>
<p>And last, to uphold the argument of appellant would leave at the hands of the 
one accused, who elects to plead guilty, the automatic exemption of his 
co-accused from all criminal responsibility. Plainly, this should not be 
allowed.</p>
<p>Finding this appeal to be without merit, the decision of the Court of First 
Instance of Quezon City is hereby affirmed, with costs against appellant.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, 
Paredes, Dizon, Regala</em> and <em>Makalintal, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
