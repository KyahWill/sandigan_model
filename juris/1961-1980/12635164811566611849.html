				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">This is an appeal by the
Iloilo Dock and Engineering Company (hereinafter referred to as the IDECO) from
the decision dated February 28, 1966 of the Workmen's Compensation Commission
(hereinafter referred to as the Commission) affirming the decision of the
Regional Office VII in Iloilo City, and ordering the IDECO to pay to the widow
and children of <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> G. Pablo (<span class="SpellE">Irenea</span>
M. Pablo and the minors Edwin, Edgar and Edna, all surnamed Pablo) the sum of
P4,000, to pay to the widow P89 as reimbursement for burial expenses and P300
as attorney's fees, and to pay to the Commission the amount of P46 as fees
pursuant to section 55 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At about </span><st1:time minute="2" hour="17"><span style="">5:02 o'clock</span></st1:time><span style=""> in the afternoon of </span><st1:date year="1960" day="29" month="1"><span style="">January </span><span style="">29, </span><span style="">1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, Pablo,
who was employed as a mechanic of the IDECO, while walk</span>ing on his way
home, was shot to death in front of, and about 20 meters away from, the main
IDECO gate, on a private road commonly called the IDECO road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The slayer, Martin Cordero, was not heard to
say anything before or after the killing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The motive for the crime was and still is unknown as Cordero was himself
killed before he could be tried for Pablo's death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time of the killing, Pablo's companion
was, Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Galopez</span>, another em<span style="">ployee, who, like Pablo, had finished
overtime work at </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="17"><span style="">5:00 p.m.</span></st1:time><span style="">
and was going home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the main IDECO
gate to the spot where Pablo was killed, there-were four "<span class="SpellE">carinderias</span>" the left side of the road and two "<span class="SpellE">carinderias</span>" and a residential house on the right
side. The entire length of the road is nowhere stated in the record.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">According to the IDECO,
the Commission erred </span>(1) <span style="">in holding
that Pablo's death occurred in the <u>course</u> of employment and in presuming
that it </span><u>arose out </u><span style="">of the
employment; (2) in applying the "proximity rule;" and (3) in holding
that Pablo's death was an </span><u>accident </u><span style="">within the purview of the Workmen's Compensation Act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The principal issue is
whether Pablo's death comes within the meaning and intendment of that
"deceptively simple and litigiously prolific"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> phrase "arising out of and in the

basic concept of compensation coverage is uni­tary, not dual, and is best
expressed in </span>the word, <span style="">"work-connection
because an uncompromising insistence on an independent application or each of
the two portions of the test can, in certain cases, exclude clearly
work-connected injuries.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The words "arising out of" refer

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As a matter of general
proposition, an injury or accident is said to arise "in the course of
employment" when it takes place within </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">period of them
employment, at a place where the employee reasonably may be, and while he ism
fulfilling his duties or is engaged in doing something incidental thereto.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The general rule in
workmen's compensation law known </span>as the "going &amp; coming
rule," simply stated, is that "in the absence of special
circumstances, an employee injured in, going to, or coming from his place of
work is excluded from the benefits of workmen's compensation acts."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
This rule„ however, admits of four well recognized exceptions, to wit: (1)
where the employee is proceeding to or from his work on the premises of his
employer; (2) where the employee is about to enter or about to leave the
premises of his employer by way of the exclusive or customary means of ingress
and egress; (3) where the employee is charged, while on his way to or from his
place of employment or at his home, or during his employment, with some duty or
special errand connected with his employment; and (4) where the employer, as an
incident of the employment, provides the means of transportation to and from
the place of employment.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We address ourselves
particularly to an examination and consideration of the second exception, i.e.,
injuries sustained off the premises of the employer, but while using a
customary means of ingress and egress.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This exception, known as the "proximity rule," was
applied in <u>Philippine Fiber Processing Co., Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Ampil</span></u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
There, the employee, at about 5:15 a.m., while proceeding to his place of work
and running to avoid the rain, slipped and fell into a ditch fronting the main
gate of the employer's factory, as a result of which he died the next day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sole question was whether or not the acci­dent
which caused the employee's death arose out of and in the course of his
employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court ruled in favor of
the claimant, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The very case of <span class="SpellE">Afable</span> vs. Singer
Sewing Machine Co. invoked by the petitioner intimated that we do not of course
mean to imply that an employee can never recover for injuries suffered while on
his way to or from work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That depends on
the nature of his, employment.' Considering the facts found by the Commission,
namely, that the deceased Angel was not under any shift routine; that his
assignment covered the entire working hours of the factory; that the first
working hour starts at 6:00 o'clock in the morning; that it takes at least
thirty minutes before the machine operates at full Speed or load; that the spot
where he fell (ditch fronting petitioner's factory or sidewalk of its
premises), is immediately proximate this place of work, the accident in
question must be deemed to have occurred within the zone of his employment and
therefore arose out of and in the course thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Sailing vs. Insular Lumber Co., G.R. No.
28951, September 10, 1928, referred to in the Comments on the Workmen's
Compensation Commission Act by <span class="SpellE">Morabe</span> and <span class="SpellE">Inton</span>, 1955 edition, compensation was allowed for injury
received by a laborer from an accident in going to his place of work, along a
path or way owned by his employer aril commonly used by the latter's
laborers."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In contrast is <span class="SpellE"><u>Pampanga</u></span><u> Sugar Development Co., Inc. vs. Quiroz</u>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> which concerned injuries sustained by a
centrifugal ope­rator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had reported
for work at </span><st1:time minute="30" hour="21"><span style="">9:30 p.m.</span></st1:time><span style=""> (</span><st1:date year="1958" day="7" month="3"><span style="">March 7,
 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">) and was
dismissed at </span><st1:time minute="30" hour="17"><span style="">5:30</span></st1:time><span style=""> the
following morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon "after he
stepped out of the company gate, and while standing about 2 1/2 meters from it
between the shoulder of the highway and a railroad that came from inside the
compound and intersected the highway, wait­ing for <span style="">a </span>ride home, he was bumped by a <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>,
as a result of which he sustained" injuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In holding that these injuries were "not
produced by an accident 'arising out of and in the course of employment,'"
this Court reasoned thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The compensability of an injury suffered by an employee
proceeding to or coming from his work depends upon whether or not it is 'work
connected.' As Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Kenison</span> of <st1:state><st1:place>New
  Hamp­shire</st1:place></st1:state> has put it, 'the fact that the employee is
<span class="SpellE">travelling</span> to or from work on a public highway does
not necessarily exclude coverage (<span class="SpellE">Brousseau</span> vs.
Blackstone Mills, 130 A 2d 543, 545).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Conversely, it is not enough to say, that the employee would not have
been on the public highway had it not been for his job, since the same can
usually be said of the general public (Payne &amp; Dolan vs. Industrial
Commission, 46 NE 2d 925).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law, in
effect, insures the employee against losses: arising <u>from the perils of his
work.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the Workmen's
Com­pensation Act covers occupational injuries, which, as such, must have a <u>causative
connection</u> with something, not merely <u>in common</u> with the public, but
peculiar to the employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order to
warrant recovery for off-the-premises injuries, it must be shown that there has
been a very special danger, some particular risk which <u><span style="">the employer </span>could have caused or
allowed to exist</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence,</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'It is significant that practically <u>all</u> successful
off-the-premises cases have involved <u>normal route of access to the plant</u>,
or an icy sidewalk adjacent to the premises and therefore <u><span style="">identified with the premises </span>in the
sense that the employer should have removed the ice</u>.' (Underscoring ours.)</p>

<blockquote>"It is true that in Philippine Fiber Processing Co. v. <span class="SpellE">Ampil</span>, G.R. No. L-8130 (June 30, 1956), We held the
employer liable for an injury sustained by an employee who, as he was <u>running
to his place of work to avoid the rain</u>, slipped <u>and fell into a ditch in
front of the factory's</u> main gate and near the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The ditch was</u>, <u>however</u>, <u>in
itself an obvious hazard</u> which, owing to its proximity to the gate, the
employer should have taken measures to remove.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, thru his inaction, he had, contributed, in a special way, to the
occurrence of the accident.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the case at bar, no such special circumstance appears to
exist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no <u>particular</u>
causative connection between the injury sustained by the employee and either his
work or his employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Al­though, as
stated in the decision appealed from, the record does not show that the company
'had taken measures to make the waiting place safe for the employees, neither
does the record show either that the accident occurred at the usual waiting
place of the employees, or that said place was <u>particularly</u>
unsafe."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Our Workmen's
Compensation Act being essentially American in origin and text, it is not amiss
to pay deference to pertinent American jurisprudence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the precise area of law here involved, we
can draw guidance from an affluence of Federal and State precedents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From Samuel B. <span class="SpellE">Horovitz</span>' <u>Injury and Death under Workmen's Compensation
Laws</u> (1944), pp. 159 to 165, we glean the fol­lowing observations:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Suppose, however, that the injury occurs <u>on the way to
work or on the way home from work</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Injuries going to or from work have caused many judicial upheavals.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The question here is limited to whether the injuries are 'in
the course of’ and not 'out of’ the employment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>How the injury occurred is not in point.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Street risks, whether the employee was walking or driving, and all other
similar questions deal with the risk of injury or 'out of’ the employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'In the course of’ deals mainly with the
element of time and space, or 'time, place and circumstances.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thus, if the injury occurred fifteen minutes before working
hours and within one hundred feet of the employer's premises, on sidewalks or
public roads, the question of 'in the course of’ the employ­ment is flatly
raised.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Some of our states refuse to extend this definition of 'in
the course of to include these 'injuries.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Most of the states will protect the employee from the, moment his foot
or person reaches the <u>employer's premises,</u> whether he arrives early or
late.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These states find 'something
sacred about the employment premises and define 'premises' very broadly, <u>not
only to include premises owned by the employer</u>, <u>but</u><u><span style=""> also premises leased</span></u><span style="">, <u>hired</u>, <u>supplied or used by him</u>,
<u>even private alleyways merely used by the employer</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Adjacent privat</u></span><u>e</u><u><span style=""> premises are protect</span>ed</u><u><span style=""> many states</span></u><span style="">, <u>and a few protect the employee even on
adjacent public sidewalks</u> <u>and</u> <u>streets</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where a city or any employer owns or controls
an island, all its streets are protected premises.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is no reason in principle why states should not protect
employees for a <u>reasonable pe­riod of time prior to or after working hours</u>
and for a <u>reasonable distance</u> before reaching or after leaving the
employer's premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
has declared that if will not overturn any state decision that so enlarges the
scope of its act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, a deaf worker,
trespassing on rail-road 'tracks adjacent to his employer's brick-making
premises (but shown by his superintendent the specific short crossing over the
track), and killed by a <span style="">train, was held
to be in the course of his employment when hit by an on-corning train fifteen
minutes before his day would have begun.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So long as a causal relation to the employment is discernible, no
federal question arises.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The narrow rule that a worker is not in the course of his
employment until he crosses the em­ployment threshold is itself subject to many
<u>exceptions</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Off-premises injuries
<u>to or from work</u>, in <span style="">both liberal
and narrow states, are compensable (1) if the employee is on the way to or from
work in a vehicle owned or supplied by the employer, whether </span><span style="">in a </span><span style="">public (e.g., the employer’s street car) or private conveyance; (2) if
the employee is subject to call at all house or at the moment of injury; (3) if
the employee is traveling for the employer, i.e. traveling workers; (4) if the
employer </span><span style="">pays </span><span style="">for the employee's time from the moment he
leaves his home to </span><span style="">his </span><span style="">return home; (5) if the employee is on his
way to do further work at home, even though on a fixed salary; (6) where the
employee is required to bring his automobile to his place of business for use
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Other exceptions undoubtedly
are equally justified</u>, <u>dependent on their own peculiar circumstances.</u>"<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Schneider <u>(supra,</u>
at p. 117) makes this significant statement:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The proximity rule exception to the general going and coming
rule is that an employee is gene­rally considered to be in the course of his
employment while coming to or going from his work, <u>when</u>, <u>through off
the actual premises of his employer</u>, <u>he is still in close proximity
thereto</u>, <u>is proceeding diligently at an appropriate time</u>, <u>by
reasonable means</u>, <u>over the natural</u>, <u>practical</u>, <u>customary</u>,
<u>convenient and</u> <u>recognized way of ingress</u>, <u>or egress</u>, <u>either
on land under the control of the employer</u>, <u>or on adjacent property</u> <u>with
the express or implied consent of the employer</u>."<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On pp. 98 to 99 of 85 ALR
we find the following disquisi­</span><span style="">tion:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"The compensation acts
have been very gene</span>rally held not to authorize an award in case of an injury
or death from a peril which is common to all mankind, or to which the public at
large is ex­posed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">28 </span>R.C.L. 804.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And they do not as a general rule cover
injuries received while going to or from so work on public streets, where the
employee has not reached, or has left the employer's premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question whether an injury arises out of
and in the course of the employment, however, is one depending upon the facts
of each case, and in some cases, where an injury occurred while the employee
was going to or from work, but was in the street-in front of the employer's
premises, it has been held compensable.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thus, in the reported case (BARNETT V BRTILING <span style="">CAFETERIA </span>CO., ante, 85) the inju<span style="">ry was held to have arisen out of and </span>in
the course of the employment, where the employee slipped on ice on the sidewalk
immediately in front of the employer's place of business, while on her way to
re­port for duty, and just before entering by the only entrance to her place of
employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court here recognized the
general rule that, if an emplo­yee is injured while going to or from his work
to his house, or to or froth some point not visited for the discharge of a duty
arising out of the employment, or while in the use of a public highway, he does
not come within the protection of the Workmen's Compensation Act, but stated
that there is an exception to this rule and <u>that the employment is not
limited by the actual time when the workman reaches the scene of his labor and
begins it</u>, <u>or when he ceases</u>, <u>but includes a reasonable time and
opportunity before and after</u>, <u>while he is at or near his place of
employment</u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The court reasoned that in the case at
bar, <u>although the employee had </u><u><span style="">not
entered the employer’s </span></u><u><span style="">place of business</span></u><span style="">, </span><u><span style="">and the sidewalk was a public highway so much therefore as was in front
of the employer’s place of business was a necessary adjunct</span></u><span style="">, <u>used in connection with the business</u>,
<u>and that the sidewalk was to a limited degree and purpose a part of the
employer’s premises</u>.</span><u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In Industrial Commission v Barber (1927) 117 Ohio St 373, 159
NE 363, the injury was held to have arisen in the course of the employment
where an employee, about five minutes before the hour when he was to go on
duty, was struck by an automobile owned and driven by another employee, within
a short distance from the employer's plant, which was located at the dead end
of <u>a street maintained </u><u><span style="">by the
employer from its plant the intersection with another street</span></u><span style="">, <u>and</u>, <u>although the street was a
public one</u>, <u>it led nowhere except </u></span><u>player's plant</u>, <u>and
all of its employees were obliged to use it in going to and from their work.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court stated that where the conditions
under the control of an industrial plant are such that the employee has no
option but to pursue a given course with reference to such conditions and
environments, the pursuance of such course is an implied obligation of the
employer in his contract with such employee, and that when he, for the purpose
of entering his employment, has entered into the sphere or zone controlled by
his employer and is pursuing a course with reference<span style=""> to which he has no option, he is then not only within the conditions
and environments of the plant of his employer, but is then in the course of <span style="">his </span>employment; and that, when he
receives an injury attributable to such conditions and environments, there is a
direct causal connection between his em­ployment and his injury, and the injury
falls within the class of industrial injuries for which compensation has been
provided by the Workmen's Compensation Law."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>99 C. J. S. at pp. 807-814, has this to
say:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is laid down as a general rule, known as the 'going and
coming rule, that, in the absence of special circumstances, and except in
certain unusual circumstances, and where nothing else appears, harm or injury
sustained by an employee while going to or from his work is not compensable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such injury, or accident, is regarded by the
weight of authority of many courts as not arising out of his employment, and as
not being, or not <span style="">oc</span>curring, in
the course thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"However, this rule is not inflexible, is not of inevitable
application, and is subject to qualifications, and to exceptions which depend
on the <span style="">na</span><span style="">ture, circumstances, and conditions of the particular employment, the
circumstances of the particular case, and the cause of the injury."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

rationale for extending the scope of "course of employment" to
certain "off-premises" injuries:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"We are urged here to again recognize and apply the distinction
between off-premises injuries which occur on private property and those which
occur on public streets and highways.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The extension of the course of employment to off-premises injuries is
not based upon the principle which would justify a distinction upon the narrow
ground of private and public property; it is not sound to say that <span style="">while an employee is on a public highway he
is always there as a member of the public and in nowise in the exercise of any
right conferred by his contract of employment; nor is it a complete answer to
say that while he is on his employer's premises his presence there is by
contract right, otherwise he would be a trespasser.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question of whether or not one is a
covered employee should not be resolved by the application </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the law relating to rights to enter upon lands, or by the law of
trespass, licensee, invitee or otherwise.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"A substantial and fair ground to justify the extension of the
course of employment beyond the premises of the employer is to extend its scope
to the necessary risks and hazards associated with the employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These risks may or may not be on the premises
of the employer and for this reason there is no justification to distinguish
between extended risks on public highways and private pathways.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact it is at most a distinction without a
difference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the better reasoned
cases the technical status as public or private is obviously of no moment or in
any event in and of itself is not conclusive."</blockquote>

(1) Once it is proved that the employee died <u>in the course</u> of the

risk of assault on the person of the employee and it is </span><span style="">in that </span><span style="">sense that an injury or harm, sustained by
the assaulted worker arises out of the employment, because the increased risk
to assault supplies the link or connection between the injury and the
employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among the jobs enumerated as
increasing the risk </span>of assault are (a) jobs having to do with keeping
the peace or guarding property; (b) jobs having to do with keeping or carrying
of money which subject the employee to the risk of assault because of the
increased temptation to robbery; (c) jobs which expose the employee to direct

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In <u>Rivera</u>, <u>supra</u>,
the unexplained assault on the employee was considered to have <u>arisen</u>
out of the employment because it occurred in the <u>course</u> of
employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court relied on the

According to this Court, "this statutory presumption was copied from <st1:state><st1:place>New

a statutory presumption in <span style="">coverage has

<p class="2Q">'In any claim for compensation, where the employee has been killed,
or is physically or mentally unable to testify, it shall be presumed, in the
absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, that the claim comes within
the provisions of this chapter, that sufficient notice of the injury has been
given, and that the injury or death was not occasioned by the <span class="SpellE">wilful</span> intention of the employee to injure or kill himself
or another.'</p>

<blockquote>"This provision was largely copied from the <st1:state><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:state> section on presumptions, except that the <st1:state><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:state> act creates the presumption in all cases, not
merely those involving an employee's death or inability to testify.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The sweeping inclusiveness of this lan­guage might seem at
first glance to mean that the mere making of a claim is also the making of a
prima facie case, as long as death or injury is shown to have occurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <st1:state><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:state>
and <st1:state><st1:place>Massa<span style="">chusetts</span></st1:place></st1:state><span style=""> courts have not so interpreted these sta­tutes,
however.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seems </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">be necessary to esta­blish some kind of preliminary link with the
employ­ment before the presumption can attach.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise the claimant widow would have merely to say, 'My husband, who
was one of your employee, has died, and I therefore claim death benefits,'
whereupon the affirmative burden would devolve upon the em­ployer to prove that
there was no connection between the death and the </span><span style="">environment.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is not yet entirely clear what initial demonstration of
employment-connection will give the presumption a foothold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, the idea is to rule out cases in
which claimant can show neither, that the injury occurred in the course of
employment nor that it arose out of it, as where he contracted a disease but
has no evidence to show where he got it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">If there is evidence that the
injury occurred in the course of employment, the presumption will usually

the accident will give rise to the statutory presumption only where some connec­tion
appears between the accident and the employment.'"<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Likewise of relevance is
the following treatise:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The discussion of the coverage formula, "arising out of and
in the course of employment,' was opened with the suggestion that, while
'course' and 'arising' were put under separate headings for convenience, some
interplay between the two factors should <span style="">be
</span>observed <span style="">in </span>the various categories discussed.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"A </span>few examples
may now be reviewed to show that the two tests, in practice, have not been kept
<span style="">in </span>air-tight compartments, but
have to some extent merged into a single concept of work-connec<span style="">tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">One is </span><span style="">almost tempted to formulate a sort of quantum theory of work-connection
</span><span style="">must </span><span style="">be shown, and if the 'course' quantity is </span><span style="">very </span><span style="">small, but the 'arising' quantity is large,
the quantum will add up to the necessary minimum, as it will also when the
'arising' quantity is <span style="">very </span>small
but the, 'course' quantity is relatively large.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"But if both the 'course' and 'arising' quantities are small,
the minimum quantum will not be met.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“As an example of the first, a strong 'aris­ing' factor but weak
'course' factor, one may cite <span style="">the cases
in </span>which recoveries have been allowed off the employment premises,
outside business hours, when an employee going to or coming from work is<span style=""> </span>injured by a hazard distinctly
traceable to the employment, such as a traffic jam overflowing from the
employment premises, or a rock flying through the air from a blast on the
premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, by normal course of
employment standards, there would be no award, since the employee was not on
the 'premises while coming or going.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet
the <u>unmistakable character </u>of the causal relation of the injury to the
employment has been sufficient to make up for the weakness of the 'course'
factor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another example of the same kind
of balancing-out is seen in the line of cases dealing with injury to traveling
men or loggers while sleeping in hotels or bunk-houses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was shown in the analysis of these cases
that, although the 'course' factor is on the borderline when the employee is
sound asleep at the time <span style="">of injury, a
strong causal relation </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the injury to the conditions of employment -
as where a fellow-logger runs amok, or a straw falls into the bunk-
house-inmate's throat from the mattress above, or the employee is trapped in a
burning hotel - will boost the case over the line to success; while a weak
causal connection, as where the salesman merely slips in a hotel bath, coupled
with a weak 'course' factor due to the absence of any direct service performed
for the employer at the time, will under present decisions add up to a quantum
of work-connection too small to support an award.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was also shown that when the 'course' element
is strengthened by the fact that the employee is at all times on call, the
range of compensable sources of injury is broader than when the employee, although
living on the premises is not on call.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"A somewhat similar balancing-out process is seen in the
holding that a borderline course-of-employment activity like seeking personal
comfort or going to and from work falls short of compen­sability if the method
adopted is unusual, unreasonable and dangerous, while no such restriction ap­plies
to the direct performance of the work.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As an example of the reverse situation, a strong 'course'
element and a weak 'arising' element, one may recall the 'positional' cases
discussed in section 10, as well as the unexplained-fall and other
'neutral-cause' cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here the course
of employment test is satisfied beyond the slightest doubt: the employee is in
the midst of performing the active duties of his job.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the causal connection is very weak, since
the source of the injury - whether a stray bullet, a wandering lunatic, an
unexplained fall or death, or a mistaken assault by a stranger is not
distinctly associated with employment con<span style="">ditions
as such, and is tied to the employment only by the argument that the injury
would not have occurred to this employee but for the obligation of the
employment which placed him in the position to be hurt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, since the 'course' element is so strong,
awards are becoming increasingly common on these </span>facts.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Incidentally, it may be observed that this 'quantum' idea
forms a useful yardstick for measuring just how generous a court has become in
expanding compensation coverage; for if a court makes an award when a case, by
the above standards, is weak both on course of employment and on causal
connection, one can conclude that the court is capable of giving the act a
broad construction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, an award was
made in Puffin v. General Electric, where the course element was weak (rest
period) and the causal element was weak (setting fire to own sweater while
smoking).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both factors were likewise
very weak in O'Leary v, Brown Pacific-<span class="SpellE">Maxon</span> Inc.,
where the course of employment consisted of a recreation period interrupted by
a rescue of a stranger, and the arising factor consisted of drowning in a
channel where decedent was prohibited from going.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, in Martin v. <span class="SpellE">Plaut</span>,
the course of employment factor was weak (a cook dressing <span style="">in </span>the morning) and the causal factor
was also weak (an unexplained fall); yet an award was made in <st1:state><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:state>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"But another <st1:state><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:state>
case shows that the simultaneous weakness of course and arising factors may
reach the point where the requisite quantum is not found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Shultz v. Nation Associates, compensation
was denied to an employee who while <span style="">combing
her hair preparatory to going to lunch negligently struck her eye with the
comb.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here we see thinness on all
fronts: as to course of employment time factor, we have a lunch period; as to
the course of employment activity factor, we have care of personal appearance;
and as to the causal factor, we have negligence of the employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each weakness standing alone -- lunch period,
care of appearance, negligence -- would not be fatal; there are many awards in
which one or another of these is present.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But when all are present, while an award is not impossible and could be
defended on a point </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">point basis, it can not be relied upon in
most juris­dictions by the prudent lawyer." Larson's <u>Work</u></span><u>men's

whether the accident is work-connected.</p>

is presumed to come within the provisions <span style="">of

case at bar, having in mind always that no cover-all formula can be spelled out
with specificity, that the particular facts and circumstances of each case must
be inquired into, and </span><span style="">that in</span>
<span style="">any perceptive inquiry, the question as
to where the line should be drawn beyond which the liability of the employer
cannot continue has been held to be usually one of fact.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We shall first dwell on
the question of ownership of the private road where Pablo was killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In granting compensation, the Commission said
that "the road where the deceased was shot was of private ownership, was
called the IDECO road, and led straight to the main IDECO gate, </span><span style="">thus </span><span style="">raising the reasonable assumption that it belonged" to the
IDECO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission reasoned out that
"even if the ownership of the road were open to ques­tion, there was no
doubt that its private character was obviously exploited by the respondent for
the purpose of its own business to such an extent as to make it to all intents
and purposes an exten­sion of its premises," so that "the shooting </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">the deceased may be considered to have taken place on the premises, and
therefore within the employment;" and that "while respondent allowed
its name to be used in connection, with the private road for the ingress and
egress </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">the employees it did not apparently take the
necessary precaution to make it safe for its employees by employing security
guard."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But the IDECO denies
ownership of the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its memorandum
filed with the Regional Office, IDECO averred that Pablo's death did not
originate from </span><span style="">his work </span><span style="">as to time, place and circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, in effect, is a denial of ownership of
the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the Regional
Office does not state that the road belongs to the IDECO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that it says is that Pablo was shot
"barely two minutes after he was dismissed from work and while walking
along the IDECO road about twenty (20) meters from the gate." In its
"motion for reconsideration and/or review," the IDECO emphasized that
"the place where the incident happened was a public road, not less than
(20) meters away from the main gate of the compound, and therefore not
proximate to or in the immediate vicinity of the place of work." Again,
the ownership </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the road was implicitly denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in its "motion for reconsideration
and/ or appeal to the Commission en banc," the IDECO alleged outright that
the "road where the incident took place, although of private ownership,
does not belong to IDECO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But while the IDECO does
not own the private road, it can­not be denied that it was using the same as
the principal means of ingress and egress.<span style="">&nbsp;

or a contractual one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In either case the
IDECO should logically and properly be charged with security control of the
road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The IDECO owed its employees a
safe passage to its premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
compliance with such duty, the IDECO should have seen</span> it not only that
the road was properly paved and did not have holes or ditches, but should also
have instituted measures for the proper policing of the immediate area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The point where Pa­blo was shot <span style="">was </span>barely twenty meters away from the

</span>Considering this fact, and the further facts that Pablo had just

dismissal from work, the <span class="SpellE"><u>Ampil</u></span><u> </u>case is
squarely applicable here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We may say, as
we did in <span class="SpellE"><u>Ampil</u></span>, that the place where the
employee was injured being "immediately proximate to his place of work,
the accident in question must be deemed to have occurred within the zone of his
employment and therefore arose out of and in the course thereof." Our
principal question is whether the injury was <span style="">sustained in </span>the <u>course</u> of employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find that it was and so conclude that the
assault arose out of the employment, even though the said assault is
