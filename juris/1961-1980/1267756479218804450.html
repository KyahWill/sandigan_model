<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><u><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Statement</span></u><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> - This is an appeal from the 
decision of the Court of Tax Appeals denying the refund of income taxes imposed 
on, and paid by, Jose Leon Gonzales and Juana F. Gonzales.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><u><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Facts</span></u><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.-Jose Leon Gonzales and Juana F. 
Gonzales are brother and sister / the latter being married to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> de Leon <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style11"><sup>[1]</sup></span>/. Both petitioners are co-heirs and 
co-owners, (one-sixth each) of a tract of land of 871,982 square meters' which 
they, along with four other co-heirs, inherited from their 
mother.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This realty, locked at 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Caloocan</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, was the object of expropriation proceedings, which 
this Court finally decided in May 1954, in G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-4918.</span> Therein we fixed the just compensation for the 
property at P1.50 per square meter. We also ordered the payment of interest at 
the legal rate of 6% from </span><st1:date month="1" day="25" year="1947"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 25, 
1947</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
(when the Government took possession of the property) to the date of payment, 
which payment was actually made on </span><st1:date month="10" day="31" year="1954"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 31, 
1954</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
Excluded from the payment of interest the sum of P28<span class="GramE">,850.00</span>, the amount deposited by the Government upon taking 
possession of the estate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The total compensation paid the 
six heirs for the expropriated properly amounted to P1<span class="GramE">,307,973.00</span>. Subtracting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> 
the amount of P28.850.00 just mentioned, there remained a difference of P1<span class="GramE">,279,123.00</span>, the interest on which, at the legal rate of 6% 
per annum, <span class="SpellE">totalled</span> P535,587.70. Divided among the six 
heirs, this total gave a share of P89<span class="GramE">,305.61</span> as 
interest to each of them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Upon the amounts received from 
the Government, Jose Leon Gonzales and Juana F. Gonzales, were each ascertained 
to have made a capital gain of P213,328.82 [P1,279,973,00 <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style11"><sup>[2]</sup></span> divided by 6 heirs]; and each of them to 
have received the amount of P89,309.61 as share in the interests of P535.857.70 
(this sum is divided by 6). A tentative return for 1954 was thus prepared and 
filed for each of the two petitioners describing the amount of P213,328.82 as 
capital gain, and in addition, the amount of P89,309.61 as ordinary income. On 
the basis of such income, each of the petitioners was assessed P86<span class="GramE">,166.00</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Government paid to 
petitioners the proceeds of the expropriation award and interest through the 
People's <span class="SpellE">Homesite</span> and Housing Corporation sometime in 
October 1954 the last check having been delivered on </span><st1:date month="11" day="4" year="1954"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 4, 
1954</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
However, the sum of P532<span class="GramE">,234.70</span> was retained by the 
Housing Corporation; and on </span><st1:date month="11" day="18" year="1954"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 18, 
1954</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, at 
the request of respondent Collector, it turned over to the Bureau of Internal 
Revenue the amount of P516,007.00 representing income taxes reportedly due and 
owing from the six co-heirs of the estate. Therefore, petitioners Jose Leon 
Gonzales and his sister Juana F. Gonzales were each credited income tax. <span class="GramE">(Official Receipts Nos. 520491 and 520496 dated November 19, 
1954.)</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="2" day="29" year="1956"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 29, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
petitioner Juana F. Gonzales wrote the respondent Collector a letter, seeking 
the refund of P24<span class="GramE">,426.00</span> allegedly representing excess 
payment of income taxes for 1954. The letter pertinently 
stated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"We respectfully contend that the 
assessment was erroneous in that the amount of P80.309.61 representing <span class="GramE">interest,</span> was considered as ordinary income and not merely 
capital gain. If the interest was computed as capital gain, there shall be due 
and owing from your office the amount of P24<span class="GramE">,426.00</span> 
assuming for argument's sake that your assessment was 
correct."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: right;" align="right"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> H &amp; 2, also par. 22, '<span class="SpellE">Stifacts</span>')<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="11" day="5" year="1956"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 5, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
petitioner Jose Leon Gonzales also wrote a letter to said respondent requesting 
refund of a similar amount of P24<span class="GramE">,426.00</span> for the same 
reasons as his co-petitioner. No action appears to have been taken on this 
refund claim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="11" day="12" year="1956"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 12, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
respondent Collector denied the request of Juana F. Gonzales for refund of 
P24<span class="GramE">,426.00</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><u><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Suits</span></u><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.-</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> So on November 15, 1956, Jose 
Leon Gonzales and Juana F. Gonzales submitted to the Court of Tax Appeals a 
joint petition seeking a refund, <u>this time</u> of the amount of P86,166.00 
for each of the two petitioners; but the next day, both petitioners amended 
their petition by filing separate petitions which were docketed separately as 
CTA Case No. 328 and CTA Case No. 329.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It appears that on 
</span><st1:date month="11" day="24" year="1956"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 24, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> de Leon wrote the respondent Collector 
the following letter:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Sir:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is to acknowledge receipt 
today of your letter of </span><st1:date month="11" day="12" year="1956"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 12, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
denying the claim of Mrs. Juana F. Gonzales de Leon for refund, to which we take 
exception.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We are not only claiming the 
refund of P24,426.00 but the entire amount of P86,166.00 for various reasons 
more specifically contained in our petition before the Court of Tax Appeals on 
November 16 1956, Case No. 328. We had to file the petition because we believe 
our claim is meritorious and that the prescriptive period may run 
out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">For all legal purposes we shall 
consider your letter herein referred to as denial of the claim for refund of the 
total amount of P86<span class="GramE">,166.00</span>. And the difference in 
amount may be considered for all purposes as variance 
only."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Respondent Collector, however, 
disclaims receipt of this second written claim for refund.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="12" day="5" year="1956"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 5, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
respondent Collector contested the amended petitions. Trial ensued, and in the 
course thereof the parties signed a "Partial Stipulation of 
Facts."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><u><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Decision</span></u><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> - On </span><st1:date month="7" day="16" year="1958"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 
16, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
a decision was rendered by the Court of Tax Appeals denying petitioners' claim 
for refund, with costs against them. Their <span class="GramE">motion for 
reconsideration and new trial having been denied, petitioners perfected this 
appeal and now pray</span> for reversal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><u><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Issue</span></u><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> - A careful perusal of the 
debated issues will show that the resolution of this appeal hinges decisively on 
two propositions:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(1) Whether or not petitioner's 
claim for refund of the total of P86<span class="GramE">,166.00</span> may be 
properly entertained; and<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(2) Whether or not the sum of 
P89<span class="GramE">,309.61</span> which each of the petitioners received as 
interest on the value of the land expropriated is taxable as ordinary income, 
and not as capital gain.<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><u><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Discussion</span></u><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> - The record shows that on 
</span><st1:date month="11" day="18" year="1954"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 18, 
1954</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, at 
the request of respondent Collector, the People's <span class="SpellE">Homesite</span> and Housing Corporation turned over to the Bureau 
of Internal Revenue the sum of P516.007.00 representing income taxes due from 
the six co-owners of the expropriated property. Of this amount, the two 
appellants Gonzales were each credited with the amount of P86<span class="GramE">,166.00</span> as income taxes for 1954. (The receipts evidencing 
such payments are O. R. No. 520491, dated November 19, 1954 for P86,166.00 for 
Jose Leon Gonzales and O. R. No. 520496 dated November 19, 1954 for Juana F. 
Gonzales.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It likewise appears that 
appellant Juana F. Gonzales in letter of </span><st1:date month="2" day="29" year="1956"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 29, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
requested for the refund <u>P24<span class="GramE">,426.00</span></u> (only), 
citing as sole ground <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> that amount of 
P89,309.61 which was her share in the interests paid on the expropriated 
property was taxed by respondent Collector <u>as ordinary income</u>. She 
contended that it should have been taxed <u>as capital gain</u>. Appellant Jose 
de Leon Gonzales on his part, in his letter of </span><st1:date month="11" day="5" year="1956"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 5, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
requested the refund of a similar amount of P24<span class="GramE">,426.00</span> 
(only).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Then a joint petition was filed 
by both parties before the Court of Tax Appeals first on </span><st1:date month="11" day="15" year="1956"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 15, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">; but 
the next day, </span><st1:date month="11" day="16" year="1956"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 16, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
they filed separate petitions containing similar 
allegations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It would appear, therefore, that 
from </span><st1:date month="11" day="19" year="1954"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 19, 
1954</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
when the payments for income taxes were received from the appellants to 
</span><st1:date month="2" day="29" year="1956"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 29, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
when appellant Juana Gonzales filed her claim for refund and to </span><st1:date month="11" day="5" year="1956"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 5, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, and 
appellant Jose Leon Gonzales filed his own refund claim, <span class="GramE">less</span> than two years had elapsed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">But, since their respective 
claims for refund were restricted to the amount of P24<span class="GramE">,426.00</span> only, it should be clear that their demand for the 
return of an amount in excess thereof (P86,166.00) is not 
included.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Remarkably, the so-called claim 
for refund of the amount of P86<span class="GramE">,166.00</span> <u>was made only 
on </u></span><st1:date month="11" day="24" year="1956"><u><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 24, 
1956</span></u></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
(after the complaints had been filed) without giving the Collector "an 
opportunity to consider his mistake, if mistake has been committed." (<span class="SpellE">Kiener</span> Co. vs. David, 92 Phil. 945) And it refers 
specifically and exclusively to appellant Juana F. Gonzales' <span class="GramE">claim</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "J"). Appellant Jose 
Leon Gonzales seems not to have filed any refund claim for a similar 
amount.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Be that as it may, this later 
claim for refund for P86<span class="GramE">,166.00</span> made on 
</span><st1:date month="11" day="24" year="1956"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 24, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, by 
appellant Juana F. Gonzales has been definitely filed beyond the statutory 
period of two years from the date of payment, which was </span><st1:date month="11" day="19" year="1954"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 19, 
1954</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">A stringent requirement of the 
Tax Code is that before a suit or proceeding for the refund of any internal 
revenue tax can be maintained in any court, a written claim for its refund shall 
be filed with the Collector of Internal Revenue before <u>filing the action in 
court</u> and <u>before the expiration of two years from the date of payment</u> 
of the taxes to be refunded.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style11"><sup>[3]</sup></span> This 
requirement is mandatory and failure to comply therewith is fatal to the 
action.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style11"><sup>[4]</sup></span> What is more, the claim for 
refund should set forth in detail the facts and the grounds upon which it is 
based, so as to apprise the Collector accordingly.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style11"><sup>[5]</sup></span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellants maintain that it was 
not they who had paid the tax of P86<span class="GramE">,166.00</span> imposed 
upon each of them, but that it was respondent Collector himself who paid those 
taxes and issued receipts <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> without their 
knowledge and consent. And that even if the receipts of payment were in fact 
sent by the respondent Collector to the People's <span class="SpellE">Homesite</span> and Housing Corporation and were received by the 
latter on November 23, 1954, said receipts could not have been received by 
appellants earlier than November 28, 1954, considering that the Rules of Court 
treats a service as complete only upon the expiration of five days from 
mailing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We find no merit in these 
contentions. To begin with, there is no proof positive on record that appellant 
Juana F. Gonzales’ so-called refund claim for the amount of P86<span class="GramE">,166.00</span> had been sent to, let alone received, by respondent. 
Neither have they protested against this payment <u>by</u> the Collector 
<u>to</u> the Collector. <span class="GramE">In the second place, the refund 
letter of </span></span><st1:date month="11" day="24" year="1956"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 24, 
1956</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, assuming that it was duly 
filed, referred to Juana F. Gonzales' claim alone, and made no mention of Jose 
Leon Gonzales'.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> In the third place, the 
aforesaid refund claim does not set forth in detail the facts and grounds upon 
which it was based and failed to apprise the respondent of her grounds for 
raising her claim from P24.426.00 to P86<span class="GramE">,166.00</span> (see 
letter). Lastly, appellant Juana F. Gonzales' eleventh-hour modification upping 
her refund claim from P24,426.00 to P86, 166.00 was made on November 24, 1956 or 
eight days <u>after</u> the filing of her amended petition before the respondent 
court on November 16, 1956, and a few days after the two-year 
period.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Obviously then, the requirement 
of <u>prior timely</u> claim for refund of the sum of P86<span class="GramE">,166.00</span> has not been met in this case. The demand for refund 
must <u>precede</u> the suit, and this requirement is mandatory; so much so that 
noncompliance therewith bars the action<span class="GramE">.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style11"><sup>[</sup></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style11"><sup>6]</sup></span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellants insist that payment of 
the tax was not made by them but by the respondent Collector himself, and that, 
therefore, the prescriptive period should begin not from the date of such 
payment but from the date appellants learned of such 
payment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This contention offers no help to 
appellants' cause. Assuming that appellants indeed learned of their payments 
only on </span><st1:date month="11" day="24" year="1954"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 24, 
1954</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
they should have claimed the refund of P86<span class="GramE">,166.00</span> from 
said date and <u>before</u> they filed their petitions with the respondent Court 
on November 15 or 16, 1956. Neither could they blame the respondent Collector 
for failing to act on their refund claims sooner for it was incumbent upon 
appellants' to urge him to act expeditiously on their claims, knowing as they 
did that the time for bringing an action for a refund of income tax, fixed by 
statute, is not extended by the delay of the Collector of Internal Revenue in 
giving notice of the rejection of their claim<span class="GramE">.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style11"><sup>[</sup></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style11"><sup>7]</sup></span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Moreover, the provisions of 
section 306 of the Tax Code are mandatory and not subject to any qualification 
and, hence, they apply regardless of the conditions under which the payment has 
been made."<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style11"><sup>[8]</sup></span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">With respect, therefore, loathe 
issue of whether or not appellants claim for refund of P86<span class="GramE">,166.00</span> (each) could now be entertained, we believe that the 
same has been barred by prescription.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Anyway, it is mainly based on the 
proposition that our ruling in Gutierrez vs. Court of Tax Appeals, L-9738<span class="GramE">,9771</span>, May 31, 1957, should be abandoned, a proposition we 
are not disposed to encourage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This our decision will, 
therefore, address itself only to appellants earlier claim for refund in the sum 
of P24<span class="GramE">,126.00</span>. Which brings us to the question, of 
whether or not the sum of P89<span class="GramE">,309.61</span> which each of the 
appellants had received as <u>share in the interest</u> on the proceeds of the 
expropriation should be taxed <u>as capital</u> gain or <u>as ordinary</u> 
income.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellants argue that the 
accessory follows the principal, that the amount paid in expropriation 
proceedings (the principal) i.e. the profit thereon is admittedly <u>capital 
gain</u>, not ordinary income, and that therefore, the interest paid thereon 
(the accessory) is capital gain, not ordinary income.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This contention may not be 
sustained. In a previous case <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style11"><sup>[9]</sup></span>, we held 
that "the acquisition by the Government of private properties through the 
exercise of the power of eminent domain, said properties being justly 
compensated, is embraced within the meaning of the term "sale" or "disposition 
of property” and the definition of gross income laid down by Section 29 of the 
Tax Code of the Philippines. We also adhered to the view that the transfer of 
property through condemnation proceedings is a sale or exchange and that profit 
from the transaction constitutes capital gain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">But to say that the proceeds of 
expropriation which is the return of capital and, therefore, a capital gain, 
partakes of the same nature as interests paid thereon is far from correct; 
because interest is compensation for the delay in the return of such capital. In 
fact, the authorities support the conclusion that for income tax purposes, 
interest does not form part of the price paid by the Government in condemnation 
proceedings; and may not be treated as part of the capital gain. It was so held 
by the United States Supreme Court in <span class="SpellE">Kieselback</span> vs. 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 317 U.S. 399.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Borrowing the words and phrases 
of said Court, we could say now:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The sum paid these taxpayers 
above the award of P1<span class="GramE">,307,973.00</span> was paid because of 
the failure to put the award in the taxpayer's hands oh the day, 
</span><st1:date month="1" day="25" year="1947"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 25, 
1947</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
when the property was taken. This additional payment was necessary to give the 
owners the full equivalent of the value of the property at the time it was 
taken. Whether one calls it interest on the value or payments to meet the 
constitutional requirement of just compensation is immaterial. It is income paid 
to the taxpayers in lieu of what they might have earned on the sum found to be 
the value of the property on the day the property was taken. <u>It is not a 
capital</u> gain upon an asset sold. The sale price was the P1<span class="GramE">,307,973.00</span>. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style11"><sup>[10]</sup></span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The property was turned over in 
January, 1947. This was the sale. Title then passed. The subsequent earnings of 
the property went to the Government. The transaction was as though a purchase 
money lien at legal interest was retained upon the property. Such interest when 
paid would, of course, be ordinary income.<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Incidentally, the above Supreme 
Court's decision disapproved the Seaside Improvement case on which petitioners 
rely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We see, therefore, no reason to 
impute error to the opinion of the Collector of Internal Revenue and the Court 
of Tax Appeals that interest paid was ordinary income, bearing in mind that the 
Tax Code provided,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
