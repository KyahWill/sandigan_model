				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before the Court of First Instance of Tarlac, the Manila Railroad Co. and 
Andres Garcia were sued for damages for personal injuries on account of a 
collision, between its train (driven by Garcia) and the truck wherein Emilia de 
la Cruz (deceased wife and mother of plaintiffs) was riding. Defendants moved to 
dismiss on the ground of improper venue, because the complaint.alleged: (1) 
residence of the plaintiffs in Nueva Ecija; (2) location of the Railroad's main 
office in Manila; and (3) residence of the other defendant in Manila.
<p>The motion to dismiss was denied. Whereupon, the Railroad and its 
co-defendant filed this certiorari and prohibition proceeding alleging lack of 
jurisdiction and/or abuse of discretion.</p>
<p>It appears from the answer submitted here that immediately after the 
defendants had filed their motion to dismiss, plaintiffs amended their complaint 
on January 6, 1959, by alleging that one of them, Fortunate Pano was a resident 
of Paniqui, Tarlac. And on January 10, 1959, the respondent judge denied, as 
stated, the motion to dismiss, holding it to be not well taken.</p>
<p>Under the Rules, there being an allegation that one of the plaintiffs was a 
resident of Tarlac, the court of that province could net, as this stage, be 
prohibited to take cognizance of the litigation. (See Rule 5, sec. 1)</p>
<p>Petitioners here submitted certificates signed by the Chief of Police, and 
the Mayor of Paniqui to the effect that Fortunato Pano was not a resident of 
that town. But the papers should be exhibited to the trial court as evidence, if 
and when the defendants take their turn to present their side of the 
controversy.</p>
<p>In this connection, it should be remembered that the question here is 
<i>venue,</i> not jurisdiction. As to "abuse of discretion" there being an 
affirmative allegation before him that one of the plaintiffs resided in Paniqui, 
Tarlac, the trial judge may not certainly be charged with abuse for having 
accepted such allegation <i>prima facie</i> for the purposes of denying 
defendant's motion to dismiss. Specially because At that time the official 
certificates—which by the way are not conclusive—had not been shown to 
him.</p>
<p>His Honor made these pertinent remarks which, though not totally acceptable, 
may have some bearing on the matter of discretion, if any:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is true that railroad company, ordinarily is deemed to be a resident of, 
or domiciled in, the place where its principal business is transacted, but "for 
some purposes" it may be regarded as a resident of any city, province or town in 
which it has an office or place of business or wherein, its railroad is operated 
and it has an agent and a station, this interpretation being applicable where 
such application like in said civil ease No. 3352 accomplishes the substantial 
purpose of the rule about venue, which is to give the plaintiff an opportunity 
to file easily his complaint, at the convenience of the witnesses in the place 
of collision and expediency of the ocular inspection that may be 
needed."</p></blockquote>
<p>Wherefore, petitioners having failed to make out a case for certiorari or 
prohibition, their petition is hereby dismissed. Without costs.</p> <i>Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, 
Paredes, Dizon, </i>and <i>De Leon, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
