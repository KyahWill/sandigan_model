				G.R. No. L-14834, January 31, 1962</h4>
				<H3>TOMAS ALVAREZ AND FRANCISCO BASILIO, PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLEES, VS. BOARD OF LIQUIDATORS, COMPOSED OF FILOMENO KINTANAR, AS CHAIRMAN, BARTOLOME FERNANDEZ AND ELADIO FERNANDEZ, MEMBERS, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Davao, 
Hon. Wenceslao L. Fernan, presiding, in Civil Case No. 2135, declaring that the 
Board of Liquidators has no authority or jurisdiction to cancel a sale executed 
by the National Abaca and Other Fibers Corporation (NAFCO) in favor of Tomas 
Alvarez and that said Board's resolution dated September 19, 1956, cancelling 
the above-mentioned sale and ordering the disposal of the lot in favor of other 
persons, is null and void.
<p>The said case (No. 2135, CFI of Davao) is an action filed in the Court of 
First Instance to annul a decision of the Board of Liquidators, Davao branch, 
cancelling the sale of lot No. 52 of the Daliaon Plantation, made to Tomas 
Alvarez and declaring forfeited two installments thereon made by Alvarez, 
awarding portion of said lot No. 52 (Lot B in Tinio's Plan Z) to another 
(Zacarias Alfafara), and declaring said portion vacant and disposable by 
lottery. The complaint alleges that the administrative investigation ordered by 
the Board of liquidators was made by a partial investigator, after denial of a 
motion to defer said investigation because of the pendency of an action for 
ejectment filed by plaintiff against another claimant of the same lot, and 
furthermore, that the action of the Board of Liquidators is without authority of 
law.</p>
<p>Defendants moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the court is 
without jurisdiction to try the case, that the action is not the proper remedy, 
and that the complaint states no cause of action. The movant claimed that the 
court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter because the same involves 
disposition of NAFCO lands, and that if the board exceeded its powers, an 
ordinary action in court would not be the proper remedy. This motion, however, 
was denied. So defendants presented their answer.</p>
<p>The answer contains denials of the allegations of the complaint, and as 
special defenses, alleges that the lot subject of the action is a portion of the 
Public domain disposable by the defendant Board of Liquidators under Republic 
Act No, 477 and Executive Order No. 372, dated November 24, 1950; that a protest 
was filed against the sale to Alvarez; that an investigation of the contest was 
conducted by an officer of the Board of Liquidators in accordance with the 
provisions of the Public Land Law; that plaintiffs were notified of the protest, 
but plaintiffs objected to the investigation on the ground that the 
investigating officer is partial and, therefore, repudiated the jurisdiction of 
the Board of Liquidators over the contest; that sufficient opportunity was given 
plaintiffs to appear, after notice of the denial of plaintiff's petition for 
deferment (postponement), but they refused to appear at the investigation; that 
plaintiff Alvarez was not in possession of the lands subject of the sale in 
question at the time of the sale and this was enough reason for the cancellation 
of his sale contract, etc. The answer also contains appendices, among which are 
the protest against the sale to Alvarez (Annex "1" and "1-a"); resolution of the 
Board of Liquidators annulling the sale to Alvarez (Annex "2"); notice by 
investigator to Alvarez of hearing (Annexes "2", "2-A", "3-B", "3-C" and "3-D"); 
refusal of Alvarez to submit to investigation (Annex "4"); and copy of 
proceedings of the investigation wherein it was shown that Alvarez was never in 
possession of the contested lot.</p>
<p>The parties did not go into trial but instead submitted a very long 
stipulation of facts, the most pertinent paragraphs of which are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"9. That notice of the above-referred protest with copies of protest 
attached, was made to the plaintiffs, as per letter dated September 10, 1954,

that they could not submit to such investigation in view of the pendency of 
Civil Case No. 1303, a true copy is attached as Annex '4' to the answer of the

per letter quoted in the notice dated September 30, 1955, consisting of two 
useful pages attached to the answer of the defendant Board of Liquidators as 
Annex '3-B', and which is hereby marked, offered and submitted as Exhibit '7' 
for the defendants, and Exhibit 'E' for the plaintiffs, said notice being the 
one referred to par. 6 of the complaints.</p>
<p>"Accordingly on September 30, 1955, the Legal Officer of the Board wrote 
plaintiffs a letter giving them 'ten days from receipt hereof to appear before 
said Office and to explain your side of the conflict' copy of which is marked as 
Exhibit 'E' for plaintiffs.</p>
<p>"13. That on October 10, 1955, the plaintiffs, thru their counsel, wrote a 
letter to the Administrator, Alien Property, Board of Liquidators, requesting 
that administrative investigation be deferred until after the decision of Civil 
Case No. 1303, then pending trial before this Court, as per letter true copy of 
which is hereby marked, offered and submitted as Exhibit 'F' for the plaintiffs, 
this being the same letter referred to in par. 7 of the complaint.</p>
<p>"14. That the Officer-in-charge, the defendant Miguel R. Diccion, received a 
letter dated December 8,1955, informing him to the effect that administrative 
investigation over the lot in question 'may be continued despite the pendency of the Civil Case' (referring to Civil Case No. 1303), and this letter of the 
Administrator, Alien Property, Board of Liquidators, was brought to the notice 
of the plaintiffs, again thru counsel, as per notice of the Legal Officer dated 
December 16, 1955, in which notice plaintiffs were required 'to submit such 
investigation within 15 days' true copy of which is attached to the answer of 
the defendant Board of Liquidators as Annex '3-D', and hereby marked, offered 
and submitted as Exhibit '8' for the defendants, and Exhibit 'G' for the

complaint.</p>
<p>"15. That upon receipt of said notice, Exhibit 'G' plaintiffs wired the 
Administrator, Alien Property, Board of Liquidators requesting for investigator 
other than Atty. Anacleto K. Bajenting, as per telegram copy of which is hereby 
marked, offered and submitted as Exhibit 'H' for the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>"16. That ignoring the request contained in above-mentioned wire, the Board 
of Liquidators, acting upon the recommendation of its Legal Officer, Atty. 
Anacleto K. Bajenting contained in Exhibit '6' for the defendants, on September 
24, 1956 ordered the cancellation of the sale of Lot No. 52 in favor of Tomas 
Alvarez; ordered the forfeiture of all payments made by Tomas Alvarez for the 
purchase of the said lot; as well as the forfeiture of the improvements 
introduced on the lot; awarded a portion of the said Lot No. 52 to defendant 
Zacarias Alfafara; and declared vacant the remaining portion of Lot No. 52, 
ordering the sale of the portion declared vacant through lottery, as per 
Resolution No. 8104 of the Board of Liquidators approved in the meeting of 
September 19, 1956 true copy of which is attached as Annex '2' to the answer of

and attached to the complaint as Annex 'B' and 'B-1' (these being only a single 
letter of two pages), and which is hereby marked, offered and submitted as 
Exhibit '1' for the plaintiffs and Exihibit '9-A' for the defendants,</p>
<p>"18. That the plaintiff Tomas Alvarez, so far, has only paid the first and 
second installments of the sales price of the lot in question in accordance with

<p>all of which lots are under the disposition of the defendant Board of 
Liquidators under the same circumstances and condition as the lot in 
question."</p></blockquote>
<p>On the facts submitted in the stipulation, the court entered the decision 
already mentioned above in the following words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * In the present case, while the Public Land Law conferred upon the 
Bureau of Lands semi-judicial functions to cancel or revoke, yet, this same 
power was not granted to the Board of Liquidators in accordance with Republic 
Act No. 477.</p>
<p>"There is another point in the present ease which involves due process of law 
that, to the mind of the Court, merits serious consideration. The plaintiff here 
had consistently prayed that the administrative investigation to be conducted by 
Atty. Bajenting be held in abeyance until the termination of Civil Case No. 
1303. This request was denied by the Board of Liquidators which ordered the 
<span style="font-style: italic;">ex-parte</span> investigation without the presence of the plaintiff, Tomas Alvarez. By 
doing so in cancellingthe contract of sale without giving a chance to Tomas 
Alvarez, to present his side of the case, the plaintiff, Tomas Alvarez, was not 
given due process of law in protecting his rights and interest in the lot in 
question. For purposes of administrative investigation Tomas Alvarez should be 
given a chance to be heard by granting his petition that investigation be 
conducted only after Civil Case No. 1303 is terminated by the Court, or that 
another investigator be appointed in lieu of Atty. Bajenting.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *<br> </p>
<p>"In view of the foregoing, this Court feels constrained to hold that the 
Board of Liquidators has no authority or jurisdiction to cancel the sale 
executed by the NAFCO and Tomas Alvarez, and, consequently, Resolution No. 3104, 
dated September 19, 1956, passed by the Board of Liquidators and the disposition 
of said lot in favor of other persons are hereby declared null and void, without 
special pronouncement as to costs."</p></blockquote>
<p>The defendants have appealed from the above decision assigning the following 
errors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">I</p>
<p>The trial court erred in trying the case when it has no power to issue an 
order enforceable against respondent Board of Liquidators.</p>
<p align="center">II</p>
<p>The trial court erred in trying the case when plaintiffs have not yet 
exhausted available administrative remedies.</p>
<p align="center">III</p>
<p>The trial court erred in holding that the Board of Liquidators has no power 
to cancel the contract of sale.</p>
<p align="center">IV</p>
<p>The trial court erred in not ordering the cancellation of the sale to 
plaintiff in question for breach of contract as alleged! in the 
counterclaim.</p>
<p align="center">V</p>
<p>The trial court erred in not dismissing the complaint.</p></blockquote>
<p>The first assignment of error involves the jurisdiction of the court to take 
cognizance of the subject matter of the action, it being alleged that the court 
has no power to issue an order enforceable against the respondent Board of 
liquidators. This same objection was raised in the motion to dismiss. This 
objection, however, is closely related to the second assignment of error, 
namely, that the plaintiffs have not exhausted their administrative remedies 
before filing the action. The power to dispose of the lands placed under the 
administration of the Board of Liquidators is lodged in said board. There is no 
provision of law authorizing courts to review decisions of the Board of 
Liquidators and to take cognizance of actions to annul awards of sale or any 
other action made by it pursuant to the authority granted it by law. If the 
courts are to take cognizance of cases involving errors or abuse of power 
exercised by the Board of Liquidators, the remedy would be by means of an action 
of certiorari or prohibition to set aside the orders or decisions of the Board. 
But this special civil action would not lie unless there is an allegation of 
abuse of discretion or a lack of jurisdiction. In the case at bar, it is not 
claimed that the Board lacked jurisdiction, so that an action would lie only in 
case there has been an abuse of discretion by it (Board of Liquidators) in the 
exercise of its powers. The remedy would be either certiorari or prohibition, 
and not a direct action of annulment as the one instituted in this case.</p>
<p>But even if the action instituted in the Court of First Instance were to be 
taken or considered as a special civil action of prohibition, still we find that 
the action would not lie, first, because the plaintiff has not exhausted 
hisadministrative remedies in accordance with the rules and principles set forth 
by this Court (See Lubugan vs. Gastrillo, G. R. No. L-1052, May 29, 1957; 
Cebedo, et al. vs. Dir. of Lands, et al., G. R. No. L-12777, May 23, 1961; Booc vs. 
Osmeña, Perez vs. City Mayor of Cabanatuan, G.R. No. L-16786, Oct. 31, 1961), 
and second, because there was no abuse of discretion in the exercise of its 
powers resulting in the cancellation of the sale in favor of the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs-appellees in their brief argue that the Board of Liquidators 
has no power under the provisions of Republic Act No. 477 to cancel the sale. 
Paragraphs 22, 23, and 24 of the stipulation of facts, which are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"22. That under the procedure adopted by the Board of Liquidators in the 
implementation of the provisions of Republic Act No. 477, as regards public 
agricultural lands like the lot in question, once the awardee pays in fall the 
consideration agreed upon in the deed of sale, the defendant Board of 
Liquidators, thru the defendant Miguel R. Diccion who is a Deputy Public Lands 
Inspector, conducts the final investigation to determine whether the awardee has 
complied with all the requisites for the issuance of a sales patent in 
accordance with the provisions of the Public Land Law, as amended.</p>
<p>"23. That if in the investigation it is shown that the awardee has complied 
with the said requisites, the defendant Board of Liquidators, forwards the deed 
of sale to the Bureau of Lands with the report of the final investigation and 
recommendation for the issuance of the sales patent, and thereafter the rights 
of the awardee takes the course of an ordinary sales application as if 
originally filed with the Bureau of Lands under the provisions of the Public 
Land Law, as amended.</p>
<p>"24. And that if in the final investigation it is shown that the awardee has 
not complied with the provisions of Republic Act No. 477 and the pertinent 
provisions of the Public Land Law, as amended, relative to the requisites for 
the issuance of a sales patent, the issuance of thesame shall not be 
recommended."</p></blockquote>
<p>recognize the right of the Board of Liquidators to cancel or give due course 
to a sales contract or application. In the case at bar, the plaintiff-appellee 
Tomas Alvarez.had not yet paid all the installments for the lot, so that under 
paragraph 22 of the stipulation of facts he would not yet be entitled to an 
investigation to determine compliance with tiie requisites for the issuance of a 
sales patent. The hearing ordered by the Board of Liquidators was to 
determine the conflicting claims of Tomas Alvarez and Francisco Basilio, on the 
one hand, and appellants Miguel Diccion and Zacarias Alfafara, on the other. It 
was in this investigation where it was found that Tomas Alvarez was never in 
possession of the land, but that the same was in the possession of another, and 
where the investigating officer further found that Tomas Alvarez was just a 
dummy of Francisco Basilio who no longer could acquire a parcel of land from 
the Board of Liquidators because he already had purchased another parcel from 
said body, and a person is disqualified from purchasing more than one lot. The 
agreement which the Board denominated "contract of sale," is not really a deed 
of actual sale, but should be considered as a mere application on the part of 
Tomas Alvarez. After the approval of such application it was still necessary to 
have Alvarez' qualifications investigated as well as whether or not he has 
complied with the provisions of the laws regarding the disposition of lands by 
the Board of Liquidators. The "contract of sale" so-called was not an ordinary 
deed of sale of properties but, as shown by the above-quoted stipulations, was 
merely an application subject to revocation in case the applicant is found not 
to possess the qualifications necessary. The Board found that Alvarez is not 
qualified because he did not actually occupy the land but merely served as a 
dummy of another who was disqualified to get this lot, having already purchased 
one lot from the Board of Liquidators. The argument, therefore, that the Board 
of Liquidators had no power under the circumstances to order the cancellation of 
the sale is without foundation either in law or in fact.</p>
<p>The above considerations fully cover the assignments of error Nos. 3 and 4, 
and further discussion thereof is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision rendered by the Court of First Instance of Davao is 
hereby set aside and the action dismissed. With costs against 
plaintiffs-appellees.</p> <i>Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, Paredes, Dizon,</i> 
and <i>De Leon, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
