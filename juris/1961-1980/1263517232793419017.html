				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner in this certiorari proceeding was averse to paying the
docket fees in the amount of P940.00 for the probate of a will of the decedent,
<span class="SpellE">Gliceria</span> A. <span class="GramE">del</span>
Rosario.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was of the belief that no
such fee should be collected as previously another alleged will of the same
deceased was filed for probate by another party with the corresponding docket
fee for having been paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would
assert, as set forth in the petition, "that after [such payment] by the
original petitioner, Consuelo Gonzales, there is no more need for [him] to pay
additional or separate docket fees for their peti­tions, since they all refer
to the settlement of only one estate, the Estate of <span class="SpellE">Gliceria</span>
A. del Rosario."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner had to pay just the same, his belief that he would be
thus exempted having failed to command the assent of re­spondent Judge, the
Honorable <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> M. Vasquez, who issued the
following order of November 6, 1965:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"'<span class="SpellE">Oppositor</span>, Father Lucia Garcia is
hereby ordered to pay the corresponding fees of the filing of his petition for
allowance of will and issuance of letters of administration with the will
annexed, dated September 30, 1965 within fifteen (15) days from notice hereof,
failure of which the said petition will be considered dismissed.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Payment was made by him on <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1965</st1:date>, coupled with a
reservation that he would seek a definite ruling from us.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence this petition for certiorari filed on November 9, 1966, the
sole question raised being the alleged error of the respondent Judge in
ordering the payment of the aforesaid docket fee consider­ing that previously,
with reference to an alleged will of the same estate of the decedent in
connection with the petition for probate filed, such a fee had been
collected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is petitioner's contention
that the challenged order of respondent Judge amounted to a grave abuse of
discretion correctible by certiorari.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge did not even bother to answer the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is understandable why.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On its face, it is obviously without
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A petition for probate of a will
having been filed by petitioner, he could not escape the payment of the
corresponding docket fee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The argument
based on the <span class="GramE">allegation</span> that there was such a previous
payment in connection with another will of the same decedent sought to be
probated does not carry the day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
bereft of any persuasive force.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner should have been aware that there is no escape from
the payment of the corresponding docket <span class="GramE">fee,</span>
otherwise, the Court is not called upon to act on a complaint or petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor does it suffice to vary the rule simply
because there is only one decedent whose estate is thus to be disposed of by
will that must first be probated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
not farfetched or implausible that a decedent could have left various
wills.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under such circumstances, there
is nothing inherently objectionable in thus exacting the payment of a docket
fee, every time a will is sought to be probated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner here could have sought the probate
of the will presented by him in the same proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not; he filed instead a separate
action.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">One last point.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Rules of Court require that for all
clerical services in the allowance of will, the "fees payable out of the
estate shall be collected in accordance with the value of the property involved
* * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The specific legal provision is thus clear and unmistakable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the clerical service in the allowance
of the will that has to be paid for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
docket fees exist for that purpose and must be collected at the outset.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no exception according to the above
legal provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It needs no
interpretation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be applied in
accordance with the specific language thus employed.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge acted in accordance with the
clear tenor of the controlling legal norm.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The alleged grievance of petitioner that there was a grave abuse of
discretion does not merit any attention.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a matter of fact, on this point, respondent Judge had no discretion
to abuse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The docket fees had to be
paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no escape for petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this petition for certiorari is denied, with
costs against petitioner.</p>
