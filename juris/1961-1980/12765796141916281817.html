				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>This is an action for damages brought by Trinidad A. Deaño, assisted by her 
husband Manuel Deaño, against defendant Diogenez Godinez before the Court of 
First Instance of Lanao del Norte based on a communication sent by the latter as 
district supervisor to his immediate superior, the Division Superintendent of 
Schools.</p>
<p>Trinidad claims that, with malice aforethought and in disregard of proper 
decorum and accepted administrative practices, defendant wrote the aforesaid 
communication making therein statements which are contrary to morals, good 
customs or public policy, and to existing rules and regulations, thereby causing 
irreparable .damage to her personal dignity and professional standing, for which 
reason she asks that she be paid P30.000.00 as moral damages, P10.000.00 as 
exemplary damages, and Pl.000.00 as attorney's fees for bringing the present 
action. </p>
<p>Defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the letter 
complained of is a privileged communication and the action has already 
prescribed. The motion was upheld, and the court a quo dismissed the complaint. 
Hence this appeal. </p>
<p>In paragraph 3 of the complaint, it is alleged that, on or about March 
20,1956, defendant, as a responsible public school official, wrote a letter to 
the Division Superintendent of Schools, his immediate superior officer, the 
contents of which we quote for ready reference: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Respectfully returned to the Division Superintendent of Schools, Camp 
Keithley, Lanao, with the explanation to the alleged confusion in the 
dental-medical reports of the district. It seems, the basic communication has 
been written thru the deliberate misinformation of Dr. T. Deaño, the School 
dentist. If such be the case, she twisted the facts to satisfy her ulterior 
motives. Immediately upon her arrival in the district, Dr. Deaño was informed of 
the present set up in the district. The teachers contribute twenty pesos (P20.) 
each by installments to cover all the voluntary drives. Among other things, it 
includes the dental-medical drive and the support to Hoy Scout Bally, district, 
provincial and Mindanao meets. Despite that information, she required the 
teachers in the field to sign the blank form she was bringing with her not 
filled, then later on put the amount of P20.00. It then tended to snow that the 
teachers contributed P20.00 each solely for the dental-medical drive. Teachers 
in I.umbatnn district can be asked individually to support the contention of the 
undersigned. In view of the above, Dr. Deaño is a carping critic, a fault finder 
and suspects every teacher or School official to be potential grafters and 
swindlers of the medical-dental funds. If the Division Superintendent of Schools 
after the above explanation still entertain doubts of the funds, the undersigned 
welcomes a prove to clear his bismirched reputation. But, the lady dentist must 
be ready to answer complaints of teachers and pupils against hex services while 
she was in Lumbatan District. In this connection, the undersigned wishes to make 
record that the lady dentist will not be welcomed in Lumbatan district next 
school year. If she will be sent back, the undersigned and his teachers will not 
lift a finger in the collection of dental medical funds. She did more harm than 
good to the teeth of the patients she treated." </p></blockquote>
<p>The highlights of the letter may be boiled down as follows: Dr. Trinidad A. 
Deaño, plaintiff herein, as the school dentist of Lanao, required the teachers 
in the field to sign blank forms indicating therein a contribution of P20.00 
which she intended to be only for the dental-medical drive, when she knew well 
that the drive included the Boy Scout Rally of the district. "In view of the 
above, Dr. Deaño is a carping critic, a fault finder and suspects every teacher 
or school official to be potential grafters and swindlers of the medical-dental 
funds. * * * The lady dentist will not be welcomed in Lumbatan district next 
school year. * * * She did more harm than good to the teeth of the patients she 
treated." </p>
<p>The utterances or statements above referred to, if untrue, are indeed 
derogatory to the personal dignity and professional standing of the plaintiff as 
a high official in the government service as they in fact disturbed her peace of 
mind to the extent that they caused her mental anguish, wounded her feelings and 
made her suffer moral shock and social humiliation for which she now asks for 
damages in retribution. But defendant claims that he made those statements in 
pursuance of a legal duty or in the exercise of his functions as a public 
official and as such they are justifiable under the doctrine of privileged 
communication. In this sense, defendant contends, they cannot be the basis of an 
action for damages. </p>
<p>The question that now arises is: Does the letter in which the alleged 
defamatory statements appear partake of the nature of a privileged 
communication? </p>
<p>Reading the complaint one may gather that the letter alleged to be defamatory 
is embodied in an endorsement sent by defendant to the Division Superintendent 
of Schools, his immediate superior, by way of an explanation of an alleged 
confusion concerning a dental-medical report submitted relative to the fund 
drive then being undertaken for certain public purpose. Apparently, the 
explanation was given as a comment on a communication referred to the defendant 
in his official capacity as district supervisor. And in his endorsement 
defendant stated certain facts which came to his information regarding the 
dental-medical drive then undertaken by the plaintiff, but that the language he 
used was such that it somewhat hurt the feeling and pride of plaintiff as a 
public school official. Nevertheless, we find that the communication is 
privileged in nature and as such comes within the purview of Article 354 of the 
Revised Penal Code, which we quote: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ART. 354. <i>Requirement for publicity</i>. — Every defamatory imputation is 
presumed to be malicious, even if it be true, if no good intention and 
justifiable motive for making it is shown, except in the following eases: 
</p></blockquote>
<ol><li>A private communication made by any person to another in the performance of 
any legal, moral or social duty; and <br><br>
</li><li>A fair and true report, made in good faith, without any comments or remarks, 
of any judicial, legislative or other official proceedings which are not of 
confidential nature, or of any statement, report or speech delivered in said 
proceedings, or of any other act performed by public officers in the exercise of 
their functions.” </li></ol>
<p>Indeed, the communication now denounced by plaintiff as defamatory is one 
sent by defendant to his immediate superior in the performance of a legal duty, 
or in the nature of a report submitted in the exercise of an official function. 
He sent it as an explanation of a matter contained in an endorsement sent to him 
by his superior officer. It is a report submitted in obedience to a lawful duty, 
though in doing so defendant employed a language somewhat harsh and uncalled 
for. But such is excusable in the interest of public policy. As it has been 
aptly said, "The doctrine of privileged communication rests upon public policy, 
'which looks to the free and unfettered administration of justice, though, as an 
incidental result, it may in some instances afford an immunity to the 
evil-disposed and malignant slanderer.'" (Abbott us. National Bank of Commerce 
of Tacoma, 175 U.S., 409, 411). The philosophy behind this privilege is well 
expressed thus: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Public policy is the foundation of the doctrine of privilege communications. 
It is based upon the recognition of the fact that the right of the individual to 
enjoy immunity from the publication or untruthful charges derogatory to his 
character is not absolute and must at times yield to the superior necessity of 
subjecting to investigation the conduct of persons charged with wrong-doing. In 
order to accomplish this purpose end to permit private persons having, or in 
good faith believing themselves to have, knowledge to such wrong doing, to 
perform the [legal, moral, social duty resulting from such knowledge or belief, 
without restraining them by the fear that an error, no matter how innocently or 
honestly made, may subject them to punishment for defamation, the doctrine of 
qualified privilege has been evolved." ( U.S. <em>vs.</em> Cañete, et al., 38 
Phil. 253). </p></blockquote>
<p>The letter sent by defendant being a privileged communication, it is presumed 
that it was sent without malice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> It 
being a communication sent in the discharge of a legal duty, the writer is not 
liable for damages. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It will be noted that all of the defendant's communications were of a public 
nature and addressed to his superior officers, and that his investigation was 
made in the line of his duty. There is no evidence that defendant was actuated 
by any malicious motive. </p>
<p>"In the instant case, the alleged libel is based upon the official letter of 
the defendant to his superior officers, which were written in the discharge of 
his official duties, and for which he is not liable in an action for damages." 
(Gilmer <i>vs.</i> Hilliard, 43 Phil., 180).</p></blockquote>
