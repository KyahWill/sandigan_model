Francisco <span class="SpellE">Quintela</span> filed an amended petition with the
Court of Agrarian Relations, 6th Regional District, </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Naga</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">, entitled "Francisco <span class="SpellE">Quintela</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span> <span class="SpellE">Bustos</span> and Jesus Ma. <span class="SpellE">Bernarte</span>,"
docketed therein as CAR Case No. 197-CN '62.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Alleging, <u>inter</u> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, <span style="">that he was the tenant-overseer of all the
lands belonging to <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span> <span class="SpellE">Bustos</span>
in the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Para足cale</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte, that he planted </span>a certain <span style="">number of coconut trees thereon and that he
had been unlawfully ejected from said landholding, <span class="SpellE">Quintela</span>
prayed for his reinstatement and compensation for the value of the improve足ments
alleged to have been introduced by him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">On </span></span><st1:date year="1962" day="3" month="12"><span class="GramE"><span style="">December 3, 1962</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span> <span class="SpellE">Bustos</span> and Jesus </span>Ma.</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bernarte</span></span><span style=""> filed their answer to said petition, denying all the material
allegations contained therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
December 5, 1962, herein petitioners filed a motion for intervention, to which
was attached their answer in intervention, in which they alleged that they were
the only <span class="SpellE"><u>bonafide</u></span> tenants on the land subject
of the case and that they were the ones who planted the coconut trees claimed
by <span class="SpellE">Quintela</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According足ly, they prayed that "judgment be rendered dismissing the
amended petition and ordering the petitioners to pay expenses of litigation in
the amount of P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> </span>as <span style="">and for attorney's fees."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Quintela</span></span><span style=""> filed his opposition to the motion for
intervention and on March 18, 1963 respondent Judge denied this motion, and
said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"A perusal of the allegations in their proposed answer in
intervention shows that they have no inchoate interest in the subject matter of
litigation; that in their prayer, they only ask that the amended petition be
dismissed and the petitioner to pay the expenses of litigation in the amount of
Two Thousand (P2,000.00) pesos as and for attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, they have not even
intervened either as party-petitioners or as party-defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have not complied with the requirements
of the procedural laws heretofore enforced in this jurisdiction regarding
intervention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court tried to find
means to allow them to intervene in order to bring all the necessary parties to
the litigation, but to no avail because, as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>,
they have shown no inchoate interest in the result of the litigation."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner moved for
reconsideration of the order of denial, and the motion having been turned down,
instituted the instant petition for mandamus to compel respondent Judge to
allow them to intervene.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We believe the writ
should issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that mandamus
cannot be resorted to in order to control <span class="GramE">discretion,</span>
and that as a general rule allowance of a motion to intervene rests in the
sound discretion of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>But
<span style="">such discretion </span>is <span style="">not unlimited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the exercise thereof</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">the
Rules provide that the Court "shall consider whether or not the
intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of
the original parties and whether or not the <span class="SpellE">intervenor's</span>
rights may be fully protected in a separate proceeding." If these
considerations weigh in favor of the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>, a
denial of the intervention may amount to an arbitrary or capricious exercise of
discretion which is correctible by mandamus, if an ordinary appeal would not be
an adequate and speedy remedy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the instant case,
there could not have been any undue delay in the proceedings if the
intervention of petitioners bad been allowed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They filed their motion before the case was set for trial, and only two
days after defendants answered the petition below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed herein respondent had then already
been apprised of petitioners' interest in the litigation, since defendants, in
their motion to dismiss which antedated their answer by two months,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a><span style="">
categorically denied respondent's claim that he was their tenant and alleged
that since liberation it was these petitioners </span><span style="">who </span><span style="">had been cultivating
the lands as such tenants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Would petitioners' rights
be fully protected in a separate proceeding?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Hardly.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A decision in favor of respondent <span class="SpellE">Quintela</span>,
declaring him to be the tenant-overseer of <u>all</u> the lands (which have an
area of some 64 hectares), the one who planted coconut trees thereon and hence
the one entitled to be compensated for their value, would necessarily and
injuriously affect the interest of petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That interest is not only inchoate but material, direct and immediate;
and for it to be </span><span style="">in any </span><span style="">manner prejudiced without first giving
petitioners a chance to be heard would be <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, to
rule in favor of respondent <span class="SpellE">Quintela</span>, recognize him
as tenant and award compensation in his favor, but saving petitioners' claim
that they are the only tenants </span><span style="">on
</span><span style="">the lands to be litigated and
adjudged in another proceeding, would subject the defendants-landowners to the
danger of having to recognize all of them as tenants and to pay compensation
twice for the improvements that both respondent and petitioners allege to have
introduced on the lands.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent Judge would
have done well to brush aside narrow technicalities in this case, allow the
intervention prayed for and thus avoid needless delay in the resolution of the
conflicting interests of all the </span>parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">The writ prayed for is granted, and respondent Judge is ordered
to allow the intervention of petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Costs against respondent Francisco <span class="SpellE">Quintela</span>.</span></p>
