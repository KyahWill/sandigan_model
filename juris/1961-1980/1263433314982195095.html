in this petition for certiorari by way of review comes from police power
legislation, the first Republic Act No. 6539 and thereafter Presidential Decree
No. 20.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had a common objective to
remedy the plight of the lessees, Presidential Decree No. 20, moreover, having
a constitutional sanction in that it is specifically referred to in the
fundamental law as part of "the law of the land."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners in this proceeding were the plaintiffs in Civil Case

a certain Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Leyva</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With leave of court, and within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period, respondent spouses filed on <st1:date year="1972" day="2" month="5">May 2, 1972</st1:date> an answer in intervention
to the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such pleading, they
admitted that plaintiffs, now petitioners, are the owners of the land on which
their house is built, including as an affirmative defense the fact that their
life savings were spent for the purchase of that house, a transaction entered
into only because they were given the assurance by petitioners as <span class="SpellE">lessors</span> that they would be allowed to remain for a
substantial number of years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After trial

respondent spouses was promul­gated on <st1:date year="1972" day="21" month="9">September
 21, 1972</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent spouses
on the same day appealed to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City Branch XXXIII, presided over by
respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1973" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1973</st1:date>, respondent Judge
rendered a decision on the case, reversing the <st1:place><st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placetype>Court</st1:placetype> <st1:placename>of</st1:placename> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
Branch II, dismissing the complaint for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In such decision, respondent Judge stated the following:
"From the evidence thus adduced, it is unmistakably clear that this case
comes under the coverage of the rental law of 1971, Republic Act No. 6359.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, the rental stipulated is only for
P30.00 or P40.00 a month for the occupancy of defendant-<span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
on plaintiffs' property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The residential
house of said <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> is involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is an agreement as to use of the
premises between the plaintiffs and the defendants-<span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be claimed that the plaintiffs were
not informed nor that did they know about the occupancy of the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> on their property or <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>'
having purchased the house of their (plaintiffs') own collector.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is hard to believe that they did not know
until after almost one and a half years from the purchase of the house that it
is <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> Armando <span class="SpellE">Cantada</span>,
and not anymore Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Leyva</span> nor Jose <span class="SpellE">Chaingan</span>, who is actually paying rentals <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all,
a house with a value of P8,000.00 could not just be ignored, and more, no
person would just part with P8,000.00 for a house standing on another's
property without the assurance or at least the knowledge of the latter."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge also pointed out: "There is nothing in the
complaint insinuating, or in the evidence which shows that the grounds for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> as enumerated in Article 1673 are present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the evidence shows that <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> are up-to-date in their payment of their
monthly rentals, at least before the filing of the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no question, either, that the
property leased from plaintiffs is used for the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>
for residential purposes, as was tacitly agreed upon by the parties, or at
least permitted by the plaintiffs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
only ground, therefore, apparently available to the plaintiffs to justify their
action is the fact that the duration of the lease as fixed by Article 1687 has
already expired, or expires each month and may be terminated at the end of said
month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this is excepted as ground
for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> by Section 4 of Republic Act No.
6359.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under said section, the prevision
of the first paragraph of Article 1673 is suspended when the period of the
lease has not been agreed upon but has been only fixed in accordance with
Article 1687 and said period has expired.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The period of the suspension of said provision is for 2 years from <st1:date year="1971" day="14" month="7">July 14, 1971</st1:date>, the date of the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the Act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This action was filed on <st1:date year="1972" day="27" month="4">April
 27, 1972</st1:date>, well within the period of the suspension of the provision
authorizing <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> by judicial action."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
After a motion for reconsideration failed, this petition for certiorari was
filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted that in the
opposition to such motion, Presidential Decree No. 20 which suspended court
actions for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> for leases covered by the same
was relied upon by private respondents.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As noted at the outset, the reliance of the decision sought to be
reviewed was on the previous statute and subsequently Presidential Decree No.
20, both police power legislation intended to remedy the situation of the
lessees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence the weakness of this
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find for private
respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">1. On the facts as found by the lower court to which no objection
could be raised by petitioners as they brought the certiorari proceeding
directly to this Tribunal, the decision arrived at is free from the taint of
any infirmity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit was filed on <st1:date year="1972" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1972</st1:date>, Republic Act No. 6359 was in full force
and effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As noted earlier, for a
period of two years from <st1:date year="1971" day="14" month="7">July 14, 1971</st1:date>,
the right of the lessees to remain could not be disputed for as found by the
lower court the lease was not for a definite period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence the reversal of the decision of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placetype>Court</st1:placetype> <st1:placename>of</st1:placename> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
by respondent Judge in his decision of <st1:date year="1973" day="14" month="2">February
 14, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of
fact, as of that date, Presidential Decree No. 20 was in full force and effect.
The suspension of actions for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> was for an
indefinite period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as it is a
police power legislation, it was applicable to leases entered into prior to
that date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The applicability thereof to
existing contracts cannot be denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From
<span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> Transportation Co. v. Public Service
Commission,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
such a doctrine has been repeatedly adhered to by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was held in <span class="SpellE">Ongsiako</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Gamboa</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
decided in 1950, a police power measure being remedial in character covers
existing situations; otherwise, it would be self-defeating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Abe v. Foster Wheeler Corp.,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Justice Barrera, speaking for the Court, took note of the contention "that
as the contracts of employment Were entered into at a time when there was no
law granting the workers said right, the application as to them of the
subsequent enactment restoring the same right constitutes an impairment of
their contractual obligations." Then he made clear why the Court was of a
contrary view as "the constitutional guaranty of non? impairment * *
* is limited by the exercise of the police power of the State, in the interest
of public health, safety, morals and general welfare."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
So it must be in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. The futility of this petition is thus apparent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A belated attempt by counsel for petitioners by
raising a constitutional question is equally unavailing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would have this Court declare that
Republic Act No. 6539 is <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the equal
protection clause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The imputation that a
police power measure of that character intended to remedy the deplorable
situation of lessees<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
suffers from such infirmity, is far from persuasive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be stigmatized as class
legislation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a clear need for
such a statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was enacted to
promote the public interest and the general welfare. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The State is not compelled to stand idly by
while a considerable segment of its citizens suffers from economic
distress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only recently, in Agustin v. <span class="SpellE">Edu</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
reference was made to the "broad and expansive scope of police power"
citing Chief Justice Taney of the American Supreme Court in an 1847 decision as
"nothing more or less than the powers of government inherent in every
sovereignty."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Correctly was it characterized by Justice Malcolm as "that most essential,
insistent, and illimitable of powers."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, there is a procedural objection to this last-ditch effort, the
well-settled rule being that the constitutional question should be raised at
the earliest opportunity.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Nor does this case falls within one of the exceptions mentioned in People v.
Vera.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Even if success could have attended this maneuver, still there is the
insuperable barrier posed by Presidential Decree No. 20 which was relied upon
in the objection of private respondents to the motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was therefore within the cognizance of
respondent Judge, as it ought to have been all the while.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners apparently had nothing to say
about this Presidential Decree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
ought not to have been surprised at its being applied being a part "of the
law of the land." To repeat, petitioner had failed to make out a case for
reversal.</p>
