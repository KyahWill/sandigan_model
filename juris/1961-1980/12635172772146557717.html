				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">This is a pauper's appeal
from the order dated August 20, 1963 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> dismissing the plaintiffs' complaint in Case No.
<span class="GramE">U-661.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
pertinent allegations in said complaint are as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the plaintiffs were the owners of
several parcels of land (specifically referred to by their respective lot
numbers and certificates of title); "that on three occasions, thru
misrepresentation, fraud and deceit (they) were re­quested to sign some papers
purportedly to be (sic) an ap­plication for their pension and passport of their
grandson to go to America;" that said documents, which turned out to be
deeds of sale of their lands, were executed without any consideration;
"that the possession of the said pro­perties were transferred to the
defendants, some as a gesture of kindness... for the reason that <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Garanciang</span> is the only
son of the plaintiffs;" that the defend­ants were able to register the
documents and to obtain the </span><span class="GramE">corresponding</span>
transfer certificates of title; that the plaintiffs discovered the
"anomalous execution" of the deeds of sale on or about September 10,
1958, whereupon they filed an adverse claim with the Register of Deeds; and
that despite repeated demands, the defendants failed and refused to deliver
possession of the lands to the plaintiffs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The relief prayed for was for recovery of possession; for a declaration
that the deeds of <span style="">sale </span>and the transfer <span style="">certificates
of </span>title issued pursuant thereto were null and void; and for damages,
attorney's fees and costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August <span style="">7, </span>1963 the <span style="">defendants
moved to dismiss </span>the complaint on the ground of <span style="">prescription and lack of </span>cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs opposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August 20, 1963 the trial court granted
the motion and dismissed the complaint on the first ground relied upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs moved to reconsider but were
turned down; hence the instant appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In dismissing the complaint the trial court relied on Article
1391 of the Civil Code, which provides that an action for annulment (of a
contract) on the ground of fraud prescribes in four years, computed from the
discovery of the <span style="">fraud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According </span>to the complaint the fraud
was discovered by the plaintiffs on September 10, 1958, so that when this
action was filed <span class="GramE">an</span> July 2, 1963, more than four years
had passed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the com­plaint alleges
not only fraud in the execution of the deeds of sale sought to be annulled, but
total absence of cause or consideration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This allegation, if true, would render the contracts not merely <span class="SpellE">voidable</span> but absolutely void and inexistent (Arts. 1352,
1409(3), Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed the sales
were, on the face of the complaint, worse than fictitious, since the plaintiffs
had no intention - not even <span style="">a </span>simulated one - of executing them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the action to set aside <span style="">a </span>contract that is fictitious, or
absolutely void or inexistent, does not prescribe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Art. 1410, Civil Code; <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>, et al., 98

G. <span style="">R. </span>No.</span> L-21628, May
19, 1966).</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the said allegation, which was deemed hypothetically
admitted for purposes of the defendants' motion to dismiss, the trial court
erred in dismissing the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Wherefore</b>, the order appealed from is set aside and the
case is remanded to the court of origin for further proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in this instance.</span></p>
