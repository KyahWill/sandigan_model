enjoining the implementation of <span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span>
Resolution 43 (69) until further orders from the said court; (2) that because
of the said restrain­ing order, the petitioner had no right to propose the
substitution and replacement of the bonds because Resolution 43 (69) which was
the source of his right or authority had been temporarily rendered ineffective
by the said restraining order; and (3) that there <span style="">was </span>no allegation, much less any showing that the said bonds,

their duly authorized representatives, with authority to incur expenses to be

expenses, from the Customs area and custody, ready for sale, under the

<p class="BODY">On September 5, 1970, the petitioner filed his comments on the

supplemental motion dated July 25, 1970, among others, be denied and that the <u>LEI</u>
Receiver, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Clapano</span>, be severely censured,

</span>In this particular pleading, the petitioner made the claim that by

 15, 1968</st1:date> granting his petition for withdrawal of his supplemental
petition for <i>certiorari</i>, the reparations goods in question ceased to be

<p class="BODY">A panoramic appraisal of the facts of this case will show that
two issues are primarily involved, to wit:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did
the respondent Court </span>issue the questioned orders without or in excess of
jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion?</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Has this Court lost juris­diction over the
reparations goods by virtue of its reso­lution dated <st1:date year="1968" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1968</st1:date> granting the petitioner's petition
to withdraw his supplemental petition for <i>certiorari</i>?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to Section 1,
Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, the writ of <i>certiorari</i> lies if the
following requisites concur:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) that it
is directed against a tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial functions;
and (b) that such tribunal, board or officer has acted without or in excess of
jurisdiction or with grave abuse of dis­cretion; and (c) that there is no appeal
nor any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not all the foregoing requisites are present
in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is no gainsaying as
to the presence of the first requisite -- the </span><span style="">respondent </span><span style="">court being a
tribunal exercising judicial functions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Regard­ing the second requisite, it is not disputed that the respondent
court has jurisdiction over the civil cases in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had acquired jurisdiction over the
parties-signatories to the Compromise Agree­ment of </span><st1:date year="1964" day="13" month="5"><span style="">May 13, 1964</span></st1:date><span style=""> and the other agreements and the
subject-matter thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, even
assuming </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">arguendo</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">that
the respondent Judge committed errors in issuing the questioned orders, they
are merely errors of judgment and not errors of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A line must be drawn between errors of
judgment and errors of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An
error of judgment is one which the court may commit in the exercise of its
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An error of jurisdiction
renders an order or judgment void or <span class="SpellE">voidable</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Errors of jurisdiction are <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> on <i>certiorari</i>; errors of judgment, only

the absence of appeal or any speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course
of law, cannot likewise be said to be present in the instant case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No motions for reconsideration were filed in
the case of the orders dated </span><st1:date year="1966" day="28" month="12"><span style="">December 28, 1966</span></st1:date><span style=""> and </span><st1:date year="1967" day="3" month="1"><span style="">January 3, 1967</span></st1:date><span style="">, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motions for reconsideration filed in the

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Well settled in </span><span style="">this </span><span style="">jurisdiction is the rule that before filing a petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
the petitioner should first call the attention of the respondent judge and
afford him a chance or opportunity to correct his error, if any, in an
appropriate motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>An omission to comply with this procedural requirement justifies a
denial of the writ of <i>certiorari</i> applied for.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The reason for this rule is that issues,
which courts of first instance are bound to decide, should not be taken

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To be sure, there are
well-defined exceptions to the foregoing rule, <u>e</u>.<u>g</u>. (a) where the
question of</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">jurisdiction has been squarely raised, argued
before, submitted to, and met and decided by the respondent court; (b) where
the questioned order is a patent nullity; and (c) where there is a deprivation
of the petitioner's fundamental right to due process.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Not one of these exceptions, however,
obtains in the instant case, as will be shown later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This Court has held,
likewise, that where the petitioner filed his petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
without waiting for the resolution of his motion for reconsideration in the
lower court, the writ cannot be granted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For, if there is an appeal or other adequate remedy, like a motion for
reconsi­deration, which is still pending in the court below, the petition for <i>certiorari</i>
should be denied.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The respondent Judge did
not commit a grave abuse of discretion when he issued the questioned
orders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Grave abuse </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">discretion, another require­ment in order that the instant </span><span style="">petition </span><span style="">for <i>certiorari</i> may prosper, "implies such capricious </span>and
whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction, or, in
other words, where the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by
reason of passion or personal hostility, and it must be so patent and gross as
to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the
duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
But the respondent Judge's orders are not claimed to have been motivated by
passion and personal hostility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are
not despotic or arbitrary but were prompted by justifiable grounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A perusal of the questioned orders and the
circumstances under which they were issued will show that the respondent Judge
did not gravely abuse his discretion in issuing them.</p>

orders for the enforcement and implementation of the contracts of sale and/or
instructions to the <u>LEI</u> Receiver to implement and enforce the sales
agreement, is the <span class="SpellE">abovequoted</span> provision of the
Compromise Agreement of </span><st1:date year="1964" day="13" month="5"><span style="">May 13, 1964</span></st1:date><span style=""> which has been properly approved by the
respondent court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In issuing the said
orders, the respondent court only implemented a </span><span style="">covenant </span><span style="">which had been
long agreed and approved by the said court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioner has no cause to complain in the implementation of the
rights of other parties to the Compromise Agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties thereto (except the LEI) had
agreed to allow the petitioner to implement the entire US$1 million.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This alloca­tion, except for the remaining

notified the said parties that the <span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span> had
already set aside US$789,600, made available under the 9th and 10th year
reparations schedule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Knowing that the

$188,251.21, the parties filed their motions for implementation ex­-<span class="SpellE">parte</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No notice was
given to the petitioner because he was not going to be affected by any ruling

since the orders partake of the nature of (or are technically) motions for
execution based on a compromise agreement which had been judicially approved,
the respondent court did not act with grave abuse of discretion in issuing the

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, during the
hearing of </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Panay's</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">motion
on October 22, 1966, the respondent court granted the request of the
petitioner's counsel that he be given five days to file his opposition to the
motion and the court made it clear, and it was agreed in open court, that after
the expiration of the said period, the incident would be deemed submitted for
resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the respondent
court acted correctly when it resolved the motion after the expiration of the
five-day period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as earlier stated,
his motion for reconsideration of the order of </span><st1:date year="1966" day="2" month="11"><span style="">November 2, 1966</span></st1:date><span style=""> is still pending because the petitioner came
up to this Court on a petition for <i>certiorari</i> before his motion could be
resolved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With reference to the
order of November 11, 1966, the petitioner was given ample opportunity to be
heard on the propriety of the said order when his motion for reconsideration
which he filed on November 14, 1966 was given due course by the respondent
court, and which, together with the oppositions thereto filed by the <u>LEI</u>
on November 24, 1966 and by <u>Keyser</u> on November 25, 1966, was properly
heard and ventilated on November 26, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, before the respondent court could resolve his motion, the
petitioner brought up the instant petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner claims
that <u>Keyser</u> has no more contract to be implemented because under an
agreement executed by them on January 8, 1965, the petitioner sold an
additional $300,000 worth of photographic supplies to <u>Keyser</u> in
consideration of which <u>Keyser</u> had in effect agreed to release the
petitioner from any obligation under the Compromise Agreement of May 13, 1964
to recognize <u>Keyser's</u> contract of $120,000 with the <u>LEI</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Paragraph 7 of the contract of </span><st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="1"><span style="">January
 8, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, cited by
the petitioner to support his allegation that <u>Keyser</u> had revoked its
$120,000 contract with the <u>LEI</u>, provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"7. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Keyser
and <span class="SpellE">Cochingyan</span> </span>(the petitioner) agree that
this agreement even (sic) not approved <span style="">by
the court, revokes and super</span>cedes any and all agreements, undertakings
and arrangements heretofore made and entered into between them."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">A
cursory perusal of the above paragraph will show that there is nothing therein
which suggests a renunciation by <u>Keyser</u> of its $120,000 contract with
the <u>LEI</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contract of </span><st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="1"><span style="">January
 8, 1965</span></st1:date><span style=""> is an
agreement of <u>Keyser</u> with the petitioner, and not with the <u>LEI</u>;
therefore, it has no application whatsoever to the enforcement of the agreement
between the <u>LEI</u> and <u>Keyser</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is clearly mis­leading to allege that by virtue of the said contract,
the agreement between the <u>LEI</u> and <u>Keyser</u> is no longer
enforceable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Keyser</u>, therefore,
has all the right to have its $120,000 contract with the <u>LEI</u> impl</span>e<span style="">mented.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was the basis of the order of </span><st1:date year="1966" day="11" month="11"><span style="">November 11, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner claims
that he has a right to be heard in any motion which any of the respondents may
file by reason of the fact that he is a buyer of the US$4 million <span class="SpellE"><u>PVL</u></span>-<u>LEI</u> allocation under his February 7, 1964
contract with the <u>LEI</u>, and that he is an assignee of <u>Filipinas</u>
for US$4 million of the <span class="SpellE"><u>PVL</u></span>-<u>LEI</u>
allocation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he overlooks the fact
that by reason of the Compromise Agreement of May 13, 1964, <span class="SpellE"><u>Eguia</u></span>,
<span class="SpellE"><u>Panay</u></span>, <span class="SpellE"><u>Magno</u></span>,
<u>Worldwide</u> and <u>Keyser </u>agreed to allow him to buy all the goods
procured under Resolution 396 of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span>
in the amount </span>of US$1 million, provided their respective contracts of
purchase with the <u>LEI</u> will be implemented against the balance <span style="">of </span>the <span class="SpellE"><u>PVL</u></span>-<u>LEI</u>
allocation of US$4 million, <u>i</u>.<u>e</u>., the allocation made available
in addition to the first US$1 million.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, his Compromise Agreement with <u>Filipinas</u> dated <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1965</st1:date> takes favorable
cognizance of the <st1:date year="1964" day="13" month="5">May 13, 1964</st1:date>
Compromise Agreement with other parties because it provides that it (the
agreement with Filipinas) must "be implemented in relation to and
harmoniously with the Compromise Agreement between <span class="SpellE">Cochingyan</span>
and the other buyer-claimants of <span class="SpellE">PVL</span>/LEI." In
fact, when Branch I of the Court of First Instance of Manila approved the
Filipinas-<span class="SpellE">Cochingyan</span> contract, it ordered the <u>LEI</u>
Receiver -?</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> to
implement the contract of LEI and <span class="SpellE">Cochingyan</span> dated
February 7, 1964, pursuant to the Compromise Agreement of May 13, 1964 approved
by this Court in its Order of June 1, 1964 and the Compromise Agreement of <span class="SpellE">Cochingyan</span> and Filipinas of September 30, 1965 and finally
the parties to said compromise agreements are hereby enjoined to comply with
the terms and the conditions thereof."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Finally, the order of
January 3, 1967 was issued on motion of the <u>LEI</u> Receiver upon the re­quest
of the <u>LEI</u> which </span><span style="">had </span><span style="">to</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">take such legal step,
otherwise it could be held liable for damages and could be exposed to lawsuits
which the parties-buyers might file against it for specific perform­ance of
their clearly established rights, should </span>the Receiver fail to implement
their respective contracts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather than
risk the certainty of incurring expenses and facing court litigations, the <u>LEI</u>
saw the need to write the Receiver to obtain instructions from the court to
submit firm offers to satisfy the requirements of the parties-buyers pursuant
to the Compromise Agreement of <st1:date year="1964" day="13" month="5">May 13,
 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We likewise fail to
see any abuse of dis­cretion on the part of the respondent court in issuing
this order.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is not, however,
difficult to imagine why the petitioner is vigorously objecting to the
implementation of the contracts of other parties with the <u>LEI</u> on the
balance of US$3 million of the <span class="SpellE"><u>PVL</u></span>-<u>LEI</u>
allocation which is </span>now <span style="">authorized
in the sum of $1.5 million, $789,600 of which was already made available under
the 9th and 10th year reparations schedule, as aforesaid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In October 1966, he sneaked out of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">, and, with­out informing the other parties,
went to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Japan</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> and entered into contracts with various Japanese firms over the amount
of US$789,600 for goods other than those that </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Panay</span></u></span></st1:place><span style="">,<u> <span class="SpellE">Magno</span></u>, <span class="SpellE"><u>Eguia</u></span> </span><span style="">and
</span><u><span style="">Keyser</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">would
want to order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Naturally, if out of the
amount of US$789,600, only the sum of US$135,000 (corres­ponding to the share
of </span><u><span style="">Worldwide</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">which
the latter assigned to him) will be awarded to him, and the </span>rest to <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Panay</span></u></span><span style="">, <u>Keyser</u>, <span class="SpellE"><u>Eguia</u></span>
</span>and <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Magno</span></u></span><span style="">, </span>then he would be placed in a very
embarrassing position and would lose face with the various Japanese firms with
which he <span class="SpellE">unauthorizedly</span> entered into contracts.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Let us now consider the
questioned order of </span><st1:date year="1966" day="28" month="12"><span style="">December 28, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pursuant to the Compromise Agreement of February 17, 1966 and the
supplement thereto of the same date, the petitioner, for and in consideration
of the rights and interests in the reparations goods which </span><u><span style="">Worldwide</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">and <span class="SpellE">Torrefranca</span>
had assigned to him, obligated himself to pay to the latter P0.85 for every
US$1.00 of the said goods released to him up to the amount of P600,000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the first release obtained by the</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">petitioner
following the date of execution of the said agreement, he paid what was due to </span><u><span style="">Worldwide</span></u> and <span class="SpellE">Torrefranca</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on the subsequent releases of goods,
he began proving himself short of expectation in the religious performance of
his obligations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He started paying <u><span style="">Worldwide </span></u>way off the period of 30
days from his receipt of the goods, with checks post-dated at that, for a
period of from 60 to 120 days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On many
occasions, the <span style="">petitioner, in spite of
the demands made on him by <u>Worldwide</u>, refused to pay, and because of
such refusal, the latter was compelled to file numerous motions with the
respondent court for it to order the petitioner to pay <u>Worldwide</u> its
legal claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, upon an ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> motion filed by <u>Worldwide</u>, the respondent
court issued the questioned order of </span><st1:date year="1966" day="28" month="12"><span style="">December 28, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner impugns
this order on the ground that it is contrary to and in violation of the meaning
and intention of the Compromise Agree­ment of </span><st1:date year="1966" day="17" month="2"><span style="">February 17, 1966</span></st1:date><span style=""> which he admits is binding upon the parties
and <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the said compromise agreement and the
supplement thereto define the right of <u>Worldwide</u> and <span class="SpellE">Torrefranca</span>
to be paid P0.85 per US$1.00 of reparations goods released to the petitioner
and the latter's obligation to make such payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since both paragraphs 1 of the aforementioned
two documents alleged by the petitioner to have been violated, do not speak of
a right on his part, but on the contrary, define his obligation to pay, <u>ergo</u>
there is no violation of the petitioner's right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">He insists, however, that
it violates the provision of the compromise agreement granting him a period of
30 days within which to pay <u>Worldwide </u>and <span class="SpellE">Torrefranca</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The penal clause of the compromise agreement
states that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the event that <span class="SpellE">Cochingyan</span>
shall fail to pay any amounts due Worldwide, Joaquin So and <span class="SpellE">Torrefranca</span>
for any shipment that would have arrived, then said unpaid amount shall
constitute a lien on all subsequent shipments and the same shall not be released
to <span class="SpellE">Cochingyan</span> until all unpaid arrears shall have
been paid..."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Since
the petitioner has still an unpaid account in favor of <u>Worldwide</u> and <span class="SpellE">Torrefranca</span> for goods released to him in the first and
second weeks of November 1966, <u>Worldwide</u> could have availed itself of
the above penalty clause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it chose
to be more liberal and selected the less onerous way of enforcing its rights
through an early payment of its claim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If harsher remedies could be made use of by <u>Worldwide</u>, there
should be no reason why it cannot resort to a lighter penalty or remedy in
order to enforce its rights.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Indeed, the order merely
seeks the implementation by the <u>LEI</u> Receiver of an obligation unper­formed
by the petitioner in favor of a party to which he is obligated to pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order was not an amendment to the
agreement because the 30-day period within which to make payments includes the
day of release of the goods, the day following and up to the end of the said
period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the <u>LEI</u> Receiver
had been appointed by the respondent court to protect the interests of the
parties by carrying out the provisions of the various compro­mise agreements
that are </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">res</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">judicata</span></u></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Surely, there is no more expeditious and effective protection that the
Receiver could provide than the earliest delivery of whatever belongs to a
party whose interest he is supposed to protect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After all, there is no reason why the portion of the money realized from
the goods which by right has to be paid to <u>Worldwide</u> should be kept in
the Receiver's possession for 30 days.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the Receiver had agreed to pay the rightful claim of a party at an
earlier date but well within the period for making such payment, this is far
from censurable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the court which
authorized such cannot be faulted because it was merely serving the cause of
justice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is <u>apropos</u> to
mention at this juncture that, with respect to the reparations goods that he
has already taken away, the petitioner has not yet paid all his monetary
obligations to the different veterans organizations and persons and entities
who/which are to share in the proceeds of the sale of the goods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, as far back as January 4, 1967, Col. <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> B. Garcia, president and chairman of the Board of
the <u>LEI</u>, wrote the <u>LEI</u> Receiver, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Clapano</span>
(Annex 13, Receiver's Motion dated June 21, 1969, pp. 1124-1126, Vol. III, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) that the petitioner had the following outstanding
obligations, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1. P106,394.32 -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>representing amounts due the various
veterans organizations;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P 6,000.00<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>representing the share payable to
the LEI;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. P988,000.00
-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>representing the exchange rate
difference of P1.90 per US$1.00 payable by the LEI to the <span class="SpellE">Repacom</span>
should the payment at free market rate be upheld;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P25,000.00<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- representing P0.30 per US$1.00 payable to <u>Filipinas</u>, which constitutes
a lien on all importations of consumer goods by the LEI;</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P40,000.00<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>-<span style="">&nbsp; </span> representing P0.25 per US$1.00
settlement in favor of the Joaquin So group; and <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P13,000.00<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- <span style=""> </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>representing P0.85 per US$1.00 settlement in
favor of <u>Worldwide</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">In
fact, the respondent court had repeatedly warned the petitioner to pay his
obligations to the other parties in this case, pursuant to the various com­promise
agreements--to no avail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As far </span><span style="">as</span><span style=""> the </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span> <span style="">is </span><span style="">concerned, the peti­tioner does not owe it any amount, except that --
as hereafter to be discussed -- he </span><span style="">is
</span><span style="">obliged to replace the
performance bonds guaranteeing the payment to the </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span>
<span style="">of the difference between the free
market rate of exchange and the old rate of exchange of P2.00 to $1.00 in
connection with the f.o.b. value of the reparations goods he procured for some
end-users.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner also
denounces the order of </span><st1:date year="1966" day="19" month="12"><span style="">December 19, 1966</span></st1:date><span style=""> which denied the <span class="SpellE"><u>PVL's</u></span>
motion for reconsideration on the reinstatement of the <u>LEI</u> receivership,
relieved as receiver Atty. Mariano L. Mercado, and appointed as the new <u>LEI</u>
Receiver Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ireneo</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Clapano</span>,
Jr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A flashback of the events which
preceded the issuance of the said order will show that the petitioner has
absolutely no reason to complain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The respondent court, by
virtue of an ex-­<span class="SpellE">parte</span> motion of the petitioner,
issued, on </span><st1:date year="1966" day="14" month="10"><span style="">October 14, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, an order appointing Atty. Mercado as the
new <u>LEI</u> Receiver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither the
motion for the appointment of Atty. Mercado as the <u>LEI</u> Receiver, nor the
order granting the said motion, was made known to the other parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the said parties learned about them,
and upon their motions, the respondent court gave all the parties the chance to
be heard and present their candidates for the position if they wished, although
the court is vested with the sole power to select a receiver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After considering the arguments of all
parties whose rights and interests could be affected thereby, the respondent
court reconsidered its order of </span><st1:date year="1966" day="14" month="10"><span style="">October 14, 1966</span></st1:date><span style=""> by explicitly revoking the appointment of
Atty. Mariano L. Mercado and appointing Atty. <span class="SpellE">Clapano</span>
as the <u>LEI</u> Receiver in its order of </span><st1:date year="1966" day="19" month="12"><span style="">December 19, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Certainly, there is no
logic in the petitioner's assertion that the order of </span><st1:date year="1966" day="19" month="12"><span style="">December
 19, 1966</span></st1:date><span style=""> should be
held null and void while the order of </span><st1:date year="1966" day="14" month="10"><span style="">October 14, 1966</span></st1:date><span style=""> should be valid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He cannot accept a court's prerogative to
appoint a receiver, on the one hand, and refuse to admit its power to revoke
such appointment, on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power
of a court vested in it by law to appoint a receiver necessarily carries with
it the power to revoke the said appoint­ment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And although the final selection of a receiver is vested solely in a
court, it is also proper for a judge to receive advice from parties interested
in the trust.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In this case, the respondent court gave
opportunity to all the parties to agree on a person who could be qualified as a
receiver and is supported by at least a majority, if not by all of the
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, except the petitioner,
there is no organization or person who openly objects to the continuation of
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Clapano</span> as the <u>LEI</u> Receiver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, his appointment, as the order of </span><st1:date year="1966" day="19" month="12"><span style="">December

been made by virtue of the <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> of the
majority of the parties to this case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Besides, the revocation
of the appointment of </span>Atty. <span style="">Mercado
as the </span><u>LEI</u> Receiver was not <span style="">without
sufficient basis, as shown by the well-reasoned order of the respondent court
which states, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<blockquote>"... Further, this Court notes and has observed that the

des­pite several incidents in these cases from the date of his appointment, as
to his position on the several conflicting claims of the various opposing
parties in these cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these
circumstances, the Court is inclined to give credence to one of the parties'
claim that Atty. Mercado's old age, his having retired from the judiciary and
is residing (sic) in <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, may be a handicap in the
faithful and rigorous implementation of the veterans reparations allocation and
in the discharge of his duties as receiver.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court needs a receiver who is physically active, with sufficient
knowledge and experience."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">In
fact, during his entire tenure, Atty. Mercado never visited the <u>LEI</u>
offices, nor had he consulted with the <u>LEI</u> officers to find out how he
could best serve the organization he was representing as receiver.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The position of <u>LEI</u> Receiver should be given to one who is
not only physically fit, but as well knows the case, the parties, and the
procedure at the <span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span> -- in the words of
the respondent Court, one "who is physically active, with sufficient know­ledge
and experience." The petitioner himself admits that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Clapano</span> has been trained in the ramifications of
reparations business and is familiar with the transactions in connection
therewith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For about four years, <span class="SpellE">Clapano</span> was the technical assistant to the then Executive
Director, now Commissioner Mauricio O. Bas of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was so capable in screening procurement
orders and studying the different legal aspects of every transaction involving
the <span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span> that Executive Director Bas would
not sign any procurement order or other communication unless initialed by
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Verily, the knowledge and
experience of <span class="SpellE">Clapano</span> in reparations matters would prove
invaluable to the <u>LEI</u> and its buyers.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner's argument
that <span class="SpellE">Clapano</span> is not qualified to perform the duties
of the <u>LEI</u> Receiver because he has been his former employee and legal
counsel and therefore privy to his trade secrets, deserves scant attention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The p</span><span style="">e</span><span style="">titioner concedes that
he had already virtually dismissed <span class="SpellE">Clapano</span>,
therefore, their relation as counsel and client no longer exists.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>" ... An attorney is not disqualified where the relation of
attorney and client has terminated before the appointment, or where, although
he is attorney for another judgment creditor or defendant, he is not attorney
for the judgment creditor who applied for the receivership; and, a fortiori,

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Clapano</span></span><span style=""> can no longer act as the petitioner's counsel in any of his cases even
if the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> name has not yet been deleted as
counsel of record. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>It is the
petitioner's fault that although he had dismissed <span class="SpellE">Clapano</span>
as counsel, he (the petitioner) has not given his written consent for <span class="SpellE">Clapano</span> to withdraw as his counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even this refusal to give his written
consent is of no moment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having exercised
the universally recognized right of a client to terminate the relation between
himself and his counsel, which can be done at any time and for any cause, it is
absurd for the petitioner to aver that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Clapano</span>
must obtain his written consent before the latter can withdraw as his
counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Clapano</span> has filed a pleading in the court below wherein he
disavowed any further connection or relation with the peti­tioner and denied
that he is still the petitioner's counsel in any case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, no prejudice was caused to the
petitioner's rights because he was being represented by a chief counsel (Atty. <span class="SpellE">Patajo</span>) at that time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, there is no proof that the respondent Receiver has acquired
trade secrets which he is now adversely using against the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the records show that the
respondent Receiver has given his confor­mity to many motions of the
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it is strange that
the complaint and opposition against the appointment of <span class="SpellE">Clapano</span>
as the <u>LEI</u> Receiver should emanate from the petitioner's corner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be the other respondents who would
logically express fear and apprehension in the appointment as <u>LEI</u>
Receiver of a former counsel of the adverse party, the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, he might side with his former
employer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is thus clear that
petitioner has not made out a cause against the appointment of <span class="SpellE">Clapano</span> as receiver.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But while the court below judiciously revoked Mercado's appointment and
in his stead appointed <span class="SpellE">Clapano</span>, it would do well for
the court, considering the various incidents in the case, to exercise a tighter
supervision over the new receiver in order to forestall any charge of
unfairness or partiality from any source, always having in mind that a receiver
is to be regarded as the arm, officer or representative of the court; that his
contracts and liabilities are, in contemplation of law, the contracts and
liabilities of the court and that, as a necessary consequence, the receiver is
subject to the control and supervision of the court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The exercise of a close
supervision over the present receiver augurs a more advantageous alter­native
to considering again the appointment of a new one in place of <span class="SpellE">Clapano</span> for this latter course would again entail delay in
the disposition of this case and, consequently, delay also in the remittance of
the proceeds from the sale of the reparations goods to the "Trust

and orphans.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the reparations goods and dispose of part of the same for the maintenance and
expenses of the corporation (LEI).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
the petitioner filed his supplemental petition for <i>certiorari</i> impugning
the said order as issued in excess of jurisdiction and with grave abuse of
discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the parties to this

permanently disqualified the petitioner from further dealing or transacting
with the </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span> <span style="">relative to the procurement of reparations

entitled "United Disabled Veterans Association of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>

bond approved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the said

conditions imposed by <span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span> Resolution 43
(69), the permanent disqualification imposed on him by <span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span>
Resolution 243 (68) was automatically restored.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's financial incapability and incapacity, and his
failure to replace the worthless bonds, are the principal grounds why the <span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span><u> </u>refuses to allow him to <span class="SpellE">requalify</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
aside from the <span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom's</u></span> own knowledge,
obtained through its own investigations, that the petitioner has been
implicated in the falsification of the list of the goods to be imported through
reparations as approved by the National Economic Council; likewise, in the
complaint of the United Disabled Veterans Association of the Philippines (<span class="SpellE">UDVAP</span>) that goods procured for its use had been pilfered,
the petitioner is implicated in the pilferage (Annexes 1, 2, 3 and 3-1,
Receiver's Reply dated September 19, 1970 to petitioner's comments).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the aforesaid <span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span>
investigation, it was disclosed that the list of goods approved by the National
Economic Council for importation via reparations cover was substituted with
another which included banned items.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
list was contained in the second page of a 3-page letter of the Council <span style="">to the <span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The receiving clerk testified in the
investigation that petitioner <span class="SpellE"><u>Cochingyan</u></span> had
approached and requested her to stamp a second copy </span><span style="">of the letter </span><span style="">which <span class="SpellE"><u>Cochingyan</u></span> had brought, with </span>the
date of receipt similar to the original copy, and that she had overheard petitioner
and a certain Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Alcala</span>, who was the clerk's
superior, talking about the necessity of using a typewriter and a kind of paper
similar to the ones used in the original copy of the letter ("<span class="SpellE">dapat</span> <span class="SpellE">parehong</span> <span class="SpellE">papel</span>, <span class="SpellE">parehong</span>
typewriter").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Laborers under <span style="">the employ </span>of the petitioner executed
affidavits pointing to petitioner as the one who directed and supervised them
in taking away reparations goods on specified dates from various warehouses; <span style="">they </span>narrated in detail how they
unpacked boxes, loaded their contents in petitioner's waiting car and closed
the boxes to make them appear as though they had not been emptied of their
contents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A case for theft had been
filed with the office of the city fiscal of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
against petitioner and other persons who appeared to have participated in the
pilferage.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The first initial
disqualification of the petitioner had something to do with the more than </span><span style="">US$500,000 </span><span style="">worth of reparations goods which were released to him, through the then
<u>LEI</u> Receiver, Atty. Ramon M. <span class="SpellE">Velayo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court allowed the then <u>LEI</u>
Receiver <span class="SpellE">Velayo</span> to take delivery of the goods and
release the same to the petitioner on condition that the latter should file a
bond to be </span>approved by the court to insure that the P1.90 <span style="">difference between the old rate and the free
market rate would be paid by the petitioner the moment it would be finally
ruled that the rate of exchange should be the free market rate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These bonds posted by the <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span>
Insurance Co., Inc., which have now become worthless, are the same bonds which
the <span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span> required the petitioner to be
replaced by other bonds to be issued by qualified bonding companies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For the reasons above
stated, the petitioner is no longer qualified to handle the reparations goods
procured for the <span class="SpellE"><u>PVL</u></span>/<u>LEI</u> now stored at
the piers an</span><span style="">d in </span><span style="">different bonded warehouses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Consequently, on March
21, 1969, the <u>LEI</u> Receiver filed a motion followed by a supplement
thereto filed on July 28, 1970, praying this Court (a) to </span><span style="">authorize him to </span><span style="">sell the reparations goods (now </span><span style="">in s</span><span style="">torage at </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">piers and </span><span style="">in different bonded warehouses) upon the grounds that these goods,

Trust Fund which under Republic Act No. 3518 (Veterans Bank Act) shall be im­mediately
paid and transmitted to the Philippine Veterans Bank to form a portion of the
capitalization of said bank; that any delay in the generation of said trust fund
will necessarily result in the delay in the transmittal of the proceeds to the
Philippine Veterans Ban, to the prejudice of the intended beneficiaries, the
Filipino Veterans, their widows and orphans</u>; that in the light of the fact
that reparations consumer goods are payable in cash, and until so paid remain
the property of the Government, and the amounts so paid are constituted into
the Veterans Trust Fund, the interest of conflicting claimants should be
confined to whatever margin profits there may be after payment of the value of
the goods is made to the Reparations Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Accordingly, in the expeditious pro­curement

just, fair, valid and reasonable that the Receiver's motion be given due

<p class="BODY">It must be noted that it has been and still is the policy of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span> that all reparations goods must be sold and
released under a "no selective release scheme" or <span class="SpellE"><u>pakiao</u></span>
to one person or entity, provided that before actual release is made, the costs

</span>Reparations goods intended for veterans are payable in cash, and, until

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner's
position, however, is that this Court can not act on the <u>LEI</u> Receiver's
motions because by virtue of its resolution dated July 15, 1968 granting his
petition for withdrawal of his supplemental petition for <i>certiorari</i>, the
reparations goods in question ceased to be the subject of any action pending
before this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not subscribe
to this argument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we issued the
resolution of </span><st1:date year="1968" day="15" month="7"><span style="">July 15, 1968</span></st1:date><span style=""> which should have paved the way for the
delivery to the petitioner of the goods kept at the piers and in customs bonded
warehouses, he was still legally and fully qualified to take delivery
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on </span><st1:date year="1968" day="13" month="11"><span style="">November
 13, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">, by
Resolution 243 (68), the <span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span> permanently
disqualified him from further dealing or transacting with it relative to the
procure­ment of reparations goods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
his application, the <span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span>, in Resolution 43
(69) of </span><st1:date year="1969" day="14" month="2"><span style="">February 14, 1969</span></st1:date><span style="">, temporarily lifted his permanent disqualification upon the conditions
specified in the said resolution, but he failed to comply therewith, causing
the automatic restoration of his permanent disqualification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner cannot now, therefore, take
delivery of the reparations goods since he has not taken any steps to lift his
permanent disqualification -- one of which is an appeal to the Office of the
President from the refusal of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span> to
accept the substi­tute bonds he had submitted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, there is a
legal impediment to allowing the petitioner to <span class="SpellE">requalify</span>
himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the Reparations Law (Rep.
Act 1789, as amended), it is the <span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span> which
specifically defines the qualifications and determines who are qualified to
take delivery of the reparations goods, and unless clear abuse is shown in the
exercise of such function, courts should not interfere therewith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the <span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span>
is the entity vested by law to "ascertain and verify that the applicant
concerned has enough financial resources and capacity to pay" (Sec. </span><span style="">6 [</span><span style="">a-1], <span class="SpellE">R.A</span>. 1789 as amended), and "to
provide for the care, custody, protection and proper delivery to end-users of
all such reparations goods as provided in this Act" (Sec. 6 d, Id.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span>
is like­wise the entity vested with authority "to hear and decide all
questions and controversies regarding the rules and regulations which it shall
issue to carry out the purposes of this Act, its decisions in all such cases
being <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> directly to the President"
(Sec. 6 h, Id.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the <span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span> has disqualified perma­nently and totally
the petitioner from further dealing o</span>n reparations matters, and this
disqualification has not been appealed by the petitioner to the President, this
Court can not extend any relief in the matter of the petitioner's efforts to <span class="SpellE">requalify</span> himself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, since the <span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span> is neither a
signatory nor a party to any of the various compromise agreements executed by
the private parties-buyers, it cannot be compelled to deliver the goods to
parties it sees unfit to receive them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It cannot be bound by any stipulation of the various agreements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the peti­tioner cannot
therefore assert or claim an absolute right over the goods, as in fact he
admits that "his rights did not spring from his dealings with the
Reparations Commission but from his dealings with LEI" (Par. 2, page 2,
Petitioner's Comments on the Supple­mental Manifestations of the Reparations
Commission).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, unless they are fully
paid for in cash (f.o.b. costs of goods and expenses of procurement), the <span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span> is the absolute owner of the goods in
question, although the same are being procured for the <span class="SpellE"><u>PVL</u></span>/<u>LEI</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The issuance by this
Court of its resolution of </span><st1:date year="1968" day="15" month="7"><span style="">July 15, 1968</span></st1:date><span style=""> was implicitly conditioned upon the
petitioner's ability and qualification to take delivery of the goods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being now bereft of such ability and
qualification, he cannot avail himself of the said resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, this Court still has
jurisdiction over the said goods, and can and will favorably act on the <u>LEI</u>
Receiver's motion to sell the same, upon the conditions to be hereinafter set
forth, impelled only by the thought that this will best serve public interest
and the interests of the widows and orphans for whose benefit the Veterans
Trust Fund is sought to be generated; and that no prejudice in any way will
result to any of the parties, including the petitioner, because the money to be
realized from the sale of the reparations goods will be deposited with a stable
and reputable bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, we see no
legal impediment to this </span>Court ordering the implementation of the remainder
of the US$1 million allocation in the amount of US$188,251.21.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Finally, the petitioner
vigorously objects to the advance payment made by the <span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span>
of ware­housing fees at the rate of P0.50 per ton per day, alleging that it
should be P0.07 per ton per day as agreed upon between him and the Reliance
Warehousing &amp; Commercial Co., Inc. as allegedly approved by the </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The facts, however, do not support the
petitioner's stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that when
the repa­rations goods released to the petitioner through the then <u>LEI</u>
Receiver Atty. <span class="SpellE">Velayo</span> and pertaining to the first
US$500,000 were about to arrive, the Reliance Warehousing &amp; Commercial Co.,
Inc. alone, among several warehouses, agreed to give a special rate of storage
charge to the <span class="SpellE"><u>PVL</u></span>-<u>LEI</u> at the rate now
claimed by the petitioner, on condition that the next incoming shipments of
reparations goods be also stored in the Reliance customs bonded warehouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is, however, no clear agreement that
the special rate claimed by the petitioner be also made applicable to the goods
now stored at the said warehouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
is no written agreement to this effect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As now contended by the Reliance Warehousing and concurred in by the <span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span>, the special rate of warehousing charges
then previously given was made applicable only to the goods previously stored
and long released.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to the
goods now at the warehouse, they should be charged at the rate now claimed by
the Reliance Warehousing and adopted by the <span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span>
because the said rate charge has been approved and fixed by the Bureau of
Customs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner has not
presented any written agreement or proved any verbal contract existing between
the parties in this case, on the one hand, and the Reliance Warehousing, on the
other, that the rate of warehousing charges be as claimed by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the <span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span>
acted correctly when it adopted Resolution 148 (68), dated August 14, 1968
(Annex 5, Receiver's Reply dated September 19, 1970 to petitioner's comments),
author­izing the release of the amount of P313,456.32 in favor of the Reliance
Warehousing &amp; Commercial Co., Inc. as warehousing charges, of which the
amount of P272,707.43 was released through a General Voucher (Annex 12,
Receiver's motion dated March 21, 1969, p. 1123, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>
III).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Considering all the
pleadings relative and relevant to the two above-mentioned motions of the </span><span style="">Receiver dated March 21, 1969 and July 28,
1970, respectively, and finding the reasons adduced by the said Receiver in his
said two motions, as well as the reasons stated in the manifestations of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Repacom</u></span>, valid and compelling, this Court hereby
creates a Committee to be composed of (a) Receiver <span class="SpellE">Ireneo</span>
R. <span class="SpellE">Clapano</span>, Jr., as chairman, (b) a representative to
be named without delay by the Reparations Commission, and (c) a representative
of the Court of First Instance of Manila (Branch VI) to be named without delay
by the Presiding Judge thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
Committee shall, with deliberate speed, and always under the guidance,
supervision and control of the Presiding Judge of Branch VI:</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

reparations goods above referred to (stored at the piers and in the bonded
warehouses), the dates of the making of such inventory to be communicated <span class="SpellE">priorly</span> to all the parties in this case who or which, at
their options, may send their respective representatives to attend and observe
the making of the inventory;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon as the final
and complete inventory shall have been finished, forthwith furnish this Court
fifteen (15) certified true copies thereof, signed by the chairman and the
members of the Committee and attested by the Presiding Judge;</p>

<p class="BODY">(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Immediately
thereafter, to proceed to sell all the said reparations goods, each sale to be
done either by public auction or by negotiation (negotiated sale), the manner
of sale in every case subject to the prior approval of the Presiding Judge,
always bearing in mind the primary objective of securing the best and/or highest
possible prices for the goods, in the <span style="">light
</span>of the particular or special environmental circumstances obtaining in
each case;</p>

<p class="BODY">(4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To report to the
Presiding Judge, as well <span style="">as </span>to
this Court, each sale as it is consummated, the report to contain precise information
as to (a) the date of the sale, (b) the kind of goods sold, (c) the quantity
thereof, (d) the nature of the sale, whether by public auction or by negotiated
sale, (e) the amount generated <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, and (f) the
name(s) and address(<span class="SpellE">es</span>) of the purchaser(s);</p>

<p class="BODY">(5)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To deliver the
proceeds of each sale to the Presiding Judge who is hereby directed to deposit
the same without delay with the Philippine Veterans Bank as a savings deposit
in the name of the Philippine Reparations Commission, the disposition thereof
to await the orders of this Court; and</p>

<p class="BODY">(6)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon as all the
said reparations goods shall have been sold, to submit to this Court a final
report attested by the Presiding Judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">All proper and necessary expenses incurred <span style="">by </span>the Committee in the discharge of
its functions and duties by virtue of this decision may, from time to time, be
authorized to be paid by the Presiding Judge from the sales proceeds, prior to
their being deposited with the Philippine Veterans Bank as herein-before
directed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the Reparations Commission shall file with this Court
a verified manifestation itemizing and detailing the charges, taxes and duties
that are due to it by virtue of the importation of the reparations goods in
question.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It appearing that to
require a bond from any of the respondents would be inequitable </span><span style="">because none </span><span style="">of them are in possession of the goods in question, nor have the power
to dispose of them, nor have </span>received any money proceeds by virtue of
their importation, the Court will not, require the posting of any bond by any
of the respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Reparations
Commission is hereby authorize </span>to take all proper and necessary steps to
