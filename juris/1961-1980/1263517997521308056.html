Industrial Relations denying, in effect, two motions, the first of twenty-one
members, in their own respect­ive individual right, of the petitioner union and
the second of the union as such, to reopen the case of un­fair labor practice
originally filed by said union, through its former set of officers and counsel,
purport­edly "for the implementation of (the) decision" of this
Supreme Court of October 30, 1962 in G. R. No. L-18112, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Kapisanan</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">mga</span>

the <span class="SpellE">disposi­tive</span> part of which reads thus:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is hereby reversed and
another one shall be entered ordering the Com­pany to cease and desist from further
unfair labor practices, to pay the members of the NAFLU who had been dis­criminated
against the difference bet­ween the compensation actually paid to them and that
which they would have re­ceived had there been no discrimina­tion, and to
reinstate the employees named above, with back wages from the time of their
dismissal until their actual reinstatement, with all of the rights and
privileges appertaining thereto, as well as to pay the costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"IT IS SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In substance, the main ground for the denial of said motions is
that after the above judgment became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
and the proceedings for its execution were be­ing undertaken, the case was
completely terminated when the union entered into a compromise agreement with
re­spondent company as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Resolving the incident, Judge Bautista granted the mo­tion for
reopening on <st1:date month="4" day="17" year="1964">April 17, 1964</st1:date>
in the following order:</p>

<blockquote>"The above-entitled case has been termi­nated by an Order of
this Court of December 28, 1963 based in turn on an agreement filed by the
parties, dated <st1:date month="12" day="24" year="1963">December 24, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="27" month="1">January
 27, 1964</st1:date> however, twenty (20) members of complainant filed an
Incidental Motion to <span class="GramE">Reopen</span> the case for the
implementation of the decision, through another attorney, not of re­cord, Atty.
Gregorio E. <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>, basing the Incidental Motion on
the provision of Section 17 of Act 103.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Attorney of Record, Fede­rico <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>
filed his Opposition to the In­cidental Motion basing his Opposition on said
contract between the parties in the above-entitled case, Annex 'A', and also <span class="SpellE">photostatic</span> copy of an alleged agreement of acceptance by
said twenty (20) members of the amount corres­ponding to them as per Annex 'B'
of said Opposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1964</st1:date>, <span class="GramE">respondents
filed their Opposition to Motion to Reopen Case for the implementation of
decision basing also their Opposition on Annex 'B' of complai­nant's Opposition
and on the allegation that the order of </span><st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="12"><span class="GramE">December 28, 1963</span></st1:date><span class="GramE"> has already be­come final and that Section 17 of Act 103 is</span>
no longer applicable in this case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"From the facts and arguments presented by the parties,
including that of the <span class="SpellE">Movants</span> this Court is of the
opinion and so hold:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That while this
Court approved, on December 28, 1963, the amicable settlement of the parties,
of December 24, 1963, it was on the assumption that there was no Opposition to
said contract, but it now appears that at least twenty (20) members of
complainant contend that they have no knowledge of nor consent to said
contract, and that the alleged Annex 'B' containing their signatures attached
to the Opposition of complainant was secured through fraud, and hence the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> contend that the agreement of the parties on
December 24, 1963 was null and void.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That</span>
without deciding for the present, in this Order, as to whether the claims of
the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> herein, are true and correct be­cause
said claims have not been ventilated in a hearing before this Court, yet this
Court, being not only a Court of law but also a Court of equity, appears to be
obliged to look deep­er into these claims by making a further in­vestigation
thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, such an
investigation, will not prejudice the interest of either parties in this case,
even if <span class="SpellE">movants</span> can prove their case, therein,
because the most that can result in such an investigation against the
respondents maybe an additional payment to <span class="SpellE">movants</span>
based on the decision of the Supreme Court in this case, in G.R. No. L-18112,
which after all is the original decision promulgated by said Court for
compliance by the parties in this case and in so far as the complainant is
concerned, compliance with the Supreme Court's decision by respondents will
result in more be­nefits to its members than what has been pro­vided in the
contract of the parties of December 24, 1963.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That</span>
while it may be true that the Order of this Court of December 28, 1963 has
become final and the present Incidental Motion was filed only on January 27,
1964, without a pre­vious Motion for Reconsideration of the Order, still the
Order is in full effect and Section 17 of Act 103 upon which this incidental
Motion is based partly provides as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">'SEC. 17.</span><span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="2Q">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Provided,
however, That at any time during the <u>effectiveness of an award, order or

due hear­ing, alter, modify in whole or in part, or set aside any such award,
order or decision, or reopen any question in­volved therein.' (Underscoring
ours)</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">so</span> that the
present Motion is sanctioned by said Section 17 of Act 103 and said provi­sion
of law is applicable in the present case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, considering that the agreement of the parties was filed on <st1:date month="12" day="24" year="1963">December 24, 1963</st1:date> while the Supreme
Court's decision in the above-entitled case was promulgated on <st1:date month="10" day="30" year="1962">Oct­ober 30, 1962</st1:date> in G. R. No.
L-18112, the fi­ling of the Motion to close this case on <st1:date month="12" day="24" year="1963">Dec­ember 24, 1963</st1:date> appears to be contrary to
ano­ther provision of Section 17 of Act 103 which states as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">'SEC. 17.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Limit effectiveness of award.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>--
An award, order or decision of the Court shall be valid and effect­ive during
the time therein specified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
absence of such specification, any party or both parties to a contro­versy may
terminate the effectiveness of an award, order or decision <u>after three years</u>
have elapsed from the date of said award, order or decision by giving notice to
that effect to the Court.' (Underscoring ours)</p>

<blockquote>because the effectiveness of the decision
of the Supreme Court was being terminated by the parties even before the three
(3) years period for the effectiveness of said decision which should terminate
only in December, 1965.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In view of the need for looking into the claims of the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> herein, which if true will affect the validity of
the contract of the parties of December 24, 1963, and consider­ing that Section
17 of Commonwealth Act 103, which has been enacted precisely to correct any
mistake or injustice in a final, but still effective decision, award or order
of this Court, as in the instant case, this Court is of the further opinion and
so holds that the Order of December 28, 1963, should be set aside and the case
be reopened for the submission of evidence from the parties in support of their
respective claims for final determination and action by this Court in this
case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the Order of this Court closing
this case, dated <st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="12">Decem­ber 28, 1963</st1:date>
is hereby set aside and <span class="SpellE">movants</span> Motion to <span class="GramE">Reopen</span> case should be, as it is hereby, GRANTED."

Fran­cisco <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> executed said agreement without the
knowledge of the members of the Union", hence the ruling of the court that
only a minority was seeking the reopening of the case could no longer
hold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was also alleged therein that
"this action of the complainant was not submitted in the initial stage of
the Motion to Reopen because it was but recently approved upon a change of
officers of the com­plainant Union and of its counsel" and that "this
motion is based on Rule 40 of the Rules of Court for a new hearing or new trial

<p class="BODY">On October 7, 1964, respondent court denied this pe­tition in the
second disputed <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> resolution, holding that (1) a motion for
new trial can be filed only against an order or judgment of a trial judge, and
not of the court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>; (2) the evidence offered was not newly
dis­covered, since it came into existence only after the reso­lution of July
22, 1964 and was an "afterthought" evidence intended to "cure or
remedy that which the court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> had ruled was not sufficient
to offset the legal effect of the compromise which settled the case"; and
(3) "the said evidence is intended to undo that which the complainant
union through its former president and the whole member­ship did when they
entered into the compromise agreement, for which they 'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
received payment in consideration and in virtue of the same.', simply because
complainant union is now led by a new set of officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And for a reason, <span class="SpellE">movants</span>
claimed 'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">That we did not know any­thing about the agreement

issue has already been squarely resolved."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It thus appears that while the respondent court considered that it was
against its policy not to entertain motions for reconsideration of <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
resolu­tions, nevertheless, it passed on the merits of petition­er's latest
motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated in the opening paragraph of this decision, petitioner
has appealed to this Court from the above <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> resolutions of <st1:date month="7" day="22" year="1964">July 22, 1964</st1:date> and <st1:date month="10" day="7" year="1964">October 7, 1964</st1:date> of respondent court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to petitioner:</p>

to this Honorable Supreme Court of the Resolution of the respondent Court in

Annex 'N' is whether sec­tion 17 of Act 103 is applicable to the facts and
circumstances of Case No. 1454-ULP of said Court and which issue has given rise
to the above 4 legal questions raised in this appeal."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The legal questions being referred to

Manifestation of respondent company Annex 'C' which <span class="SpellE">mo­vants</span>
for the Reopening of Case No. 1454 of the respondent Court asserted to be
prejudicial to their interest and an injustice on their part, can the
respondent Court refuse to apply Section 17 of Commonwealth Act 103 for the
reopening of said Case No. 1454 as prayed for by the <span class="SpellE">movants</span>
in Annex 'F' on the allegation in the Resolution of the Respondent Court of
July 22, 1964, (1) that the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> are in the
minority, (2) that they have not denied the signatures to their share of the
P20,000.00 payment made by the respondent company to the herein petitioner in
the alleged con­tract between the parties and (3) that the dismissal of the
case was legal citing the doctrine in 'Betting Ushers Union (PLUM) case, G. R.
No. L-9330, and the <span class="SpellE">Vedasto</span> <span class="SpellE">Jesalva</span>,

interpreted by the respondent Court in its said Order of July 22, 1964 Annex
'L' and even granting, without admit­ting, the correctness of said inter­pretation,
did not the respondent Court of Industrial Relations committed a grave abuse of
discretion in refusing to grant the Motion for New Hearing of petitioner filed
already in the name of full membership of petitioner union Annex 'M' precisely

the alleged contract between the parties which provided the basis for the Order
dismissing said case of Presiding Judge Bautista of December 26, 1963 was not
known to the members of the petitioner union and that their signatures were
gathered under fraud and misrepresentation which are grounds for <span class="SpellE">recission</span> of contracts un­der the Civil Code, did not respondent
Court of Industrial Relations committed again a grave abuse of discretion or
even a violation of the provision of the Civil Code in refusing to reopen the
case under Section 17, of Common­wealth Act 103 for verification of pe­titioner

Act 103 for the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of a decision of the

<p class="BODY">We have taken pains to recite in detail the material facts and
circumstances of this case because, as this is a labor case and We find this
appeal to be without sufficient merits, We can do no less than lay down clearly
and as ex­haustively as possible the bases of Our judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Cons­titution of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
ordains that "the State shall afford protection to labor" (Sec. 6,
Art. XIV) <span class="GramE">and</span> Article 24 of the Civil Code enjoins
that "in all contractual, pro­perty or other relations, when one of the
parties is at a disadvantage on account of his moral dependence, ignorance,
indigence, mental weakness, tender age or other handicap, the courts must be
vigilant for his protection."<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">More often than not labor is in such disadvantageous position.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not saying that other cases deserve
less attention and consideration, but where labor has to suffer an unfa­vorable
judgment, it is best that there be no silent pre­mises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is but consonant with the solicitous
concern for the interest of labor embodied in the constitutional and statutory
principles just quoted that if the courts find themselves in no position under
the law to grant what labor seeks, the reason or reasons for such a conclusion
should at least appear in black and white so that every­one may understand
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is, indeed, more reason to
adhere to these views in this case where there is a strong suggestion that the
parties interested in this appeal are allegedly victims, not only of respondent
company but, what is worse, by the former officers and counsel of petitioner
Union, who had entered into a compromise agreement allegedly disadvantageous to
the monetary interests of its members.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon this background of facts and considera­tions, the position
of petitioners is substantially as follows:<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent court
erred in not giving them the opportunity contemplated in Section 17 of
Commonwealth Act 103, to prove, even after the fi­nality of a judgment
approving the compromise in question, that said compromise "was not known
to them and that their signatures (thereon) were gathered under fraud and
misrepresentation", only be­cause they are in the minority in the union
and they did not deny their signatures in the said com­promise, considering,
specially, that their total claim for back wages could amount to P320,789.50,
as allegedly reflected in the court examiner's report or, at least,
P127,647.50, as allegedly contained in the counter-offer made by respondent
company, and, on the other hand, the only compromise settlement of their claim
respondents could show was for no more than P20,000;</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent court
erred even more when it maintained its refusal to reopen the case even after
petitioners had filed a motion for new trial "in the name of the full
membership of the petitioner-union"; and</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The approval of the
compromise in question to terminate the case before the expiration of three
years from October 30, 1962, the date of the decision of this Court in the main
unfair labor practice case, was illegal and contrary to the provisions of the
same Section 17 of Com. Act 103.</p>

<p class="BODY">No doubt, these issues are impressive and would connote a clear
injustice, if the circumstances alleged were true, but a careful review of the
records does not bear out the accuracy of the premises of petitioners'
grievances.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the main, what petitioners are here urging is exactly what the
reversed order of Judge Bautista of <st1:date month="4" day="17" year="1964">April
 17, 1964</st1:date> contemplated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
said order dis­posed that "in view of the need for looking into the claims
of the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> herein, which if true, will affect the
validity of the contract of the parties of December 24, 1963 x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the order of December 28,
1963 should be set aside and the case reopened for the submission of evidence
from the parties in support of their res­pective claims for final determination
and action by this Court in this case".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As already stated, however, the court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> viewed the
matter differently.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ins­tead of
postponing the "looking into the claims of the <span class="SpellE">movants</span>"
to await further hearing, it immediately looked into said claims practically on
their merits and arrived at the fundamental findings that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) petitioners, meaning the individual ones
who filed the initial plead­ing in the incident herein involved, did not deny
having signed the compromise agreement; (2) much less did they deny having
received their share of the P20,000 paid by the respondent company in virtue of
the said compromise; and (3) said petitioners are only a minority of the
original signers of the compromise agreement which was a collective act of the
union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are findings of fact which <span class="GramE">We</span> are not to take lightly, much less at liberty to
disregard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, they are
binding upon this Court unless clearly shown to be unsup­ported by substantial
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no such showing in
this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the question before
<span class="GramE">Us</span> now is whether or not in the light of these facts,
the respondent court committed an error of law in overruling petitioners'
persistent efforts to reopen the proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">To resolve this main issue, it may be necessary to also resolve
in the same discussion the claim of petitioners that after the respondent court
belittled, as it were, their capacity as a minority to secure relief against
the finality of the compromise agreement, they tried to ask for a new trial
"in the name of the full membership of the petitioner-union and still the
respondent court remained adamant in refusing to reopen the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The points related to these two matters are
so intertwined that to discuss them separately may un­duly extend this opinion
and perhaps, even make the dis­cussion repetitious.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' motion for new trial was denied by respondent court
in its order reading as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"There is no question that this Motion seeks for the
reconsidera­tion of the <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> Resolution of <st1:date month="7" day="22" year="1964">July 22, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was even ad­mitted by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span> at
the hear­ing on <st1:date month="8" day="27" year="1964">August 27, 1964</st1:date>
(pp. 29 to 30, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date month="8" day="27" year="1964">August 27, 1964</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is, however, the policy of the Court sitting <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
not to enter­tain such kind of motions, having consistently ruled that only
deci­sions and/or orders of the trial court may be subjects of a motion for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even as said
counsel has himself recognized (p. 30, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. of
August 27, 1964) this to be the policy, still he con­tends that the motion is
cognizable by the Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> pursuant to Rule 40 of the Rules
of Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This cited Rule of the Rules of Court is not in point, a fact
admit­ted by counsel for <span class="SpellE">movants</span> at the hearing on <st1:date month="8" day="27" year="1964">August 27, 1964</st1:date>, after counsel for
respondents pointed out that what probably was meant was Rule 37 of the Rules
of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the provisions of Rule 37
of the New Rules of Court are appli­cable only to trial courts and not to the
Court sitting <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, the newly discovered evi­dence (Annex 'A') relied upon to
reopen the case is not such kind of evidence contemplated in Sec­tion 1(b) of
the said Rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, the
evidence (Annex 'A') is nothing but an attempt to cure or remedy that which the
Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> had ruled was not sufficient to offset the legal
effect of the compromise agreement which settled the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an 'after-thought' evidence, to say the
least.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the second place, the said
evidence (Annex 'A') is intended to undo that which the complainant union
through its former president and the whole membership did when they entered
into the compromise agree­ment, for which they 'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
re­ceived payment in consideration and in virtue of the same', simply because
complainant union is now led by a new set of officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And for a reason, <span class="SpellE">movants</span>
claimed 'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">That we did not know anything about the agreement
entered by FRANCISCO DUMLAO.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
we have been fooled by him in signing the contract. x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="GramE">x.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(</span>Annex
'A').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A reading of the Reso­lution of <st1:date month="7" day="22" year="1964">July 22, 1964</st1:date>, will show that this
issue has already been squarely resolved."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in spite of the policy of the industrial court not to
entertain motions for new trial after an appeal from a decision, award or order
of a trial judge has been resolved by the court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>, peti­tioners'
motion was nevertheless acted upon albeit it was found to be without merit as a
motion for new trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first
place, the court held that the evidence sought to be offered was not
"newly discovered" but merely "an 'after-thought'
evidence".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the second place, it
found that the purpose of the evidence offered was to prove a supposed act
"intended to undo that which the complainant union, through its former
president and the whole membership, did when they entered into the compromise
agreement, for which they 'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span> received payment in
consideration and in virtue of the same', simply because complainant union is
now led by a new set of officers."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It held that the same point had already been "squarely
resolved" in the first <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> resolution of <st1:date month="7" day="22" year="1964">July 22, 1964</st1:date> also here on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the point that the evidence being offered by petitioners in
the motion for new trial is not "newly discovered", as such term is
understood in the rules of procedure for the ordinary courts, We hold that such
criterion is not binding upon the Court of Industrial Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Section 20 of Commonwealth Act 103,
"The Court of Industrial Relations shall adopt its rules of procedure and
shall have such other powers as general­ly pertain to a court of justice:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, however, That in the hearing,
investigation and determination of any question or controversy and in
exercising any duties and power under this Act, the Court shall act according
to justice and equity and substantial merits of the case, without regard to
technicalities or legal forms and shall not be bound by any technical rules of
legal evi­dence but may inform its mind in such manner as it may deem just and
equitable."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By this provision, the
industrial court is disengaged from the rigidity of the technicalities
applicable to ordinary courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
court is not even restricted to the specific relief de­manded by the parties
but may issue such orders as may be deemed necessary or expedient for the
purpose of set­tling the dispute or dispelling any doubts that may give rise to
future disputes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Ang</span>

Trading &amp; Supply Co. v. Phil. Labor, 71 Phil. 124.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, <span class="GramE">We</span>
be­lieve that this provision is ample enough to have enabled the respondent
court to consider whether or not its previous ruling that petitioners
constitute a mi­nority was founded on fact, without regard to the tech­nical
meaning of newly discovered evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After all, the original motion for reopening was filed in the name of
the union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence being offered
was for the purpose of showing such capacity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, this is in the nature of a move to show who is the real
par­ty-in-interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Technical objections
to matters of this kind have gained no favor from the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Alonso v. <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>, 16 Phil. 315; Chua <span class="SpellE">Kiong</span>
v. Whitaker, 46 Phil. 578.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">We deem it, however, that what weighed upon the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
is the apparently doubtful evidentiary va­lue of the certification, Annex A of
petitioners' motion, and its appended minutes of an alleged meeting of the
union held on <st1:date month="8" day="4" year="1964">August 4, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have gone over these documents, and apart
from the fact that they bear patent earmarks of having been made to order,
there is nothing in them that would concretely and clearly prove that as a
matter of fact, the majority of the union members were really supporting the re­quest
for reopening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much less is there any
faith-bearing indication therein that the petitioners had really been fooled by
the former officers and coun­sel of the union into signing the compromise agree­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statement in the said minutes that the
former President of the union "executed said agree­ment without the
knowledge of the members of the union" cannot obviously stand against <span class="SpellE">undisclaimed</span> signatures of all the members thereon as well
as the <span class="SpellE">undenied</span> receipt by them of the consideration
there­in stated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, it strikes Us
as significant that <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of specific allegations
made by the re­spondents in their pleadings in the court below and here that
even the twenty petitioners have already dwindled in number, no denial of any
kind whatsoever has been made of such an important assertion.</p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, in the mind of the respondent court the granting
of petitioners' motion would not alter the result.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="GramE">We</span> see it, the
court, without any dissenting vote, was convinced that petitioners have not
been deceived and that the petitioners cons­tituted a minority who could not
speak for the union that had entered into the compromise as such.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this premise, it held that under settled
precedents the motion for reopening could not legally prosper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no error in such holding.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In the case of <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dionela</span>, et al vs. Court of Industrial Relations, G.
R. No.</span> L-18334, August 31, 1963, 8 SCRA 832, Our eminent Chief Justice
who, inci­dentally, was the <span class="SpellE"><u>ponente</u></span> of the
decision in the main case herein involved, spoke for the Court thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The main question for determina­tion in this case is whether
the com­promise agreement pursuant to which the complaint in Case No. 598-ULP
had, inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>, been withdrawn and then dismissed is
binding upon petitioners herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
latter maintain that it is not, but the lower court held other­wise, upon the
ground that 'it is an accepted rule under our laws that the will of the
majority should prevail over the minority' citing Betting Ushers Union (PLUM)
v. Jai-Alai, L­-9330, June 29, 1957 and <span class="SpellE">Jesalva</span>, et
al. v. Bautista, L-11928 to L-11930, March 24, 1959 - and that the action taken
by the petitioners herein as minority members of the Union 'is contrary to the
policy of the Magna <span class="SpellE">Carta</span> of Labor, which promotes
the settlement of differences between management and labor by mutual agree­ments,'
and that if said action were tolerated, 'no employer would ever enter into any
compromise agreement for the minority members of the Union will always dishonor
the terms of the agreement and demand for better terms.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The view thus taken by the lower court is
correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, other­wise, even
collective bargaining agree­ments would cease to promote industrial peace and
the purpose of Republic Act 875 would thus be defeated."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case cited by the Chief Justice, this Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"Lastly, the parties in the cases which were the subject of
the compro­mise agreement were the Premier Produc­tions, Inc. and the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The peti­tioners in these cases are merely
mem­bers of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> and are bound by the actions of
the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>, that is to say, a majority of the members of
the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
petitioners feel that they have been deprived of their personal rights under
the judgment that they have ob­tained, which judgments had become <span class="SpellE">exe­cutory</span>, because the sums to which they are entitled
under the judgments object of the compromise had been reduced, the remedy does
not lie in questioning the validity of the compromise agreement, but in
compelling the Union of which they are members to give them a share in the
proceeds of the compromise agree­ment equal or equivalent to that recog­nized
in the judgments." (<span class="SpellE">Vedasto</span> <span class="SpellE">Jesal­va</span>,
et al. v. The Hon. Judge Bautista, et al., 105 Phil. 348, 352-353.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The same principle was upheld in the other cited case of Betting
Ushers Union (PLUM) v. Jai-Alai Corpo­ration, et al., 101 Phil. 822, 826-27:</p>

<blockquote>"The record shows that the dis­missal was decreed upon motion
filed by the petitioning union itself, through its board of directors, acting
in de­ference to the wishes of all the mem­bers of the union except one as ex­pressed
in their resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attys. Rafael and <span class="SpellE">Ilustre</span> tried to show by means of a resolution purportedly
signed by 40 members of the union that the said 40 signers had not authorized

'im­posed' upon them and that they were made to believe that they would be
fully paid their claim for minimum wages.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But it appears from the sworn statements of more than three-fourths of
the 40 sign­ers of the resolution presented by the attorneys that their
signatures were affixed thereto under a misapprehension in that they had been
made to believe that the object of the said resolution was only to secure
reimbursement for one-half of the cost of their original uniforms, whereas,
their real desire was to have the case dismissed because it lacked merit since
they were not em­ployees of the corporation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It appear­ing then that the dismissal was sought by the union itself
acting through the instrumentality of its governing body and also in accordance
with the wishes of an overwhelming majority of the mem­bers of the <span class="GramE">union,</span> we do not think the lower court abused its discretion
or violated any legal rule in dismissing the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely, the will of one or several members of
an association can­not be allowed to prevail over the will of the great
majority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it may well be questioned
whether Attys. Rafael and <span class="SpellE">Ilustre</span> could still be
deemed authorized to ask for a reconsideration of the dis­missal after they had
been notified by the union that their services had al­ready been dispensed
with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that, as already held
in several cases, once the case is in court with the re­quisite jurisdictional
number of em­ployees involved, jurisdiction over it is not lost upon the
withdrawal of some of those employees from the union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But such is not the situation in the instant
case, it not appearing that any of the dissenting mem­bers has withdrawn from
the union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as already stated<span class="GramE">,</span> it was the union itself that asked for the dismissal of
the case."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, there should be no doubt as to the pur­pose of Section 17
of Commonwealth Act 103.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is mainly to
furnish the parties to a case before the industrial court in which the judgment
has already be­come final the means by which such judgment may be ad­justed in
order to be consonant with relevant circums­tances arising after such
finality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is already settled,
however, that it would not be good judicial policy nor conducive to public interest
to allow a re­opening on grounds related to matters which could have been
raised or are necessarily included in those that have been actually raised
before the judgment became final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
allow such a procedure would undermine the very nature of the judicial process
as <span class="GramE">a machinery</span> for the final determination of
controversies and would correspondingly produce uncertainty and instability in
the relations between labor and management thereby impairing the economy of the
country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, be­fore its judgment
becomes final, the industrial court has, in the exercise of its quasi-judicial
powers, the inherent power to reopen cases on grounds of fraud, accident,
mistake, excusable negligence and/or newly discovered evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the nature of the
functions of the industrial court makes it necessary to leave it free to modify
its final awards, deci­sions or orders whenever subsequent circumstances so
demand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said court fixes the terms
and conditions of employment, but as the fairness and adequacy of such terms
and conditions are dependent on ever changing economic and social factors, it
is only natural and logical that as the arbiter created by law for the pur­pose,
the court should be clothed with the power to make adjustments, even after its
judgment is already final, when needed to maintain the harmonious relations
between the two economic factors sought to be promoted in its original
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this end, the provision in
question fixes the periods within which this power of adjustment may be
exercised to be:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the period agreed
upon by the parties for the effectiveness of an award, order or decision, and
(2) in case there is no such agreement, before notice has been given by any
party or both parties to the court for the termination of such effectiveness,
which notice may be given not earlier than three years from the date of such
award, decision or order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It goes
without saying that the adjustments to be made by the court are to be deter­mined
in the same manner as the original award, decision or order.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus clear that the only awards, orders or decisions
contemplated in Section 17 are those of such a nature that they are supposed to
be carried out within an extended period.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We do not believe that said pro­vision contemplates decisions, orders or
awards for the outright payment of back wages, as these are expected to be
complied with at one time only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since
they are con­sidered to be the equivalent of services supposed to have been
already rendered, all that remains after the decision becomes final is for such
wages to be computed and paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once the
amount thereof is determined, the payment can be enforced by execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no pos­sible adjustment that can be
envisaged; so if the pur­pose of the reopening sought is to change or modify
the amount, either because it is inadequate or is incorrectly computed, such
reopening has to be denied after the judgment, order or award has already
become final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All matters regarding
adequacy or correctness of the back-salaries are supposed to be settled before
such finality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The exception is when a
decision or order is alleged to be the product of extrinsic fraud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such an event­uality, however, the
reopening would depend on the suc­cessful showing of the existence of such
fraud.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, it is as if by agreement of the parties, the
court had fixed the amount of the back wages herein involved at P20<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Generally, once
said amount is paid, that should be the end of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, however, it is alleged that the petitioners
were fooled into accepting such amount which is more than three hundred
thousand pesos less than what was supposedly computed by the court examiner to
be due to them and more than one hundred thousand pesos less than the amount
allegedly counter-offered by the respondent company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, however, such allegations did
not earn the sanction of the respondent court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Going over the records just to see how equitable or otherwise the res­pondent
court's conclusions are, since <span class="GramE">We</span> have no power to set
aside its findings of fact, We find that it was not without basis for such a
reaction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the said court in
its answer, the court examiner’s report referred to by petitioners was not yet
final and subject to further disposition by the court in view of the numer­ous
objections thereto of respondent company, which objections do appear to Us to
be worthy of serious consideration, (See Annex 5, Amended Supplemental Motion
for Dismissal); and with respect to the alleged counter­-offer of respondent
company, the same court also found that there was no such counter-offer and
that what res­pondent had filed was only its manifestation regarding the pay
basis that should be used in computing the back wages of petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is explained that from this pay basis,
there are still many substantial deductions that have to be made regarding
incomes of petitioners from work in other places, the back wages of those who
have already gone abroad as well as those who are no longer willing or are
unable to return to work, etc. (Annex C, Petition).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, it appears that there were other
considerations recited in the compromise agreement aside from the P20<span class="GramE">,000</span>, such as –</p>

<blockquote>“2<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That</span>
the respondent hereby binds itself to admit any or all members of the
petitioner union ordered by the Honorable Supreme Court in G.R. No. L-18112 to
be reinstated in respondents' employ, and who may still want to return back to
work notwithstanding that this matter is still pending determination by the
Honorable Court;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the respondent
company hereby binds to give continuous work of six (6) days a week to all
members of both the unions existing in the respondent company in so far as they
are financially capable to do so, and in all cases, to observe justice and
equal treatment to all of its employee irrespective of union membership;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That should respondent
sell any or all of its rights, interests, and partici­pations in the Hamilton
Distillery Company, the respondent company hereby binds itself that all the
above preceding agreements shall be incorporated in their Deeds of Sales and
become a part of the conditions hereof;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“5<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That</span>
any or all court fees that may be assessed in the premises shall be borne by
the respondent exclusively;" (Annex D, Petition)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In other words, the respondent court was
of the opinion that in the light of these circumstances, the settlement of P20<span class="GramE">,000</span> was not as inadequate as petitioners would <span class="SpellE">would</span> make it appear; that, moreover, there were addi­tional
substantial considerations offered by respondent company; and that inasmuch as
a compromise involves give and take, under the circumstances revealed in this
case, the claim of petitioners that they were fooled has not been successfully
sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">The last question raised by petitioners deserves very little
discussion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is contended that Judge
Bautista's order approving the compromise and, by impli­cation, the <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
resolutions reviving the same, are <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the
same Section 17 aforementioned because the effect of such order and resolutions
was to terminate the case even before the end of three years from October 30,
1962, the date of this Court's decision in the main unfair labor case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already explained, the invoked provision
can apply only to orders, awards and decisions which need time to implement or
which imply an extended period of enforcement, such as one that lays down terms
and conditions of work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, as will be
noted, the deci­sion of this Court of October 30, 1962 did not lay down any
such terms and conditions; all that it ordered was for the respondent company
to reinstate all the dismissed members of the union with <span class="SpellE">backpay</span>
and for the said respondent to cease and desist from committing the acts of
discrimination complained of against said members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As far as reinstatement and <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> are concerned, they were supposed to be implemented
immediately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as to the
cease-and-desist-order, this could not have any spe­cific period, for the
simple reason that by its nature, it is an ever existing injunction against all
employers at all times, whether there is a case or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In conse­quence, We hold that obviously, the
three year period mentioned in Section 17 is not applicable to the mentioned
decision of this Court even as, perchance, it should apply to the order of
Judge Bautista approving the compromise, since, as may be seen from the
above-quoted terms approved by said order, the respondent company bound itself
to certain conditions which have extended periods of enforce­ability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated, contrary to the impression
of petitioners, the said order of Judge Bautista revived by the <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
resolutions on appeal did not terminate the case between petitioners and
respondent company; ra­ther it would precisely serve as the starting point of
the applicability of said Section 17.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing should be sufficient to dispose of this appeal and
to justify the <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the decision of the
respondent court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not amiss,
however, to additionally mention one procedural deficiency from which
petitioners' last motion for "new trial" suffered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was filed beyond the period
ordinarily allowed by the rules of the industrial court for the purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Ac­cording to the record,
counsel for petitioners, as well as all the other parties, received notice of
the first <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> resolution of respondent court of July 22, 1964
on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="29" month="7"><span class="GramE">July 29,
 1964</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners' motion in question was filed on <st1:date month="8" day="6" year="1964">August 6, 1964</st1:date>, the eighth day after
such no­tice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rules of the <st1:street><st1:address>Industrial
  Court</st1:address></st1:street> provide that mo­tions of such nature must be
filed within five (5) days only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
is no way of interpreting said rules otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, even without going into the merits, the res­pondent court
could have ignored petitioners' motion for new trial, but <span class="GramE">We</span>
deem it unnecessary to make a definite ruling on this point, in view of the
above conclusions regarding the merits of petitioners' cause.</p>

<p class="BODY">Along the same line of reasoning, respondent court as well as
respondent company are raising, in their respective answers, the issue that the
resolu­tion of respondent court of July 22, 1964 is already final, inasmuch as
petitioners' motion for new trial of August 6, 1964 did not suspend the period
for filing a certiorari by way of appeal to this Court within the period
provided for in Rule 43.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this point, <span class="GramE">We</span> ad­here to the liberality of the law with respect to pro­cedural
matters enunciated, as already stated above, in Section 20 of Com. Act
103.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appearing that the res­pondent
court did actually act, for the reasons stated by it, on the merits of the
motion for "new trial" of petitioners, We see nothing wrong in
holding that motions for new trial or reconsideration of <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
orders, awards and decisions of the Court of Industrial Rela­tions suspend the
period for the appeal of the same, provided the said motions are filed within
the regular five (5) days period stipulated in its rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is when no such motion is filed at all,
that the period for appeal to this Court is uninterrupted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be suggested, however, that generally,
only one such motion may be filed.</p>

from are affirmed, without costs.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J</i>.:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">I concur with the extensive main opinion penned by Mr. Justice Barredo,
which expressly finds that "a careful review of the records does not bear
out the accuracy of the premises of petitioners' grievances", whereby
through a new set of offi­cers and new counsel, a minority of twenty-one out of
forty-nine members who all authorized the settlement of their case for
reinstatement with back wages (as decreed by this Court's final decision of
October 30, 1962 in G. R. No. L-18112, en­titled "Kapisanan ng mga
Manggagawa ng Alak (NAFLU) vs. Hamilton Distillery Co. et al.) and who each
acknowledged in writing receipt in full of his respective share of the
P20,000.00-settlement paid by respondent company under the compromise agreement
of December 24, 1963 duly approved by the industrial court, sought to overthrow
the very same settlement.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the industrial court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> duly heard the
parties and "without any dissenting vote, was convinced that petitioners
have not been deceived and that the petitioners constituted a min­ority who
could not speak for the union that had entered into the agreement as such"
(main opinion, at page 24) the Court's deci­sion affirming the industrial
court's <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> resolutions refus­ing to set aside the settlement
and to reopen the case, is fully grounded on the facts and on the applicable
law and settled prin­ciples, as ably expounded by Mr. Justice Barredo in the
main opinion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the present case properly applied the precedents of Dionela
vs. C.I.R.,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Jesalva vs. Bautista,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and Betting Ushers Union (PLUM) vs. Jai Alai Corporation,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
applying the doctrine in labor cases that the will of the majority should
prevail over that of the minority, it might be well to point out that the
doctrine has been qualified by the Court in two recent decisions, <u>viz</u>, <u>La
Campana Food Products, Inc. etc. Employees Ass'n. vs. C.I.R</u>.,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
where the Court disregarded the peti­tioner union's motion to dismiss a pending
appeal on the ground that it was formulating a collective bargaining agreement
with the employer in the interest of industrial peace and instead ruled upon
the merits of the union's appeal on behalf of twenty-one members who were the
parties directly and personally affected by the employer's unfair labor
practice and who stood to take tre­mendous losses and suffer injustice from a
dismissal of the appeal, as sought by the union, and  <u>Heirs of T. Cruz et al. vs. C. I. R. et. al</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the latter case of <u>Cruz</u>, the Court reaffirmed the
rationale for the majority rule doctrine that:  "the will of the majority must prevail over that of the minority in
the process, for 'under the philosophy of collective responsibility, an
employer who bargains in good faith should be entitled to rely upon the
promises and agree­ments of the union representatives with whom he must deal
under the compulsion of law and contract.  The collective bargaining process should be carried on between parties
who can mutually respect and rely upon the authority of each other.'" We
however expressly qualified the doctrine, pointing out that:  "(W)here, how­ever, collective
bargaining process is not involved, and what is at stake are back wages already
earned by the individual workers by way of overtime, premium and differential
pay, and final judgment has been rendered in their favor, as in the present
case, the real parties in interest with direct material interest, as against
the union which has only served as a vehicle for collective action to enforce
their just claims, are the individual workers themselves.  Authority of the union to waive or quitclaim
all or part of the judg­ment award in favor of the individual workers cannot be
lightly presumed but must be expressly granted, and the employer, as judgment
debtor, must deal in all good faith with the union as the agent of the
individual workers.  The court in turn
should certainly verify and assure itself of the fact and extent of the
authority of the union leadership to execute any compromise or settlement of
the judgment on behalf of the individual workers who are the real judgment
creditors."</p>

<p class="BODY">As indicated hereinabove, and fully discussed in the main
opinion, the factual setting of the case at bar rules out the appli­cability of
these latest decisions of the Court.</p>
