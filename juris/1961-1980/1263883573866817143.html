				<BR><STRONG>AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Severino Cueto appealed from the decision of the Court of First Instance of Oriental Mindoro, convicting him of rape, sentencing him to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, and ordering him to pay Evelyn Cauyan moral and exemplary damages in the sum of P20, 000 and to acknowledge the offspring, a baby boy named Ruben Cueto (Criminal Case No. P-691). <p>Instead of upholding that judgment of conviction, the Solicitor General filed a manifestation recommending the acquittal of the accused. </p><p>Complainant Evelyn Cauyan, single, finished second year high school. She was already twenty-one years old when the alleged rape was committed (she was born on September 20, 1952). She was the only witness who testified that the twenty-one year old Severino Cueto (whom she had known at the grade school) had forcible sexual intercourse with her on a certain night in June, 1974, the exact date of which she could no longer recall. </p><p>Her version is that on that night, she slept beside Magdalena Roco in the latter's house. During the night (the approximate hour was not mentioned), she woke up. Magdalena was no longer at her side. Evelyn noticed that Cueto was in the room undressing himself. She did not make any outcry when she saw Cueto. </p><p>Cueto placed himself on top of her, embraced and kissed her, fondled her breasts and at the same time removed her dress and panty. She "struggled" and "fought back". He threatened to kill her if she shouted. He was able to have carnal intercourse with her. She was then having her regular menstruation. She did not scream. She did not describe how she struggled and resisted Cueto's advances. She did not even testify as to what she did after the alleged rape. </p><p>She complained to the police only on January 10, 1975. She submitted to a medical examination on February 7, 1975 when she was already eight or nine months pregnant. She filed the complaint for rape against Cueto on February 10, 1975, which was the date when her child, named Ruben Cueto, was born. On May 19, 1975 she signed a statement withdrawing her complaint because Cueto's brother promised to pay her P1,000. That promise was not fulfilled. </p><p>So that Evelyn's credibility and the sufficiency of her evidence may be evaluated, we are reproducing below her uncorroborated, spurtive or spasmodic testimony as to how she was allegedly raped by Cueto, who was unarmed, which testimony was elicited by means of leading questions: </p><blockquote>&nbsp; <p>"Q.

Alright, the municipal court fixed the bail at P18, 000. 00 and now afterwards, it was lowered to P15, 000. 00.

No, sir. </p>&nbsp; <p>Court: Ask if she undressed also when she saw Severino Cueto already undressed. - A. No, your Honor. </p>&nbsp; <p>Q.

(by Fiscal): In this affidavit which is already marked as Exh. 1 and which you had already identified your signature, please remember who prepared this Exh. 1? - A. Pedro Casao, sir. </p><p>Q. Do you remember if this person by the name of Pedro Casao held any position in that municipality of Bongabon? -A. He is called ''attorney' , sir. </p><p>Q. Do you remember the reason why you affixed your signature on this Exh. 1 which was prepared by Pedro Casao, according to you? - A. Yes, sir. I was promised that a certain amount shall be given by them. </p><p>Q. Who promised you that in consideration of your signature in Exh. 1 you would be given a certain amount? - A. Mang Ipe, brother of Severino Cueto, sir. </p><p>Q. Aside from you and aside from Pedro Casao, who were present when you signed this Exh. 1? - A. Lita Cordero and Rudy Arellano, sir. Those were the persons who were present. </p><p>Q. In what place was this Exh. 1 presented to you for signature and in fact you signed the same? - A. In our house because according to them, that was the instruction of Municipal Judge Garcia, sir. </p><p>Q. Who told you that the instruction of Judge Garcia was to sign the same? - A. That was the information given me by the brother of Severino Cueto, sir. </p><p>Q. Do you have any companion at that time in your house when you signed this Exh. 1? - A. Yes, sir, Lita Cordero. </p><p>Q. Where was your mother when you signed this Exh. 1? -A. She was out of our residence as she was at Dolores, Quezon, sir. </p><p align="center">xxx xxx xxx </p><p>Q.

They promised to give me P1,000. </p><p>Q. Before signing Exh. 1, did you have any occasion to read the same or was it read to you by, say, Pedro Casao? -A. Yes, sir, I read the contents of Exh. 1 before signing the same. </p><p>Court: Did you not tell Pedro Casao or the brother of Severino Cueto that you will sign the document after you were paid the P1,000 promised you? - A. No, your Honor. I was asked to sign and they will immediately deliver the P1,000, your Honor. </p><p>Q. (by Fiscal): You stated in the cross-examination that you had a menstruation during the sexual intercourse on the night of the month of June, 1974, while in the direct examination you stated that right after the sexual intercourse blood oozed from your vagina. Now, please tell this Honorable Court which of the two really happened? - A. That blood oozed on (from) my vagina immediately after having been abused, sir. </p><p>Q. Now, for how long have you been having your monthly menstruation before June, 1974? - A. For less than a year, sir. </p><p>Q. You stated that blood oozed from your vagina right after the sexual intercourse. Which was bigger in quantity the blood by reason of your menstruation or the blood by reason of the sexual intercourse? - A. The volume of blood is greater that particular evening, sir. </p><p>Q. Try again to recoup your memory and try to recall and remember what really transpired after the sexual intercourse on the night of June, 1974. For purposes of clarification, did you have really your menstruation right after the sexual intercourse on the night of June, 1974? - A. No, sir, I did not have menstruation immediately after that sexual intercourse. </p><p>Q. When you were again asked on cross-examination you said that the accused Severino Cueto had sexual intercourse for several times. For clarification, are you referring to the manner by which the accused had his push-and-pull movement or did he rest after one sexual intercourse and resumed again for another sexual intercourse? - A. I am referring to the insertion and putting out of his penis, sir. </p><p>Q. Now, again you stated in cross-examination that there was pain in your vagina right after the first sexual intercourse. My question is this for clarification. Did you ever feel any pain at the initial insertion of the penis of the accused on the first intercourse in the night of June, 1974? - A. Right on the initial insertion of the penis of the accused I felt the pain. </p><p align="center">xxx xxx xxx </p><p>Q. Have you had any intercourse with any other man before Severino Cueto had sexual intercourse with you in the night of June, 1974? - A. No, sir. </p><p>Q. Right after the night of June, 1974 when the accused Severino Cueto had sexual intercourse with you, have you had any other inter courses with him or with any other men? - A. None, sir. </p><p>Court: If the same offer of P1,000 is given to you now, would you be willing to withdraw the complaint against the accused and you will forgive him? - A. No, your Honor. </p><p align="center">RECROSS EXAMINATION </p><p>Q. Because of that promise of P1,000, you voluntarily signed this Exh. 1? - A. Yes, sir, because I was promised that I will be given the amount of P1,000. </p><p>Q. If you were not promised, you would not have signed this Exh. 1? - A. No, sir. I will not sign had I not been promised. </p><p>Court: At the time that you signed that Exh. 1 on May 19, 1975, did you deliver already or not? - A. I have already given birth, your Honor. </p><p>Q. (by defense counsel): According to you, during the cross-examination, you had menstruation one week after the night when Severino Cueto abused you? - A. No, sir. </p><p>Q. So that you are already withdrawing your previous answer that you had menstruation one week after the night in question? - A. No, sir, and I am now rectifying my previous answer to the cross-examination. </p><p>Q. The only time that you went to the doctor was on February 7, 1975? - A. Yes, sir. </p><p align="center">xxx xxx xxx </p><p>Defense counsel: I am through with this witness, your Honor." (1-12 tsn March 30, 1976). </p><p>"Experience has shown that unfounded charges of rape or attempted rape have not infrequently been preferred by women actuated by some sinister or ulterior and undisclosed motive, and convictions for such crimes should not be sustained without clear and convincing proof of the guilt of the accused. It is the duty of the courts in such cases to scrutinize with the utmost care the story told by the complaining witness, especially when it appears that she did not make an immediate outcry or that there was any unexplained delay in instituting criminal proceedings." (<em>U.S. vs. Bay</em>, 27 Phil. 495). </p><p>Applying these guidelines to the instant case, we are of the opinion that the testimony of the complainant does not prove beyond reasonable doubt that Cueto raped her. Her testimony lacks spontaneity and does not ring with truth and candor. It is not clear, positive and convincing. </p><p>The complainant did not offer any tenacious resistance to the alleged sexual assault. Her declaration that she was raped and that she struggled and fought back are mere conclusions which are not sufficient to dispel the impression that she tacitly consented to the sexual intercourse. (The commission of rape without outside assistance is possible but is a rare case. 2 Cuello Calon, <em>Derecho Penal</em>, 12th Ed., p. 535, note 5). </p><p>"The crime of rape is not to be presumed. Consent and not physical force is the common origin of acts between man and woman." "Should the records disclose that some hesitation was shown by the woman or that she had contributed in some way to the realization of the act, this will perhaps constitute an offense very different from that of rape." (Pacheco and Viada, cited in <em>U.S. vs. De Dios</em>, 8 Phil. 279, 282-3). </p><p>As noted by Justice Street, in crimes against chastity, the testimony of the complaining woman should not be received with precipitate credulity. When the conviction depends at any vital point upon her uncorroborated testimony, it should not be accepted unless her sincerity and candor are free from suspicion. A little insight into human nature is of most value in judging matters of this kind (<em>People vs. Fausto</em>, 51 Phil. 852, 856). A conviction for rape based on the uncorroborated testimony of the com-plaining woman requires that her story should be carefully examined and weighed. The accused should not be convicted unless the complainant's testimony is impeccable and rings true throughout (<em>People vs. Ariarte</em>, 60 Phil. 326). </p><p>Moreover, the delay in the filing of the complaint and the fact that the complaining girl did not submit immediately to a medical examination generate doubt as to Cueto' s guilt. The explanation for the seven-month delay in the filing of the complaint, which was that Evelyn's mother did not want her husband to know of the alleged rape, is not satisfactory. Evelyn herself, being of age, was competent to file the complaint. She should have acted with promptitude if it were true that she was the unwilling victim of a grievous outrage. </p><p>In passing, it may be noted that complainant's mother admitted at the hearing in the lower court on February 21, 1977 that Evelyn was then living with her common-law husband, Ely Rosales. </p><p>The accused pleaded the defense that Evelyn was a prostitute. He declared that he had sexual intercourse with her in March, 1974 and that he paid her twenty pesos. It is not necessary to assess the veracity of that defense. We are satisfied that the prosecution's evidence has not established the commission of rape in this case. </p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the lower court's judgment is reversed and defendant-appellant Cueto is acquitted. Costs <em>de oficio</em>. </p><p><strong>SO ORDERED</strong>. </p><p><em>Fernando, (Chairman), Barredo, Antonio</em>, and <em>Santos, JJ.</em>, concur. </p><p><em>Concepcion, Jr., J.</em>, did not take part.</p> </div>
