				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align=""><div align="justify"><b></b><br><p>Estelita Bernabe, wife of Sedesias del Castillo, who died of injuries 
inflicted on his person on the night of November 25, 1962, filed a petition for 
mandamus in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo (Civil Case No. 6323), seeking 
to compel the respondent Provincial Fiscal of Iloilo to amend the information in 
Criminal Case No. 9624 of the same court, from homicide to murder, with 
aggravating circumstance of use of motor vehicle.</p>
<p>It was alleged therein that in connection with the death of petitioner's 
husband, a complaint for homicide through reckless imprudence was first filed by 
the Chief of Police of Sara, Iloilo, against Pedro del Castillo, Jr., which 
complaint was later amended to charge him, together with Pedro del Castillo, 
Sr., with the crime of homicide. When the case was remanded to the court of 
first instance for further proceedings, petitioner widow requested the 
provincial fiscal for reinvestigation, maintaining that the accused should 
properly be charged with murder. However, after such reinvestigation, the 
Assistant Provincial Fiscal reproduced the complaint for homicide. Thus, the 
widow instituted the action, claiming that in refusing to amend the information 
from homicide to murder, the respondents Provincial Fiscal and Assistant 
Provincial Fiscal acted with grave abuse of discretion and neglected the 
performance of an act which the law enjoined them to do.</p>
<p>Respondents moved for the dismissal of the mandamus case. It was their 
contention that from the affidavits of the witnesses for the government, there 
was no treachery attending the stabbing and killing of the victim, for which 
reason they found that the offense committed was only homicide. As the 
government prosecutors have the discretion to determine not only the sufficiency 
or insufficiency of evidence establishing a <u>prima facie</u> case, but also 
the nature or kind of offense committed, it is claimed that mandamus will not 
lie to compel them to change the information already filed. Sustaining the 
foregoing allegations, the court, in its order of June 28, 1963, granted the 
motion and dismissed the petition for mandamus tor lack of legal basis. 
Petitioner filed the present appeal.</p>
<p>From the affidavits of the witnesses, which were attached to the complaint 
and presented during the investigation by the prosecuting orficers, the incident 
appeared to have happened as follows;</p>
<p>In the evening of November 25, 1962, the deceased Sedesias del Castillo, one 
Fernando Castromayor and the accused Pedro del Castillo, Sr., after a drinking 
spree in a store, were forced to seek shelter from the rain in tne house of one 
Tinong in Aguinaldo street, Sara, Iloilo. While thereat, Pedro del Castillo, Sr. 
and Castromayor eagaged in a fight where Pedro was bested. After they were 
separated by Sedesias, the latter and Castromayor left together. They met a 
policeman to whom the incident was reported. At about 9:30, and while they were 
on their way home (Sedesias, Castromayor and the two other witnesses), a 
speeding jeep came heading to their direction which caused Sedesias to shout to 
his companions, "get away from the road, there is a jeep". The vehicle veered 
toward Sedesias, bumping and throwing him to the ground. Thereupon, Pedro del 
Castillo, Sr. jumped from the jeep, struck the fallen man with vhmething on the 
head and then stabbed the latter twice in the neck. When Castromayor saw this, 
he ran away pursued by Pedro. When it was realized that the stricken man was 
Sedesias, and not Castromayor, Pedro del Castillo, Jr., who was driving the 
jeep, tried, with others, to bring the former to the doctor, but Sedesias 
expired without receiving medical treatment. With the foregoing version of the 
facts by the supposed eyewitnesses, the Fiscals concluded that there was no 
treachery in the commission of the ofiense, and thus reiufteu to amend the 
information for homicide, to murder, as prayed for by the 
petitioner-appellant.</p>
<p>The issues presented by this appeal are (1) whether considering the 
affidavits of the supposed eye-witnesses which are also the basis of the 
homicide-charge, there was abuse of discretion committed by 
respondents-appellees when they refused to amend the information to murder; and 
(2) if there was such abuse of discretion, whether respondents-appellees may be 
compelled by mandamus to amend the information.</p>
<p>To justify their action of refusing to amend the information, 
respondents-appellees capitalize on appellant's contention that when the 
incident happened, the night was dark. They argue that if this were so, the 
supposed witnesses could not have seen, as they alleged to have seen, the 
striking of the head and stabbing of the neck of the victim by the accused. 
Furthermore, it is maintained that since it was the deceased himself who warned 
his companions of the coming of the jeep of the accused, the attack cannot be 
considered sudden to qualify the slaying to murder.</p>
<p>It may be pointed out that appellees do not claim insufficiency of evidence 
of the probable guilt of the accused for the death of the victim. They only say 
that in their appreciation or appraisal of the facts as narrated by the 
witnesses, there was no treachery attending the commission of the crime. It is 
the established jurisprudence that for <u>alevosia</u> to exist, the aggressor 
must have adopted a mode of attack intended to facilitate the commission of the 
crime without risk to himself. (People v. Caflete, 44 Phil. 478; U.S. v. 
Balagtas, 19 Phil. 194; People v. Calinawan, 83 Phil. 642; People v. Tagaro, 
G.R. No. L-18518, Jan. 31, 1963; People v. Baloyo, G.R. No. L-11215, Jan. 30, 
1960.) What is necessary to determine, therefore, is whether the attack or 
infliction of the fatal injuries on the victim in this case was made in such a 
manner as to insure the commission thereof with ease and without danger to the 
accused, of retaliation or defense that might be put up by the deceased.</p>
<p>The supposed eyewitnesses, Virgilio Palencia, Rizalino Patanao, and Fernando 
Castromayor, unanimously declared under oath that after the deceased was bumped, 
in all appearances, intentionally, by the jeep in which the accused was riding, 
the latter jumped off the vehicle, struck Sedesias on the head while prostrate 
on the ground, and then stabbed him twice in the neck. Under the situation as 
declared by these witnesses, there can hardly be any doubt as to the helpless 
condition of the victim when he received the injuries which caused his death. 
The fact that he had seen the coming of the vehicle does not justify the 
conclusion that he could have been prepared for the attack by the accused. The 
fact that the victim was bumped by the jeep seems to indicate that he was not 
anticipating that he would be bumped or hit by it, much less that while he was 
lying on the ground, somebody would come around and inflict injuries on him.</p>
<p>With regard to the other issue of the propriety of the remedy of mandamus, it 
may be true that, as appellees aver, it is a relief for official inaction. It is 
claimed that with the filing of the information for homicide, appellees have 
already performed their duty and, therefore, there is no cause of action against 
them. It must be remembered, however, that a prosecuting officer is sworn, under 
his oath of office, not merely to file charges against an accused, but to file 
the corresponding complaint or information in accordance with the facts and/or 
evidence obtaining in a case. Considering the circumstances stated above, there 
was created and imposed upon herein respondents-appellees a legal duty to file 
the information which, in view of the declarations of the alleged eyewitnesses, 
should be for murder. Clearly, their failure to do so rendered the respondents 
Fiscals subject to the writ of mandamus.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order appealed from is hereby reversed and set aside. 
Respondents-appellees are hereby directed to amend the information in Criminal 
Case No. 9624 of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo accordingly. No costs.
