				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF QUE CHOC GUI, TO BE ADMITTED AS CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. QUE CHOC GUI, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal by the Government from a decision of the Court of First
Instance of Manila granting the application of petitioner Que Choc Gui
for naturalization as citizen of the Philippines.<p></p>
<p>Petitioner has resided continuously in the Philippines since March
4, 1937, when he was born therein of Chinese parents. He completed his
primary and secondary education in the Quiapo Anglo-Chinese School and
the Far Eastern University, respectively. The Government assails,
however, the sufficiency of the evidence to establish some of his
qualifications and the absence of disqualifications for naturalization.
Upon examination of the record, we are fully satisfied that the appeal
is well taken.</p>
<p>In Ong <em>vs</em>. Republic (103 Phil., 964; 55 Off. Gaz., 3290, 3294), we said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Needless to say, the legal provision requiring that
the sworn statements of at least two (2) credible persons be attached
to the petition, necessarily implies that <em>those two (2) persons must, also, confirm, on the witness stand, the contents of their aforementioned affidavits</em>. Accordingly, in the absence of good reasons therefor-such as death or unexpected absence of the affiantsâ€”we have held that <em>they must testify for the petitioner, and cannot be substituted by other witnesses</em> (Cu <em>vs</em>. Republic, 89 Phil., 473; Yu Chiong Tian <em>vs</em>. Republic, 94 Phil., 742 Awad <em>vs</em>. Republic 97 Phil., 569; Karam Singh <em>vs</em>. Republic, 97 Phil., 622; 51 Off. Gaz., 5172; Cabarles Cu <em>vs</em>. Republic, 97 Phil., 746; 51 Off. Gaz., [11] 5625; Raymundo Pe, et al. <em>vs</em>. Republic, 99 Phil., 586; 52 Off. Gaz., 5855; Lui <em>vs</em>. Republic, 100 Phil., 258; 53 Off. Gaz., [2] 379; 53 Off. Gaz., 379; Chan Pong <em>vs</em>. Republic, 101 Phil., 1210; and Dy Suat Hong <em>vs</em>. Republic, 101 Phil., 639, 54 Off. Gaz. [7] 2168).</p>
  <p>"Similarly,
when the law ordains that certain specified statements be made in said
affidavits, it follows, as an inevitable corollary, that <em>those statements must be established, on the witness stand, by the testimony of the affiants themselves</em>. In other words, <em>petitioner must prove by the testimony of, at least, two (2) credible persons, whose affidavits are attached to the petition</em>:</p>
  <ol><li>That they are <em>citizens</em> of the Philippines;</li><li>That they are '<em>credible</em> persons'</li><li>That they <em>personally</em> know the petitioner;</li><li>That they personally know him to be a <em>resident </em>of the Philippines for the period of time required by law;</li><li>That they personally know him to be a person of <em>good repute</em>;</li><li>That they personally know him to be <em>morally irreproachable</em>;</li><li>That he has, in their opinion, <em>all the qualifications</em> necessary to become a citizen of the Philippines; and</li><li>That he 'is not in any way disqualified under the provisions' of the Naturalization Law."</li></ol>
</blockquote>
<p>In the case at bar, petitioner's character witnesses did not testify
on, among other things, whether or not he believes in the principles
underlying our Constitution or has evinced a sincere desire to embrace
the customs, traditions and ideals of the Filipinos (Com. Act No. 473,
Sec. 2, subdivision [3] and Sec. 4[f]. Moreover, aside from identifying
his affidavit in support of petitioner's application, one of said
witnesses, namely, Eriberto Angeles, said nothing about petitioner's
qualifications. As to his disqualifications, Angeles admitted that all
he could say is that petitioner had not committed any crime. Indeed,
neither Angeles, nor the other character witness, Adela Purugganan,
knew the petitioner sufficiently to vouchsafe for his qualifications
and lack of any disqualification. Apart from being acquainted with
petitioner's father because she had been a clerk in the records
division of the Bureau of Immigration, Miss Purugganan used to meet
petitioner when the former went shopping to the Quinta Market or in the
grocery store of petitioner's father in Quezon Boulevard. Upon the
other hand, Angeles was merely in charge of a restaurant in Quiapo.</p>
<p>Again, in said case of Ong <em>vs</em>. Republic, we held: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"*  * * Within the purview of the Naturalization Law, a 'credible' person is, to our mind, <em>not only</em>
an individual who has not been previously convicted of a crime; who is
not a police character and has no police record; who has not perjured
in the past; or whose 'affidavit' or testimony is not incredible. What
must be 'credible' is not the declaration made, but the <em>person</em> making it. This implies that such person must have a <em>good standing in the community;</em> that he is <em>known to be honest and upright; </em>that he is<em> reputed to be trustworthy and reliable;</em> and that his word may be taken on its face value, as a good warranty of the worthiness of the petitioner. Thus, in Cu <em>vs</em>. Republic, G. R. No. L-3018 (decided on July 18, 1951), we declared that said affiants 'are in a way <em>insurers of the character of the candidate concerned</em>.'
Indeed, by their affidavits, they do not merely make the statements
herein contained. They also vouch for the applicant, attest to the
merits of the petition and sort of <em>underwrite</em> the same."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neither Angeles nor Purugganan meets these conditions.</p>
<p>Lastly, petitioner's only income is a monthly salary of P150 he
claims to receive as salesman in the aforementioned store since June 1,
1958. We have repeatedly declared that such income, allegedly derived
from employment in a business enterprise of petitioner's father, is
insufficient to establish compliance with the statutory requirement of
lucrative occupation or calling (Sy Ang Hoc <em>vs</em>. Republic, 111 Phil., 489; 58 Off. Gaz. (34) 5629; Richard Velasco <em>vs</em>. Republic, 108 Phil., 234; 58 Off. Gaz. (11) 2154; Tan <em>vs</em>. Republic 111 Phil., 321; Zacarias <em>vs</em>. Republic 112 Phil., 131; 59 Off. Gaz. (36) 6038).</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is reversed, and petitioner's
application hereby dismissed, with cost against the petitioner. It is
so ordered.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, C. J., Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L., Paredes</em>, and <em>De Leon, JJ.</em>, concur.<br>
  <em>Bautista Angelo</em> and <em>Barrera, JJ</em>., on leave.<br>
  <em>Dizon</em> and <em>Padilla, JJ</em>., took no part.
