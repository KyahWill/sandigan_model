plaintiff-appellant <span class="SpellE">Gualberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Tenchavez</span>
and defendant-appellant Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Company filed
in this case a joint petition for judgment in accordance with the com­promise agreement
attached thereto in the form of a public instrument executed jointly by them.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="24" month="5">May 24, 1967</st1:date>
<span class="GramE">We</span> approved said compromise agree­ment and rendered
judgment in accordance therewith, order­ing the parties to comply with all the
terms and stipu­lations thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 1, 1967, however, <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> I.
V. <span class="SpellE">Bina­mira</span> and F. B. <span class="SpellE">Barria</span>
filed a motion for the recon­sideration of the abovementioned decision, and
praying further that their opposition to the approval of the com­promise
agreement and the dismissal of the appeal, as well <span style="">as </span>their motion to record their attorneys lien, be restored and
disposed of in due course, and that, in the event of an adverse ruling, Atlas
Consolidated Mining and Development Company be ordered to pay them the unpaid
balance of P30,000 acknowledged by <span style="">it
"confidentially" in its letter to <span class="SpellE">Tenchavez</span>
dated April 19, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a supplemental
motion for reconsideration filed on July 9 </span>of the same year, the same
parties alleged that they had filed in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Civil Case No. R-10051 <span style="">to declare the aforesaid compromise agreement fraudulent, illegal and
without </span>force and <span class="GramE">effect</span> and, as a result, they
prayed that this Court hold in abeyance any action on said compromise agreement
until said civil case <span style="">is </span><span style="">finally resolved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1967</st1:date>
<span class="GramE">We</span> issued a resolution requiring the adverse parties

<span class="SpellE">Quibranza</span>, as <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>,
also filed their comment on </span><st1:date year="1967" day="5" month="10"><span style="">October 5, 1967</span></st1:date><span style=""> in which they stated in substance that
"a grant of the motion for reconsideration as well as the supplemental
motion for reconsideration will tend to aid this Honorable Court in resolving
fairly the incident raised in both motions etc.<span class="GramE">".</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Oppositors</span> <span class="SpellE">Binamira</span> and <span class="SpellE">Barria</span> likewise

compromise agreement be declared frau­dulent and, in the alternative, that
action on the approval of said agreement be deferred until after Civil Case No.
R-10051 is finally resolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was followed
by a mani­festation filed by Atlas on </span><st1:date year="1968" day="30" month="1"><span style="">January 30, 1968</span></st1:date><span style=""> praying for the denial of the motions for
