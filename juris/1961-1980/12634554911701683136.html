				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The main issue posed in this appeal is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether the rate of exchange to be adopted in
fixing <span style="">the peso </span>cost of
reparations goods procured by the Reparations Commission for the
applicant-end-user, Consolidated Textile Mills, Inc., should be reckoned on the
basis of the rate of exchange of the Philippine peso to the U.S. dollar
obtaining at the time the corres­ponding "Contract to Purchase" the
goods was entered into between the applicant and the Reparations Commission in
1961, or on the basis of the prevailing free market rate of exchange between
the said currencies at the time of the procurement of the goods in 1963.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a complaint for declaratory judgment filed by Consolidated
Textile Mills, Inc. (referred to hereafter as Consolidated) in the Court of
first Instance of Manila, Civil Case No. 54375, against the Reparations
Commission (hereafter referred to <span style="">as </span>the
Commission), the plaintiff prayed for judgment dec­laring that the payment to
the defendant Reparations Commission for the goods worth $3,900,000.00 alloca­ted
to it, should be based on the official rate of exchange of 12.00 to $1.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff was joined in its prayer by <span class="SpellE">Mabuhay</span> Rubber Corporation which, with leave of court,
intervened in the action with respect to other reparations goods worth $1,500,
000.00 allocated to it by the Commission under similar circumstances <span style="">as those </span>of the Consolidated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission contends that the peso cost of
the goods in question should be computed on the basis of the free market rate
of exchange which was about P4.00 to $1.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a decision, dated <st1:date year="1964" day="22" month="2">February
 22, 1964</st1:date>, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> denied the claims of both
the plaintiff and the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>, and declared that
payments for the goods in question shall be subject to, and be based upon, the
free market rate of exchange of the Peso to the dollar as proposed by the
Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedents of the cast are not <span class="SpellE">contro­verted</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stripped of unessential details, the evidence
of record gives the following account of the environmental facts of the case:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Consolidated was an
applicant for reparation goods for which it filed Application No. 0953 with the
defendant </span>Commission <span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="2" month="3"><span style="">March 2,
 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, for one set of
integrated textile mill equipment to the amount of $3,900,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to the previsions of Republic <span style="">Act </span>1789, otherwise known as the
Reparation Law, the application was given due course for consideration by the
Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The applica­tion was
recorded as Item No. 6, Category II Pri­vate Sector, in the Fifth Reparations
Year Tentative Schedule which late became the Sixth Year Schedule because when
it was finally concluded with the Japanese Government, the Fifth Reparations
Year had already expired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same item
was still later carried over to the Seventh Year Agreed Schedule </span>listed
as Item No. 19, Category II Private Sector - Textile Mill Equipment valued at
$3,900,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Im­plementing the
aforesaid allocation, on November 29, 1961, Consolidated and the Commission
entered into and executed a "Contract to Purchase" wherein <span style="">it </span>is made to appear that a down
payment of P390<span style="">,000.00</span> was made
by Consolidated to the Commission, with a further stipulation that a
"Contract of Con­ditional Purchase and Sale" shall be executed which
shall <span style="">supersede </span>the
"Contract to Purchase".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
approved by the Commission in its Resolution of De­cember 12, 1961, the
procurement of textile machine­ries and equipment for Consolidated, provided
for an estimated contract value of THREE MILLION <span style="">NINE </span>HUNDRED THOUSAND U. S. DOLLARS; and as authorized in <span style="">said Resolution, the Executive Director and
Secre­tary of the Commission issued the </span><span style="">corresponding </span><span style="">Pro</span>curement
Order directed to the Chief of the Reparations Mission in Japan on the
following day.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1962" day="28" month="2"><span style="">February
 </span>28, <span style="">1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Office of the Pre</span>sident issued a
directive <span style="">addressed </span>to both the
Commission and the National Economic Council enjoining further implementation
of all items in the Sixth Year Agreed Schedule, except those for small scale
industries, pending reexamination of the said items in the light of the new
socio economic development <span style="">program </span>of
the new administration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another direct­ive
of the same import was addressed to the Chief of the Reparations Mission in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
on <st1:date year="1962" day="29" month="5">May 29, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="9"><span style="">September 13, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>the Commission adopted Resolution
No. 692 by virtue of which bids of Japanese suppliers <span style="">of </span>the <span style="">machineries and
equipment </span><span style="">allocated to Conso­</span><span style="">lidated were approved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in conformity with the then existing
requirement of </span>the Commission, Consolidated submitted <span style="">a guarantee </span>bond in the amount of <span style="">P</span><span style="">1,170,000.00
representing 15% of the </span><span style="">total
alloca­</span><span style="">tion to it in the sum of
$3,900,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The corresp</span>onding
procurement contracts (with the suppliers) were verified by the General Auditing
Office of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
on <st1:date year="1963" day="29" month="2">February 29, <span style="">1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, and approved </span>by the Commission on <st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same were ve­rified by the Japanese
Government on <st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1963</st1:date>,
<span style="">In </span>signed by the Chief of the
Reparations Mission in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
on that same day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These procurement
contracts involved <span style="">a </span><span style="">total amoun</span>t of $3,357.191.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Consolidated having known before hand
that the aforesaid procurement contracts did not totally exhaust its allocation
of $3,900,000.00, in its letter dated <st1:date year="1962" day="16" month="1">January
 16, 1962</st1:date>, and <st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="7">July 13,
 1962</st1:date>, requested the Commission to allow it <span style="">to m</span>ake use of the ba­lance of its allocation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The request was granted, and on <st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="5">May<span style=""> </span>28, 1963</st1:date>, the Commission
resolved to authorize the procurement of additional reparations goods for
Consolidated in an amount equivalent to its balance of $542,809.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="3">March 28, 1963</st1:date>,
a Presidential Directive signed by the Executive Secretary was issued provi­ding,
among others, that the free market rate shall be applied without exception to
all items appearing in the Seventh Year Reparations Schedule including those
items which had appeared in previous schedules.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was in pursuance of this directive that the Com­mission required the
Consolidated to pay, before de­livery of the goods, the difference between the
down-payment computed at the rate of P2.00 to $1.00 and that as computed on the
basis of the free market rate of exchange.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This demand precipitated a disagree­ment between the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1963</st1:date>,
Consolidated filed a petition for declaratory relief in the Court of First
Instance of Manila against the Commission, seeking for a judi­cial declaration
as to the rate of exchange that should be applied to ascertain the peso price
of the reparations goods allocated to it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon plaintiff's motion, the court issued a writ of preliminary in­junction
on August 28, 1963, supplemented by another on September 28, 1963 whereby
defendant Commission was ordered, among others, to refrain from specify­ing in
the "conditional contract <span style="">of </span>purchase
and sale" to be executed by the parties the peso value <span style="">of </span>the reparations goods allocated to
the plaintiff; the writ further enjoined the defendant Commission from
requiring the plaintiff to pay the difference of the <span style="">5% </span>down payment based on the free market rate and the amount
actually deposited by the latter for the said purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">Partial shipments of the reparations goods subject of the
procurement contracts aforementioned have since then arrived in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and delivered to the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
accordance with the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the court, on Octo­ber
4, 1963, the parties Consolidated and the Commission, executed a "Contract
<span style="">of </span>Conditional Purchase and
Sale" of the goods covered by the reparations al­location of
$3,900,000.00, without indicating therein the peso value thereof pending the
judicial determi­nation <span style="">of </span>the
question regarding the applicable ex­change rate, which contract is dated
October 4, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the same time, the
plaintiff has submitted the cor­responding insurance coverage and performance
bond based on the value of the goods computed at the cur­rent rate of foreign
exchange, subject to the condi­tion that the same shall be reduces in the event
the court should decide to apply the P2.00 to $1.00 rate of exchange to the
goods allocated to the plaintiff; and the plaintiff likewise agreed to pay in
cash all amounts due and payable under the contract computed at the rate of
P2.00 to $1.00 <span style="">with a bond to cover the
amounts in excess thereof </span>demanded by <span style="">the defend­ant Commission on the basis of the current rate of </span>exchange.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On February </span><span style="">22, 1964, the Court of First In­stance of
Manila rendered the decision appealed from which, as stated in the first
paragraph of this opi­nion, sustained the right of the Reparations Commis</span>sion
to apply the current rate of exchange in deter­mining the equivalent peso price
to the U. S. dollar of the reparations goods allocated to and procured from
Japan for the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff moved
for a reconsideration of the decision by adopting as its own, the Motion for
Reconsideration and <span style="">New Trial </span><span style="">filed by the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mabuhay</span> Rubber Corporation, </span>which the court
denied <span style="">in its </span>order dated July
15, 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">A </span>second motion for reconsideration dated <st1:date year="1964" day="27" month="7">July 27, 1964</st1:date>, was filed by the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> which, was again concurred in and adopted by the
plaintiff <span style="">as its own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, because </span>the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">intervenor</span></span><span style=""> had thereafter moved for a suspension of the
proceedings in connection with its second motion for reconsidera­tion,
whereupon, plaintiff withdrew as party to the second motion for reconsideration
</span><span style="">and filed a notice </span>of
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this appeal by the
Consolidated Textile Mills, Inc., from the decision.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This is the appellant's
theory:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The "Contract to
Purchase" the reparations goods in question was concluded at a time
(November, 1961) when the rate </span>of exchange obtaining between the peso
and the dollar was in the ratio of 2:1, whereas the directive of the President
requiring the Reparations Commission to apply the current free market rate of
exchange of the <span style="">peso to the dollar
computing the peso cost of re</span>parations goods allocated to it was issued
when such rate is about P4.00 to $1.00. This would increase the cost of the
goods by two-fold which - to the mind of the appellant - spells a clear
impairment of the obligation under its contract with the Reparations
Commission;<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
to apply the directive of the President retroactively to its case would amount
to a denial of due process;<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and with the circumstance that the said directive would be made to apply
indiscriminately to all items appearing in the Seventh Year Reparations
Schedule without regard to the time the applications were made as appears in
previous schedules, it would surely man, according to the appellant, a total
disregard of the principle of equal protection of the <span style="">law.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

 9, 1962</st1:date> (last paragraph), as clarified by the above rules, shall be
considered as a directive for all intents and purposes."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant contends that
from the time it filed its application in 1961 for the aforesaid reparations
goods up to the time the corresponding Procurement Contracts for the same goods
were approved by the Commission in 1963, it was expressly understood and agreed
by both parties that the official rate of exchange of P2.00 for $1.00 would be
the </span>measure of its obligation under the "Contract to <span style="">Purchase" earlier quoted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It specifically points out the fact that </span>the
Commission <span style="">had required </span>it <span style="">to make down payment of P390,000.00 and to
post </span><span style="">a
</span><span style="">guarantee bond in the amount of
P1,170,</span>000.00, <span style="">representing </span><span style="">5% and </span><span style="">15%, respectively, of the </span>estimated contract value of its
$3,900,000.00 alloca­<span style="">tion as </span>computed
at the exchange rate of P2.00 to $1.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
argues, therefore, that to apply the cur­rent free market rate of <span style="">exchange </span>of the peso to the dollar to
its case as directed by the Office of the President and imposed upon it by the
Commission - thereby increasing by about two (2) times the peso cost of the
reparations goods allocated to it - would clearly impair the obligation it has
assumed under the "contract to purchase" <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The <span class="SpellE">gravamen</span>
of </span>appellant's contention is <span style="">anchored
on </span>the proposition that under <span style="">the
</span>"contract to <span style="">purchase"
earlier </span>quote, the <span style="">Commission </span>is
under obli­<span style="">gation to </span><span style="">procure, </span>sell and deliver the goods,
which said appellant had requisitioned or applied for at the rate of P2.00 for
every $1.00 of the procurement cost of said reparations item.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a word, appellant holds the view that the
said "contract to purchase" is a bilateral promise to buy and sell at
the rate of P2.00 to $1.00 and is as good <span style="">as </span>a perfected sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this posture, therefore, it argues with
vehemence that the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Commission cannot
unilaterally alter the <span style="">consideration of
the </span>perfected sale <span style="">by applying a
</span>rate of exchange <span style="">which was </span>not
<span style="">agreed upon, nor con</span>templated by
the parties <span style="">when they executed </span>the
a­foresaid "contract to purchase".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, however, an <span style="">examination
of </span>that "contract to purchase" does not <span style="">support appellant’s </span>assumption and<span style=""> </span>contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, it reveals all the earmarks
of a mere preliminary agreement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Admittedly, both the objects to be procured and the <span style="">price </span>to be paid were not specifically
described therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is like­wise
significant to note that in the "contract to purchase" there is no
stipulation as to what rate of exchange should govern in the determination of
the peso equivalent of the dollar <span style="">v</span>a<span style="">l</span>ue<span style=""> of</span> the reparations to be procured <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, we hold, obv<span style="">ious</span> from the face of the agreement that it does not contain,

shall be executed by the parties to the agreement which shall supersede the
said contract to purchase.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">With
this authority in mind, and </span>considering the sur­rounding circumstances
of the <span style="">of case already stated, it </span>is
our considered opinion that the Secretary of Just­ice was right, clod <span style="">the court below did not err, in </span>holding
that "existing contracts to purchase repara­tions goods are, at best,
preliminary agreements which do not definitely stipulate try contract price;
nor do they carry any <span style="">provision </span>as
to <span style="">the rate</span> to be used for the
conversion into pesos of <span style="">the </span>dollar
value of the reparations goods."</p>

<p class="BODY">Even from the standpoint that the "contract to
purchase" is a perfected contract between the parties, as contended by the
appellant, it can only be so with respect to the rights and obligations therein
stipula­ted and agreed upon by the parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We find that the Commission had assumed under the "contract to
purchase" the obligation to give due course to appellant's appli­cation
for the goods in question and to procure and deliver the same after appellant
shall have executed a contract of conditional purchase and sale of the goods
accordingly procured which, may be in whole or in part of the item specified in
the procurement order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before the
contemplated contract of conditional purchase and sale may be executed, certain
essential points must necessarily be threshed out first between them, as the
terms of payment, and the rate of exchange to be used in determining the peso
cost of the goods over which the minds of the parties may or may not meet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And since the parties made no mention whatsoever
in the "contract of purchase" about the rate of exchange to be
adopted in fixing the peso cost of the goods, it becomes necessary that a final
contract of conditional purchase and sale be subsequently executed by them be­fore
delivery of the goods wherein the dollar price of the goods may be reduced into
its peso equivalent.</p>

<p class="BODY">But it is pointed out by the appellant that in the "contract
to purchase" under consideration, it was required and made to pay a down
payment of P390, 000.00, and that thereafter, it was again made to put a
guarantee bond in the amount of P1,170,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ap­pellant therefore contends that since these amounts correspond to 5%
and 15%, respectively, of the $3,900,000.00 contract value of the reparations
goods it has applied for <span style="">as </span>required
it the existing rules and re­gulations of the Commission, and were arrived at
by using the then prevailing P2.00 to $1.00 rate of ex­change, it may
reasonably be inferred <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> that the parties
intended are understood that the same ra­tio (2:1) of the peso to the dollar
would be used in <span style="">ascertaining </span><span style="">peso price of the goods </span><span style="">after the same shall have been </span><span style="">subsequently procu</span><span style="">r</span><span style="">ed
from </span><span style="">Japan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence its insistence </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">rate </span>e<span style="">xchange </span><span style="">may </span><span style="">no </span>longer be altered or change in conditional purchase <span style="">and sale </span>to be executed by <span style="">the parties </span>before the delivery of the
<span style="">c</span>o<span style="">ntentio</span>n<span style=""> </span>should
be denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From<span style=""> the fact </span><span style="">alone that the
exchange </span>rate of P2.00 to P1.00 had<span style="">
been used in the computation</span> of the above-mentioned amounts of down
payments<span style=""> and </span>guarantee bond as
required in the then regulations of the Reparations Commission, is cannot be
lightly inferred that the parties bound themselves to use the same rate of
exchange in all their future dealings relative to the same goods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties could have so provided the same in
the contract had they wanted to, which they did not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And certainly, we <span style="">cannot </span>write something into the "contract to purchase"
and <span style="">make </span>its provisions cover
points not expressly stipulated therein, such as the conversion rate of the
peso to the dollar to be used to determine the equivalent in Philippine pesos
of the dollar price of the goods which, at the time the said "contract to
purchase" was<span style=""> </span>entered into,
had not even then been definitely ascertained.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It logic­ally follows, therefore, that the circumstances point­ed out by
the appellant can not <span style="">be </span>determinative
of the question regarding rate of <span style="">exchange
that should </span>govern the transaction in question.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">An examination of the
evidence of record reveals that the appellant stated the value of the goods in </span>its
application <span style="">filed with the Reparations
Commission as $3,904,915,42; and the Reparations Commission had referred to the
cost of the goods in dollars only </span><span style="">in
</span><span style="">all, its subsequent actions on
the said application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, when the
Commission approved the application on December 12, 1961, it "resolved to
approve the procurement of textile machineries and equipment for </span><span style="">Con</span>solidated Textile Mills, Inc at the
estimated contract value of the U. S. dollars <span style="">THREE </span>MILLION NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND ($3,900,000.00)".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same amount of $3,900, 000.00 appears in
the procurement order for the goods <span style="">issued
by the Reparations <span class="SpellE">Commi<span style="">sion</span></span> </span>on the following day, addressed to the Chief
of the Reparations Mis­sion in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Biddings were subsequently conducted in
Japan for the supply of the goods, as a result of which the Philippine and
Japanese <span style="">Governments </span>approved
the procurement contracts involving a total amount of $3,357,191.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And thereafter, herein appellant ap­plied for
additional equipments is the sum of $542,809.00 to <span style="">make use of the balance of the $3,900,000.</span><span style="">00 previously allocated to </span>it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It is</span>
<span style="">therefore, clear that the goods in
question were acquired </span>by <span style="">the </span>Reparations
Commission for herein <span style="">appellant </span>in
the amount of $3,900,000.00.</p>

<blockquote>"Contracts which are by their terms payable in foreign money,
if they are enforced in the United States, must be paid in United States money
equivalent, according to the acts of Con­gress, to the amount stipulated in the
contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been held, however,
that the exchange of currency or the rate of ex­change determines the
purchasing power or the equivalent of the <span style="">currency
</span>of one country as mea­sured by or in the currency of <span style="">another.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As the rate which nor­</span>mally affects business transact­ions
fluctuates from day to day, <span style="">it is </span>more
commonly expressed as <span style="">the current rate
of exchange; but when </span>the rate is established by contract or otherwise,
it is a fixed rate and controls all <span style="">mat­ters
within </span>the scope of its <span style="">operation."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">From
the </span>foregoing circumstances, and in <span style="">the light of the authority just quoted, it is seen that the real value
of the reparations good</span>s <span style="">procured
for herein appellant is $3,900,000.00 which should be the basis of the peso
value of said goods to be specified in </span>the <span style="">contract of conditional purchase and sale </span>entered <span style="">into between the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sum of $3,900,000.00 is the amount the
Reparations </span>Commission is supposed <span style="">to
pay to the Japanese suppliers of the goods.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The appellant may not expect the Reparations Commission to part with the
goods for any amount less than what </span>it will actually pay, or is supposed
to pay <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> <span style="">in
Japan, in the same way </span>that the Reparations Com­mission cannot compel
herein appellant to pay more than the value of the goods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This being so, and considering the failure of
the parties to <span style="">stipulate </span><span style="">in </span>the "contract to
purchase" the rate of exchange to be used in determining the peso value or
cost of the said goods, it would surely be <span style="">fair </span>and just, and in keeping with the substance of the
obligation that here­in appellant should pay for the goods in its equivalent
peso cost based on the free market rate of exchange of the peso to the dollar
at the time of the procurement in Japan.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither would the circumstance that by so applying the current rate of
exchange obtaining at the time of procurement, the acquisition cost of machine­ries
as reflected in its original project studies would be doubled, carry the day
for herein appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact still
remains that the Reparations Commission would not be unjustly enriched thereby
at appellant's expense for the reason that what appellant would pay would only
be equal to what the Reparations Commission is supposed to pay for the goods to
the Japanese suppliers.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, it is the opinion of the Court, that whether the
"contract to purchase "be treated as a <span style="">mere preliminary agreement of the parties, or as a perfected contract
which bound the Reparations Commission </span>to procure and then sell the
goods, and herein appel­lant to purchase the said goods, we have arrived at <span style="">the same conclusion - that for the failure of
the agreement to specify therein the rate of exchange to be adopted in
computing </span>the dollar <span style="">value </span>of
the goods <span style="">to its peso equivalent - </span>the
adoption of the free mar­ket rate by the Reparations Commission to ascertain <span style="">the peso cost of the goods would not spell impairment
of any obligation <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, we do not find it necessary to </span>dwell
at length on the discussion <span style="">of the
principle of non-impairment of obligation so elaborately expounded by appellant
in its brief; and </span>so, with the alleged denial of due process and equal
protection of the laws.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, AND CONSIDERING ALL THE FOREGOING, the decision
