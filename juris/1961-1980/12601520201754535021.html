				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">By virtue of a writ of execution issued by the Court of First Instance of La 
Union in Civil Case No. 1002 entitled Rodolfo Geronimo, plaintiff, <i>versus</i> 
Municipality of Caba, La Unión, defendant, the sheriff sold at public auction on 
July 16, 1957 to Dr. Felipe Mangaser a parcel of land situated in the same 
province for the sum of P1,011.81. The property was subject of redemption within 
one year from said date. Exactly one year from said date, or on July 16, 1958, 
the municipality of Caba, through its mayor, redeemed the property by depositing 
the purchase price, including interest, with the office of the provincial 
sheriff. Thereupon, the sheriff issued a certificate of redemption on the same 
date which was duly registered in the office of the register of deeds.
<p>On September 13, 1958, the purchaser filed with the court in the same case a 
petition to require the sheriff to execute a final deed of sale in his favor 
contending that the municipality of Caba, owner of the property, has failed to 
redeem it within the period of one year. In support of his petition, petitioner 
filed a memorandum on October 4, 1958, to which an answer was filed in behalf of 
the municipality, praying that an order be issued declaring the redemption valid 
and restoring the ownership of the property to the municipality.</p>
<p>After the parties had filed memoranda in support of this respective 
contentions, the court issued an order from which we quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"By affirmation in the certificate of redemption acknowledged by the 
Provincial Sheriff and registered with the Office of the Register of Deeds on 
July 16, 1958, it appears that the defendant municipality through its mayor 
redeemed the property depositing with the Provincial Sheriff the amount of the 
redemption money. Said document being in due form and substance and executed 
within the one year period provided by the Rules of Court, this Court does not 
need to inquire from the judgment debtor'duly represented, by its Municipal 
Mayor as to where the money used to redeem the property came from. The actuation 
of the Municipal Mayor in securing the amount used to redeem, the said property 
for the defendant municipality cannot.be inquired into in this proceeding as the 
Mayor just complied with his official duty to protect the interest of the 
municipality. If the Mayor secured the money illegally as insinuated by 
petitioner-purchaser, then the real aggrieved parties who own the money and who 
may be prejudiced by the acts of the Mayor, may bring the corresponding 
appropriate action before the competent court to protect their rights.</p>
<p>"IN VIEW THEREOF, it appearing that the defendant municipality has already 
redeemed the property, the herein petition to compel the sheriff to execute a 
final certificate of sale is hereby denied and the purchaser shall have the 
right to withdraw the money deposited with the Provincial Sheriff for the 
redemption of said property. The Municipality of Caba shall be restored to the 
possession of the property which it has already redeemed in accordance with law 
and the Rules of Court."</p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioner has appealed and the case is now before us on questions of law by 
virtue of the certification made by the Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>It is contended that Mayor Manuel Fonbuena cannot redeem the property in 
behalf of the municipality of Caba, La Unión, without first obtaining the 
consent or authority of the municipal council, and having done so without 
authority the redemption is invalid. It is likewise contended that even if the 
redemption was made with the authority of said body, the redemption would still 
not be valid because the money with which it was effected did not come from the 
municipality but from the Parents-Teachers Association of Caba, of which Mayor 
Fonbuena was the president. It is finally contended that the redemption should 
be invalidated because the municipal council in a resolution passed subsequent 
thereto declared that the mayor has acted in excess of his power and authority 
in making the redemption because he misrepresented that the redemption was being 
made by the municipality when in fact and in truth the latter was not 
financially able to do so for lack of funds even if the money was taken from the 
Parents-Teachers Association.</p>
<p>There is no merit in this contention. There is no dispute that the person who 
effected the redemption is Mayor Fonbuena of the municipality of Caba and that 
when he tendered the redemption money to the sheriff he acted in his capacity as 
such, otherwise the sheriff would not have allowed the redemption considering 
that the property belonged to the municipality. The fact that the redemption 
money did not come from the coffers of the municipality but from the 
Parents-Teachers Association of Caba which, upon the request of its President, 
Mayor Fonbuena, agreed to lend its own money in order that the redemption may be 
effected and the property restored to the municipality, cannot taint the 
transaction with invalidity it being a mere accommodation or help that said 
association deemed it wise to extend to the municipality. The money for the 
redemption of the property could have even come from a philanthropist, or a 
civic organization, and yet no one would dare dispute its propriety, for the 
same is intended for a worthy cause.</p>
<p>It is true that when the redemption was made the Mayor was not authorized by 
any resolution of the municipal council nor was there any appropriation by said 
council of the money needed for the redemption, but the lack of such resolution 
would not also taint with invalidity the redemption for the mayor, as chief 
executive, was in duty bound to take such step as may be necessary to protect 
the interest of his municipality. It should be noted that the property belongs 
to the municipality and it was his bounden duty to redeem it in order that it 
may not be lost.</p>
<p>In this connection, we find correct the following comment of the lower court: 
"The actuation of the Municipal Mayor in securing the. amount used to redeem the 
said property for the defendant municipality cannot be inquired into in this 
proceeding as the Mayor just complied with his official duty to protect the 
interest of said municipality. If the Mayor secured the money illegally as 
insinuated by the petitioner-purchaser, then the real aggrieved parties who 
owned the money and who may be prejudiced by the acts of the Mayor, may bring 
the corresponding appropriate action before the competent court to protect their 
rights.</p>
<p>The order appealed from is affirmed, with costs against 
appellant.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, 
Paredes,</i> and <i>Dizon, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
