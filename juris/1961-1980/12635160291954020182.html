				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Plaintiff-appellant <span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span> Tan and one Antonio <span class="SpellE">Conejero</span>
were accused of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> committed by means of false it
pretenses in an information filed on October 10, 1958 the Court of First
Instance of Manila, Branch VI, <span class="SpellE">dockeyed</span> as Criminal
Case No. 45905.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due proceedings,
the trial court, on October 27, 1959, acquitted Antonio <span class="SpellE">Conejero</span>
but convicted plaintiff-appellant for consummated <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="8">August
 31, 1963</st1:date>, the judgment of Branch VI of the Court of First Instance
of Manila was modified, the appellate court convicting plaintiff-appellant of
attempted <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter still <span class="SpellE">endeavoured</span>
to have the Supreme Court totally reverse the modified judgment but his
petition for review was not given due course since the issues raised were
factual and there was no merit in the petition.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1964</st1:date>,
plaintiff-appellant instituted Civil Case No. 58158 before Branch XXI of the
Court of First Instance of Manila to annul the judgment of convic­tion rendered
in the criminal proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His ground
was that the information therein was so totally defective that criminal
jurisdiction did not attach, thereby vitiating the resulting judgment of
conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, in the criminal proceedings, plaintiff-appellant was
able to have the promulgation of the judg­ment of conviction for attempted <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> suspended pending tee outcome of the civil case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1964</st1:date>,
the State filed its answer in the civil case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The issues having been joined, and after a pre-trial resulting in a stipulation
of the facts as stated above, the <span class="GramE">lower</span> court rendered
judgment on <st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1965</st1:date>
which dismissed the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff-appellant now comes again to this Court on a pure
question of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Basically, what plaintiff-appellant seeks is to have Branch XXI
of the Court of First Instance of Manila annul a judgment originating from
Branch VI of the same court, as modified, with finality, by the appellate
courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This simply cannot be done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just very recently,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="GramE">We</span> reaffirmed the rule that "x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> the jurisdiction to annul a judgment of a branch of
the Court of First Instance belongs <u>solely</u> to the very same branch which
rendered the judgment." For the lower court to have acceded to
plaintiff-appellants prayer would have been for it to have exceeded its juris­diction
or to have acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason alone, the
appeal should be dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">But even on the merits, the appeal cannot prosper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The offense for which plaintiff was indicted
is prescribed by Art. 315(2<span class="GramE">)(</span>a) of the Revised Penal
Code in the follow­ing language:</p>

<blockquote>"2.<span style=""> </span><u>By means of any of the following false

<blockquote>"That on or about and during the period covered from September
11, 1958 to October 9, 1958, both dates inclusive, in the City of Manila,
Philippines, the said accused <span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span> Tan y <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> and Antonio <span class="SpellE">Conejero</span> y
<span class="SpellE">Navo</span>, the latter being then an employee of the Phi­lippine

Fernando E. <span class="SpellE">Ricafort</span>, As­sistant General Manager of
the <span class="SpellE">Laureano</span> Bro­thers Co., Inc., in the following
manner:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said accused, during the

would give the accused 10% of the said sum of P250,000.00 or the amount of
P25,000.00; that the sum of P25,000.00 would be given to Execu­tive Secretary <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span> as bribe money for the said purpose of facilitating
the release of the afore-mentioned loan, <u>and by means of other<span style="">&nbsp; </span>similar deceits</u>, <u>succeeded in inducing

knowing fully well that their <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> Pretenses</u>,

they willfully, unlawfully and feloniously</u>, with intent to defraud, <u>misappropriated</u>,

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Contrary to law."</span> (Stress
supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The underscored portions of the
above-quoted information clearly refute the claim that some of the supposed
essen­tial elements of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> by means of false
pretenses were not alleged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The element
of false pretenses is alleged by the averment that the accused manifested and
represen­ted to the injured party that they were influential to the President
and his Executive Secretary, Which they knew fully well to be false and which
they made only to obtain P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> from the injured
party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The averment that the accused
"succeeded in inducing the injured party to part with his P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> is sufficient allegation of the ele­ment that the
offended party relied upon such false pre­tenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lastly, the phrase "to the damage and
prejudice of said Fernando E. <span class="SpellE">Ricafort</span> in the
aforesaid sum of P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>" constitutes the averment of damages. There is
no basis therefore for the charge that plaintiff-appellant's constitutional
right to be informed of the nature and cause of his accusation was violated.</p>
