Instance of Manila granting <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">appellee's</span></span>,
application for citizenship and ordering the issuance of the corresponding
certificate of naturalization in his favor upon compliance by him of the
requisites imposed by Republic Act No. 530.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Peh</span>
Lay Ben, alias <span class="SpellE">Liao</span> Kay <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>,
filed his application for naturalization in the lower court on <st1:date year="1960" day="19" month="7">July 19, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General, on behalf of the
State, filed an opposition thereto, and subsequently <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
filed a reply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the
publication re­quired by law having been accomplished, the case was heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the last hearing, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
filed a motion for the re-opening of the case to enable him to present additional
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the hearing held on <st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1962</st1:date>, the parties were
required to submit memoranda on whether the additional income reflected in <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> Income Tax Return for 1961 may be considered for
the purpose of meeting the requirement of lucrative employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the parties had done so, the trial
court rendered the decision men­tioned heretofore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the State took the steps required
for appeal purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pending approval of
the State's record on appeal, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed another
motion, to re-open the case to afford him — and the State, if the latter so
desired — an opportunity to produce additional evidence on his income for
1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
motion was granted, and after the presentation of such additional evidence, the
court issued its order of <st1:date year="1963" day="3" month="2">February 3,
 1963</st1:date> affirming its original decision of <st1:date year="1962" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence shows the following:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was born in Amoy, China on June
30, 1929 and arrived at the Port of Manila on December 29, 1937 as son of a mer­chant;
since then he resided at <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> Street, Manila until
1941; from 1941 up to 1945 he resided at <span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span>
Street, <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span>, Manila; he moved to Alvarado
Street, the same city, sometime in 1945 and stayed there up to 1946; from 1946
up to March 14, 1961, he returned <span style="">to </span>and
stayed at 473 <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> Street, Manila, from where he
transferred to 3013 Int. 85, <span class="SpellE">Nagtahan</span> Street, Manila,
where he had been living up to the time of the hearing; he left for China in
December 1946 and there married <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> <span class="SpellE">Suat</span> Ping on March 20, 1947, in Amoy, Province of <span class="SpellE">Fukien</span>, and returned to the Philippines in July 1947; left
again for China in April 1948 returning to the Philippines only in March 1949;
left again for <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> either in October or November
1953, returning to the Philippines two or three months thereafter; he left
again for <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> in November or December 1954,
returning after two months; he went again to <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>
either in September or October 1955, returning to the Philippines in December
of the same year; left again for <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> in
September or October 1957, returning to the Philippines in December of the same
year; left again in September or October 1958, returning to the Philippines in
December of the same year; left again for <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> in
November 1959 and returned only in February 1960, this trip having been his
last to visit some members of his family in China or in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>;
he has four chil­dren with his wife bearing the names of <span class="SpellE">Liao</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ket</span> <span class="SpellE">Hai</span>, born on January
28, 1949, in China; <span class="SpellE">Liao</span> We Lip, born on De­cember
26, 1949, in China; <span class="SpellE">Liao</span> <span class="SpellE">Giok</span>
Lip, born on July 28, 1955, in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Liao</span> <span class="SpellE">Siy</span> Chin, born on November
8, 1956, in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>; at the time he filed his
petition for naturalization, all his four children were residing in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> and they came to the Philippines only on December
18, 1960, having been admitted as temporary visitors for a period of three
months; upon their arrival <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> enrolled <span class="SpellE">Liao</span> <span class="SpellE">Ket</span> <span class="SpellE">Hai</span>,
then eleven years old, and <span class="SpellE">Liao</span> We Lip, age ten, in
Grade Four with the Crusaders' School in <span class="SpellE">Ongpin</span>,
Manila; although they were admitted only as temporary visitors, the four
children as well as <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> wife had been living
with him in his residence in <span class="SpellE">Nagtahan</span> Street since
their arrival.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span> evidence further shows that
he was em­ployed at the time of the filing of his application, with <span style="">the Hong <span class="SpellE">Moh</span> Tea
Firm located at 473 <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> Street, Manila, at a
monthly salary of P380.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Urging <span class="GramE">Us</span> to reverse the appealed
decision, the Solicitor General contends that the lower court erred in granting
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Philippine citizenship in spite of the fact
that:</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">He is not a person of
irreproachable character, and lacks <span class="SpellE">sincerety</span> in his
desire to embrace Philippine way of life.</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To resolve this appeal, <span class="GramE">We</span> need resolve
only the first and second of the above enumerated issues.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the matter of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> places of
residence, paragraph 2 of his petition for naturalization alleges the
following:</p>

<blockquote>"2. My present
place of residence is at <st1:address><st1:street>No. 473 <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
  St.</st1:street>, <st1:city>Manila</st1:city></st1:address> formerly <st1:street><st1:address>No.
  423 <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> St.</st1:address></st1:street> and my
former place of residence during the Japanese occupation <span class="GramE">was</span>
at <st1:address><st1:street><span class="SpellE">Da<span style="">pitan</span></span><span style=""> St.</span></st1:street><span style="">, </span><st1:city><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Quezon</span></span><span style=""> City</span></st1:city></st1:address><span style="">."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The evidence shows, however, that aside from 473 (formerly 423) <st1:address><st1:street><span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> Street</st1:street>, <st1:city>Manila</st1:city></st1:address>,
and <st1:address><st1:street><span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span> Street</st1:street>,
 <st1:city><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:city></st1:address>, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> also lived at <st1:address><st1:street>Alvarado
  Street</st1:street>, <st1:city>Ma­nila</st1:city></st1:address>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claims, however, that his failure to
include and mention this place in his petition was due to the fact that he
stayed there for a period of only twenty-five days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As against this, however, the State claims
that the evidence of record shows that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
stayed at that place from sometime in the year 1945 up to the year 1946.</p>

<p class="BODY">It will be noticed that, cross-examined on the mat­ter of his
places of residence, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> testified that he had
not resided in any other place except 473 <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
Street, and 3013 Interior 85, <span class="SpellE">Nagtahan</span> Street, both
of the City of Manila (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 99-100, August 31,
1961).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon being questioned further,
however, he disclosed that he had also resided at <st1:address><st1:street><span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span> Street</st1:street>, <st1:city><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:city></st1:address> from 1941 to 1945
and that in 1945 he moved to <st1:street><st1:address>Alvarado Street</st1:address></st1:street>
(<span class="SpellE">t.s<span class="GramE">,n</span></span>., p. 102, <st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His residence at Alva­rado Street, Manila —
which he did not disclose in his petition for naturalization — was formally
admitted by him in his answers given to the Confidential Question­naire on
Naturalization before the Manila Police Depart­ment on May 5, 1961 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 2, Government, pp. 68-74, Folder of Exhibits) where he
made of record that he had stayed thereat "from 1945 to 1946."</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated heretofore, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> claims —
and in this he was sustained by the trial court — that his residence at <st1:street><st1:address>Alvarado
  Street</st1:address></st1:street> was temporary in character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We be­lieve, however, that residing in a
particular place from 1945 to 1946 cannot be considered as "temporary
residence" in the eyes of our laws on naturalization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In De <span class="SpellE">Pek</span>
Long vs. Republic of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE">, G.R. No.</span> L-18758, <st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="5">May
 30, 1964</st1:date>, <span class="GramE">We</span> reversed the decision of the
Court of First In­stance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte admitting
the therein petitioner to Philippine citizenship, because of his failure to dis­close
in his petition his stay in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
in the year 1956 although it was only <u>preparatory for his departure for the </u><st1:country-region><st1:place><u>United
  States</u></st1:place></st1:country-region><u>.</u> From this it may be
clearly inferred that the temporary character of petitioner's residence at a
particular place does not excuse him from alleging that place as one of his
former places of residence, particu­larly in a case like the present where,
upon the evidence before Us; <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> stay could
have been for a period of months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
view is in consonance with that expressed in <span class="SpellE">Keng</span> <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> vs. Republic, G.R. No. L-13347, <st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1961</st1:date> and in Go <span class="SpellE">Bok</span>
vs. Republic, G.R. No. L-16813, <st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="12">Decem­ber
 27, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Go <span class="SpellE">Bok</span> We held that the failure of the therein petitioner to
disclose in his petition the fact of his residence at <span class="SpellE">Tres</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Abril</span> and C. Padilla Streets, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
City, was fatal to his case in spite of his explanation to the effect that he
honestly believed that it was not necessary for him to make such disclosure in
view of the fact that he had already stated in his petition that he resided in <span class="SpellE">Comercio</span> Street which was very near the two streets
omitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear, therefore, that We
have consistently held that the petitioner in a naturalization case must
strictly comply with the law (Section 7, Common­wealth Act 473) requiring the
statement or disclosure of all his former places of residence because it is
intended to give the State an opportunity to make such inquiries <span style="">as may be necessary regarding his character
and moral fit­ness (<span class="SpellE">Keng</span> <span class="SpellE">Giok</span>,
supra; Lo vs. Republic, G.R. No. L-15919, </span><st1:date year="1961" day="19" month="5"><span style="">May 19, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the matter of <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> lucrative
employment, paragraph 3 of his petition for naturalization gives the sum of P3<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> to be, more or less, his average annual income
during the three years preceding the filing of said petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Testifying during the hearing held on <st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1961</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
said that in 1961 his average income was P380.00 monthly in the form of salary
as em­ployee of Hong <span class="SpellE">Moh</span> Tea Firm (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 67-68, <st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="8">August
 31, 1961</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
cross-examination, he not only reiterated this statement but said further that,
aside from said salary, he had no other source of income (Idem, pp. 103-104, <span style="">August 31, 1961; <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
pp. 139-141, September 20, 1961).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
testimony finds confirmation in <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> sworn
application for clearance with the NBI dated </span><st1:date year="1961" day="4" month="4"><span style="">April 4, 1961</span></st1:date><span style=""> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1,
Government, pp. 64-65, Folder of Exhib­its), and in the answers given by him in
the Confidential Questionnaire on Naturalization (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
2, Government, pp. 68, 74, Folder of Exhibits) executed on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="5" month="5"><span style="">May </span><span style="">5, </span><span style="">1961</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Quite obvious is the fact that the additional evidence which the
trial court allowed <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to intro­duce during the
re-opening of the case was intended to prove that, for the year 1961, aside
from his annual in­come already referred to, he had received representation
allowance from Cortez Transportation Inc. in the amount of P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
and another allowance from People's Trading in the amount of P1,500.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such evidence, including the testimony of his
supposed two other employers <span class="GramE">is</span>, to say the least, <span style="">of a </span>highly suspicious character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was clearly intended to cure the
insufficiency of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> evidence presented prior
to the re-opening of the case, which was not sufficient to show that he had a
lucrative employment considering the fact that he had a wife and four children
to support.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That such evidence is of a <span style="">highly suspicious nature is shown by the
absence of read</span>ily acceptable explanation in the record of how, being a
full time employee of Hong <span class="SpellE">Moh</span> Tea Firm who was
paying a monthly salary of P380.00, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> could
still do or perform sufficiently important work to merit representa­tion allowances
from two other alleged employers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then
again, <span style="">if </span>it were true that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was also employed by Cortez Transportation Inc.
and the People's Trading during the year 1961, why did he <span style="">fail </span>to mention this important fact in
his original testimony and in his sworn statement before the NBI and the Manila
Police Department?</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, with particular reference to the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> allegedly received by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
from the People's Trading, there is the particular circumstance that, ac­cording
to his alleged employer, Li Ban <span class="SpellE">Hok</span>, the amount was
"paid to him as a <span style="">sort of </span>gift"
(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 35-37, <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1962</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If so, it could be considered good — if at all — only for the year 1961
and would be immaterial to show <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> alleged
lucrative employment after that year in the absence of definite assurance that
he would continue to receive the same generous "gift" from his al­leged
employer in the years to follow.</p>

<p class="BODY">Relevant to the matter under discussion are our decisions in <span class="SpellE">Justo</span> Tan vs. Republic, G.R. No. L-6013, <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1963</st1:date> and <span class="SpellE">Keng</span> <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> vs. Republic, supra,
where We held that even the yearly income of P6<span class="GramE">,300.00</span>
and P8,687.00 were not lucrative income where the petitioner in a
naturalization case had a wife and four children to support.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, <span class="GramE">We</span> no longer
deem it necessary to consider the other issues raised by the State in its
brief, the foregoing being sufficient for a reversal of the appealed decision.</p>
