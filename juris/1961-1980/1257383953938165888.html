				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a pauper's &nbsp;appeal &nbsp;urging &nbsp;the &nbsp;enforcement by writ of execution of a final award &nbsp;in the sum of P3,088.27 granted to the appellant by the Workmen's Compensation Commission against the &nbsp;Republic of the &nbsp;Philippines. <p>The appellant, Kindipan Belleng, a laborer for more than thirty (30) years in &nbsp;the &nbsp;Office of the City &nbsp;Engineer of Baguio, was bitten by a snake, &nbsp;and, as a result, one of his legs had &nbsp;to &nbsp;be amputated. &nbsp;&nbsp;He filed a claim under the Workmen's Compensation Act against the &nbsp;"Republic of the &nbsp;Philippines—City &nbsp;Engineer &nbsp;of Baguio", &nbsp; which &nbsp;was docketed as BWC &nbsp;Case No. 1516-R01. &nbsp;The claim was uncontroverted, and &nbsp; the &nbsp;case was heard <em>ex parte</em> ursuant to an order of &nbsp;an Associate &nbsp;Commissioner of the Workmen's Compensation &nbsp;Commission, &nbsp;the hearing officer &nbsp;rendered, on 3 January 1962, a resolution and award in favor of &nbsp;the &nbsp;claimant. The awardee &nbsp;then requested, &nbsp;on 29 January 1962, the City Engineer of Baguio to comply with the resolution and award, but &nbsp;the latter &nbsp;failed to act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p> <p>Claimant then filed with the Court of First Instance of Baguio City a petition &nbsp;to enforce the said &nbsp;resolution and award. &nbsp;The &nbsp;respondents &nbsp;did &nbsp;not &nbsp;answer, &nbsp;or &nbsp;oppose the &nbsp;petition. The &nbsp;court rendered judgment, and, &nbsp;upon motion, ordered that execution issue. &nbsp;The sheriff served the writ of execution upon the City Engineer's Office. On 29 March &nbsp;1962, however, the court, &nbsp;over the objection of the petitioner, sustained a motion "to quash and/or stay execution" &nbsp;filed &nbsp;by the Solicitor- General. &nbsp;The petitioner then filed &nbsp;a motion &nbsp;for reconsideration, and, acting upon the &nbsp;same, &nbsp;the court promulgated an order on &nbsp;27 April 1962, reading as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>"Petitioner has filed &nbsp;a motion for reconsideration to the order of this Court denying the &nbsp;issuance of a writ of execution against the Government. The mere fact that &nbsp;the &nbsp;Workmen's &nbsp;Compensation &nbsp;Law applies &nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;Government does not mean &nbsp;that &nbsp;the immunity from suit has been waived insofar as the issuance of execution is concerned. &nbsp;The proper remedy is the filing &nbsp;of a claim before the Auditor- General's Office."</p> </blockquote> <p>The above-quoted &nbsp;order &nbsp;is now the &nbsp;subject &nbsp;of the present appeal.</p> <p>The Workmen's Compensation &nbsp;Act applies—</p> <blockquote> <p> "to mounted messengers in the service of the National Government and all its political subdivisions and to &nbsp;the &nbsp; employees and laborers employed &nbsp;in &nbsp;public works and in the industrial concerns of the Government and to all other persons performing manual labor &nbsp;in the service of the National Government and its &nbsp;political &nbsp;&nbsp;subdivisions &nbsp;and &nbsp;instrumentalities; * * * " (Sec. 2, &nbsp;Act 3428, &nbsp;as &nbsp;amended by Rep. Act &nbsp;772); </p> </blockquote> <p>and the "Workmen's &nbsp;Compensation &nbsp;Commissioner &nbsp;shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide claims &nbsp;for compensation * &nbsp;* *" &nbsp;&nbsp;(Sec. 46, Act 3428, &nbsp;as added &nbsp;by Section 24, Republic Act &nbsp;772). &nbsp;However, the award &nbsp;is enforced through the regular courts of justice &nbsp;(Section 51, Act &nbsp;3428, as amended &nbsp;by Republic &nbsp;Act &nbsp;772).</p> <p>While Section 53 &nbsp;of &nbsp;the Workmen's Compensation &nbsp;Act directs the national, provincial, and municipal governments to deposit an amount to be determined by the Workmen's Compensation commissioner, to guarantee payment of Compensation to injured laborers employed by them, and these deposits may be disbursed, &nbsp;through the authority of the commissioner or his deputy, as compensation payments to the said laborers &nbsp;of the government entities "making the contribution (Section 53, Act 3428, as amended by Republic Act 772), nevertheless, Section 7 of Act &nbsp;3083 provides:</p> <blockquote> <p>"Sec, 7. No execution shall issue upon any judgment rendered by any court against the &nbsp;Government of the Philippine Islands under the provisions of this &nbsp;Act; * * *."</p> </blockquote> <p>We find the position &nbsp;taken by appellant, &nbsp;that the Workmen's Compensation Act has repealed, by implication, &nbsp;section 7 of Act 3083, to be untenable. &nbsp;This Court finds harmony, rather than conflict, in the foregoing provisions of law. &nbsp;&nbsp;In consenting to &nbsp;be sued under the Workmen's Compensation Act, the &nbsp;Government did &nbsp;not waive the condition prescribed by Act 3083 &nbsp;that no &nbsp;execution may issue against it by any court.</p> <blockquote> <p>"The state &nbsp;may give its consent to &nbsp;be sued by private &nbsp;parties either by a general or by &nbsp;a special law. But when this concession is &nbsp;granted, the state may limit or &nbsp;regulate the right of action thus given by such &nbsp;conditions as &nbsp;it may deem, necessary * * *." (Sinco, Philippine Political Law, p. 37)</p> </blockquote> <p>As things now stand, the state &nbsp;has allowed itself to be sued in &nbsp;compensation cases, but has limited the claimant's action only up to the completion &nbsp;of proceedings anterior to the stage of execution. &nbsp;There being no incompatibility between them, the Workmen's Compensation Act did not repeal, by implication, &nbsp;Section 7 of &nbsp;Act 3083.</p> <p>This Court is not unmindful &nbsp;of the pauper-appellant's plight for the delayed satisfaction &nbsp;of his claim, &nbsp;but It cannot, &nbsp;on &nbsp;equitable considerations, &nbsp;sanction a &nbsp;remedy which the law prohibits.</p> <p>Appellant's remedy lies in section 53 of the Compensation Act, requiring the national, provincial, and municipal governments &nbsp;and &nbsp;government-owned &nbsp;or controlled &nbsp;corporations to make contributions to the compensation guarantee fund therein provided. &nbsp;If appellant's employer contributed to the fund in the amount previously determined by &nbsp;the Workmen's &nbsp;Compensation Commissioner, &nbsp;<em>and if</em> there is a balance available, the said Commissioner, as depositary or trustee, &nbsp;upon proper request, may authorize the disbursement of such fund to satisfy the award in accordance with Section 53 of Act 3428, as amended. &nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, appellant &nbsp;must apply to the Auditor-General, as suggested by the court below.</p> <p>For the foregoing reasons, the appealed order is affirmed, and, as &nbsp;recommended &nbsp;by the Solicitor-General, &nbsp;without costs against the &nbsp;appellant.</p> <p>Within &nbsp;five (5) &nbsp;days after this decision becomes final, let a certified copy be sent to the Office of the President of the Philippines in &nbsp;connection with the letter of notification sent &nbsp;to him by &nbsp;the Clerk of Court of the &nbsp;Court of First Instance of Baguio, dated 23 May 1962, &nbsp;pursuant to Section 7 of &nbsp;Act 3083. &nbsp;So &nbsp;ordered.</p> <p><em>Bengzon, &nbsp;C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala,</em> and <em>Makalintal, JJ.,</em> &nbsp;concur.</p> <p>&nbsp; </p> <hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; The record shows a 1st Indorsement, dated 31 May &nbsp;1962, &nbsp;of the Department Legal Counsel of the Department of Public Works and Communications to the Commissioner of Public Highways "requesting appropriate action".<p></p> </div>
