				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of First
Instance, Branch I, of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span> in Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">V-2681, for reco­very of property, consisting of 30 parcels of land
and of unpaid rentals for their cultivation.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff-appellant Alexander Castro is the adopted son of the
late Father Eduardo N. Castro, parish priest of <span class="SpellE">Tanjay</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Luis <span class="SpellE">Escutin</span>
is one of the heirs, and the administrator of the testate estate, of the late <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> <span class="SpellE">Escutin</span>, who died in
1955.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Upon <span class="SpellE">Nicanor's</span> death, Special Proceedings No.</span> V-2033 over
his testate estate was filed in the Court of First Instance, Branch II.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the special proceedings, defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Luis <span class="SpellE">Escutin</span>, in his
capacity as Administrator, returned an inventory; plaintiff-appellant Alexander
Castro filed a motion to exclude the subject 30 parcels of land from this
inventory on the ground that they are his properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before this motion could be resolved in
Branch II, the complaint in this case was filed in Branch I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the presiding judge in Branch II
entered an order in Special Proceedings No. <span class="GramE">V-2033, holding
in abeyance his reso­lution of the motion, pending final determination of <span style="">the </span>civil action in Branch I.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision rendered on <st1:date year="1966" day="7" month="7">7 July 1966</st1:date> by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> dismissed
the complaint, with costs against the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this appeal.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Supreme Court took cognizance of the appeal because the value
of the property involved is in excess of TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (P200, 000.
00), Phi­lippine currency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff-appellant
Alexander T. Castro executed a subscribed verification stating that in <span style="">his </span>complaint, he claims <span style="">ownership </span>of <span style="">the </span>30 parcels of land <span style="">which
his </span>predecessor-in-interest, the late Father Castro, allegedly purchased
in the sum of SIXTY NINE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED PESOS (P69, 300. 00).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further stated that the 30 lots contain a
total area of 141 hectares more or less, most of which are <span class="SpellE">ricelands</span>
very near the <span class="SpellE"><u>poblacion</u></span> of Dao, <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>, and the rest of which are lands in the <span class="SpellE"><u>poblacion</u></span> itself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He also stated that at the rate of P1<span class="GramE">,400.00</span>
per hectare, the <span class="SpellE">ricelands</span> near the <span class="SpellE"><u>poblacion</u></span> of Dao are worth at least P182, 000.
00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This amount, added to the amount
representing the value of the lands in the <span class="SpellE"><u>poblacion</u></span>,
total TWO HUNDRED FOUR THOUSAND PESOS (P204, 000. 00), an aggregate value which
he considers to be conservative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Record on Appeal, pp. 127-130).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that the late <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> <span class="SpellE">Escutin</span> was a sugar planter who owned Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Escutin</span> in <span class="SpellE">Lacaron</span>, Dao, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Capiz</span></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For financing, he turned to the Asturias
Sugar Central Inc. at <span class="SpellE">Dumalag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>,
which extended him a running account.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unfor­tunately, financial reverses visited the hacienda, provoking from <st1:country-region><st1:place>Asturias</st1:place></st1:country-region>
a threat to foreclose the pending mortgage (See Exhibit 2).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was no idle threat, for <st1:country-region><st1:place>Asturias</st1:place></st1:country-region>
had previously foreclosed the mortgages on the haciendas of two other
millers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the threat was carried out,
foreclosure would mean losing not only the hacienda, but also the other <span class="SpellE">Escutin</span> properties by means of a deficiency judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> decided to
seek the advice of a close family friend and lawyer, <span class="SpellE">Gervasio</span>
Diaz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He recommended that they should
simulate an encumbrance on <span class="SpellE">Nicanor's</span> properties not
directly involved with <st1:country-region><st1:place>Asturias</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
to stave off attachment or execution for the satisfaction of a possible
deficiency judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this simulated encumbrance, the role of creditor was played by
Father Eduardo N. Castro, <span class="SpellE">Nicanor's</span> close boyhood
friend and schoolmate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Father Castro was
godfather to <span class="SpellE">Nicanor's</span> eldest son, the defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Father Castro
also solem­nized the second marriage of <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stayed with <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span>
when he was assigned as parish priest of Dao.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Gervasio</span> prepared a deed of mortgage on
<span class="SpellE">Nicanor's</span> 30 parcels of land in favor of Father
Castro.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contract, styled "<span class="SpellE">Escritura</span> de <span class="SpellE">Prestamo</span> con <span class="SpellE">Hipoteca</span>," (Exhibit A) appears to have been executed
on <st1:date year="1932" day="5" month="6">5 June 1932</st1:date> in <span class="SpellE">Ayuquitan</span> (now <span class="SpellE">Amlan</span>) <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental, "for the consideration of a loan of
P63<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, with interest at 10% per annum," to
be paid on or before <st1:date year="1944" day="30" month="12">30 December 1944</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contract was accompanied by a
counter-receipt <span style="">(<u>contra</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>recibo</u></span>) </span>by the mortgagee, acknowledging
payment of the redemption price stipulated in the contract of mortgage (<u>See</u>
Exhibit 13).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the mortgage contract
and counter-receipt were signed, Father Castro sent the mortgage contract to
Notary Public Pedro <span class="SpellE">Bandoquillo</span> for acknowledgment.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Nicanor's</span> financial problems did not
lighten; in fact they deteriorated, and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Asturias</st1:place></st1:country-region>
required him to sign a promissory note.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At this occasion, the threat of foreclosure was reiterated, and this
prompted <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> to seek further legal advice from <span class="SpellE">Gervacio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To fortify
<span class="SpellE">Nicanor's</span> position, <span class="SpellE">Gervacio</span>
drafted a deed of sale, styled "<span class="SpellE">Escritura</span> de <span class="SpellE">Venta</span> <span class="SpellE">Definitiva</span>" (Exhibit
B).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears to have been executed on
27 July 1933 at <span class="SpellE">Tanjay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Oriental, and stipulated that <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> sold, conveyed,
and trans­ferred all the parcels of land described in Exhibit A in favor of
Father Castro for the sum of P63<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> plus
P6,300.00, representing the unpaid interest of 10% per annum, as stipulated in
the aforementioned Exhibit A, or at the total price of P69,300.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deed of sale had a built-in agreement of
lease in favor of <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> at P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
yearly for all of the same pro­perties described in Exhibit A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> and Father
Castro signed the deed of sale with the built-in lease agreement, and the
corres­ponding counter-receipt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> introduced evidence
to show that despite the deed of sale, <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span>
continued to possess and enjoy, and exercise acts of ownership over, all the
properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After <span class="SpellE">Nicanor's</span>
death, these properties were partitioned and distributed to his heirs who, at
the time this civil action was filed in 1963, had been individually in
possession of their respective shares since 1956 (Exhibits 8, 8-A, 8-B and 8-C).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
evidence also shows that the properties remained registered in <span class="SpellE">Nicanor's</span> name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
tax declarations were in his name; he paid the taxes in his own <span class="GramE">capacity,</span> and not as agent for another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After his death, his children paid the taxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> nor
his surviving heirs ever paid the interest stipulated in the contract of
mortgage, nor the yearly rental stipulated in the deed of sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the pre-trial conference, the parties admitted the genuineness
and due execution, both of the <span class="GramE">contract</span> of mortgage,
and of the deed of definite sale with the built-in lease contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the only issue left was whether
the two contracts, which are onerous in character, were executed for
consideration and therefore valid, as claimed by plaintiff-appellant; or were
simulated and therefore void, as claimed by defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This remains the issue on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">To resolve the issue, we start with the legal presumption that
there was a sufficient consideration for a written contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Rules of Court, Rule 131,
Section 5, paragraph r).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
outset, then, the regular presumption weighs the case in favor of
plaintiff-appellant, and imposes the burden of proof on the defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, since the burden of proof lies on the party who
would be defeated if no evidence were given on either side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Rules of Court, Rule 131, Section 1).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, granting that even private
transactions are to be presumed fair and regular, the presumption is only <u><span style="">prima</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>facie</u>, and must yield to evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Genato</span>
v. de Lorenzo, L-24983, 20 May 1968; 23 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 618.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The cumulative effect of the evidence presented by the defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is to identify certain badges of fraud that attach
themselves to both contracts under consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> nor
his successors-in-interest ever paid interest or rentals, pursuant to the
provisions of the two instruments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their
possession of all the lands was peaceful, adverse, and continuous, and they
exclusively enjoyed its fruits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
certificate of title covering the lands remained in <span class="SpellE">Nicanor's</span>
name, and it was he who declared them for taxation purposes and paid the taxes,
a duty assumed by his heirs after his death.</p>

<p class="BODY">More startling to the dispassionate mind is the incongruence
between the <span class="GramE">income</span> supposed to be earned by the
property under the deed of mortgage on the one hand, and the income supposed to
be earned under the deed of sale on the other hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the deed of mortgage, Father Castro
apparently was to earn P6<span class="GramE">,300.00</span> yearly, representing
the interest at 10% per annum on the principal loan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But under the deed of sale, Father Castro
apparently was to earn only P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> yearly,
represent­ing the payment for the lease.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It thus appears that when Father Castro extended a loan secured by the
mortgage, he stood to earn more by way of interest payments, than when he
bought the land outright and then leased it out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an obvious discrepancy would not escape
the notice of a reasonable man, and can only be explained as a grave symptom of
simulation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the late Father
Castro took no step whatsoever to assume ownership over the land, such as
demanding payment for interest or rentals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This failure to take exclusive possession of the property allegedly sold
to him is a clear badge of fraud [<u>See</u> <span class="SpellE">Oria</span> vs.
<span class="SpellE">McMicking</span>, 21 Phil. 243 (1912)].</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiff-appellant implicitly admits as much, for in the
lower court, he argued that this case should be subsumed under the principle of
<span class="GramE"><u><span style="">In</span></u></span><u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">pari</span> <span class="SpellE">delicto</span> </span>non </u><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">oritur</span></u></span><u><span style=""> action</span></u> (Record on Appeal, page
121).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, to the general rule that
when two persons are equally at fault, the law will not relieve them, the
Supreme Court has laid down an exception, by deciding that the rule does not
apply to an inexistent contract [Gonzales vs. Trinidad, 67 Phil. 682 (1939)].<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the intent to defraud, which was
the animus of the two simulated contracts, was never effectuated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">For the finances of the
Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Escutin</span> subse­quently took a turn for the
better, and </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE">Asturias</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE"> abandoned the threat to foreclose the mortgage on the hacienda.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Another token of fraud is the relationship between <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> and Father Castro, the ostensible
mortgagee-vendee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been observed
that fraud is generally accompanied by a secret trust, and that, as in this
case, the ostensible debtor selects a person in whom he can repose trust and
confidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[See Ford v. <span class="SpellE">Chelf</span>, 112 <span class="SpellE">Vd</span>. 98, 102, 70 S.E.
500, cited in Garcia et al. v. <span class="SpellE">Bituin</span>, etc. et al.,
CA-<span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. No. 12297-R, 55 <span class="SpellE">O.G</span>.
1785 (1958)].<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span>
and Father Castro were bosom friends with a long history of trust and
intimacy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The element of trust is
further accentuated by the execution between them, in addition to the two
instruments in question, of two secret documents known as the counter-receipt (<u>contra</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>recibo</u></span>).<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in their totality, defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
proof is sufficiently weighty to overthrow the legal presumption of suffi­cient
consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Badges of fraud, when
clear and unmistakable, will serve to destroy the camouflage of validity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, we find overwhelming proof that the
instruments in question were without consideration and fraudulent, executed
merely to lend color of authenticity to what was calculated as <span class="SpellE">Nicanor's</span> would-be status of insolvency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since both the mortgage and the sale were
fictitious and simulated, they were void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span> [New Civil Code, Art. 1409.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>See</u> <span class="SpellE">Mapalo</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Mapalo</span>, L-21489 &amp; L-21628, <st1:date year="1966" day="19" month="5">19 May 1966</st1:date>; 17 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span>
114; <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> Rodriguez v.
Rodriguez, L-23002, <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="7">31 July 1967</st1:date>;
20 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 908).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the con­templation of law, it is as if they never were, with the
result that the lands covered by the instruments remain under the ownership of
the alleged mortgagor-vendor, <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> <span class="SpellE">Escutin</span>, and his successors-in-interest.</p>
