she reasoned out with respondent that she had been advised by an official of the Civil Service Commission that it was not necessary to have a lawyer because her evidence was complete and mainly documentary but respondent insisted that she should have a counsel; on one occasion respondent shouted at her and slammed the door of his office to her face.<br><br>Denying that he ever shouted at complainant or acted discourteously, respondent nevertheless admitted that he required Mrs. Soriño to secure the services of a lawyer to assist her in prosecuting her complaint against her husband because he wanted to avoid any suspicion later on that he was partial in the conduct of the investigation against a subordinate in his office.<br><br>The present controversy stems mainly from the fact that respondent did not investigate and take action on the administrative complaint filed by Mrs. Soriño against her husband simply because he believed that it was indispensable for the complainant to be represented by counsel.&nbsp;

complaint was filed by Andres Suck, a brother-in-law.<p></p>

<p class="BODY">It is claimed by Mrs. Soriño that she filed an administrative
case against her husband, Andres Soriño, an employee of Branch III, which was
assigned to respondent for investigation, and notwithstanding the several
subpoenas sent to her and her appearance pursuant thereto, no hearing was ever

Civil Service Commission that it was not necessary to have a lawyer because her
evidence was complete and mainly documentary but respondent insisted that she
should have a counsel; on one occasion respondent shouted at her and slammed
the door of his office to her face.</p>

<p class="BODY">Denying that he ever shouted at complainant or acted
discourteously, respondent nevertheless admitted that he required Mrs. Soriño
to secure the services of a lawyer to assist her in prosecuting her complaint
against her husband because he wanted to avoid any suspicion later on that he
was partial in the conduct of the investigation against a subordinate in his
office.</p>

<p class="BODY">The present controversy stems mainly from the fact that
respondent did not investigate and take action on the administrative complaint
filed by Mrs. Soriño against her husband simply because he believed that it was
indispensable for the complainant to be represented by counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We take the view that respondent's action was
unwarranted.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the record, We gather that Mrs. Soriño's charge against her
husband was for negligence or dereliction of duty as a government employee
because he continued to receive his salary as such although he was actually
working in his farm in <st1:place>Mindoro</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This matter could have very well been

herein <i>motu proprio </i>should have investigated the complaint of Mrs.
Soriño after his attention had been called to the alleged absence of Andres
Soriño from work it being a matter which involved the efficiency of his office
personnel.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent's alleged apprehension that he may be suspected of

referred for investigation<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
reports that there was no evil motive or malice on the part of respondent and
recommends the dismissal of the case, still We hold that respondent's inaction
warrants strong disciplinary measure against him; his lack of malice may only
serve to mitigate his liability.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a responsible, ranking official of a court of first instance,
holding the position of clerk of court since 1965 and a member of the bar,
respondent was called upon to assist the herein complainant in obtaining the
relief she was seeking for in the most expeditious and simplified manner
possible without seeing complexities in the case where there was none and
setting up requirements which the nature of the complaint did not call for.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent's refusal to proceed with the investigation of Mrs.
Sorino's complaint unless the latter was represented by counsel constitutes
under the circumstances, a serious neglect of duty and a callous disregard for
the said plight of the complainant who claims to have been abandoned or
neglected by her husband, a court employee under the direct supervision of
respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other charges of discourtesy and conduct unbecoming of a
public official have not been established according to the findings of the
Honorable Investigator.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Wherefore</b>, We hold respondent Rolando Diaz GUILTY of <i>gross
neglect of duty </i>and order his SUSPENSION FROM OFFICE for a period of SIX
(6) MONTHS effective immediately upon the finality of this Decision, with a
warning that a repetition of similar conduct will merit a more severe
disciplinary action against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Judicial Consultant is directed to cause the investigation of
the complaint of Mrs. Sorino against Andres Sorino, an employee in Branch III,
Court of First Instance of Cavite, and to report to the Court the result of
such investigation within ten (10) days from notice hereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><b>So ordered.</b></p>
