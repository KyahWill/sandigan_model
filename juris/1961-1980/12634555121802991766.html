Sub-block No. 13-F, of the Subdivision Plan Psd­-1107, covered by Transfer
Certificate of Title <span style="">No. </span>18304 <span style="">(18833) of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1954" day="18" month="2"><span style="">February

the said lot to herein <span class="GramE">respondent</span> <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span>
B. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Encarnacion</span></span><span style="">, for <span style="">a

P0.60 per square meter, or P120.00 monthly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The contract of lease
above referred to </span><span style="">stipulates </span><span style="">that -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"2. a<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The duration of this lease shall be for a
period of Twelve (12) years counted from the date hereof, which may be renewed
for another period of Eight (8) years under such rental, terms and conditions
which the <span class="SpellE">Lessor</span> and the Lessee may then agree upon,
and in case <span style="">the Lessee would desire
such re­newal, he shall so notify the <span class="SpellE">Lessor</span> in
writing at least Sixty (60) days before the expiration of the Twelve (12) years
period hereinabove stipulated, and the parties </span><span style="">will </span><span style="">have to reach </span><span style="">an </span><span style="">agreement regarding the renewal at least

the lease shall not be renewed."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At the end of the
stipulated 12-year lease period, there was no agreement reached between the
parties </span><span style="">as to the renewal of the
contract, although it appears from the record </span>that before the <span style="">expiration </span><span style="">of the period of the lease, the parties tried to negotiate for a
renewal, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="9"><span style="">September
 25, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, the lessee
notified the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> of his </span><span style="">desire to </span><span style="">avail of the renewal provision of their lease contract, but requesting
for a reduction of the rental to </span><span style="">P80.00
a month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On October 1, 1965, the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> informed the lessee </span><span style="">that "there </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">a
prospect </span><span style="">for the</span><span style=""> lease </span><span style="">of the lot in question for ten (10) years
period from February 19, 1966, at P500.00 monthly rental, and <span style="">all im­provements to be introduced </span>by
the lessee will be for me at the expiration of the period of the lease <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." </span><span class="GramE">On </span></span><st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="10"><span class="GramE"><span style="">October 11, 1965</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="">, the lessee reiterated in writing his <span style="">desire </span>to renew the contract, and
mentioning justifications for a reduced rental.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>By </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">letter </span><span style="">of October 22, 1965, the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> informed the
lessee that if the lease would be renewed, it </span><span style="">would be </span><span style="">on an <span style="">increased rental taking </span>into account
the <span style="">decrease </span>in the purchasing
power of the peso, the increase of business opportunities in the vici­nity, the
increase of rentals of buildings in simi­lar locations, and increase in real
estate taxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>On January 17,
1966, the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> wrote another letter stating that
"unless we could agree as to the amount of the rental for the renewal of the
lease of the lot to you, the contract of lease shall automatically expire on
February 18, 1966, and hence, <span style="">after </span>that
date you should vacate the premises and deliver possession thereof to me,"
and that "I am ready and willing to have the lease of the lot leased to
you renewed for another period of eight (8) years from February 19, 1966, <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>for double the present rental, or TWO <span style="">HUNDRED FORTY PESOS </span>(P240.00) <span style="">a </span>month which rental is even <span style="">less </span>than the rental I expect to get
from a­nother <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
</span><span class="SpellE">x</span>".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Still on January 25, 1966, the <span class="SpellE">les­sor</span> wrote
again to the lessee informing him that <span style="">as
</span>per survey made of the premises, the total area of the lot occupied by
the <span style="">lessee is </span>347 square meters,
so that "my letter to you of January 17, 1966 x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> is hereby modified in the sense that if you want to
continue with the lease it must be under terms and conditions which must be
agreed upon on or before Feb­ruary 18, 1966 taking <span style="">into </span>account the area of the <span style="">lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="17" month="2">February 17, <span style="">1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, one day </span>before the <span style="">expira­</span>tion date of the <span style="">aforesaid </span>contract of <span style="">lease, the </span>lessee filed <span style="">a </span>complaint in the Court of First In­stance
of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> (Civil Case N-872), for specific <span style="">performance with damages, seeking to obtain a
renewal </span>of the <span style="">lease </span>at <span style="">a </span>reduced rental of P<span style="">80.00 a month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>,
on <st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1966</st1:date>, instead of
answering the complaint, countered with <span style="">a
</span>"Special Appearance Attacking Jurisdiction and Venue with
Consequent Dis­missal of the Case."</p>

<p class="BODY">A few days after the <span style="">expi</span>ration
of the contract of <span style="">lease, </span>or on <st1:date year="1966" day="10" month="3">March 10, 1966</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> instituted <span style="">unlawful
<span class="SpellE">detainer-ejectment</span> proceedings against the lessee in
the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The less<span style="">ee </span>moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of another action <span style="">between </span>the same parties for the same cause, but <span style="">said </span>court declared itself with
jurisdiction over the <span style="">same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In his answer, the lessee raised the
same issues which he brought out in his complaint filed with the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the answer, the case (City Court, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Quezon</span></span><span style=""> City</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">) was set for trial se­veral times but
postponed at the instance of the lessee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, on <st1:date year="1967" day="14" month="1">January 14,
 1967</st1:date>, the lessee filed with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> a petition for certiorari and prohibition with
injunction (Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">Q-10710) seeking a declaration
that the City Court of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Quezon</span></span><span class="GramE"> City</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE"> has no <span style="">jurisdiction </span>to
try the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="10" month="2">February
 10, 1967</st1:date>, the respondent judge <span style="">of </span>the Court of <span style="">First </span>Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> is­sued an order, as prayed for, advising
the parties to maintain the <u><span style="">status</span></u><span style=""> <u>quo</u> </span>pending the resolution of
the aforesaid petition for <span style="">certiorari
and </span>prohibition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By virtue of
this order, the city court refrained from proceeding with the trial of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1967</st1:date>,
the Court of First Instance <span style="">of </span><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> issued an order <span style="">declaring itself </span>with jurisdiction
over the case for <span style="">specific performance </span>with damages filed by <span style="">the lessee </span><span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1966" day="17" month="2"><span style="">February </span>17, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, Carmen <span class="SpellE">Pardo</span>
<span style="">de <span class="SpellE">Tavera</span>, </span>has
brought the case directly to this Court on petition:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) <u>for</u> <u><span style="">certiorari</span></u><span style="">, </span>to annul the order of the respondent
judge of the Court of First <span style="">Instance </span><span style="">of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, declaring itself with jurisdiction to take </span><span style="">cognizance of </span>Civil
Case No. <span class="GramE">N-872, and to <span style="">likewise </span>annul the or­ders of the respondent judge of the Court of
<span style="">First </span>Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City in its Civil Case No.</span> Q-10710 <span style="">restraining the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City Court from trying the </span><span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case and
denying the <span class="SpellE">lessor's</span> motion to dismiss; (b) <u><span style="">for prohibition</span></u><span style="">, </span>to restrain the respond­ents judges
of <span style="">said </span>Courts of First Instance
from fur­ther proceeding with the aforesaid cases before them; <span style="">and (c) </span><u><span style="">for mandamus</span></u><span style="">, </span><span style="">to order the </span><span style="">respondent judge of
the </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Quezon</span></span><span style=""> City court </span><span style="">to proceed </span><span style="">with </span><span style="">the hearing </span><span style="">of the </span><span style="">unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer-ejectment</span>
case pending there­in until its </span><span style="">final termination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We
find </span><span style="">the petition to be</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">meritorious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The provision of the
lease contract entered into between </span><span style="">petitioner </span><span style="">and respondent is appar­ently clear that unless the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
and lessee agreed to a renewal thereof at least thirty days prior to the date
of expiration, the </span><span style="">lease shall </span><span style="">not be
renewed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts on record show that
despite </span><span style="">the exchange of </span><span style="">communication,
proposals end counter-proposals, between the parties regarding <span style="">a </span>renewal of the lease, </span><span style="">they were not able
to </span><span style="">arrive at an agreement within
said period, for while </span><span style="">the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> wanted </span><span style="">an increased rental, the lessee, on the other
hand, proposed for a reduct­ion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
this failure of an agreement, it is to be presumed that the lessee was aware
that an <span class="SpellE">e­jectment</span> case against him was
forthcoming.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the case
filed before the <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> Court of First Instance, just
one day before the expiration of the base contract, was an anticipation to
block the action for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> which the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> was to take against</span><span style=""> the lessee, </span><span style="">the fact, however, is that the lessee was not disposed to leave the
premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, while the said
case before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>
appears to be one for specific performance with damages, it cannot be de­nied
that the real issue between the parties is whether or not the lessee should be
allowed to continue occupying the land as lessee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The situation is not
novel to <span class="GramE">Us</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It
has </span><span style="">been settled in a number of
cases</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> that the right of a lessee </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">occupy </span><span style="">land </span><span style="">leased as against the demand of the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> should be decided </span><span style="">under Rule 70 (formerly Rule </span><span style="">72) of the </span><span style="">Rules of Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is no merit to </span><span style="">the contention that
the </span><span style="">lessee's supposed right to a
renewal of the <span style="">lease </span>contract
can not be decided in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">In the </span><span style="">case </span><span style="">of <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> v. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Mirasol</span></span><span style="">, <u>supra</u>, this </span><span style="">Court held that </span><span style="">"if </span><span style="">the plaintiff has
any right to the</span><span style=""> extension of
the lease at all, such right is a proper and legitimate issue that could be
raised in the unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case because it may
be used as a defense to the action." In other words, the matter raised in
the Court of First Instance </span>of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cavite</span></span><span style=""> </span>may be threshed out in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
suit, in consonance with the principle prohibiting multi­plicity of suits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the mere fact that the unlaw­<span style="">ful <span class="SpellE">detainer<span style="">-ejectment</span></span></span> case was
filed <span class="GramE">later,</span> would not change the situation of the
foregoing ruling:</p>

<blockquote>"It is to be noted that the Rules do not require as a ground
for dismissal of a complaint that there is a prior pending action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">They
provide that there is </span>a pending action, not a pending prior action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the unlaw­<span style="">ful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> suit </span>was
of <span style="">a </span>later <span style="">date is </span>no <span style="">bar to the dismissal of the present action" (<span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>,
</span>Jr. v. <span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span>, <u>supra</u>.)<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, let <span style="">the writs issue as prayed for in the petition, </span>and the
preliminary injunction issued <span style="">at </span>the
commencement of these pro­ceedings is made permanent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span>.</span></p>
