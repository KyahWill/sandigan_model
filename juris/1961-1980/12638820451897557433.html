levy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should have looked at the price

appliances, i.e. the refrigerator, sewing machines and office equip­ment with
which he was familiar, after satisfying himself that they belonged to the
judgment debtors.</blockquote>

only the number of rolls and bundles which he took, without specifying the
yardage in each.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of that omission

goods, the opportunity to fraudulently take any number of yards from each roll

<p class="BODY">We have carefully considered the foregoing report in the light of
the recorded evidence submitted therewith and <span class="GramE">We</span> are
fully convinced that the conclusions of Her Honor, the Investigator, are fully
supported by the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
recommendation of the Investigator for the immediate dismissal of respondent
from the service is more than amply justified, and indeed respondent's separation
from the ranks of judicial employees is overdue.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anyone who goes over the record of this case cannot escape the
conclusion that respondent acted with gross inefficiency, grave abuse of
authority and total disregard of the requirements of fairness, not to speak of
the elementary rules governing the implementation of judicial or court
processes of the nature herein involved.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">No reason or explanation
whatsoever has been given as to why respondent insisted on immediately
proceeding with the levy on the goods in question even after he was informed
that the drapery store does not belong to the defendant named in the writ of
execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The
evidence that the said store belongs to <span class="SpellE">Leonila</span> <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> and not to complainant Atty. Lumen <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span>, the defendant in the case, is well nigh
conclusive, and respondent has not shown any basis for hi s assertion
otherwise.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The least that he
should have done was to wait for either <span class="SpellE">Leonila</span> <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> or Atty. Lumen <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span>,
as requested by those who were in the store.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the circumstances, with him already there in the premises, there
was no danger of any of the goods being carted away before the appearance of
either of </span>those ladies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was
no real urgency that the levy <span class="GramE">be</span> made then and there.</p>

<p class="BODY">The manner in which respondent conducted the levy leaves no room
for doubt about his bad faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He made
no effort to limit the goods to be levied to the amount called for in the writ,
assuming he could make the levy without making a formal demand for payment,
which, of course, he could not have done because he refused to wait for Atty. <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span>, who, considering she was a practicing lawyer
with a law office, which he was invited to see, should not have been summarily
presumed to be without resources to cover the amount of P5,927.70 which was
supposed to be recovered under the judgment of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, any person with ordinary sense
of values of merchandise and dry goods, and We refuse to believe respondent was
entirely devoid of the experience to more or less have ideas in this respect,
could have known that the rolls and rolls, more than 250, of curtains,
draperies and door mats, excluding the 30 rolls and 57 bundles contained in
plastic bags, practically the whole inventory of the store of <span class="SpellE">Leonila</span> <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span>, were valued
much more than P6<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Actually, as assessed by reputable entities engaged in the same
business, the imported materials alone were worth at least <span style="">P74<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Indeed, he must have known he was
taking more than was needed, for, according to the finding of Her Honor, he
readily left the refrigerator and sewing machines he had already listed when he
found there was not enough space for them in the conveyances they had brought
along, a truck, a taxicab and a car, which together with the fact that two lawyers,
Attys. Francisco <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span> and <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dajao</span>, the lady employee of the Socio-Economic
Financing Corpora­tion and about ten (10) laborers who accompanied respondent
readily suggests that it was really the intention of respondent and his
companions to take as much as they could in implementing the writ in their
possession.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the Investigator that respondent's "levy on
the contents of <span class="SpellE">Leonila</span> <span class="SpellE">Policarpio's</span>
store was not only improvident and reckless -- but was malicious, hasty and
oppressive'', apart from being ''excessive and an abusive enforcement of (a)
writ of execution." We agree also that "<span class="SpellE">Fajardo's</span>
delivery of the goods to Li <span class="SpellE">Yao</span>, instead of keeping
them in sheriff's bodega, was irregular and improper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It demonstrated his complete and absolute
subordination of himself to Li <span class="SpellE">Yao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He behaved like a minion of Li <span class="SpellE">Yao</span> instead of as an officer of the court."</p>

<p class="BODY">In one word, respondent's conduct in implementing and enforcing
the writ of execution in his hands was completely wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everything he did was precisely what a
sheriff should not do.</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot conclude this decision without reiterating emphaticall<span style="">y </span>Our admonition to all judges that
"the general practice of the lower courts of appointing 'special sheriffs'
(is) unauthorized by law" except "when <span style="">the sheriff </span>is party to <span style="">any
action or proceeding or is otherwise </span>incompetent to serve process
therein" and "when the office of sheriff is vacant"
(Commissioner of Public Highways vs. San Diego, 31 SCRA <span style="">616).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, We feel that for the good of the profession and in
the interest of justice, it is best that the actuations and participation of
Attorneys Francisco <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span> and <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> <span class="SpellE">Dajao</span> in the incident here
in question be inquired into with a view to ascertaining whether or not
administrative action may be taken against them as members of the bar for
having in any manner helped, assisted or advised respondent in acting as he
did.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, it is hereby ordered that respondent Ely <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>, deputy sheriff of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, be immediately dismissed from the service with
forfeiture of all benefits otherwise due him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Solicitor General is directed to conduct the necessary investigation
of Attorneys Francisco <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span> and <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> <span class="SpellE">Dajao</span> as above indicated.</p>
