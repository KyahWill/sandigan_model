				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date month="5" day="9" year="1967"><span style="">May 9,
 1967</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Philippine
National Railways - hereinafter referred to as PNR - filed a petition for <i style="">mandamus</i> and <i style="">certiorari</i> (G.R. L-27501) against the Court of Appeals and the
spouses <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cusi</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span>, praying for judgment
as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that –</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A writ of <i style="">mandamus</i>
be issued by this Honorable Court compelling respondent Court of Appeals to
exercise its appellate jurisdiction and to resolve the merits of the petition
for <i style="">mandamus</i> and <i style="">certiorari</i> in CA-G.R. No. 38906-R of the respondent Court of
Appeals and a writ of <i style="">certiorari</i>
issue declaring null and void the Resolutions of the respondent Court of
Appeals dated February 28, 1967 and April 6, 1967.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner prays of such other and further relief
as may be just and equitable in the premises."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Because our resolution of
May 17, 1967 dismissing the <span class="SpellE">PNR<sup>'</sup>s</span> petition
mistakenly </span>referred to it as "Petition for Review on <i style="">Certiorari</i> of the Resolution of the
Court of <span style="">Appeals", on July 16 of
the same year the PNR filed a motion stating, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
that it had "never filed a petition for review in the above-entitled
case" but "an original action for <i style="">mandamus</i>
and <i style="">certiorari</i> dated May 3,
1967"; that this court had exclusive original jurisdiction to grant the
writs therein prayed for because they were to be directed against the <span class="SpellE">the</span> Court of Appeals; that it had no remedy by appeal nor
any other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law
against the resolutions issued by said court on February 28 and April 16, both
of the year 1967, in CA-G.R. No. 38906-R; and prayed that its "original
action for <i style="">mandamus</i> and <i style="">certiorari</i>, be <span class="GramE">given</span>
due course." As our resolution of dismissal of </span><st1:date year="1967" day="17" month="5"><span style="">May 17, 1967</span></st1:date><span style=""> referred, in reality, to the original action
for <i style="">mandamus</i> and <i style="">certiorari</i> filed by the PNR on May 9 of the same year, <span class="GramE">We</span> consider its motion of </span><st1:date year="1967" day="16" month="7"><span style="">July 16, 1967</span></st1:date><span style=""> as one for the reconsideration of said
resolution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At the outset it must be
stated that whether the printed petition filed by the PNR is one for the review
on appeal of the resolutions of the Court of Appeals mentioned therein, or a
special civil action for <i style="">mandamus</i> and
<i style="">certiorari</i> against said court and the
private respondents named in the petition, makes no substantial difference as
far as our resolution of dismissal is concerned, the essence of which is that,
upon the allegations made in the aforesaid petition, the same was without
merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To further clarify
matters, <span class="GramE">We</span> advert to the following facts disclosed by
the record:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It appears that in the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> an action for damages was
filed by the spouses <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cusi</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> against the
PNR (Civil Case No. 7948).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the
latter had filed its answer, the court, upon motion of the plaintiffs, issued
an order dated </span><st1:date month="11" day="17" year="1964"><span style="">November 17, 1964</span></st1:date><span style=""> requiring the said defendant to file a third
party complaint against the United Housing Corporation mentioned in its
answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As said defendant showed no
willingness to file the third party complaint, the plaintiffs filed a motion to
compel it to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion,
however, was denied by the court on </span><st1:date month="3" day="21" year="1966"><span style="">March 21, 1966</span></st1:date><span style=""> upon the ground that "it is
discretionary for a defendant either to file a third party complaint or not
against a third person not yet a party to the original action (Annex
"C" of the printed petition pages 116-117).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">More than one year later,
or more specifically, on August 11, 1966, the PNR changed its mind and filed a
motion for leave to amend its answer by including therein a third party
complaint against the United Housing Corporation (Annex "D" of the
printed petition pages 118-119), to which was attached the amended pleading it
intended to file.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was denied
by the court in its order of </span><st1:date year="1966" day="28" month="11"><span style="">November 28, 1966</span></st1:date><span style=""> for the reasons stated in the following
portion thereof:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Examining the record of this case, it is shown that since <st1:date month="11" day="17" year="1964">November 17, 1964</st1:date>, upon motion of
plaintiffs, defendant was directed to file a third-party complaint against the
United Housing Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant
failed, however, to comply with said Order and plaintiffs filed again on <st1:date month="2" day="4" year="1965">February 4, 1965</st1:date> another motion to
compel defendant to comply with said Order of <st1:date month="11" day="17" year="1964">November 17, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again on <st1:date month="3" day="9" year="1966">March 9, 1966</st1:date>,
plaintiffs filed another motion <span style="">to </span>re-compel
defendant to <span class="SpellE">implead</span> the United Housing Corporation
but notwithstanding these motions defendant consistently refused and failed to
file action as indicated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the basis of the above and considering that defendant's counsel
was given all the opportunity to <span class="SpellE">implead</span> the United
Housing Corporation as third-party defendant but failed to do so it is now too
late for him to amend his Answer after he allowed more than three years to
lapse after the filing of his Answer and plaintiffs have already presented
their evidence and rested their case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We also note that the amendment of the Answer seeks to alter the
defense in that the responsibility is shifted to the United Housing Corporation
which, however, has not been given the opportunity to cross-examine the
witnesses of the plaintiffs it was not brought in as third-party defendant
prior to plaintiffs' presentation of evidence.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">In the case of Rodgers vs. Dick No.</span>
L-18220, <st1:date month="4" day="30" year="1963">April 30, 1963</st1:date>, it
was held that "pleadings serve to determine the issues of law and/or fact
raised by the respective pleaders.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly there must be, and there is a limit as to the time at which
a party may amend his own pleading.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Amendments may be made, therefore, within the time and under the
conditions prescribed in the Rules of Court, generally, before the trial or
hearing of the case or issue on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, otherwise, there would be no way to determine and limit the
nature of the evidence to be presented or admitted or of the arguments that the
parties may adduce." (<span class="GramE">italics</span> supplied.)</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">In the case of Jai-Alai Corporation vs. <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span> G. R. No.</span>
L-7969 (March 30, 1960) it was also held:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"With respect to <span class="GramE">plaintiff's</span> other
motion to bring the new parties-defendants, we, likewise find that the trial
court did not err in denying the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Motion was made 5 years after the filing of the complaint and when
the trial was already on rebuttal stage.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was also unnecessary since the persons proposed to be brought in were
not really indispensable parties."</p>

<blockquote>Premises considered this Court finds the Motion of defendant
Philippine National Railways to be without merit and the same is DENIED.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Let this case be set for reception of defendant's evidence on
December 15, 16, 1966, January 5, 6 and 12, 1967, all at <st1:time hour="9" minute="30">9:30 o'clock a.m.</st1:time>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The motion for
reconsideration of this order filed by the PNR under date of </span><st1:date month="12" day="29" year="1966"><span style="">December
 29, 1966</span></st1:date><span style=""> was also
denied by the court in its order of </span><st1:date month="1" day="12" year="1967"><span style="">January 12, 1967</span></st1:date><span style=""> in which the following was said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
this Court finds no justification for setting aside its Order of November 28,
1966, as it believes <span style="">that </span>the
reasons and grounds given by us in the Order of November 28, 1966 more than
justify the denial of defendant's Motion to Amend its Answer at this stage of
the proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We may state further
that unlike other situations, this particular case is unique in that defendant
was advised and ordered by the Court at the instance of plaintiffs <span style="">to <span class="SpellE">implead</span> </span>the
United Housing Corporation as a third-party defendant, and notwithstanding our
Orders on the matter, defendant refused and thought it best perhaps not to
bring in the United Housing Corporation as third-party defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is petitioner's
contention in the petition for <i style="">mandamus</i>
etc., now before Us that the above-mentioned orders of November 28, 1966 and
January 12, 1967 were </span><span style="">issued </span><span style="">by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> with grave abuse of discretion and that, therefore, a
writ of <i style="">certiorari</i> and another of <i style="">mandamus</i> should be issued for their
annulment and to compel said court to admit the amended answer with a
counterclaim and third-party complaint mentioned above.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It appears, however, that
besides the petition for <i style="">mandamus</i> and
<i style="">certiorari</i> under consideration (G.R.
L-27501), the PNR had previously filed with </span><span style="">this </span><span style="">court (G.R.
L-27123) and with the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. No. 38906-R), similar petitions
for <i style="">mandamus</i> and <i style="">certiorari</i> for the same purpose of annulling the aforesaid orders
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> and to compel
the latter to admit its amended answer with a counterclaim and third-party
claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, the pleadings
before <span class="GramE">Us</span> show that <u>prior</u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">to
</span><st1:date year="1967" day="1" month="2"><span style="">February 1, 1967</span></st1:date><span style=""> the PNR filed against the same respondents herein a special civil
action for <i style="">mandamus</i> and <i style="">certiorari</i> docketed in this court as
G.R. L-27123 to obtain exactly the same relief prayed for in G.R. L-27501.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We dismissed said petition (G.R. L-27123) by
our resolution of </span><st1:date month="2" day="1" year="1967"><span style="">February 1, 1967</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
February 9 of the same year, the PNR filed an amended petition for <i style="">mandamus</i> and <i style="">certiorari</i> dated </span><st1:date month="2" day="6" year="1967"><span style="">February 6, 1967</span></st1:date><span style=""> just to file almost immediately a motion for
its dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, on </span><st1:date month="2" day="28" year="1967"><span style="">February
 28, 1967</span></st1:date><span style="">, the same
party filed a motion to withdraw its motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of <span class="GramE">this confusing
steps</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">taken by the PNR, this Court issued a
resolution on </span><st1:date year="1967" day="29" month="2"><span style="">February 29, 1967</span></st1:date><span style=""> to this effect:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to deny the petitioner's motion of February 9,
1967 'to dismiss the amended petition for <i style="">mandamus</i>
and <i style="">certiorari</i> dated February 6,
1967,; (2) to deny petitioner's motion of February 28, 1967 'to withdraw motion
to dismiss' the amended petition for <i style="">mandamus</i>
and <i style="">certiorari</i> of February 9, 1967;
(3) to declare the resolution of this Court of February 1, 1967 dismissing the
original petition for <i style="">certiorari</i> as
final; and (4) to furnish the Court of Appeals a copy of this resolution for
reference in connection with Case CA-G.R. 38906-R pending in that court,
entitled 'Philippine National Railways, petitioner, versus Cecilia <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> Palma, et al., Respondents.'"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After <span class="GramE">We</span>
had dismissed the petition for <i style="">mandamus</i>
and <i style="">certiorari</i> in G.R. L-27123, the
PNR went to the Court of Appeals where it filed a similar if not identical petition
docketed as CA-G.R. L-38906-R.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
February 28, 1967, the Court of Appeals dismissed said petition on two
grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>firstly, that as the action
pending before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
(Civil Case No. 7948) involved an amount of damages exceeding the maximum
amount within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals, the writs prayed for
were not in aid of its appellate jurisdiction; secondly, because the petitioner
had previously filed with the Supreme Court an identical petition which was subsequently
dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It appearing from the
foregoing that the PNR, herein petitioner, is raising in the petition for <i style="">mandamus</i> and <i style="">certiorari</i> now before Us (G.R. L-27501) one and the same issue for
the <u>third</u> time:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the first time in
G.R. L-27123, and the second before the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. 38906-R, it
is clear that We must deny, as We hereby deny its motion of June 15, 1967
praying that We give due course to its petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Our resolution of </span><st1:date month="5" day="17" year="1967"><span style="">May 17,
