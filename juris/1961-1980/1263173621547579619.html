				<BR><BR><div align=""><p>Appeal from the order of dismissal by the Court of First Instance of Negros 
Occidental.</p>
<p>The complaint, filed on June 18, 1959, allege that defendants obtained 
various sugar crop loans from plaintiff through its Victorias Branch, evidenced 
by promissory notes (reproduced as annexes to the complaint) respectively dated 
January 25, 1941, February 13, 1941, March 8, 1941, April 3, 1941, May 2, 1941 
and June 23, 1941; that of the total amount of P9,692.00 represented by said 
notes defendants paid P3,905.61, leaving a balance of P6,786.39, which, added to 
accrued interest of P5,213. 34, summed up to P11.999.73 as of January 17, 1957; 
that despite repeated demands, defendants failed and refused to pay said amount; 
that in view of such demands defendants, on May 7, 1957, went to Attorney 
Francis I. Medel of the legal department of plaintiff's Victorias branch and 
offered a plan of payment of the account, but for reasons unknown to plaintiff 
and probably due to the transfer of defendant Hipolito as supervising teacher to 
some other province, his proposed plan of payment did not materialize; that said 
ofFer of plan of payment was an acknowledgement of defendants' just and valid 
obligation. The prayer is for the court to order defendants to pay to plaintifF 
the said amount of P11,993.73, with accrued annual interest thereon at the rate 
of 5% from January 17, 1957 up to the date of payment, plus attorney's fees 
equivalent to 10%. </p>
<p>Defendants move for a bill of particulars, but the motion was denied. They 
then moved to dismiss on the ground that plaintiff's cause of action, if any, 
had already prescribed. To the motion they attached a joint affidavit of merit, 
wherein they averred that they never made any acknowledgement of indebtedness 
nor offered a plan of payment, but on the contrary had always maintained that 
plaintiff's action had prescribed.</p>
<p>Plaintiff opposed the motion, contending that the prescriptive period had 
been suspended by "Executive Order No. 32, otherwise known as the Moratorium 
Law," and interrupted, pursuant to Article 1973 of the old Civil Code, by 
plaintiff's written extra-judicial demands as well as by defendants' 
acknowledgment of the indebtedness. Attached to the opposition were (1) a 
statement of defendants' account dated July 22, 1947; (2) plaintiffs' letter 
dated October 31, 1953, asking defendants to make arrangements for the 
liquidation of the debt (3) letter of plaintiffs' Victorias Branch Manager, 
dated February 4, 1959, addressed to defendant Hipolito (at Iloilo City) 
requesting him to settle his account, otherwise drastic action would be taken 
against him as a government employee, and reminding him of his May 7, 1957 
interview with Brancli Attorney Medel, wherein he proposed a plan of payment 
which however did not materialize; and (4) defendant Hipolito's answer dated 
February 16, 1959, requesting said Manager, in his personal and not in his 
official capacity, to be more "sensitive" to the financial plight of defendants; 
and requesting further that he or any of his investigators study the case by 
seeing Mrs. Hipolito (who was then staying very near the Victorias Branch 
Office) about "the actual insolvency of the family," ending up with an appeal 
for help "in this matter."</p>
<p>Defendants replied to plaintiff's opposition, stating among other things that 
Executive Order No. 32, if at all, suspended the prescriptive period "only for 
two (2) years, four (4) months and sixteen (16) days, from March 10, 1945, or 
only up to July 26, 1948," citing Bachrach Motors Co., Inc. vs. Chua fia Hian, 
101 Phil., 184; 53 Off. Gaz., 6524; that the alleged written extrajudi-cial 
demands constitute self-serving evidence; and that defendant Hipolito's letter 
of February 16, 1959 can not be considered as an acknowledgment of 
indebtedness.</p>
<p>In dismissing the complaint the lower court ruled that since the seven 
promissory notes constituted one single obligation, arising as it did from 
plaintiff's fmanciation of defendants' sugar crop for 1941-42, the date of the 
last promissory note, June 23, 1941, should be considered as the true date of 
the written contract, from which the ten year prescriptive period (Art. 1144, 
par. 1 of the new Civil Code) started; that said period was suspended only for 
two (2) years, four (4) months and sixteen (16) days (by reason of Executive 
Order No. 32) until said Order was declared unconstitutional; that prescription 
set in on November 8, 1953, five (5) years, five (5) months and ten (10) days 
before the complaint was filed on June 18, 1959; that the alleged letters of 
demand cannot be considered as extrajudicial demands "under Art. 1155 of the 
Civil Code" because there is no proof that defendants received them; that 
plaintiff's letter of demand of February 4, 1959, which was admittedly received 
by defendant Hipolito, did not work to interrupt the prescriptive period which 
had already previously elapsed; and that defendant Hipolito's answering letter 
of February 16, 1959 does not contain any express or tacit acknowledgement of 
the obligation nor promise to pay the same and hence did not renew the 
obligation.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that the dismissal of the complaint is erroneous. In a 
motion to dismiss defendant hypotheticaly admits the truth of the allegations of 
fact contained in the complaint. (Pangan vs. Evening News Publishing Co., Inc. 
110 Phil., 409; Pascual vs. Secretary of Public Works and Communications, 110 
Phil., 331; Republic vs. Ramos, G.R. No. L-15484, Jan. 31, 1963).</p>
<p>An examination of the complaint herein does not indicate clearly that 
prescription has set in. On the contrary, it is belied by the allegation 
concerning defendant's offer of payment made on May 7, 1957. Such offer 
hypothetically admitted in the motion, worked as a renewal of the 
obligation.</p>
<p>It is true that defendants attached to the motion a joint affidavit of merit 
wherein they deny having made an offer of a plan of payment. Such denial, 
however, being a contrary averment of fact, would be proper in the answer to the 
complaint but not in a motion for dismissal, for the contradictory allegations 
would require presentation of evidence (Alquigue vs. De Leon, G.R. No. L-15059, 
March 30, 1963). The same is true of the other allegations in the complaint 
concerning the demands for payment sent by plaintiff upon defendants and the 
partial payments made by them, all or some of which may have a material bearing 
on the question of prescription. In other words, the ground for dismissal not 
being indubitable, the lower court should have deferred determination of the 
issue until after trial of the case on the merits. (Sec. 3, Rule 16, Revised 
Rules of Court; Geganto vs. Katalbas, G.R. L-17105, July 31, 1963).</p>
<p>The order appealed from is set aside and the case is remanded to the lower 
court for further proceedings, with costs against appellees.</p>
