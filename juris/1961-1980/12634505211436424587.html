				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This appeal, from a decision of the Court of First Instance of
Manila, is before us upon certification by the Court of Appeals, only ques­tions
of law being involved therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">The relevant facts are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
September 15, 1948, plain­tiffs herein, Juan <span class="SpellE">Sumerariz</span>,
and his wife, Luisa <span class="SpellE">Sumerariz</span>, constituted, in favor
of the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation - now Development Bank of the
Philippines, and hereinafter referred to as the Bank - a real estate mortgage
on two (2) parcels of land forming part of San Andres Subdivision, Manila, and
covered by Transfer Certificate of Title <span style="">No.
</span>1442, in their names, including a house to be constructed thereon, to
guarantee a P15,000.00 loan granted them by the Bank, payable within ten (10)
years, at a given monthly amortiza­tion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In view of plaintiffs' failure to comply with the terms and conditions
of their contract, the Bank asked the sheriff of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
to take possession of the property and sell it at public auction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After several postponements made upon
plaintiffs' request, the sale was set for <st1:date year="1955" day="29" month="3">March 29, 1955</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the behest of Juan <span class="SpellE">Sumerariz</span>, made the
day before, the Bank agreed, however, to postpone the sale, if there was a
token payment of at least P100.00, before <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00
 a.m.</st1:time>, the next day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No such
payment having been made, the Bank bought the property, on March 29, for P8,
000.00, as the highest bidder.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, the Bank repeatedly notified the plain­tiffs that
they could redeem the property within one (1) year, or not <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ia</span>ter</span> than <st1:date year="1956" day="29" month="3">March 29, 1956</st1:date>, upon a down payment of P2,806.64,
the balance payable in ten (10) years, at the rate of P166.50 per month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of exercising the right of
redemption, on March 26, 1956, plaintiffs instituted Civil Case No. 29306, of
the Court of <span style="">First Instance </span>of
Manila, against the Bank and the sheriff of Manila, to set aside the
aforementioned foreclosure sale, upon the ground that the Bank had failed to
comply with its agreement to postpone the auction sale scheduled to be held on <st1:date year="1956" day="29" month="3">March 29, 1956</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1956" day="19" month="7">July 19, 1956</st1:date>,
while the case was pending in the trial Court, the Bank sold the property to
the Philippine Surety and Insurance Co., Inc., hereinafter referred to as the
Surety Co.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, or on <st1:date year="1958" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1958</st1:date>, said Court rendered
a decision dismissing the complaint in Case No.29306, for the reason that
plaintiffs had not redeemed the property within the period prescribed by law <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> and that the Bank had thereby become its absolute
owner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said decision was, on November 5,
1959, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, in CA-G.R. No. 25077-R.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs petitioned the Supreme Court to
review by certiorari the decision of the Court of Appeals; but, we denied the
petition,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
on <st1:date year="1960" day="5" month="2">February 5, 1960</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Soon later, or on March 16, 1960, plaintiffs com­menced the
present action, in the Court of First Instance of Manila, against the Bank and
the Surety Co., to annul the sale made to the latter by the Bank and to be
allowed to redeem the property in question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In their answer, de­fendants herein pleaded <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> and prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They, moreover, set up a counter-claim for
rentals, for the use of said property, until actual delivery thereof to the
defendants, plus interest, attorney's fees and other expenses.</p>

<p class="BODY">After appropriate proceedings, said Court render­ed a decision
dismissing plaintiff’s complaint and ordering them to vacate the property in
question, as well as to pay P100.00 a month to the Bank, from <st1:date year="1960" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1960</st1:date>, until said property
is vacated by the plaintiffs, with costs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to
us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They maintain that the lower court
erred:</p>

<blockquote>"1. In holding that the decision render­ed in Civil Case No.
29306, Court of First In­stance of Manila, entitled 'Juan <span class="SpellE">Sumerariz</span>
and Luisa <span class="SpellE">Sumerariz</span> vs. Development Bank of the
Philippines and Sheriff of Manila' is a bar to the present case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2. In holding that the filing of Civil Case No. 29306 in the Court
of First Instance of Manila x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
did not suspend the period of redemption of the property in question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3. In not allowing the appellants to re­deem the properties in
question in accordance with the manifestation and willingness of the <span class="SpellE">ap­pellee</span> development Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to al­low the appellants to redeem their own properties.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4. In requiring the appellants to pay rents for the properties in
question to the <span class="SpellE">appel­lee</span> Development Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
from <st1:date year="1956" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1956</st1:date> until
appellants delivered the said properties to the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Bank."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is urged that the present case is not barred by the decision
in Case No. 29306 because there is, allegedly, no identity, either of parties,
or of subject-matter, or of cause of action, between the two cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contention <span style="">is </span>mani­festly untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although not a party in the first case, the inclusion of the
Surety Co. as defendant in the case at bar does not detract from the legal
identity of both cases, because, by buying the property from the Bank, the
Surety Co. became merely the Bank's successor in interest.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> Neither
does the absence, as party herein, of the sheriff, who was one of the defendants
in the first case, negate said identity, in­asmuch as the sheriff was but a
formal party in said pre­vious case, and is virtually a party in the present
proceedings, although not explicitly mentioned as such therein.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">As stated in Republic v. Planas:<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"The inclusion of the surety as party defendant in Civil Case
No. 51080, where it is not so named in Civil Case No. 49206, can <u>­not</u> be
invoked to nullify the effect on the for­mer case of the dismissal-order issued
in the latter proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been
ruled that where the one who is offering a judgment as an <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
and the party against whom it is being offered were <u>both</u> parties to the
action, in which such judgment was rendered, it is no objection that the action
included some <u>additional</u> parties who are joined in the second case.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> Conversely, the operation of the final judgment or
order in a previous case is <u>not</u> <u>altered</u> by the fact that somebody
who was not a party in that first action has been <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span>
in the second case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Otherwise,
litigants can always re­new any litigation by the mere expedient of inclu­ding
new parties</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The subject-matter of both cases is, obviously, the same - the
property in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is,
likewise, identity of the cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the first case, the issue was the validity of the auction sale in
favor of the Bank, which sale, plaintiffs contended, had been made in viola­tion
of their agreement with the Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
case at bar, plaintiffs maintain that the conveyance by the Bank <span style="">to </span>the Surety Co. is invalid, and this
pretense is anchored upon the predicate that, when it took place, the property
did not belong to the Bank, the sale in its favor by the sheriff having been
made in violation of the alleged agreement aforementioned, which predicate had
been rejected by the Court in the previous case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the cause of action <span style="">in the first case was based upon the alleged
right of the plain­tiffs to the property in question, upon the ground that its
sale to the Bank was illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
premise is, also, the corner­stone of plaintiffs' cause of action in the case
at bar.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the same evidence would have sufficed to sup­port and
establish the cause of action in both cases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In <span class="SpellE">Abes</span>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Rodil</span>,
et al.,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> it was held:</p>

<blockquote>"The test to determine the existence of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">judicata</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>is simply this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">'Would </span>the same evidence support and
establish both the present and the former cause of action?’<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a> Here, the
answer is in the affirmative. The evidence both in the cadastral proceedings
and in the present <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> case, is directed at
the question of ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was held
that where the first case is one for <span class="SpellE"><span style="">reivindicacion</span></span><span style=""> </span>and the
other for partition, the title of the case is unimportant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the same evidence would support the one
and the other.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a> A similar rule obtains whe<span style="">r</span>e the former cases were <span class="SpellE">reivindicatory</span> in char­acter and the second are land
registration proceedings.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> Another
example:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first case was for
consolidation of title of the assignee in the land registration
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was objected to upon
the ground that the deed of as­signment was invalid as <span class="SpellE"><u>pactum</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>commissorium</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court gave due effect to said document and ordered that assignor's
titles be cancelled and new ones issued to the assignee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second was an action for reformation upon
the averment that the deed of assignment mentioned in the first case was an
equitable mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court declared
that the issue in both suits is 'whether the deed of assignment vested in Monte
de <span class="SpellE">Piedad</span> the <u>ownership</u> of the lots,' and held
that the second action was barred by previous adjudica­tion in the land
registration case.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> And
where, as here, fraud was alleged in the first case and the same fraud was
relied upon in the second, the judgment in former case operated as <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <u>judicata</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Again, the issue of ownership
of the property in ques­tion was settled in the first </span><span style="">case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, </span><span style="">it may no
longer be litigated in the case at bar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under the second
assignment of error, plaintiffs main­tain that the period of one (1) year to
redeem the property in </span>question was suspended by the institution of Case
No. 29306, on <st1:date year="1956" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1956</st1:date>,
or three (3) days before the expiration of said period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have not found, however, any statute or
decision in support of this pretense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, up to now plaintiffs have not exercised the right of
redemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In­deed, although they have
intimated their wish to redeem the property in question, they have not
deposited the amount necessary <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may not be amiss to note that, unlike
Section 30 of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, which permits the extension of the
period of redemption of mortgaged properties,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> Section 3
of Commonwealth Act No. 459, in relation to Section 9 of Republic Act No. 85,
which governs the redemption of property mortgaged to the Bank, does not
contain a similar provision.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> Again
this question has been definitely settled by the decision in the previous case
declaring that plaintiffs' right of redemp­tion has already been extinguished
in view of their failure to exercise it within the statutory period.</p>

<p class="BODY">The third assignment of error's predicated upon an alleged
willingness of the Bank to allow the plaintiffs to make such redemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Bank denies, however, having agreed
thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, this question of fact
was not raised by plaintiffs in the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it cannot be entertained in this
appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The fourth assignment of error is premised on plain­tiffs'
alleged right of redemption, which was held, in the first case, to have expired
already.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is thus clearly de­void of
merit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from should be, as it is
hereby, affirmed, with costs against plaintiffs-appellants.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>
