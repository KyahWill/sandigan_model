petitions this Supreme Court for a certiorari to review a decision of the Court
of Appeals, rendered in <span style="">its </span>Case No. 36094-<span class="GramE">R, that</span> reversed the
judgment i<span style="">n
his </span>favor rendered by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>

<p class="BODY">The factual background and history of these proceedings is thus
stated by the Court of Appeals (pages 1-2):</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"On </span><st1:date year="1955" day="12" month="4"><span class="GramE">April 12, 1955</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">,
the Spouses <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Canuto</span>

virtue of a ‘Deed of Sale of Unregistered Land with Covenants of “Warranty’ (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> A), sold a parcel of land, partly residential
and partly coconut land with a periphery (area) of 359.09 square meters, <span style="">more or less, located in the barrio of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Santo Domingo</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Iriga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, to the spouses <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Carum­<span style="">ba</span></span></span><span style=""> and </span><span style="">Benita <span class="SpellE">Canuto</span>, for the </span><span style="">sum of </span><span style="">P350.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The referred deed of
sale was never registered </span>in the Office of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, and the Notary,
Mr. <span style="">Vicente </span>Malaya,
was not then an authorized notary public in the place, as <span style="">shown </span>by <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, it
has been expressly <span style="">admitted by <span class="SpellE">ap­<span style="">pellee</span></span></span> that he is the
brother-in-law of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Amado</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Canuto</span>, the

of the wife of the herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Carumba</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">On </span><st1:date year="1957" day="21" month="1"><span class="GramE">January 21, 1957</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, a complaint
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> B) for a sum of money was filed by
Santiago <span class="SpellE">Balbuena</span> against <span class="SpellE">Amado</span>
<span class="SpellE">Canuto</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nemesia</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibasco</span> before the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Iriga</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Camarines</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, known as Civil Case No. 139 and <span style="">on April 15, </span>1967,
a decision (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C) <span class="GramE">was</span>
rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1958" day="1" month="10"><span style="">October 1, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, the ex-officio Sheriff, <span class="SpellE">Justo</span>
V. Imperial, of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>,
issued a "Defi­nite Deed of Sale (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D) <span class="GramE">of</span> the property </span><span style="">now in </span><span style="">question
in favor of Santiago <span class="SpellE">Balbuena</span>, which instrument of
sale was registered before </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">Office
of the register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, </span><span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1958" day="3" month="10"><span style="">October 3, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
aforesaid property </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">declared for taxation
purposes (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1) </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the name of Santiago <span class="SpellE">Balbuena</span> in 1958."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court of First Instance, finding <span style="">that after execution of the </span>document <span class="SpellE">Carumba</span>
had taken possession of the land, planting bananas, coffee and other vegetables
thereon, declared him to be the owner of the property under a consummated sale;
held void the execution levy made by the sheriff, pursuant to a judgment
against <span class="SpellE">Carumba's</span> vendor, <span class="SpellE">Amado</span>
<span class="SpellE">Canuto</span>; and nullified the sale in favor of the
judgment creditor, Santiago <span class="SpellE">Balbuena</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court, therefore, declared <span class="SpellE">Carumba</span> the owner of the litigated property and ordered <span class="SpellE">Balbuena</span> <span style="">to pay
P30.00, as damages, </span>plus the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals, without altering the findings of fact made
by the court of origin, declared that there having been a double <span style="">sale </span>of the land subject of the suit <span class="SpellE">Balbuena's</span> title was superior <span style="">to that of </span>his adversary under Article 1544 of the Civil Code of
the Philippines, since the execution sale had been properly registered in good
faith and the sale to <span class="SpellE">Carumba</span> was not recorded.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span>disagree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While under the invoked article 1544 <span style="">registration in </span>good faith prevails
over possession in the event of a double sale <span style="">by the </span>vendor of the same piece of land to different vendees, said
article is <span style="">of no application to the
case at bar, even if <span class="SpellE">Balbuena</span>, the later </span><span style="">vendee, </span><span style="">was ignorant of the prior sale Made by his judgment debtor </span><span style="">in favor of </span><span style="">petitioner <span class="SpellE">Carumba</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason is that the purchaser of
unregistered </span>land at a sheriff's execution sale only steps into the
shoes of the judgment debtor, and merely acquires the latter's interest in the
property sold as of the time the property was levied upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is specifically provided by section 35
of Rule 39 of the Revised <span style="">Rules </span>of Court, the second paragraph of <span style="">said section spe­</span>cifically providing that:</p>

<blockquote>"Upon the execution and de livery of
said (final) deed <u>the purchaser</u>, <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span>,
or <span style="">his assignee </span>shall be
substituted to and <u>acquire all the right, title, interest</u>, and claim of <u>the
judgment debtor</u> to the property <u>as of the time of the levy</u>, except
as against the judgment debtor in possession, in which case the substitution
shall be effective as of the time of the deed. . . . . . ." (Emphasis
supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While the time of the levy does not clearly appear, it could not
have been made prior to <st1:date year="1957" day="15" month="4">15 April 1957</st1:date>,
when the decision against the former owners of the land was rendered in favor
of <span class="SpellE">Balbuena</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But the deed of sale in favor of <span class="SpellE">Canuto</span> had
been executed two years before, on <st1:date year="1955" day="12" month="4">12
 April 1955</st1:date>, and while only embodied in a private document, the
same, coupled with the fact that the buyer (petitioner <span class="SpellE">Carumba</span>)
had taken possession of the unregistered land sold, sufficed to vest ownership
on the said buyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the levy was
made by the Sheriff, therefore, the judgment debtor no longer had dominical
interest <span class="GramE">nor</span> any real right over the land that could
pass to the purchaser at the execution sale.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, the latter must yield the land to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Carumba</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule is different in case of lands
covered <span style="">by </span><st1:place>Torrens</st1:place>
titles, where the prior sale is neither recorded nor known to the execution
purchaser <span style="">prior to </span>the levy<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>;
but the land here in question is admittedly not registered under Act No. 496.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals is
reversed and that of the Court of First Instance affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against respondent <span style="">Santiago <span class="SpellE">Bal<span style="">buena</span></span></span>.</span></p>
