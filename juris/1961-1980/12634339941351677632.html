				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case is about the massacre of certain prisoners in the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Penal Colony.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was a reprise of a similar riot which occurred in the national
penitentiary at <span class="SpellE">Muntinlupa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
on Sunday morning, <st1:date year="1958" day="16" month="2">February 16, 1958</st1:date>
(People vs. De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Santos, L-19067-68, July 30, 1965,
14 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 702).</p>

<p class="BODY">The record reveals that in the morning of Sunday, June 27, 1965 <span class="SpellE">Numeriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Reynon</span>, a
prisoner-trustee, was performing guard duty at the jailhouse of the penal
colony in <span class="SpellE">Panabo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> del
Norte.</p>

<p class="BODY">The jailhouse <u>(<span class="SpellE">bartolina</span>)</u> was a
two-story building whose second floor was divided by a corridor or passageway
one and a half meters wide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On one side
was a single cell about ten meters long and eight meters wide. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>On the opposite side were three small cells.</p>

<p class="BODY">Around seventy (seventy-five, according to defendant <span class="SpellE">Cabcaban</span>) prisoners were incarcerated in the big cell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was indubitably congested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prisoners used a drum to dispose of their
waste matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Confined in the three
small cells were seventeen prisoners who had committed grave misconduct and who
were known as "close-confined" prisoners to distinguish them from the
prisoners in the big cell who were just undergoing punishment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prisoners belonged to two gangs:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the <span class="SpellE">Oxo</span> gang, whose
members were <span class="SpellE">Visayans</span> with an <span class="SpellE">Oxo</span>
mark tattooed on their bodies, and the <span class="SpellE">Sigue-Sigue</span>
gang whose members hailed from <st1:place>Luzon</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The name <span class="SpellE"><u>Sigue-Sigue</u></span>
was tattooed on their thighs or buttocks.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The existence of these gangs in the New <span class="SpellE">Bilibid</span>
Prison was traced by Judge (now Justice) Andres Reyes in the <u>De <span class="SpellE">los</span> </u><st1:city><st1:place><u>Santos</u></st1:place></st1:city>
case, <u>supra</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>See People vs.
Peralta, 25 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 759.</p>

<p class="BODY">Shortly before noontime of that <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="6">Sunday, June 27, 1965</st1:date>, or after the inmates of the big
cell had taken their lunch, <span class="SpellE">Reynon</span> locked that
cell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The seventeen inmates of the three
small cells, all members of the <span class="SpellE">Oxo</span> gang, had also
taken their lunch but <span class="SpellE">Reynon</span> did not lock their cells
because he was waiting for the prisoner-janitor to bring out from those cells
the cans used as urinals.</p>

<p class="BODY">At that juncture, <span class="SpellE">Leocadio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gavilaguin</span>, a prisoner from the small cell, approached <span class="SpellE">Reynon</span> and asked permission to pawn his pillow to Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Carballo</span>, an inmate of the big cell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Reynon</span> told <span class="SpellE">Gavilaguin</span> that <span class="SpellE">Carballo</span> would
not accept his pillow because it was very dirty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it turned out, <span class="SpellE">Gavilaguin</span>
was simply employing a ruse to inveigle <span class="SpellE">Reynon</span> into
opening the door to the big cell.</p>

<p class="BODY">When <span class="SpellE">Reynon</span> refused to open the door, <span class="SpellE">Gavilaguin</span> grabbed him from behind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, as if on cue, "the
close-confined" prisoners from the small cells surrounded <span class="SpellE">Reynon</span> and assaulted him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One prisoner stabbed <span class="SpellE">Reynon</span> while the others
hit him on the chest and right temple with fistic blows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Reynon</span> lost
consciousness and collapsed on the floor.</p>

<p class="BODY">A prisoner took the bunch of keys which were in <span class="SpellE">Reynon's</span> custody and opened the door of the big cell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(According to some extrajudicial confessions,
<span class="SpellE">Reynon</span> himself opened the door.) Led by <span class="SpellE">Kulot</span> (<span class="SpellE">Emerito</span> <span class="SpellE">Abella</span>), <span class="SpellE">Tisoy</span> (Agustin <span class="SpellE">Villaflor</span>) and <span class="SpellE">Cadio</span> (<span class="SpellE">Gavilaguin</span>), the other thirteen prisoners from the small
cells rushed into the big cell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
were (1) <span class="SpellE">Gorgonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Añover</span>,
(2) <span class="SpellE">Rustico</span> <span class="SpellE">Cidro</span>, (3) <span class="SpellE">Absalon</span> <span class="SpellE">Enrigan</span>, (4) <span class="SpellE">Sindolfo</span> <span class="SpellE">Galanto</span>, (5) Felix
Hernandez, (6) <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> <span class="SpellE">Loraña</span>
alias <span class="SpellE">Payat</span>, (7) <span class="SpellE">Eleu­terio</span>

(10) <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Rebutaso</span>, (11)
<span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Taboy</span>, (12) Jose <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span> and (13) <span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span>
Villegas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were armed with
improvised weapons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, there were
around eighty-six prisoners in the eighty-square-meter big cell when the
massacre occurred.</p>

<p class="BODY">The seventeenth closely confined prisoner, Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Bilbar</span> alias <span class="SpellE">Porping</span>, stayed in
the small cell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He locked its door and
closed the padlock of the big cell (Page 9, Record, <span class="GramE">Report</span>
of Jose T. Castro).</p>

<p class="BODY">Inside the big cell, <span class="SpellE">Villaflor</span> (<span class="SpellE">Tisoy</span>) shouted:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"<span class="SpellE">Tumabi</span> <span class="SpellE">ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span>!" ("<span class="SpellE">Visayans</span> go
to the sides").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Guillermo Ignacio
alias <span class="SpellE">Pilay</span>, an inmate of the big cell, placed pieces
of wood and a blanket on the door to keep it closed (16 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>
July 25, 1967).</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the eyewitnesses, <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>, Juan del Rosario (a victim), and Roberto Rodrigo,
all prisoners, the inmates from the big cell, who joined the sixteen raiders
from the three cells in assaulting the victims, were (1) Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span>, (2) <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Apolonias</span> alias Max, (3) Domingo <span class="SpellE">Astrologia</span>

<span class="SpellE">Sardenia</span> and (17) Angel <span class="SpellE">Tagana</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Some of these seventeen prisoners destroyed the floor of the big
cell, removed the wood <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> and used the pieces
of wood in clubbing to death some of the victims.</p>

<p class="BODY">The assaulted prisoners, who were unarmed, did not resist the
attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many of them were lying flat on
the floor with raised hands or clinging to the walls made of
steel-matting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The affray lasted for
about an hour.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although three whistles
were sounded at the start of the massacre and prison officials rushed to the
corridor near the big cell, they could not do anything because the door was
locked and the key was held by one of the raiders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one among the assailants was injured.</p>

<p class="BODY">The offenders at first did not surrender to prison officials who
had arrived at the scene after the alarm was sounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only after they were assured that they
would not be maltreated that <span class="SpellE">Abella</span> advised his
companions to surrender.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Villaflor</span> gathered all the weapons used
by his group.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He gave them and the bunch
of keys to Geronimo Jorge, the over­seer of the penal colony, through the holes
of the steel-matting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those weapons
consisted of five sharp-pointed wooden daggers, seven sharp-pointed aluminum
daggers, three wire ice picks, two bamboo ice picks, two Gillette blades with
wooden handles, a stone wrapped with cloth (<span class="SpellE"><u>caburata</u></span>),
a wooden club (<span class="SpellE">Reynon's</span> <span class="SpellE"><u>balila</u></span>)
and twenty-two pieces of wood.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ten victims, identified as (1) Romeo <span class="SpellE">Bulatao</span>,

(10) <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> San Miguel, were pronounced dead on

</span>Salvador <span class="SpellE">Abique</span>, <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Camo</span>, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span> and
Armando Sanchez died in that hospital.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fourteen victims died of shock, cerebral hemorrhage and severe
external and internal hemorr­hage.</p>

<p class="BODY">Three other victims survived.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Reynon</span> sustained a lacerated wound on his
eyebrow and a stab wound on the left shoulder.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was confined in the hospital for nineteen days.</p>

<p class="BODY">Juan <span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario, a prisoner in the big
cell, suffered a lacerated wound in the head and six incised wounds on the
right cheek, mid-anterior side of the neck, right side of the neck and the left
arm.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> de Guzman had a lacerated
wound on the head, two incised wounds at the nape and at the left hypochondriac
region, a stab wound on the neck which penetrated the larynx and two
superficial punctured wounds on the left and right sides of the chest.</p>

<p class="BODY">The examining physician testified that <span class="SpellE">Reynon</span>,
Del Rosario and De Guzman would have died had there been no timely medical
attendance.</p>

<p class="BODY">In July, 1965 the statements of several jail inmates were taken
by the prison investigator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were
sworn to before the municipal judge of <span class="SpellE">Panabo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="24" month="9">September 24, 1965</st1:date>
Vicente B. <span class="SpellE">Afurong</span>, supervising prison guard and senior
investigator of the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Penal Colony, filed in the
municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Panabo</span> a complaint for multiple <span class="GramE">murder</span> and multiple frustrated murder against thirty-seven
prisoners of the penal colony who allegedly took part in the assault (Criminal
Case No. 1773).</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused waived the second stage of the preliminary
investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="22" month="10">October 22, 1965</st1:date>, a special counsel of the

Villegas, an escapee, pleaded guilty upon arraign­ment and in open court
ratified their extrajudicial confessions which were sworn to before the
municipal judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were sentenced to
death in the trial court's 1966 partial decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nine of the ten were among the sixteen "close-confined"
prisoners in the three small cells who invaded the big cell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The tenth, <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span>,
was confined in the big cell.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a perusal of their confessions, we find that their
admission of guilt therein is corroborated by evidence of the <u>corpus</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>delicti</u></span> or the fact that the massacre described
therein actually took place.</p>

<p class="BODY">The requirements of section 20, Article IV of the Cons­titution
with respect to extrajudicial confessions are not applicable to the confessions
herein because they were taken before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>

<span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 4).</p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel <u>de</u> <u>officio</u> contends that the accused made
an improvident plea of guilty because the lower court did not apprise them of
the meaning and consequences of their plea.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Reliance is placed on the dictum that in capital cases "it is
advisable for the court to call witnesses for the purpose of establishing the
guilt and the degree of culpability of the de­fendant" (<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Talbanos</span>, 6 Phil. 541, 543).</p>

<p class="BODY">Also cited is the admonition that "judges are duty-bound to
be extra solicitous in seeing to it that when an accused pleads guilty he
understands fully the meaning of his plea and the import of an inevitable
conviction" (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Apduhan</span>, Jr., L-19491,
August 30, 1968, 24 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 798, 817).</p>

<p class="BODY">And the long settled rule is that in case a plea of guilty is
made in capital cases "the proper and prudent course to follow is to take
such evidence as are available and necessary in support of the material
allegations of the information, including the aggra­vating circumstances
therein enumerated, not only to satisfy the trial judge himself but also to aid
the Supreme Court in deter­mining whether the accused really and truly
understood and compre­hended the meaning, full significance and consequences of
his plea" (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Bulalake</span>, 106 Phil. 767,
770.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>See People vs. <span class="SpellE">Baluyot</span>,

75 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 148).</p>

<p class="BODY">As already indicated in our recital of the proceedings below, the
trial court, in order to comply with the procedure in capital cases when a plea
of guilty is entered, required the fiscal to present evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter presented the confessions of those
who pleaded guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the trial judge did not adhere to the ritualistic
formula of explaining to the accused the meaning and consequences of their plea
of guilty and the nature of the aggravating circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY">Presumably, the trial court did not do so, not only because the
judicial confessions of the accused (pleas of guilty) were reinforced by their
extrajudicial confessions, but also because it was cognizant of the fact that
all the accused were quasi-recidivists who had already acquired experience in
cri­minal proceedings and had, therefore, some comprehension of what a plea of
guilty signifies.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that in this case the accused did not make an improvident
plea of guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As held in <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Jamad</span>, 37 Phil. 305, 318, it lies within the
sound discretion of the trial judge whether he is satisfied that a plea of
guilty has been entered by the accused with full knowledge of the meaning and
consequences thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">People vs. <span class="SpellE">Yamson</span> and
Romero, 109 Phil. 793, is</span> a case similar to the instant case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the <span class="SpellE"><u>Yamson</u></span>

<span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were forthwith convicted by the trial court and sentenced to death,
being quasi-recidivists.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused appealed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
Court, in resolving the contention of counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
that the accused had made an improvident plea, held that the trial judge must
have been fully satisfied that the accused entered the plea of guilty with full
knowledge of the meaning and consequences thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That observation may be applied to the
instant case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Same

contend that the trial court erred in holding that there was a conspiracy among
the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That contention has no
basis in the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record
supports the trial court's finding that "conspiracy can lo­gically be
inferred from the simultaneous and concerted acts of (the) sixteen raiders who,
after putting down the guard and entering the big cell, joined and combined
forces with their friends and associates-inmates of the big cell who were
waiting for the go-signal to commence the attack in pursuance of their criminal
objective".</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court added that the acts and conduct of the accused
from the start of their aggression until the riot was suppressed were
characterized "by a swift, united and con­certed movement that could
easily indicate a community of pur­pose, closeness of association and
concurrence of wills", as shown particularly by the order of the two
"close-confined" prisoners, <span class="SpellE">Abella</span> and <span class="SpellE">Villaflor</span>, that the <span class="SpellE">Visayans</span> in
the big cell should stay on one side so that it could be ascertained that they
were the allies of the sixteen raiders.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conspiracy among the accused was manifest and
indubitable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The massacre had been
planned by the sixteen "close-confined" prisoners in collaboration
with the other members of the <span class="SpellE">Oxo</span> gang in the big
cell.</p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> assails
the credibility of witnesses <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> and Del
Rosario.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These two witnesses were
prisoners in the big cell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had
sufficient opportunity to observe what took place during the hour-long
riot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Del Rosario was himself a victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
contends that reiteration is not aggra­vating because there is no evidence that
the said accused had been previously punished for an offense to which the law
attaches an equal or greater penalty or for two or more crimes to which it
attaches a lighter penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
contrary, according to counsel, the said accused were still serving sentence
for their prior convictions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel's contention is correct as to <span class="SpellE">Abella</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Gavilaguin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Maldecir</span>, <span class="SpellE">Villaflor</span> and <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span> against whom reiteration was considered
aggravating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were still serv­ing
sentence for their previous crimes at the time the riot occurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order that the aggravating circumstance of
re­iteration may be taken into account, it should be shown that the offender
against whom it is appreciated had already served out his sentences for the
prior offenses (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Layson</span>, L-25177, October
31, 1969, 30 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 92, 97).</p>

<p class="BODY">But since the accused are quasi-recidivists, the fact that
reiteration cannot be appreciated against them and that their plea of guilty is
mitigating will not affect the imposition of the death penalty for the murders
and frustrated murders which they had committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other contention of counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
that all the accused should be given the benefit of the extenuating circum­stance
of voluntary <span class="GramE">surrender</span> to the authorities is not
correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused did not surrender
voluntarily and unconditionally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
rejected the initial requests for their surrender.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They surrendered after prison officials armed
with guns demanded their surrender.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
chose the person to whom they would surrender, namely, Jorge, the overseer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defense counsel's contention that treachery and evident
premeditation are not aggravating in this case is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused, <span class="GramE">who</span>
were all armed, unexpectedly attacked the unarmed and defenseless <span class="SpellE"><u>Sigue-Sigue</u></span> inmates in the big cell who had no means
of escaping from that cell and who could not avoid their assaults.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victims did not offer any resistance.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused had deliberately planned the attack as shown by the
manner in which they executed the massacre.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They provided themselves with improvised weapons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one among the accused sustained any
injuries or was exposed to any risk arising from any defense that the victims
might have made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victims were not
able to make any retaliation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
there was abuse of superiority which absorbed <span class="SpellE"><u>cuadrilla</u></span>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">In People vs. <span class="SpellE">Layson</span>, L-25177, October
31, 1969, 30 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 92, the four accused, also inmates
of the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Penal Colony, who were armed with bladed
weapons, entered on Jan­uary 17, 1964 the cell of their fellow prisoner, locked
the door thereof and stabbed him to death.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was held that the crime was murder aggravated by treachery, evident
premeditation and quasi-recidivism.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE"><u>Layson</u></span> case is similar to
the instant case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The difference between
the two cases is that in the instant case, more prisoners were involved and there
were seventeen victims.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of those twenty, ten accused, namely, <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Enrigan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Gavilaguin</span>,
Hernandez, <span class="SpellE">Loraña</span>, <span class="SpellE">Opsiar</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quijano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Taboy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Villa­rama</span> and Villegas had pleaded guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nine of the ten were "close-confined"
prisoners in the three cells.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The tenth,
<span class="SpellE">Dio­nisio</span>, was in the big cell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other ten of the twenty accused were from
the big cell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They pleaded not guilty
and they were tried.</p>

<p class="BODY">The twenty <span class="SpellE">movants</span> alleged in their
motion for new trial that those who pleaded guilty did so due to "the
coercion, harassment and intimidation applied by the prison authorities"
or due to "third degree" and other brutalities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They further alleged that one of the "fabricated
(prosecution) witnesses" was Guillermo Ignacio who made a retraction and
that another wit­ness, <span class="SpellE">Elino</span> Duran, was forced to
sign his affidavit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General commented that the grounds relied upon by
the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> are not the grounds for a new trial under
sections 2 and 3, Rule 121 and section 13, Rule 124 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He correctly observed that Ignacio and Duran
were not utilized as prosecution witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Action on the motion for new trial was
deferred until the case is decided on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After an evaluation of the said motion, we find
that it is devoid of merit and is not in order.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record does not show that Ignacio retracted his
statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Duran never claimed that he
was intimidated into making his statement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Those <span class="SpellE">movants</span> who pleaded guilty were
convicted on the basis of their confessions which they ratified during the
trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, those who
pleaded not guilty were given a fair trial.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They testified and they had the oppor­tunity to prove their
innocence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their testimonies (except <span class="SpellE">Apolonias</span>' testimony) did not generate any reasonable doubt
as to their guilt.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Propriety of the imposition of the death penalty on the
eighteen accused</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- As to the
fourteen deceased victims, the crime is murder qualified by treachery which
absorbs abuse of superiority and <span class="SpellE"><u>cuadrilla</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to those who pleaded guilty, that
mitigating circumstance is offset by evident premeditation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Recidivism is aggravating as to some
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to all the eighteen accused,
quasi-recidivism is a special aggravating circum­stance which justifies the imposition
of the penalty for murder (<u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> maximum to death)
in its maximum period or death.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fiscal and the trial court treated the fourteen killings and
the injuries inflicted on the three victims as a complex crime of multiple <span class="GramE">murder</span> and multiple frustrated murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court imposed a <u>single death
penalty</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">However, the Solicitor General submits that the accused should be
convicted of fourteen separate murders and three separate frustrated murders
and punished, res­pectively, by <u>fourteen death penalties</u> and three
penalties for the frustrated murders because the killings and injuries were
effected by distinct acts.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is argued that article 48 of the Revised Penal Code is not
applicable to this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cited in
support of that stand is the ruling in U.S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>,
1 Phil. 56 that "where the defendant has fired two shots, killing one
party and wound­ing another, the acts constitute two distinct crimes, each of
which must be tried separately".</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the Solicitor General's submission is not
well-taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the <u>De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Santos</u> case, <u>supra</u>, which in­volved two
riots on two successive days in the national peni­tentiary wherein nine
prisoners were killed (five on the first day and four on the second day), the
fourteen members of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Sigue-Sigue</u></span> gang who
took part in the killing were convicted of multiple murder (a complex crime)
and not of nine separate murders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only
one death penalty was imposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
com­muted to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> for
lack of necessary votes.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no compelling reason for not deciding this case in the
same way as the <u>De <span class="SpellE">los</span> </u><st1:city><st1:place><u>Santos</u></st1:place></st1:city>
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two cases are very similar.</p>

<p class="BODY">The ruling in the <u>De <span class="SpellE">los</span> </u><st1:city><st1:place><u>Santos</u></st1:place></st1:city>
case is predicated on the theory that "when, for the attainment of a
single purpose which constitutes an offense, various acts are executed, such
acts must be considered only as one offense", a complex one (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Peñas</span>, 66 Phil. 682, 687.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>See People vs. Cu <span class="SpellE">Unjieng</span>, 61 Phil. 236, 302
and 906, where the falsification of one hundred twenty-eight warehouse receipts
during the period from November 1930 to July 6, 1931, which enabled the accused
to swindle the bank in the sum of one million four hundred thousand pesos was
treated as only one complex crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> through
multiple falsification of mercantile documents and only one penalty was
imposed).</p>

<p class="BODY">That holding in the <u>De <span class="SpellE">los</span> </u><st1:city><st1:place><u>Santos</u></st1:place></st1:city>
case is buttressed by some precedents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, in People vs. Cabrera, 43 Phil. 64 and 82, 102-103, where
seventy-seven <span class="SpellE">Constabularymen</span> murdered six policemen
(including the assistant chief of police) and two private citizens and gravely
wounded three civilians, they were convicted of multiple murder with grave
injuries, a complex crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The eleven
sergeants and corporals were sentenced to death while the sixty-six privates
were sentenced to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See People vs. <span class="SpellE">Umali</span>,

where on a single occasion around fifty <span class="SpellE">Maranaos</span> were
killed by a group of home guards (formerly Constabulary soldiers), the killing
was held to be only one complex offense of multiple homicide because it
"resulted from a single criminal impulse" and it was not possible to
determine how many victims were killed by each of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>

a complex crime, for complicity in the ambuscade.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court sentenced them to death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They appealed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case as to three of the accused was
dismissed on the ground that their confessions were taken after they had been

<p class="BODY">Two other accused, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Manantan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Viray</span>, executed

they relied on alibis, which were not given credence.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court imposed upon <span class="SpellE">Manantan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> only one death penalty for the multiple <span class="GramE">murder</span> but for lack of necessary votes, the penalty was
reduced to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span><u>.<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">As persuasive authority, it may be noted that the Court of
Appeals rendered the same ruling when it held that where a conspiracy animates
several persons with a single purpose, "their individual acts in pursuance
of that purpose are looked upon as a single act - the act of execution - giving
rise to a complex offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The felonious
agreement produces a sole and <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>

<p class="BODY">In the <span class="SpellE"><u>Leaño</u></span> case, a group of

with <span class="SpellE"><u>lesiones</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>menos</u></span>
<u>graves.<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The holding that there is a complex crime in cases like the
instant case is similar to the rule in robbery with homicide, a special complex
crime, where the number of persons killed on the occasion or by reason of the
robbery does not change the nature of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have already stated that the conviction for multi­ple murder
and multiple frustrated murder, as a complex crime, qualified by treachery
(absorbing abuse of superiority and <span class="SpellE"><u>cuadrilla</u></span>)
and aggravated by quasi-recidivism and evident premeditation (offset by plea of
guilty) and recidivism, as to some accused, as shown in the record, should be
affirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The death penalty was properly imposed in conformity with
articles 48, 160 and 248 of the Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The indemnity of six thousand pesos should be
increased to twelve thousand pesos for each set of heirs of the fourteen victims.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, justice should be tempered with mercy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the circumstances which drove the
accused to massacre their fellow prisoners, they deserve clemency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The death penalty should be commuted to <u>reclusion</u>

</span>The following observations of this Court in the <u>De <span class="SpellE">los</span> </u><st1:city><st1:place><u>Santos</u></st1:place></st1:city>
case have some relevancy to this case:</p>

<blockquote>"But the members of the Court cannot in conscience concur in
the death penalty imposed, because they find it im­possible to ignore the
contributory role played by the inhuman conditions then reigning in the
penitentiary, vividly described by the trial judge in his decision.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is evident that the <u>incredible overcrowding</u> of the
prison cells, that taxed facilities beyond measure and the starvation allowance
of ten centavos per meal for each pri­soner, must have rubbed raw the nerves
and dispositions of the unfortunate inmates, and predisposed them to all sorts
of violence to seize from their owners the meager supplies from outside in
order to eke out their miserable existence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"All this led inevitably to the formation of gangs that preyed
like wolf packs on the weak, and ultimately to pitiless gang rivalry for the
control of the prisoners, abetted by the inability of the outnumbered guards to
enforce discipline, and which culminated in violent riots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The government cannot evade responsibility
for keeping prisoners under such subhuman and <span class="SpellE">Dantesque</span>
conditions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Society must not close its eyes to the fact that if it has
the right to exclude from its midst those who attack it, it has no right at all
to confine them under circumstances that strangle all sense of decency, reduce
convicts to the level of animals, and convert a prison term into prolonged
torture and slow death." <span class="GramE">(See People vs. <span class="SpellE">Dahil</span>, L-30271, June 15, 1979.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> believes that in a case
like the instant case, where, since the commission of the multiple murder and
multiple frustrated murder in 1965 or more than fourteen years ago, the accused
have been in confinement and in fact they have been in confinement for other
offenses even prior to 1965, the death penalty should be commuted to <u>reclusion</u>
