were trying to reach for the chickens on the eaves of the roof of his
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon seeing this, he shouted:
"Robbers! Robbers!".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because
of his shouts, the four persons scampered about the premises as far as nine (9)
meters away from his house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly
thereafter, he saw <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Caseres</span>,
a neighbor of his, walking towards his house.<span style="">&nbsp;

robbers, but as <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> was about three (3) meters
from his house, he was shot by Francisco <span class="SpellE">Toling</span> with
a shotgun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span>

about six hundred (600) meters away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the way, they met Maria <span class="SpellE">Caseres</span>, wife of <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span>, who was also running towards her father-in-law's
house because she heard a shot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
they reached the house of <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Caseres</span>, he shouted: "<span class="SpellE">Compadre</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> was shot." They then proceeded to hide
among the bushes nearby.</p>

<p class="BODY">Early in the following morning, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Lumpayao</span>
returned to his house only to discover in the yard his trunk, which in the

the barking of three dogs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Peeping
through the little opening of the window, he saw two horses running fast, with
two persons riding on each horse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
the horses got near his house, the riders dismounted and made their horses
fight his horse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, three of
the four persons walked toward his house while the fourth continued to watch
the horses fighting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He noticed that the
three persons who went near his house were armed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He recognized them as Francisco <span class="SpellE">Toling</span>, who was armed with a gun, <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span>

recognize the fourth man because he was quite far.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was able to recognize the three men
because the moon was bright --- there was a full moon --- and the sky was not
cloudy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After about half an hour, the

was very shiny due to good weather on that particular time.</blockquote>

<span class="SpellE">Caseres</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- That upon arrival near the house of his
neighbor, whose name later known to be Francisco <span class="SpellE">Lumpayao</span>,
we tried to make noise with the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> to let him
come down until the dogs of said Francisco <span class="SpellE">Lumpayao</span>
barked and barked and the said owner of the dogs was awakened, so that he
shouted for help thinking that we are robbers, and for that instant, <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Caseres</span> came down from
his house, and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Toling</span> who was aiming
already waiting for him to come down fired him a shot and I am sure he was hit
because he fell on the ground shouting for pains, and on that instant,
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Lumpayao</span> and his family run down from their
house to make their escape, so that some of us came upstairs and robbed the
house.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- You have stated that you were only hired by
your father-in-law, have you received the said amount of money?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>- None, sir, we did not receive the P250.00.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Why?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>- After the incident, said <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> <span class="SpellE">Swela</span> evacuated with his
family and we were not able to see them, especially that we were wanted and we
were always hiding ourselves from the <span class="SpellE">Molave</span> police.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Why are you here in the office of the Chief
of Police of this municipality?</blockquote>

house of my parents at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Ariosa</span> this
municipality by a team of local police.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In connection with the execution of the extrajudicial statement

the same was signed by appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He declared
that the aforesaid prepared statement was brought to his office by Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bretania</span> of the <span class="SpellE">Molave</span> Police

<p class="BODY">At the hearing on <st1:date year="1967" day="2" month="10">October

Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Cometa</span> (Exhibit "E") was brought to

</span>It was only when he was satisfied that <span class="SpellE">Cometa</span>
understood the same and affirmed that it was voluntarily given that he allowed
appellant <span class="SpellE">Cometa</span> to sign the document and afterwards

<p class="BODY">In their brief, appellants contend, among others, that the trial
court erred in reopening <span class="SpellE"><i>motu</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">proprio</span></i> the proceedings after the case had been
submitted for decision, simply to enable the prosecution to present evidence
which it overlooked or failed to submit at the trial; that the trial court
erred in admitting and relying upon the confessions of <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gahito</span>, <span class="SpellE">Candelario</span> <span class="SpellE">Bolando</span> and Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Cometa</span> as
competent evidence against each other and as against their co-accused Rolando <span class="SpellE">Cometa</span>; and that the trial court erred in holding that the
crime committed was Robbery in Band with Homicide under Article 294, paragraph
1 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">With reference to the reopening of the proceedings after both sides
had rested and the case submitted for decision, We hold that the trial court
was not in error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As early as in 1907,
this Court held in <i>U. S. v. <span class="SpellE">Cinco</span></i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
that "judges of the Courts of First Instance are judges of both fact and
law, and after all the evidence adduced by the attorneys, if the court is not
satisfied, we see no reason why he should not be permitted to call additional
witnesses for the purpose of satisfying his mind upon any questions presented
during the trial of the case." Also, in <i>U. S. v. Base, et al.</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
it has been held that "if the lower court is not satisfied with the
evidence adduced by the attorneys in criminal cases, with reference to a particular
point, he may, on his own motion, call additional witnesses or recall some of
the same witnesses, for the purpose of satisfying his mind with reference to
particular facts involved in the case."</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the confessions of <span class="SpellE">Candelario</span> <span class="SpellE">Bolando</span> and Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Cometa</span>, We
find them to have been freely and voluntarily executed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one thing, the con­fessions themselves
are indicative of their spontaneity and the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the narration of facts in the
extrajudicial confessions of <span class="SpellE">Bolando</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cometa</span> will show, the essential details, except for the
alleged plot to kill <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Caseres</span>,
when pieced together are identical and reveal a complete story of the entire
incident from its inception to its consummation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the initial meeting between Francisco <span class="SpellE">Toling</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Candelario</span> <span class="SpellE">Bolando</span> at
4:30 p.m. on February 5, 1966 wherein <span class="SpellE">Bolando</span> was
induced by <span class="SpellE">Toling</span> to go with him to Barrio Bag-<span class="SpellE">ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Gutlang</span>; the subsequent
meeting between <span class="SpellE">Toling</span> and his brother-in-law,
Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Cometa</span>, where Francisco <span class="SpellE">Toling</span>
induced Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Cometa</span> to go with him to Barrio Bag-<span class="SpellE">ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Gutlang</span> to kill one <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Caseres</span> who had a
misunderstanding with his (Rogelio's) father-in-law, for which reason he (<span class="SpellE">Toling</span>) was hired by Rogelio's father-in-law to kill <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Toling's</span> promise to
Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Cometa</span> that he would pay him P50.00; their
trip to Barrio Bag-<span class="SpellE">ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Gutlang</span>
and the recruitment along the way of Rolando <span class="SpellE">Cometa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> <span class="SpellE">Gahito</span> and Emilio <span class="SpellE">Montillano</span>;<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
the circumstance that Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Cometa</span> was armed with a
.22 Caliber revolver, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Toling</span> with a
home-made shotgun, Emilio <span class="SpellE">Montillano</span> with a bolo,
while Rolando <span class="SpellE">Cometa</span> and <span class="SpellE">Candelario</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bolando</span> had none; the events that transpired upon
their arrival near the house of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Lumpayao</span> at
about 11:00 o'clock in the evening of that date --- such as the barking of the
dogs and the shooting of <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Caseres</span>
--- which dovetail with the testimony of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Lumpayao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The aforesaid statements contain only minor
and somewhat contradictory details.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, one said Rolando <span class="SpellE">Cometa</span> had a bolo,
while the other said he was unarmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bolando</span> stated that he did not know the purpose of their
mission and only was told along the way that they were going to rob <span class="SpellE">Lumpayao</span>, while Rogelio categorically declared that their
purpose was to kill <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were also exculpatory statements, such
as the attempt of each <span class="SpellE">declarant</span> to show that not one
of them committed any overt act, either in the killing of <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span>,
or in the robbery in the house of <span class="SpellE">Lumpayao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The disclosure of such details which only the
<span class="SpellE">declarants</span> could have known, and the improbability
that such details could have been concocted by the police, the failure of the
appellants to complain to the municipal judge and the mayor before whom the
confessions were sworn, the evident attempt of each <span class="SpellE">declarant</span>
to exculpate himself, their delay in complaining to the authorities about their
alleged maltreatment, demonstrate clearly that their claim of maltreatment was
an afterthought and their said confessions were freely and voluntarily made.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the facts, the extrajudicial confessions of appellants
Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Cometa</span> and <span class="SpellE">Candelario</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bolando</span> should have been admissible only against said
<span class="SpellE">declarants</span> and not as the basis for the conviction of
Rolando <span class="SpellE">Cometa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The rule on interlocking confessions is - "where extrajudicial
confessions has been made by several persons charged with a conspiracy and
there could have been no collusion with reference to the several confessions,
the fact that the statements are in all material respects identical is <i>confirmatory
of the testimony of an accomplice</i>."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
In other words, such extrajudicial declarations may, under certain conditions,
be taken into consideration as a circumstance in judging the credibility of the
testimony of an accomplice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case
of Rolando <span class="SpellE">Cometa</span>, there is no testimony implicating
said appellant which the aforesaid extrajudicial confessions would confirm or
corroborate.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the appellants that they should not be convicted of
Robbery in Band with Homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Cometa</span> positively declared that for a price of P50.00, he
joined Francisco <span class="SpellE">Toling</span> in the latter's plan to kill <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Caseres</span> of Barrio Bag-<span class="SpellE">ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Gutlang</span> inconsideration of a
reward of P250.00 promised by <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> <span class="SpellE">Sejuela</span> who wanted <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Caseres</span> to be killed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Relating this declaration with the shooting and killing of <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Caseres</span> by Francisco <span class="SpellE">Toling</span>, We cannot escape the conclusion that indeed the
purpose of the group was to kill <span class="SpellE">Caseres</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, We hasten to state that
while <span class="SpellE">Candelario</span> <span class="SpellE">Bolando</span>
stated that he was told along the way that their purpose was to rob Francisco <span class="SpellE">Lumpayao</span>, said statement cannot prevail over the positive
declaration of Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Cometa</span> as to their purpose, it
appearing that <span class="SpellE">Franciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Toling</span>,
who did the killing, and his brother-in-law, Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Cometa</span>,
were the ones who organized and led the group in the criminal enterprise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not improbable that they did not
immediately reveal to <span class="SpellE">Bolando</span> their criminal purpose
in order to induce the latter to go with them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were the leaders, while <span class="SpellE">Candelario</span> was
merely a minor follower.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the
actuations of the appellants indicated that the robbery was an afterthought
which arose only when they saw that <span class="SpellE">Lumpayao</span> and his
family have, because of fear, abandoned their house.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is that where the original design comprehends robbery in
a dwelling, and homicide is perpetrated with a view to the consummation of the
robbery, the crime committed is the complex offense of robbery with homicide even
though homicide precedes the robbery by an appreciable time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the original design was not to commit
robbery but robbery was committed after the homicide as an afterthought as a
minor incident in the homicide, the criminal acts should be viewed as
constitutive of two distinct offenses and not as a single complex offense.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is that where a complex crime is charged and the
evidence fails to support the charge as to one of the component offenses, the
defendant can be convicted of the other.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Where the defendant is charged with robbery with homicide, he may be convicted
of one of them.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, when a person is charged with a crime and the evidence
does not show that he is guilty of the crime charged, but does show that he is
guilty of some lesser offense, the court may sentence him for the lesser
offense provided the lesser offense is a cognate offense and is included in the
complaint filed with the court.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, it should be noted that the crime charged was
Robbery with Homicide, which, being a special complex crime, is definitely
higher than the single crimes of homicide and robbery.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">If there is no express or implied conspiracy among two or more persons
taking part in the commission of the crime, then their liability is regarded as
individual or separate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, conspiracy
has not been sufficiently proven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
does not appear that the appellants had a common plan or common criminal
design.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to <span class="SpellE">Bolando's</span>
extrajudicial confession, he went along with <span class="SpellE">Toling</span>
because he was afraid to displease the latter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was only when they were on their way to the barrio that he learned
that the purpose was to rob one Francisco <span class="SpellE">Lumpayao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Cometa</span>,
however, in his extrajudicial confession maintained that his purpose with
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Toling</span> was to kill <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Caseres</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither could conspiracy be inferred from the acts of <span class="SpellE">Candelario</span> <span class="SpellE">Bolando</span> or Rolando <span class="SpellE">Cometa</span>, since the two had not cooperated in any manner with
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Toling</span> and Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Cometa</span>
for the realization of the latter's criminal purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Candelario</span> <span class="SpellE">Bolando</span> and Rolando <span class="SpellE">Cometa</span> could
not, therefore, be held responsible for the death of <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Caseres</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering, however, that <span class="SpellE">Bolando</span> admitted
that after knowing that they were going to rob someone he still went with them
to Barrio Bag-<span class="SpellE">ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Gutlang</span>
and although he did not directly participate in the robbery he gave moral
encouragement to them with his presence and shared in the loot in the amount of
Fifty Centavos (P0.50), he should be criminally responsible as an accomplice
for the crime of robbery.</p>

<p class="BODY">An accomplice is one who cooperates in the execution of the crime
by previous or simultaneous acts, provided that he has not taken direct part in
the execution of the crime or forced or induced others to execute it, or
cooperated in its perpetration by an indispensable act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crime committed is robbery with force
upon things, since the trunk of the offended party was taken from his house and
forcibly opened in the yard.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Pursuant to the fifth paragraph of Article 299 of the Revised Penal Code, when
the value of the property taken does not exceed Two Hundred Fifty Pesos
(P250.00), the penalty for the offense is <span class="SpellE"><i>prision</i></span>
<i>mayor</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">impossable</span>
penalty on appellant <span class="SpellE">Bolando</span> is the penalty next
lower in degree than that prescribed by law for the consummated felony,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
which in the instant case should be <span class="SpellE"><i>prision</i></span> <span class="SpellE"><i>correccional</i></span> to be applied in its medium period, in
the absence of any aggravating or mitigating circumstance.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of appellant Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Cometa</span>,
he admitted he agreed to the offer of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Toling</span>
that if he would go with him to kill <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Caseres</span> he would be paid P50.00 (Exhibit
"E").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, he
went with <span class="SpellE">Toling</span> after arming himself with a Caliber
.22 home-made gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the way to Barrio
Bag-<span class="SpellE">ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Gutlang</span>, he even
forced <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> <span class="SpellE">Gahito</span> to
join them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was with <span class="SpellE">Toling</span> when the latter treacherously shot <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Caseres</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should, therefore, be liable as a
co-principal in the crime of homicide, since the crime of murder is not
necessarily included in the information for robbery with homicide.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears also from the evidence that it was Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Cometa</span> who went up and ransacked the trunk of the <span class="SpellE">Lumpayaos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is,
therefore, guilty as a principal in the crime of robbery, defined and penalized
by Article 299, paragraph b, sub-paragraph 2, of the Revised Penal Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, Rolando <span class="SpellE">Cometa</span>
cannot be held criminally responsible as principal of either the crime of
homicide or robbery since there is no direct proof that he conspired with his
co-appellants or directly participated in the commission thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He cannot also be held criminally responsible
as an accomplice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order to hold one
liable as an accomplice, it is essential that it be proved beyond reasonable
doubt that between the supposed accomplice and the principal, there is
community of criminal purpose which implied that it be shown that the supposed
accomplice committed the acts imputed to him with the intention to help morally
or materially in the commission of the crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Here, it has not been convincingly established that appellant
Rolando <span class="SpellE">Cometa</span>, knowing of the criminal purpose, has
given aid or encouragement, either morally or materially, in the commission of
the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such circumstances being
absent, his mere presence at the scene of the crime does not make him an

"From the fact that the killing and the robbery did not take place in the
same place, the appellants contend that the crime committed cannot be robbery
with homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it appears from the
facts proved that appellants had the intention of robbing <span class="SpellE">Omblero</span>
when their leader asked him for money and threatened him with death if he
refused and that after shooting him down and thus eliminating an obstacle to
the effectuation of their unlawful design, they repaired to his house, which
was nearby, and by force, took his money <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is thus clear that the kill­ing and the
robbery are not isolated acts, for there is a direct connection between the
two.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The killing sprang from the idea of
robbing and was but a step in the perpe­tration of the robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances, we have no hesitation
in saying that the killing was done by rea­son or on the occasion of the
robbery, so that appellants are guilty of the special complex crime of robbery
with homicide (Article 294, paragraph 1, Revised Penal Code).</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">"When there is direct relation
and intimate connection between the robbery and the death of the owner of the
property stolen, by reason of the death having preceded the robbery and of the
fact that the crime sprang from the idea of robbery, the accused beginning the
crim­inal act by killing their victim, such crimes cannot be separated into two
distinct crimes of robbery and of ho­micide or murder, nor consequently, can
the criminal liability of the defendants be divided in accordance with such
participation as they may have had in one part of the crime or the other, nor
can they be sentenced for the crime of robbery independently of that of
homicide or murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, if
there is a direct relation, an intimate connection between the robbery and the
kill­ing whether the latter be prior or subsequent to the for­mer, or whether
both crimes be committed at the same time - it is unquestionable that they
constitute the com­plex crime defined in article 294, paragraph 1, of the Penal
Code." (Guevara, Revised Penal Code, p. 576, citing <i>People</i> <i>v</i>.
