before and had abused <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span>; that as a result of the
police investigation the corresponding criminal complaint against the three
named individuals was filed by the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Agno</span>
on 6 June 1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that Mariano <span class="SpellE">Obtinalia</span> was known to the complainants, which could have
enabled his recognition by the couple as one of the intruders, was admitted by
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, Mariano claimed that <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span> might have
pointed to him as one of the offenders because about a year prior to the
incident, he refused to sell for the couple a <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>
that had no covering certificate of ownership.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Such motive appears to be flimsy and unbelievable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing on record to indicate that <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> is such a
vindictive and ruthless person that he would stop at nothing, even to the
extent of exposing his own wife to shame and ridicule, just to get even with a
supposed enemy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, while
<span class="SpellE">Teoly</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jimce</span> <span class="SpellE">Ubalde</span> (who were represented by another counsel) made no
similar admission -- in fact, they denied knowing <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span> at all -- no reason has been given why the
latter would implicate them in the commission of the crime if indeed they were
not so involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the
Municipal Judge and the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Agno</span>, who
appeared to have no personal motive to testify falsely against the accused,
attested to the spontaneity and <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> of
their identification by the complainants as perpetrators of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the defense of alibi, the weakest
of defenses, put up by the accused and their witnesses, who were close relatives
and friends, can not overcome the aforementioned positive evidence of the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> liability.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision, the court below explained why it disbelieved the
alibis of herein accused-appellants, saying:</p>

<blockquote>"'Our Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a defense of
alibi is the weakest defense because it can easily be concocted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in this particular case, this Court
cannot believe the alibi interposed by each one of the three accused as they
are only supported by oral testimony of witnesses who are either their
neighbors or the relatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And against
this alibi of the accused, we have the strong evidence in favor of the
prosecution to the effect that immediately after the incident on the early
morning of 6 June 1968, the said <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> went to report the matter to the office of the
Chief of Police, and then, he and his wife went to the Chief of Police who,
after conducting an investigation, filed the corresponding complaint with the
municipal court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has no
reason to doubt the testimony of the two offended parties, for they are rural
folks, practically, unsophisticated, and they would not be courting trouble,
and engaging in a litigation if they have not been the victim of a crime of
mischief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most especially is this true
with respect to <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span> <span class="SpellE">Pitalbero</span>,
because a woman who is already attached to a man would not dare to expose her
dishonor and reputation, and tell to the public that she has been abused three
(3) times.' (pages 191-192, Record)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To which it can only be added that the witnesses for the accused,
while allegedly remembering clearly where the accused were on the 5<u>th</u> of
June 1968, were unsure as to the dates of other events and experiences, a
peculiarity that must adversely affect their credibility.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense challenges the testimony of the complainants by
pointing out that in their affidavits sworn to before the Municipal Judge <span class="SpellE">Noguera</span>, it is only stated that they were robbed and
"abused" but sexual intercourse is not mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted in the first place that
the witnesses only knew <span class="SpellE">Ilocano</span> and not English, and
were not responsible for the use of the vague term "abuse".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the corresponding word actually employed
by the complainants indicated that <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span> was raped,
and that the Chief of Police so understood it, is proved by the terms of the
complaint filed by him in the municipal court, wherein he charged that the
"accused took them (turns) <u>abusing</u> <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pitalbero</span> by <u>having sexual intercourse</u> with
her against her will" (Record, page 4, emphasis supplied).</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, in her first affidavit (marked as Exhibit
"3" for the defense) <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span> clearly showed
that she was raped:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How
many abused you?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three, sir."</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">xxxxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">xxxxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">xxxxx</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
did you do to defend your honor at the time they were abusing you?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I moved and struggled to get free, but two
of them held my hands, one of my hands each, and one of them said, "Don't
move or I will make your ear fly".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I crossed my legs but they tore my half slip and placed the point of a
bolo on my leg.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were able to subdue
me when my strength give in." (Record, page 122)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">True it is that in this first affidavit <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span>
claimed she recognized only one of the robbers and did not know his name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the trial, however, she explained that she
was then afraid to give the names of the accused because they had threatened to
come back and kill her and her husband if they reported to the police; and this
version was confirmed by the testimony of judge <span class="SpellE">Noguera</span>,
that he believed she knew who raped her, for he told her to return to the Chief
of Police and give the names of the accused and to request for protection (v. <u>ante</u>,
page 5).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result, <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span> executed her second affidavit, naming the
accused-appellants (Exhibit "D", Record, page 26).</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense also stresses that in the certificate issued on 23
June 1968 by the Municipal Health Officer, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>
(Exhibit "E", also marked Exhibit "4"), on the result of
his examination of complainant <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span> <span class="SpellE">Pitalbero</span> on 8 June, it was certified that there was no
evidence of spermatozoa in her vagina.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But the doctor also declared that if the woman washed her organ or if
her natural secretion was strong, the spermatozoa could be washed out in two
days' time, and the rape had occurred on the 5th of June.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence the absence of sperm on 8 June was not
incompatible with the rape three days previously.</p>

<p class="BODY">To contradict <span class="SpellE">Rufina's</span> testimony why
she could not be examined in 6 June, the defense offered to prove that Dr. <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> was in <span class="SpellE">Agno</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, on that day, but the court refused to allow the
proposed testimony to be given.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We think
this issue is of no moment, for the doctor could have been in <span class="SpellE">Agno</span> on 6 June and <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span> be
unable to contact him on that day.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, it has also been shown through the declarations of both
complainants, that the three accused, with three other unidentified companions,
entered together and left the house of the victims in a group; that the three
accused raped <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span> <span class="SpellE">Pitalbero</span>
one after the other -- two of them holding her hands and feet, while the third
was committing the vile act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The actions
of the accused sufficiently point to unity of their purpose and to their
collective and common design; in short, to a conspiracy to commit the crime<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>,
making each and all of them collectively responsible for the acts thus
perpetrated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused challenge the correctness of the lower court's
judgment sentencing each of them to the penalty of death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is claimed that having been accused of the
crime of robbery in band with rape, which is penalized by <u>reclusion temporal</u>
in its medium period to <u>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></u> by
Article 294(2) of the Revised Penal Code, they can not be sentenced to the
penalty provided under Article 335 of the same Code, as amended by Republic Act
4111.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no merit in the contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As pointed out by the trial Court, if a rape
alone, when committed by two or more persons, is penalized with death, it would
be highly illogical and irrational to hold that when such rape is committed
with the addition of a robbery, the offense should only be punishable with life
imprisonment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus the <u>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></u> prescribed by Article 294(2) of the Revised
Penal Code, for robbery with rape, must be understood as limited to cases where
there is a single rapist, and that in those cases where the rape on occasion of
the robbery is committed by two or more persons, the death penalty provided by
Republic Act No. 4111 must apply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
the more so because the crime was committed with the aggravating circumstances
of its being perpetrated in the dwelling of the complainant victims, and with
attendant ignominy, since the rapes were done in the presence of the woman's
husband.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the accused Mariano <span class="SpellE">Obtinalia</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Teoly</span> <span class="SpellE">Ubalde</span> alias Jorge <span class="SpellE">Ubalde</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Jimce</span> <span class="SpellE">Ubalde</span> are declared guilty of the crime of triple rape,
aggravated by the circumstances of commission in the dwelling of the victims
and ignominy; and each of them is sentenced to the penalty of death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused are also ordered, jointly and
severally, to pay the victims P230.00, value of the things stolen, as well as
to indemnify <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span> <span class="SpellE">Pitalbero</span>
in the sum of P5,000.00, and to pay the costs.</p>
