				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">From the order of the Court of First Instance of Rizal dismissing the 
information in Criminal Case No. 4926-P filed against defendant Carlos 
Magdaluyo, the Government has interposed this appeal.
<p>It appears on record that on November 7, 1958, defendant was found in 
possession of several decks of American playing cards, U.S. cigarettes, and 
bottles of assorted imported liquors with an estimated market value of 
P117,130.20. He was required by the Bureau of Internal Revenue to pay specific 
tax in the aggregate sum of P24,438.40, but he refused, alleging that he was not 
the owner of said articles. On December 4, 1958, the Deputy Commissioner of 
Internal Revenue recommended to the Pasay City Attorney, defendant's immediate 
criminal prosecution, for violation of Section 125, in relation to Sections 133, 
137, and 147 of the National Internal Revenue Code, penalized under Section 174 
of the same code.</p>
<p>While the case was pending investigation in the Pasay City Fiscal's Office, 
counsel for defendant addressed a letter dated January 137 1959 to the 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue, offering to compromise the case of his client, 
and agreeing to pay the full amount of the tax, subject to the following 
conditions: (1) that upon payment of the correspondinng specific tax, the 
commodities on which the tax was imposed should be returned to defendant; and 
(2) that the case pending in the Pasay City Attorney's Office be withdrawn, and 
defendant authorized to pay P500.00 as compromise penalty, in addition to the 
tax demanded.</p>
<p>On January 15, 1959, a conference attended by Atty. Simeon D. Paredes of the 
Law Division of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, Pasay City Attorney Francisco 
Salva, and defendant's counsel, was called in order to deliberate on defendant's 
offer of compromise. On the following day (January 16), the Acting Chief of the 
Law Division, Bureau of Internal Revenue, reported in a memorandum to the 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the following tentative agreement: (1) 
defendant would pay the specific tax of P24,438.40, plus the additional sum of 
P500.00, in extrajudicial settlement of his violation of Section 125 of the 
National Internal Revenue Code, in relation to Sections 133, 137, and 147 
thereof, which violation is penalized under Section 174 of the same Code; (2) 
upon payment of said sums, the Bureau of Internal Revenue would immediately 
withdraw its recommendation to the Pasay City Attorney, for the criminal 
prosecution of defendant; (3) the articles seized were to be forfeited in favor 
of the Government, notwithstanding the payment of the specific tax; and (4) when 
the articles seized are sold at public auction, defendant would be permitted to 
participate in the public bidding.</p>
<p>The Commissioner approved said compromise agreement, but increased the 
penalty from P500.00 to Pl,000.00. Approval of said agreement with the 
modification imposed by the Commissioner, which were accepted by defendant, is 
contained in a memorandum of January 16, 1959 (Annex I). The Pasay City Attorney 
was then advised by the Commissioner on January 22, 1959, of the agreement, who 
thereupon wrote a letter dated January 24, 1959 to the Commissioner, expressing 
his conformity to the compromise agreement, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Replying to your letter of January 22, 1959, asking (for) my comment on the 
proposed extra-judicial settlement of the liabilities of one Carlos Magdaluyo 
for the alleged violation of the provisions of Section 170 of the National 
Internal Revenue Code, I have the honor to inform that <i>this office, adopting 
your stand in accepting the offer of respondent to pay in full the specific 
taxes demanded on him in the total sum of</i> P24,438.40 <i>with the additional 
sum of</i> P1,000.00 <i>as compromise penalty, finds no objection in dismissing 
the case</i>.</p>
<p>"In view whereof, I am returning to you all the papers and documents you have 
submitted to this office in connection with the case aforesaid, <i>with the 
information that this case has been deemed closed and terminated."</i> 
(<i>Italics supplied.</i>)</p></blockquote>
<p>In view, however, of defendant's difficult financial situation, ho wrote a 
letter dated February 19, 1959 to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 
requesting permission to pay the obligation by installments, to which, said 
official agreed. Defendant paid P5,000.00 (O. R. No. A-09544) on February 16, 
1959, and P5,000.00 (O.R. No. A-095634) on March 16, 1959. On May 11, 1959, the 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue wrote the following letter to defendant's 
counsel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In further reference to the pending specific tax case of your client, Mr. 
Carlos Magdaluyo of 1768 Taft Avenue, Pasay City, involving the sum of 
P24,438.40, plus the additional sum of P1,000.00 as compromise penalty, I have 
the honor to draw your attention to the fact that to this date, only the amount 
of P10,000.00 has been paid, in spite of the representation you made to this 
Office that the same would be paid in the monthly installments of P5,000.00</p>
<p>"In view thereof, we request that you urge your client to pay the remaining 
balance of his specific tax liability in the total amount of P15,438.40 within 
ten (10) days from receipt hereof, in order that this case may be closed and 
terminated."</p></blockquote>
<p>Defendant, subsequently, made payments of P5,000.00 (OR No. A-517360) on May 
19, 1959, and P5,000.00 (OR No. A-516854) on July 7, 1959, bringing the total 
sum paid to P20,000.00 As defendant failed to pay in full his tax obligation and 
compromise penalty of P1,000.00, Pasay Assistant City Attorney Antonio Paredes 
filed with the above-mentioned court, on August 10, 1959, the following 
information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That on or about the 7th day of November, 1958, in Pasay City, Philippines, 
and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, 
Carlos Magdaluyo, with deliberate intent to evade, deceive and defraud the 
government of taxes due from him, possess and have under his custody and control 
in his house, known as 1786 Taft Avenue, this City the following items, to 
wit:</p>
<ol><li>1,185 decks of American Playing Cards, 
</li><li>4,100 packages of Assorted U.S. Cigarettes, 
</li><li>364 bottles of assorted liquor (cased and uncased.) </li></ol>
<p>with an estimated market value of P117,130.20 and which are subject to 
specific taxes In the amount of P24,438.40, did then and there wilfully, 
unlawfully, and feloniously and notwithstanding repeated demands fail and 
refused to pay the aforesaid specific tax in the amount of P24,438.40, due from 
him, to the damage and prejudice of the government in the aforestated amount of 
P24,438.40."</p></blockquote>
<p>One week after the filing of said information, i.e., on August 17, 1959, 
defendant paid the Bureau of Internal Revenue the balance of the specific tax in 
the sum of P4,438.40, as well as the compromise penalty in the sum of P1,000.00 
(a total of P5,438.40) under O.R. No. A-724051.</p>
<p>In view of said full payment of the specific tax and the compromise penalty, 
the Deputy Commissioner of Internal Revenue, on August 25, 1959, wrote a letter 
to the Pasay City Attorney, which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I have the honor to inform you that Mr. Carlos Magdaluyo of 1786 Taft 
Avenue, Pasay City, whose criminal prosecution for violation of sections 133, 
137, and 147, all penalized under section 174 of the National Internal Revenue 
Code, was recommended to that office on December 4, 1958, <i>has already paid in 
full his specific tax liability in the total sum of P24,438.40.</i> Mr. 
Magdaluyo <i>has, likewise, paid the additional sum of P1,000.00</i> as 
<i>compromise penalty in extrajudicial settlement of his criminal liability 
arising from his aforesaid violation.</i></p>
<p>"<i>In view thereof, this Office will interpose no objection to the 
withdrawal of the criminal case instituted against Mr. Magdaluyo</i>." (Italics 
supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>As the Assistant City Attorney was not agreeable to the withdrawal of the 
information, defendant, on September 16, 1959, filed a motion to quash the same, 
on the ground that "the criminal liability of the accused has been extinguished" 
by his full payment on August 17, 1959, of the tax liability and penalty 
pursuant to the compromise agreement with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue 
and consented to originally by the City Attorney of Pasay. To this motion, the 
Assistant City Attorney filed an opposition. On October 5, 1959, the court 
dismissed the case, in an order of this tenor:</p>
<p align="center">"ORDER</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Acting upon the motions to quash dated September 16, 1959, and September 29, 
1959, and the opposition thereto, and it appearing that the Commissioner of 
Internal Revenue has agreed to compromise this case (Annex I) and that the City 
Fiscal, upon being advised thereof on November 24, 1958, has expressed his 
conformity to the compromise agreement (Annex I), and it appearing further that 
the accused has fully paid already the amount of P24,438.40 mentioned in the 
compromise agreement,</p>
<p>"As prayed for, this case is hereby dismissed with costs <i>de oficio</i>. 
The bond filed by the accused for his provisional release is hereby ordered 
cancelled.</p>
<p>"So ordered."</p></blockquote>
<p>Dissatisfied with said order, the Government (through the Solicitor General) 
interposed this appeal.</p>
<p>The Solicitor General contends that the trial court erred in dismissing the 
case. It is urged that since the information charging defendant with the offense 
in question was filed prior to his (defendant's) full payment of the tax 
liability and teempromise penalty, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue lost the 
authority to compromise<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> the criminal 
aspect of the tax case.</p>
<p>We find no merit in the contention. The argument might be correct, had no 
compromise agreement been entered into between defendant and the Commissioner, 
with the knowledge of and concurrence by the Pasay City Fiscal, prior to the 
filing of the information (on August 17, 1959) or that there was non-compliance 
with the compromise agreement. The records disclose that the Commissioner of 
Internal Revenue has agreed to compromise the case (see memorandum Annex I), and 
that the Pasay City Fiscal, upon being advised thereof has expressed his 
conformity to the agreement, considering the case aa "closed and terminated". 
(See letter quoted above, dated January 24, 1959, or 7 months prior to the 
filing of the information on August 10, 1959).</p>
<p>Nor is there non-compliance with the compromise agreement which set no 
specific date within which defendant must fully pay the tax and penalty. In 
fact, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue agreed to the payment of said tax and 
penalty in installments (See letter of the Commissioner, Annex "L"), and 
defendant appears to have made payment as follows: P5,000.00 on February 16, 
1959, P5,000.00 on March 16, 1959, P5,000.00 on May 19, 1959, P5,000.00 on July 
7, 1959, and P5,438.40, on August 17, 1959.</p>
<p>The case of Rovero <i>vs</i>. Amparo, et al. 91 Phil., 228 cited by the 
Solicitor General is not applicable to the instant case. We there held that the 
Commissioner of Customs may not, under Article 1369 of the Revised 
Administrative Code, compromise <i>decided</i> cases; in the instant case, the 
compromise was agreed upon prior to the filing of the information U.S. 
<i>vs</i>. Chua Puete and Que Ung Bo (22 Phil., 327) is also not in point, for 
it involves an offer of compromise which was <i>rejected</i> by the Collector of 
Internal Revenue and not approved or accepted by the Secretary of Finance; in 
the instant case, defendant's offer of compromise was duly <i>approved</i> by 
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and concurred in by the City Fiscal. Morris 
<i>vs</i>. U.S. (123 F. 2d. 957) is irrelevant, as it refers to an offer of 
compromise made <i>after</i> the complaint was filed; here the compromise 
agreement was entered into, as already stated, long <i>prior</i> to the filing 
of the information against defendant. Finally, Section 9, Rule 123 of the Rules 
of Court is inapplicable because it has reference to criminal cases not allowed 
by law to be compromised; the instant case involves a tax case, which the law 
(Sec. 309 of the Tax Code) expressly allows to be compromised.</p>
<p>Wherefore, finding no error in the order appealed from, the same is hereby 
affirmed in all respects, without pronouncement as to costs. So 
ordered.</p><i>Bengzon, Acting C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, 
Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L.,</i> and <i>Dizon, JJ.,</i> concur. <br><br><br>
