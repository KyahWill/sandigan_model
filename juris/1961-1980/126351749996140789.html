<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition for review would assail the validity of a decision of
respondent Director of Patents granting the application of respondent Far
Eastern Shirt Factory to register a trademark and dismissing the opposition of
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> <span class="SpellE">Boc</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The grounds relied upon are its lack of
support in the substantial evidence of record and its failure to conform to the
applicable law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner in pressing
his opposition before respondent Director of Patents had to surmount the
obstacle posed by a decision of this Court in <span class="SpellE">Asari</span>
Yoko Co. Ltd. v. <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> <span class="SpellE">Boc</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
which rightfully could be not ignored by respondent Director because of its
relevance and pertinence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
petitioner is now faced with the extremely difficult task of showing that there
was no support for the decision reached in the substantial evidence of
record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He does not quite succeed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, he cannot prevail.</p>

<p class="BODY">An extended reference to the decision assailed would make
apparent the difficulty that faced petitioner in seeking its reversal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its opening paragraph reads thus: "An
application to register the trademark RACE, used on men's undershirts and
shirts, under class 40, was filed on April 16, 1962 by Far Eastern Shirt
Factory, a partnership duly organized under Philippine Laws, with business
address at 513 <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> St., Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Claim of first use since the year 1949 is
asserted by the applicant."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Then came the portion referring to the opposition filed by now petitioner <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> <span class="SpellE">Boc</span> alleging that he would be
damaged by such registration as he has in his favor a certificate of
registration on the trademark SUN RAYS issued by the Philippine Patent Office
on <st1:date year="1961" day="3" month="8">August 3, 1961</st1:date> covering
the same class of goods, namely, men's undershirts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was moreover "confusingly
similar" to the trademark RACE, the closeness of their identity in
appearance and pronunciation being quite marked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mention was then made in the opposition that
his trademark is well-known all over the Philippines and that applicant, now
respondent Far Eastern Shirt Factory, with prior knowledge thereof, deliberately
designed its own mark to bring about the confusion and to take advantage of the
fame, reputation and goodwill theretofore established by it at a tremendous
cost through advertising and by the superior quality of its product.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After noting that the records of the case, consisting of the application,
the opposition, the pleadings and the respective evidence, had been carefully
considered and that the issue raised for the damage that would be caused <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>, now petitioner <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> <span class="SpellE">Boc</span>, the appealed decision went on to state: "Upon
careful evaluation of the record, I agree with the <span class="SpellE">opposer</span>
that RACE and SUN RAYS are confusingly similar and I have arrived at a finding
that likelihood of confusion would occur.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In appearance and sound, the overall commercial impression likely to be
conveyed to the public is that of a speed or running competition, as it has
been found that both parties are claiming to be using in relation to their
respective trademarks male runners in the act of racing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This circumstance, I believe, is sufficient
to effect likelihood of confusion as to source or origin of the goods."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Reference was then made to the antecedents, including our previously cited
decision of <span class="SpellE">Asari</span> Yoko Co., Ltd. v. <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> <span class="SpellE">Boc</span>. Thus: "The facts,
however, show that on <st1:date year="1961" day="20" month="1">January 20, 1961</st1:date>
the Supreme Court promulgated a decision in G. R. No. L-14086 entitled '<span class="SpellE">Asari</span> Yoko Co., Ltd. vs. <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> <span class="SpellE">Boc</span>, et al.,' wherein it was decided that <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> <span class="SpellE">Boc</span> who is the same party to
the present case was adjudged not entitled to the registration of the trademark
RACE and design as used by him on shirts and undershirts which he sought to
register in this Office on August 27, 1953. In that decision the trademark was
found to be owned by <span class="SpellE">Asari</span> Yoko Co., Ltd., a
partnership duly organized in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
* * * The record also shows that <span class="SpellE">Asari</span> Yoko Ltd.
executed a power of attorney in favor of Go <span class="SpellE">Seng</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>, a Chinese citizen residing in Manila, authorizing the
latter to sell, assign, convey, and dispose of all the rights, title and
interest as well as the ownership over the trademark RACE and design (representation
of 3 men running a race) including the right to register the mark in the
Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record further shows
that Go <span class="SpellE">Seng</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span> executed
in favor of the Far Eastern Shirt Factory a Deed of Assignment of the mark in
March, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of the assignment,
the Respondent-Applicant filed the application for registration now being
opposed."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This is the way respondent Director would appraise the matter
before him: "Therefore, as between the two confusingly similar trademarks,
RACE was already in use long before the <span class="SpellE">opposer</span>
adopted his trademark SUN RAYS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such
case it is the Respondent-Applicant who would be damaged by the registration of
SUN RAYS as it has acquired, as a successor in interest, proprietary rights
over the mark RACE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Kee</span>
<span class="SpellE">Boc's</span> claim that he would be damaged by registration
thereof will not, for the foregoing; reason, prevail."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
This is the conclusion arrived at: "The result of the foregoing
pronouncements and findings would be that inasmuch as the two trademarks are
confusingly similar and since it is the Respondent-Applicant who would be
damaged, the trademark SUN RAYS becomes <span class="SpellE">unregisterable</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But notwithstanding thereof, the registration
certificate of <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> <span class="SpellE">Boc</span>
cannot <u>ipso</u> <u>facto</u> be ordered cancelled in this opposition proceeding,
and in similar cases the filing of a petition to cancel is still
necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Respondent-Applicant has
actually filed the said petition (Inter <span class="SpellE">Partes</span> Case
No 364) which is now pending in this Office."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
It was his decision, therefore, to dismiss the opposition of now petitioner <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> <span class="SpellE">Boc</span> and to grant the
application of now respondent Far Eastern Shirt Factory.</p>

<p class="BODY">We sustain, as noted at the outset, respondent Director of
Patents.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->In the decision now under review, respondent
Director of Patents made reference to our decision in <span class="SpellE">Asari</span>
Yoko Co., Ltd. v. <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> <span class="SpellE">Boc</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
In that case, now petitioner <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> <span class="SpellE">Boc</span>
asserted that he first used the trademark RACE.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Director of Patents agreed with his contention, but this Court
reversed the decision holding that <span class="SpellE">Asari</span> Yoko Co.,
Ltd. "was the first user of the trademark in question in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
[and therefore] will be damaged by the registration of the trademark in the
name of [<span class="SpellE">Kee</span> <span class="SpellE">Boc</span>]."
Thereafter, as noted likewise in the decision of respondent Director of Patents,
a power of attorney was executed by <span class="SpellE">Asari</span> Yoko Co.,
Ltd. in favor of one Go <span class="SpellE">Seng</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>,
from whom now respondent Far Eastern Shirt Factory acquired, through a deed of
assignment executed on March 2, 1962, the right to such trademark RACE, after
which the present application for registration was filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that in the meanwhile, on <st1:date year="1961" day="3" month="8">August 3, 1961</st1:date>, a registration of the
trademark SUN RAYS was effected by now petitioner <span class="SpellE">Kee</span>
<span class="SpellE">Boc</span>, both trademarks being found to be confusingly
similar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it were not for the above
background facts that would indicate the persistent and tenacious efforts on
the part of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> <span class="SpellE">Boc</span>
to deprive <span class="SpellE">Asari</span> Yoko Co., Ltd., formerly, and now
respondent Far Eastern Shirt Factory of whatever advantages might inhere in the
use of the trademark raised, then perhaps his stand would have been impressed
with a greater degree of plausibility.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As it is however, considering that he was a party to a litigation where
this Court had recognized the right of the predecessor-in-interest of
respondent Far Eastern Shirt Factory to the use of such trademark, it would
seem that under an expansive view of the principle of the law of the case,
petitioner is not to be indulged insofar as his opposition would result in
diluting the effectiveness of the aforesaid decision rendered by us where he
himself was a party.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The petition for <i style="">certiorari</i> was premised primarily on the decision of the Director
of Patents lacking support in the substantial evidence of record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> <span class="SpellE">Boc</span> did try to make out a case of the appealed decision
being thus marked by such infirmity, but his attempt does not carry enough
persuasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not because the brief
submitted was lacking in vigor and vehemence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The inherent difficulties of the situation, however, were too much to
overcome.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one thing, as above made
clear, there was this previous decision rendered by us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, too, respondent Director of Patents saw
to it that only the most relevant facts necessary to his decision were duly
considered and set forth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
there was the agreement by the parties that the oral testimony would consist
solely of the transcript of stenographic notes in a case then pending between
the parties before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Of the eleven errors assigned, the first two, which would
predicate an injury to the rights of <span class="SpellE">Kojiro</span> <span class="SpellE">Asari</span> and <span class="SpellE">Asari</span> Yoko Co., Ltd.,
the winning parties in our 1961 decision, ought rather to have been asserted by
them and not by petitioner against respondent Far Eastern Shirt Factory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of such complaint on their
part, no further consideration is necessary to dispose of the above assignment
of errors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The seventh and eighth
assignment of errors which would find fault for respondent Director of Patents,
for not including certain matters in the decision under review, would not
impair the validity of the decision rendered, as the discretion of respondent
Director to seize upon what he considered the determinative facts is not shown
to have been abused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, on those facts
as found by him, respondent Far Eastern Shirt Factory was entitled to a
favorable verdict.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is nothing, likewise, in the decision, as alleged in the
fourth assignment of error, that respondent Far Eastern Shirt Factory was held
as being entitled to sue for past infringement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The only thing decided was to give due course to the application for
registration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor was there any
sufficient showing that the other alleged errors were in fact committed;
petitioner could not specify from the evidence, whether oral or documentary,
properly before respondent Director of Patents for appraisal, the asserted
deficiency of the decision under review.</p>

<p class="BODY">It might be useful to single out the third assignment of error
because of the allegation therein made that no mention was made of the goodwill
in the deed of assignment executed by Go <span class="SpellE">Seng</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>, as attorney-in-fact of <span class="SpellE">Asari</span>
Yoko Co., Ltd. and respondent Far Eastern Shirt Factory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is clearly a misapprehension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is how such deed of assignment reads:
"Be it known that for and in consideration of the sum of [Twenty thousand
pesos] (P20, 000.00) and other good and valuable consideration to it in hand
paid, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the said <span class="SpellE">Asari</span>
Yoko Co., Ltd., represented by its above-named attorney-in-fact, Mr. Go <span class="SpellE">Seng</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>, by these presents,
does sell, assign and transfer unto the said Far Eastern Shirt Factory, its
entire right, title and interest in and to the said trademark "RACE"
and Design (Representation of 3 men running a race) and the registration
thereof in the Philippines Patent Office, together with the goodwill of the
business in connection with which the said trademark is used."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
It would be futile, then, to maintain, as is done in the eleventh assignment of
error, that the application for registration of respondent Far Eastern Shirt
Factory ought not to have been given due course.</p>

<p class="BODY">The legal principle decisive of this controversy is set forth by
us in Lim <span class="SpellE">Kiah</span> v. The <span class="SpellE">Kaynee</span>
Company.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus: "It is well-settled that we are precluded from making such an
inquiry as the finding of facts of the Director of Patents in the absence of
any showing that there was a grave abuse of discretion is binding on us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As set forth by Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>
in Chung Te v. Ng Klan <span class="SpellE">Giab</span>: 'The rule is that the
findings of fact by the Director of Patents are conclusive on the Supreme Court
provided they are supported by substantial evidence.’"<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is likewise the view of this Court that respondent Director of
Patents should proceed to act with dispatch and resolve Inter <span class="SpellE">Partes</span> Case No. 364, guided by and in accordance with this
decision.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Director of Patents of <st1:date year="1966" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1966</st1:date> is affirmed. With
