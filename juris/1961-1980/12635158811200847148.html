				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by certiorari from the decision of the Court of Appeals in
G.R. L-22378, affirming the one rendered by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Lipa</span> City in its Special Proceedings No. 610.</p>

<p class="BODY">The proceedings for the summary settlement of the intestate
estate of the late <span class="SpellE">Ciriaca</span> Angelo, who died sometime
in the year 1930 in the municipality of Rosario, province of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, were commenced by Rosario <span class="SpellE">Novero</span>
who claimed to be an illegitimate child of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Victo­rino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fortus</span> (<span class="SpellE">Ciriaca's</span>
grandson), born on April 4, 1922 out of <span class="SpellE">Victorino's</span>
alleged illicit relations with Patricia <span class="SpellE">Novero</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her claim was opposed, on the one hand, by
Julie T. <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span>, the surviving widow of <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span>, and on the other, by <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Faustina</span>, <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pio</span>, <span class="SpellE">De­metria</span>, Francisca and Roman, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span>, here­inafter referred to as the <span class="SpellE">Fortuses</span>,
who claimed to behalf brothers and sisters of said deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the required notice by publication and
subsequent trial the aforesaid Court of First Instance rendered judgment as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered dismissing the claims
of petitioner and the <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span> brothers and sisters to
succeed to the estate left by <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span>, and declaring Julia T. <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span>
as the sole heir and the abso­lute owner of all the properties left by <span class="SpellE">Vic­torino</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Julia T. <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span> is
hereby or­dered to reimburse <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> Gonzales the amount of P1<span class="GramE">,303.04</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to cost is hereby
made."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Rosario <span class="SpellE">Novero</span> and the <span class="SpellE">Fortuses</span> appealed to the Court of Appeals who in due time
rendered the appealed decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the
first did not appeal, said decision must now be deemed final, as far as she is
concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Fortuses</span>,
however, interposed the present appeal by certiorari and urge <span class="GramE">Us</span> to reverse the appealed decision claiming that the Court
of Appeals committed the following errors:</p>

<blockquote>"The trial court erred in finding that petitioners' parents, <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ja­coba</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguil</span>, were not legally
married:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(1) By holding that the legal presump­tion of marriage was overcome
by Exhibit 5 and by the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Barbosa</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) By construing the certification Exhibit 5 without reference to
Act No. 3022 and the explanatory testimony of David de Jesus, Jr. of the Bureau
of Public Libraries;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) By holding that Exhibits 2, 4, 9-B and 9-C did not constitute a
proof of marriage between <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Jacoba</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguil</span>, much less
a proof of the legitimacy of the <span class="SpellE">oppo­sitors</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortuses</span>; and</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">(4) By not applying the law and applicable
decisions of the Supreme Court to the undisputed facts of the case."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The above assignment of errors make it
obvious that the only issue involved in this appeal is one of fact: whether or
not <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jacoba</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguil</span> were legally
married.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, at page 8 (last
paragraph) of their brief the <span class="SpellE">Fortuses</span> openly admit
that "the <span style="color: windowtext;">sole question in this case"
is "whether petitioners’ mother, <span class="SpellE">Jacoba</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguil</span>, was legally married to <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fortus</span>".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeals’ (1) holding that the legal presumption of marriage
was overcome by Exhibit 5 and by the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>
<span class="SpellE">Barbosa</span>"; (2) said court's "construing the
certification Ex­hibit 5 without reference to Act No. 3022 and the explanatory
testimony of David de Jesus, Jr., of the Bureau of Public Libraries"; (3)
its "Holding that Exhibits 2, 4, 9-B and 9-C did not constitute a proof of
marriage between <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Jacoba</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguil</span>, much less
a proof of the legitimacy of the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortuses</span>" involve nothing more than evaluation of
evidence and are but the reasons that led said court to declare <u>as a fact</u>
that <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jacoba</span> were
never married.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evaluation made by
the Court of all or part of the evidence of record; its finding of fact - that
the persons just named were never legally married -, even if wrong, may not now
be reviewed by Us, the present being an appeal by certiorari.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have held in a long line of cases that in
appeals of this nature <span class="GramE">We</span> pass upon and decide only
questions of law (Cabrera vs. Lopez, 84 Phil. 834-5; Pacheco vs. <span class="SpellE">Arro</span>, 85 Phil. 505-15; <span class="SpellE">Celesto</span>

assignment of error submitted by the appellants in their brief argued ‘for the
suffi­ciency of plaintiffs-appellants’ evi<span style="font-size: 12pt; color: windowtext;">dence as a fair and reasonable basis for resting a finding
that the do­nation in question is <span class="SpellE">inofficious</span>’.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear, therefore, that the only issue
submitted to <span class="GramE">said</span> court, and by it decided, was purely
one of fact.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Our review should be confined to the facts and circumstances found
by the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And we agree
that such facts and circumstances in this case do not sustain the theory <span style="color: windowtext;">of the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed it is serious­ly to be doubted whether we could reverse the
conclusion of the appellate court <u>to the effect that those facts and circumstances
are not 'enough evidence' to show clearly and beyond doubt that the parties
intended the contract to be a mortgage instead of a conditional con­veyance</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That conclusion is obviously ONE OF FACT, not
a bit different from the verdict of a jury in a murder trial that the
circumstantial evidence pre­sented by the prosecution has proved, or has not
proved that the accused had killed the deceased.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">'In disputes of this nature, the pivotal inquiry is: Do the
circumstan­ces show beyond doubt that the parties made a contract different
from the express terms of the document they signed? Is the evidence clear, con­vincing
and satisfactory that the deal was a mortgage instead of a sale with <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span><u> de retro</u>? <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Cuyugan</span> v. </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Santos</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE"> 34 Phil. 100; <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> v.

the question must be deemed <u>factual</u> for the Appeals' Court to solve.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">'In the United States where ques­tions of law are for the jury, it
is held that if the question whether a given transaction amounts to a
conditional sale or mere mortgage depends upon written instruments alone, it is
<span style="color: windowtext;">a question for the court; but if extra­neous
evidence is required or received for the purpose of ascertaining the real
intention of the parties, the question is for the jury (41 C.J. 361 citing many
cases, particularly <span class="SpellE">Bogk</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Gasset</span>,
149 U.S. 17, Howard v. <span class="SpellE">Kopperl</span>, 74 Tex. 194; 5 SW 627

<p class="2Q">'But the trial court did not merely dismiss the complaint,
proceeded to re­ceive evidence on the counterclaim of defendants.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this respect the trial court said ‘With
respect to the counter­claim alleged in the amended answer of the said
defendants, the preponderance <span style="font-size: 12pt; color: windowtext;">of
evidence discloses that the imputations contained in the complaint that the
late <span class="SpellE">EscoIastico</span> G. Chicano, husband of <span class="SpellE">Coleta</span> de Chicano and father of <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span>
Chicano had acquired the land in question from the plaintiffs through fraud and
that the said defendants ‘taking advantage of the igno­rance of the plaintiffs

moral damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">‘Considering that <u>the foregoing finding is a question of fact
which involves an evaluation of the evidence</u> and the same is now assigned
as error, we are of the opinion that this case comes within the appellate
jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals.'"</p>

<p class="BODY">We have also held, however, that, in extreme cases calling for
the exercise of our supervisory jurisdiction, We may disturb or reverse any
particular finding of fact of the Court of Appeals should We find it to be
arbitrary or whimsical or entirely outside the issues raised by the parties in
their respective pleadings.</p>

<p class="BODY">In De Luna vs. <span class="SpellE">Linatoc</span> 74 Phil. 15,
answering our own question: "When may the Supreme Court review such
deduction of fact based on <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span> or plain
evidence?<span class="GramE">",</span> We said:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">Only</span> when reasonable men readily
agree that the inference is mani­festly mistaken, absurd or impossible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If however, fair-minded men may differ on
whether or not the main conclusion of fact is rightly <span style="font-size: 12pt; color: windowtext;">drawn from the undisputed evidence, the Supreme Court
should not, as a rule, in­quire into the discretion exercised by the Court of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The instant case is of the
latter category, because the findings of the Court of Appeals that there has
been no deceit may or may not be persuasive, according to one's own reasoning
after reading the decision and resolution of that Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be said that <span class="SpellE">fairminded</span>
men will not differ in this case on the existence of fraud."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Then, in Evangelista vs. Alto Surety and Insurance Co., Inc.,
speaking through the present Chief Justice, We said:</p>

<blockquote>"Considering, therefore, that neither the pleadings, nor the briefs
in the Court of Appeals, raised an issue on whether or not copies of the writ
of attachment and notice of attachment had been served upon Rivera; that the
defendants had impliedly admitted - in said pleadings and briefs, as well as by
their conduct during the entire proceedings, prior to the rendition of the
decision of the Court of Appeals - that Rivera had received copies of said
documents; and that, for this reason, evidently, no proof was introduced there­on,
we are of the opinion, and so hold that the finding of the Court of Appeals to
the effect that said copies had not been served upon Rivera is based upon a
misapprehension of the specific issues involved therein and goes beyond the
range of such issues, apart from being contrary to the aforementioned admission
by the parties, and that, accord­ingly, a grave abuse of discretion was com­mitted
in making said finding, which is, furthermore, inaccurate."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In connection with all the foregoing, the following facts are
either undisputed or fully borne by the evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Ciriaca</span> Angelo was the owner of the
parcel of land located in barrio <span class="SpellE">Alpaye</span>, Rosario, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, with an area of approximately 20,102 <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">sq.m</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span>
subject of the petition for summary settlement mentioned at the beginning of
this decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was registered in her
name under Original Certificate of Title No. 370.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had only one child, a daughter by the
name of <span class="SpellE">Crisanta</span> <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span>,
married to <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This couple had an only son, the deceased <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Crisanta</span> <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span> <u>predeceased</u> her mother, <span class="SpellE">Ciriaca</span>
Angelo, who died intestate sometime in the year 1930, the property aforesaid
passed on to <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span>
as the lone surviving heir of his grandmother.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is a fact, however, that he never caused the original certificate of
title covering the property to be cancelled and to have another issued in his
name.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span> and Julia T. <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span> were
husband and wife and that up to <span class="SpellE">Victorino's</span> death on <st1:date year="1954" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1954</st1:date> they were
childless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is simi­larly admitted that
at the time of his death, <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> had been
estranged from his wife for a number of years and had been living <span class="SpellE">maritally</span> with another woman named <span class="SpellE">Feli­cidad</span>
Gonzales <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Out of this illicit relation, how­ever, no issue was begotten.</p>

<p class="BODY">That the property is now covered by transfer cer­tificate of
title No. 6831 issued by the Registrar of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>
is due to the fact that upon <span class="SpellE">Victorino's</span> death, his
widow, Julia T. <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span>, executed the required
affidavit of extra-judicial summary settlement and had it registered in
accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By reason thereof,
original certificate of title No. 370 was cancelled and the transfer
certificate of title already referred to was issued in Julia's name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, the <span class="SpellE">Fortuses</span>
(page 7 of <span class="GramE">the their</span> brief) make the claim that in her
affidavit in connection with the extra-judicial settlement of the estate of <span class="SpellE">Ciriaca</span> Angelo, Julia had "falsely re­presented the
original owner <span class="SpellE">Ciriaca</span> Angelo to be her
grandmother." While this alleged falsehood is unsubstan­tial, <span class="GramE">We</span> venture the observation that Julia's statement contained
no real falsehood, for, indeed, <span class="SpellE">Ciriaca</span> was the
grandmother of her husband and therefore her own grand-mother-in-law.</p>

<p class="BODY">As Rosario <span class="SpellE">Novero</span> did not appeal from
the decision of the Court of Appeals, it is now proper to say something only
about the claim of the <span class="SpellE">Fortuses</span> - that they are <span class="SpellE">Vic­torino's</span> legitimate half-brothers and sisters, being
the legitimate children of <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span>
(father of <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span>) and <span class="SpellE">Jacoba</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aguil</span> who were allegedly married sometime between
1902 and 1905 before <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Bolaños</span>,
at that time justice of the peace of the municipality of Rosario, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As correctly held by the court of origin (Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Lipa</span> City) it was incumbent upon the <span class="SpellE">Fortuses</span> to prove their affirmative allegations that <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jacoba</span> were legally
married and that they, the <span class="SpellE">Fortuses</span>, are their
legitimate children.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the record, the presentation of the evidence of the
parties began before Judge <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> Vasquez; was later
continued before Judge Luis B. Reyes; and when both were transferred to other
judicial districts the hearings were continued before Judge <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span>
S. <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span>, who penned the decision of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These circumstances are here stated to show
that Judge <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span> cannot be said to have rendered his
decision relying only upon the <u>transcript</u> of the testimonial evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with the vital question of fact involved, His
Honor’s decision says:</p>

<blockquote>"Are the <span class="SpellE">Fortuses</span> legitimate
half-brothers and sisters of <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span>? The property involved in this proceeding came from <span class="SpellE">Ciriaca</span> Angelo, and passed to <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fortus</span> through his mother <span class="SpellE">Crisanta</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span>, daughter of the former.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Fortuses</span>
brothers and sisters are children of <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span>, father of <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span>, and a certain woman by the name of <span class="SpellE">Ja­coba</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguil</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Fortuses</span>
maintained that the petitioner not being an illegitimate daughter of <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span>, they are
entitled to inherit the one-half portion of the property left by their deceased
brother, <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their right is based upon their assertion
that their father <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Jacoba</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguil</span> were legal­ly
married.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The <span class="SpellE">Fortuses</span> brothers and sisters
failed to present a valid document of marriage between <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fortus</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jacoba</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguil</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They maintained
that it was lost during the last global war.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In many cases it has been observed by this Court that a party who is
claiming a right by virtue of a document usually finds it convenient to allege
that the said document was lost during the last global war, when in fact and in
truth <span style="">there was no such document.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The instant case is one of the many cases
wherein <span class="GramE">a party allege</span> to have lost a document which
never existed.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Attempts were made by the <span class="SpellE">Fortuses</span>
brothers to lay the basis for the intro­duction of <span class="GramE">a
secondary</span> evidence as to the existence of a marriage contract and/or
celebration thereof, but said evidence did not satisfy the requisites required
by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 51, Rule 123 of the
Rules of Court, provides that when the original writing has been lost or
destroyed, upon proof of its execution and loss or destruction, its contents
may be proved by a copy or by a recital of its contents in some authentic
document, or by collection of witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The question at issue now is, were the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fortuses</span> able to prove the due execution of the
alleged marriage contract between <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jacoba</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguil</span> or to present satisfactory secondary evidence to that
effect.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Considering the nature of the issues before it, the Court of
Appeals made a thorough review of the evi­dence in the light of the respective
contentions of the parties, and thereafter said the following:</p>

<blockquote>"The <span class="SpellE">Fortuses</span> brothers and sisters,
who are one of the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> in this case, claimed
that they were all the legitimate half-brothers and sisters of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span> as they were the
legitimate children of <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span>
- who is also the father of <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span> - and <span class="SpellE">Jacoba</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguil</span> who were legally married between 1902 and 1905 before

Justice of the Peace in the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> of Rosario, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, in the house of Victoriana <span class="SpellE">Guerro</span>;
that after the solem­nization of the marriage the couple was issued marriage
contract but the same was burned dur­ing the Japanese occupation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this purpose, to prove the existence of
marriage between <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Jacoba</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguil</span> as well as
the unavailability of the record of births of their children - the <span class="SpellE">Fortuses</span> - a certi­fication to the effect that all pre-war
public documents in the municipality of Rosario, <span class="SpellE">Ba­tangas</span>,
were burned (Exhibit 7) was offered as evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, these <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
tried to establish by secondary evidence - the weight and credence of which we
shall discuss later on - the existence of the marriage between <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jacoba</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguil</span> whom they alleged
lived together as husband and wife for almost 30 years and were never separated
during their marital union."</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"We now come to the <span class="SpellE">Fortuses</span>
brothers and sisters who all claim to be the half-brothers and sisters of <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There seam to be no dispute on the evidence
on record that the <span class="SpellE">Fortuses</span> were the children of <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jacoba</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguil</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only question to be passed upon in this
instance is whether or not the spouses <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jacoba</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguil</span> were legally married to entitle their children to <span class="SpellE">successional</span> rights and inherit from their alleged brother <span class="SpellE">Vic­torino</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is so because Article 992 of the New
Civil Code provides that an illegitimate child has no right to inherit <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>intestato</u></span> from
the legitimate children and relative of his father and mother nor such children
or relative inherit in the same manner from the illegitimate children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Fortuses</span>
maintained that their parents were legally married, but that the marriage
certificate issued to <span class="GramE">said</span> couple was burned during
the second global war.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, they tried
to establish by secondary evidence the existence of said marriage contract or
the solemnization of said marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
this instance the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortuses</span>
invoked that since for the past 30 years their parents had deported themselves
in public as husband and wife and had been living under the same roof, the
legal presumption is that they had entered into a lawful marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This presumption, however, is only applicable
where there is no clear and concrete evidence showing otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case, however, there is a certificate
from the Division of Archives (Exhibit '5') to the effect that 'no copy of the
marriage record of spouses <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Jacoba</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguil</span> supposed
to have been solemnized in the year 1902 and 1905 in the Municipality of
Rosario, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> had been received by said office
for file’, and this certifi­cation is further strengthened by the affirmation
of <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Barbosa</span>, a
clerk in the office of the municipal treasurer of Rosario, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>,
that there was no record of such marriage supposedly contracted between the
spouses <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jacoba</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguil</span> from 1902 and 1922
of the Municipality of<i> </i>Rosario, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such being the case, if it were true that the
parents of the <span class="SpellE">Fortuses</span> contracted marriage sometime
in the year 1902 to 1905 said marriage should have been<b><i><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></i></b>recorded and a copy thereof should
have been filed either in the Civil Registrar's Office of said<b><i><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></i></b>municipality or in<b><i><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></i></b>our Archives Division where public
records are officially kept intact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is true that <span class="SpellE">Jacoba</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguil</span>
on the witness stand categorically stated that they were legally married be­fore
<span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Beleños</span>, who was
then the Justice of the Peace of <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> Rosario, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, in the house of <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Guerro</span>; that during the solemnization of the
marriage, they were even required to raise their hands after <span class="SpellE">Jacoba</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguil</span> was required to <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> only once the marriage contract; and that after
the solemnization of the marriage, a marriage contract was issued in their
favor but which unfortunately was burned during the Japanese occupation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In corroboration to the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Jacoba</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguil</span> who resolutely
averred her marriage with her husband, a deposition of Victoriana <span class="SpellE">Guerro</span> was presented.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We find, however, the versions of <span class="SpellE">Jacoba</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguil</span> and <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Guerro</span> to be replete of inconsistencies and improbabili­ties
after painstakingly examining their entire testimonies and/or versions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is noteworthy to observe that at the time
when said spouses allegedly contracted marriage, the law which was then in
force to those who would contract marriage was General Orders No.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>68.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under this law, <span class="GramE">neither the contracting parties,
witnesses or</span> <span class="SpellE">padrinos</span> were required to sign
the marriage contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the law
required then was only for the father to sign a form giving his con­sent to his
son or his daughter of minor age to the contract of marriage, as to the proof
of the celebration of marriage, no marriage certificate was issued to the
contracting par­ties,<b><i><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></i></b>but
merely a certification of the Parish Priest or Justice of the Peace or Judge,
containing the full names of the parties, their residence, ages, and the
consent of the father and mother or guardian, attesting to the ce­lebration of
marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, there­fore, the
formalities mentioned by <span class="SpellE">Jacoba</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguil</span>
as well as her witness Victoriana Guerra were the formalities required under
the present law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And for this matter, it
is clear that the pretension of <span class="SpellE">Jacoba</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguil</span> as to the existence of her marriage with <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span> is highly
improbable and in­credible, which do not deserve even a scant
consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Analyzing further the cre­dibility
of <span class="SpellE">Jacoba</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguil</span>, the lower
court had keenly observed that-</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'She could not even remember on what part of the marriage contract

3753 which took effect on February 26, 1921, Roman <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span>
was born on February 28, 1922, long before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of the subsequent law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even assuming
that Act No. 3753 is applicable to Roman <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span>, it
was only a prima facie proof which <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> Julia T.
<span class="SpellE">Fortus</span> had overcome by satisfactory evidence to the
effect that <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Ja­coba</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguil</span> were
never married and hence all of their children are not legi­timate brothers or
half brothers and therefore have no right to inherit from <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fortus</span> under Article No. 922 of the New Civil Code.’</p>

<blockquote>With respect to Exhibits 9-B and 9-C which
was a ‘<span class="SpellE">Escritura</span> de <span class="SpellE">Compra</span>
y <span class="SpellE">Venta</span>’ executed by <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fortus</span>; and wherein <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span> was reflected as a married man, the same does not
clearly establish the claim of the <span class="SpellE">oppo­sitors</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortuses</span> that their parents were legal­ly married, for the
name <span class="SpellE">Jacoba</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguil</span> was not
mentioned therein as the spouse of <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">For­tus</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary,
this piece of evidence is obviously the reflection of his actual be­ing married
with his lawful wife Julia <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.</span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"<i><o:p></o:p></i></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is obvious from the foregoing quotations that the trial court
and the Court of Appeals, relying upon similar if not identical reasons, found
that <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jacoba</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguil</span> were never
married.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not believe anyone can
say that "reasonable men (will) readily agree" that such finding of
fact is "manifestly mistaken, absurd or impos­sible" (De Luna vs. <span class="SpellE">Linatoc</span>, supra).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
the contrary, <span class="GramE">We</span> are of the opinion that fair minded
men may differ on whether or not such finding of fact is right, or "is
rightly drawn from the undisputed evidence" (idem).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the present case is not one calling
for the exercise of either our appellate or supervisory jurisdiction for the
purpose of reversing the finding of fact aforesaid made by the Court of Appeals
and, before it, by the trial court.</p>
