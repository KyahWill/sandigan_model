Philippines (UP), to the Office of respond­ent UP President Salvador P. Lopez,
there to become Special assistant in charge of public information and
relations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, a professor of English and Comparative Litera­ture
(formerly Dean of the UP College in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city>),
was elected Dean of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Education</st1:placename></st1:place>
on <st1:date year="1967" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1967</st1:date> by the Board
of Regents, on nomination of the UP President.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His appointment as such Dean was for a five-year term, "effective
May 16, 1967 until May 17, 1972, unless sooner terminated, with all the rights
and privileges as well as the duties and obligations attached to the position
in accordance with the rules and regulations of the University and the
Constitution and laws of the Republic of the Phil­ippines."</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues in this case can be better understood if framed in its
proper setting, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:</p>

<p class="BODY">As far back as February 11, 1969, the graduate and under­graduate
students of the UP College of Education presented to President Salvador P.
Lopez a number of demands having a bearing on the general academic program<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and the physical plant and services,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
with a cluster of special demands.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
In response, President Lopez created a committee composed of eight graduate
students, two undergraduate students, and four faculty members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This committee met 9 times with Dean Sta.
Maria in February and March 1969.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1969" day="17" month="3">March 17, 1969</st1:date>, Dean Sta. Maria gave
President Lopez a written summary of the dialogues he had with the committee
and enumerated in connection with the demands, the steps taken,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
the steps being taken,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
and the steps to be taken in consultation with the faculty.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
He also recommended to the UP President the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a more adequate budget responsive to the
needs of the college, taking into account its expanding graduate program;
improve­ment of the library service in terms of a better book collection and
more adequate space and reading rooms, particularly for graduate students;
appointment of more faculty members on the senior level to handle the large
graduate program, and to meet the acute need for more graduate advisers, critics,
and committee members; improvement of the water system of the college;
improvement of the physical plant of the college, in­cluding its classrooms,
offices, toilets, sidewalks and sur­rounding landscape; and construction of a
graduate students' dormitory.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the students were not to be appeased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, Dean Sta. Maria, according to them, did
not act on some of their demands.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondents herein have stressed that in the meet­ings of the education
graduate committee, Dean Sta. Maria neither included in the agenda nor
consulted the faculty about the students' demands on "foreign language
proficiency examination" and on "research and thesis writing
procedures".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have brought out
the fact that many members of the faculty shared the students' grievances on
the absence of definite standards and procedures on academic work, including
teaching load, adminis­trative and committee assignments, faculty evaluation,
and favori­tism and discrimination.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1969</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Adelaida</span> E. <span class="SpellE">Masuhud</span>,
President of the UP Graduate Education Student Organization, led a group who
visited President Lopez and submitted to him a progress report on the students'
demands taken up with Sta. Maria since <st1:date year="1969" day="26" month="3">March
 26, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She acknowledged
that the dean had granted ten demands<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
but deplored the fact that the dean had ignored the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>submission to the faculty for decision, of
the demand for abolition of foreign language requirements and Comprehensive
examinations; fixing the criteria for selection, admission, appointment and promotion
of faculty members; formulation of clear-cut policies on thesis advising,
faculty teaching load, and faculty membership on standing committees; and
appointment of a permanent director for the Graduate Education Studies of the
SPED Program.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She thus stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I appreciate the efforts of the Dean in
acting on some of our demands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
the Dean has failed to take further action on the demands that have far
reaching implications for the students, faculty and the College as a
whole.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence problems,
confusion and demoralization of students and faculty have cropped up anew in
the college."</p>

<p class="BODY">The students threatened to boycott their classes the next day,
July 17.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>President Lopez asked that they
desist, suggested that they instead attend a student-faculty meeting the next
day in his office.</p>

<p class="BODY">But on July 17, the Education Graduate Student Organiza­tion
boycotted their classes just the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The President met the striking students' representatives and the faculty
members of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Education</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Charges of favoritism were allegedly hurled
by some of the faculty members against Sta. Maria.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the dean offered to sit
down with the students.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter,
however, refused to enter into a dialogue unless he (the dean) were first ousted.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a separate development, the faculty members of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Education</st1:placename></st1:place> convened in the
afternoon of July 22.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They resolved,
amongst others, to recognize the right of a college dean to his position from
which he cannot be removed unless for cause (44 in favor, 2 abstained), and not
to endorse the students' demand for the forced resignation of Sta. Maria (36 in
favor, 5 against, 3 abstained).</p>

<p class="BODY">The boycott fever infected other colleges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1969" day="22" month="7">July
 22, 1969</st1:date>, the newly installed members of the UP Student Council
voted to support the education students' strike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day, July 23, the main avenues
leading to the university gates were barricaded, buses denied entrance, and
students cajoled into joining the strike.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was thus on that day that all academic activity in the university
came to a complete standstill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
morning of July 23, at <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time>,
the UP President called a meeting of the faculty of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Education</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those present gave him a vote of con­fidence
(40 in favor, 7 abstained) to resolve the issue on hand as he sees fit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Armed with the vote of confidence of the education faculty, on
the same day, July 23, 1969, President Lopez issued the transfer order herein
challenged, Administrative Order 77.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That order, addressed to Dean Sta. Maria, reads:</p>

<blockquote>"By special authority vested in me by the Board of Regents and
pursuant to the Civil Service Law and the University Code, you are hereby trans­ferred
from the <st1:place><st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Education</st1:placename></st1:place>
to the Office of the President as Special Assistant<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
with the rank of Dean, without reduction in salary, in the interest of the
service.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This transfer involves your administrative position only and in no
way affects your status as professor of the University.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This order shall take effect immediately."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Simultaneously, President Lopez appointed <u>ad</u> <u>interim</u>
Professor <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Ceralde</span>
as "acting Dean of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Education</st1:placename></st1:place>, without additional
compensation, effective <st1:date year="1969" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1969</st1:date>".</p>

<p class="BODY">President Lopez was to explain in a press statement of July 23,
1969 that he "cannot permit the continued disruption of the academic life
of the institution"; that the transfer order was made "[<span class="SpellE">i</span>]n the interest of the service" and "as an
emergency measure" because the meetings with the faculty, students, Sta.
Maria and the UP President had "proved fruitless in the face of the
refusal of the College of Education students to discuss any further their
demands unless and until Dean Sta. Maria resigns his position"; and that,
therefore, "the complete shut-down of classes in the <span class="SpellE">Diliman</span>
campus has compelled" him to "transfer Dean Sta. Maria to other
duties".</p>

<p class="BODY">Having received the transfer order on the same day, July 23, Sta.
Maria forthwith wrote a letter, which he himself hand carried to President
Lopez, requesting that "(a) a formal investigation be conducted by the
Board of Regents on the circumstances which led to the promulgation of the
above order, and on the basis thereof; and (b) said order be reconsidered and
set aside for being manifestly unjust, unfair, unconstitutional, and contrary
to law, and, therefore, null and void."</p>

<p class="BODY">The next day, July 24, Sta. Maria announced to the education
students and faculty, through Memorandum 17, that the transfer order "is
now the subject of a pending request for recon­sideration x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> and, for this reason, its <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
is necessarily suspended", and that he shall continue "to be the Dean
x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> pur­suant to his
appointment as such for the period from January 1, 1968 to May 15, 1972."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1969</st1:date>,
the education faculty signed a "Decla­ration of Concern" stating,
amongst others, that when they gave President Lopez a vote of confidence, they
"did so in the belief and confidence that he x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> will uphold the democratic processes in the
solution of the problem and will respect the fundamental rights of the
individual." Similar declarations of concern came from the faculties of
law, medicine, arts and sciences, and nursing.</p>

<p class="BODY">At President Lopez' request, a special meeting of the Board of
Regents was held on <st1:date year="1969" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>President Lopez there reported Dean Sta.
Maria's transfer and Professor <span class="SpellE">Ceralde's</span> <u>ad</u> <u>interim
</u>appointment as Acting Dean of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Education</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told the board that because of
"failure of leadership in the College of Education, a crisis of confidence
emerged in that institution"; that the ultimate result was the boycott of
classes by the students "starting on July 17, 1969 in protest against the
inaction of Dean Sta. Maria on their demands submitted months ago"; and
that this situation impelled him to issue Administrative Order 77 "as
demanded by the prevailing crisis."</p>

<p class="BODY">The board confirmed Dean Sta. Maria's transfer and Professor <span class="SpellE">Ceralde's</span> appointment, considered as premature Sta. Maria's
Memorandum 17 heretofore mentioned, but gave due course to his plea for
reconsideration and granted him a chance to be heard at the next board meeting
on July 29, 1969.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the said meeting of July 29, Sta. Maria did not per­sonally
appear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He sent his counsel who manifested
that Sta. Maria was not recognizing the board's jurisdiction unless, without
further hearing, the board first revoke the transfer order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The board resolved:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> to take cognizance and consider as <u>a</u> <u>new</u> <u>petition</u>
of Dean Sta. Maria, submitted through counsel, his decla­ration that the
efficacy of the President's Administrative Order No. 77 transferring him should
first be suspended by the Board and held in abeyance as a prerequisite for the
hearing being prayed for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this
connection, Dean Sta. Maria will be asked to file a Memorandum with the Board
in support of his new petition."</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing had been the developments when Sta. Maria filed the
present petition for certiorari, prohibition and mandamus in this Court on <st1:date year="1969" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1969</st1:date> against respondents
Salvador P. Lopez, the Board of Regents and <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span>
R. <span class="SpellE">Ceralde</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case is now ripe for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Discussion of the issues
herein involved necessarily has to start with the examination of the terms of
employment, the covenant which binds petitioner with the university.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contract, it bears repeating, stipulates
that the dean's five-year term is qualified by the clause:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"unless sooner terminated, with all the
rights and privileges as well as the duties and obli­gations attached to the
position in accordance with the rules and regulations of the University and the
Constitution and laws of the Republic of the Philippines." The authority
for this appointment is found in Article 79 of the university code providing
that "[t]he term of office of all deans x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> shall be five years from the date of their appointment
without prejudice to reappointment and until their successors shall have been
appointed."</p>

<p class="BODY">We first look into the meaning of the phrase "unless sooner
terminated" embodied in the contract of employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Right at the start, it would seem to us that
the term "unless sooner terminated" cannot be equated or tied up with
some such terms as "terminable at will", or "removable at
pleasure".</p>

<p class="BODY">A number of reasons there are why petitioner may not be removed
at pleasure before the expiry of his term.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>First</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's
contract of employment has a fixed term of five years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not an appointment in an acting
capacity.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Nor is petitioner's designation that of an officer-in-charge as it is known in
administrative practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Second</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing in the rules and regulations of the
university or its charter would indicate that a college dean appointed with a
term can be separated with­out cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the contrary, reason there is to believe that the university policy points
quite to the contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An instance is
the resolution of the Board of Regents of <st1:date year="1961" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1961</st1:date>, fixing the term of office of the UP
President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was there stated that
"uncertainty of tenure and frequency of change in the incumbent of the
position are not for the best interests of the University." This concept
is self-evident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Third</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, there is nothing either in the UP
charter or code empowering the UP President or the Board of Regents to insert
such a clause - unless sooner terminated - as would authorize dismissal at
will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Fourth</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this Court, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Lacson</u></span>
<u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Roque</u></span>, 92 Phil. 456, 463, ruled,
"strict construction of law relating to suspension and removal, is the
universal rule." Petitioner, with a definite term of employment, may not
thus be removed except for cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
reasons being that the removal was not expressly declared to be exercisable at
pleasure or at will; and that the fixity of the term of office gives rise to
the inference that he may be removed from office only for misbehavior as to
which he shall be entitled to notice and hearing. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>As was well pointed out in <span class="SpellE"><u>Lacson</u></span>
<u>vs.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Roque</u></span>, <u>[</u>a]n inferential
authority to remove at pleasure can not be deduced, since the existence of a
defined term, <u>ipso</u> <u>facto</u> negatives such an inference and implies
a contrary presumption, i.e., that the incumbent shall hold office to the end
of his term subject to removal for cause."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing paves the way for the consideration of what we
believe is the overriding question:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was
Sta. Maria removed?</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents stand on the
premise that Sta. Maria was not removed; he was just temporarily assigned to
another position.</p>

<p class="BODY">We may well start with the statement that a dean of a UP college
holds a non-competitive or unclassified civil ser­vice position.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
As such, and upon the provisions of his con­tract of employment, he is
protected by constitutional and statu­tory provisions on security of term.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
He cannot be removed during the term except for cause and after prior hearing
and in­vestigation.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Which requisites are also embodied in the university Charter<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
and in the university code.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But is there really need for a formal prior hearing?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No need, respondents say.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, the Civil Service Law requires prior
hearing only in cases of removal, dismissal or suspension. Sta. Maria,
respondents underscore, was not suspended, dismissed or removed; he was merely
transferred to another position without reduction in salary or rank in the
interest of public service.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondents proceed to aver that the transfer was neither discipli­nary nor
punitive.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
A promotion, so they claim, because in the new position he would be an officer
of the university not just of one college;<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
he would enjoy a rank at par with senior college deans;<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
and that he would be in line for one of the vice-presidencies of the
university.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondents also say that such transfer was an emergency measure to stave off a
crisis that gripped the campus - the paralyzing disruption of classes.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
They emphasize that there was an urgent and genuine need for petitioner's
talents and services in the newly created Public Affairs and University
Relations Office.</p>

<p class="BODY">Quite interesting it is to inquire whether Dean Sta. Maria was
transferred, promoted, demoted, or removed without his consent.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A transfer is a
"movement from one position to another which is of equivalent rank, level
or salary, without break in ser­vice."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Promotion is the "advancement from one position to another with an
increase in duties and responsibilities as author­ized by law, and usually
accompanied by an increase in salary."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A transfer that results in promotion or demotion, advance­ment or
reduction<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
or a transfer that aims to "lure the em­ployee away from his permanent
position", cannot be done without the employee's consent.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
For that would constitute removal from office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, no permanent transfer can take place unless the officer or
employee is first removed from the position held, and then appointed to another
position.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">When an officer is reduced in rank or grade and suffers a big cut

But a demotion means something more than a reduction in salary; there may be a
demotion in the type of position though the salary may remain the same.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
A transfer that aims by indirect method to terminate services or to force
resignation also is removal.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Concededly, transfers
there are which do not amount to removal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Some such transfers can be effected without the need for charges being
preferred, without trial or hearing, and even without the consent of the employee.</p>

<p class="BODY">The clue to such transfers may be found in the "nature of
the appointment."<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
Where the appointment does not indicate a specific station, an employee may be
transferred or reassigned provided the transfer affects no substantial change
in title, rank and salary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, one who
is appointed "principal in the Bureau of Public Schools" and is
designated to head a pilot school may be transferred to the post of principal
of another school.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">And the rule that outlaws <span class="SpellE">unconsented</span>
transfers as anathema to security of tenure applies only to an officer who is
appointed - not merely assigned - to a particular station.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
Such a rule does not prescribe a transfer carried out under a specific statute
that empowers the head of an agency to periodically reassign the employees and
officers in order to improve the service of the agency.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>

Neither does illegality attach to the transfer or reassignment of an officer
pending the determination of an administrative charge against him;<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>

effected in good faith and in the interest of the service pursuant to Section

<p class="BODY">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next point of
inquiry is whether or not Administrative Order 77 would stand the test of
validity <span class="SpellE"><u>vis-a-vis</u></span> the principles just
enunciated.</p>

<p class="BODY">That the university is vested with corporate powers exer­cised by
the board of regents and the President is a proposition which is not open to
question.<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">To be stressed at this point, however, is that the appointment of
Sta. Maria is that of "Dean, <st1:place><st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Education</st1:placename></st1:place>, University of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>."
He is not merely a dean "in the university" His appointment is to a
specific position; and, more importantly, to a specific station.</p>

<p class="BODY">A line of distinction must be drawn between the office of dean
and that of professor, say, of English and Comparative Lite­rature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A professor in the latter capacity may be
assigned to handle classes from one college to another or to any other unit in
the uni­versity where English is offered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He may even be transferred from graduate school to undergraduate
classes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He cannot complain if such was
done without his consent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has no
fixed station.<a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a>
As for him, it can always be argued that the interests of the service are
paramount.</p>

<p class="BODY">But a college dean holding an appointment with a fixed term
stands on a different plane.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He cannot,
without his consent, be transferred before the end of his term.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He cannot be asked to give up his post.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor may he be appointed as dean of another
college.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much less can he be transferred
to another position even if it be dignified with a dean's rank.<a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We now come to the
problem of whether or not peti­tioner's transfer from the <st1:place><st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Education</st1:placename></st1:place> to the Office of the
President as special assistant with the rank of dean without reduction in
salary was permanent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Facts there are
which would show that far from being a temporary measure, petitioner's trans­fer
was in fact a removal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent university president himself admitted that the
transfer order was an <u>ad</u> <u>interim</u> appointment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the transfer was a removal has been
confirmed by the UP President's reference to Sta. Maria's deanship of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Education</st1:placename></st1:place> as his "former
position".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This plainly indicates
that Sta. Maria ceased to be dean of the college.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The validity of Dean Sta. Maria's designa­tion or appointment
as Special Assistant to the President rests upon two acts:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The transfer order of <st1:date year="1969" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1969</st1:date>, which operates as an <u>ad</u> <u>interim</u>
<u>appointment</u> under Art. 44(e) of the Revised U.P. Code; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>confirmation</u> on such appointment by
the Board of Regents in its special meeting on <st1:date year="1969" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1969</st1:date>."<a style="" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">And again:</p>

<blockquote>"The position of Special Assistant to the President with the
rank of Dean carries equal, if not higher, rank than the position of Dean of
the <st1:place><st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Education</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Special Assistant to the President, Dean
Sta. Maria has become an officer of the University while in his <u>former</u>
position, he was merely an officer of the college in the Univer­sity."<a style="" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not that the foregoing stand alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reasons advanced by respondents to
justify such transfer are quite revealing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They pictured Sta. Maria as a bungling administrator, incompetent, inef­ficient,
unworthy, a miscast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They averred that
he did not act on the petitions and grievances of graduate students; that he
caused widespread dissatisfaction amongst faculty members and students because
of his "inaction", his "lack of sincerity and candor in
dealing" with them; that he was guilty of "inflexible, arrogant
attitude and actuation" as dean; that he miserably failed to avert a
boycott that was caused by a "crisis of confidence" and "failure
of leadership" in his college; that he abandoned his post when he was most
needed; that he refused to accept solutions even as he failed to advance his
own to mitigate the crisis; that in sum, he was a miscast in the College of
Education.<a style="" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></span></span></a>
Of course, these are merely charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
they collectively reflect the thinking of respondents toward petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the picture thus presented, it would not
be unreasonable to say that Sta. Maria's transfer was with the character of
permanence to take him away from his duties and responsibilities as dean, in
all of which allegedly he was a failure.</p>

<p class="BODY">And if more were needed to show that the transfer of Sta. Maria
was permanent, there is the fact that <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ceralde</span> was appointed "ad interim" acting dean of
the <st1:place><st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Education</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, <span class="SpellE">Ceralde's</span>
appointment was confirmed by the Board of Regents on <st1:date year="1969" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, there is respondents' averment that peti­tioner's new position as
special assistant to the President could be a stepping-stone to a higher
position - that of Vice Presidency of the university.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were his appointment but temporary, there
would be no occasion to say that he could be elevated to another position of a
higher category.</p>

<p class="BODY">More than this, the transfer was a demotion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A demotion, because:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>First</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Deanship in a university, being an academic posi­tion which requires
learning, ability and scholarship, is more exalted than that of a special
assistant who merely assists the Pre­sident, as the title indicates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The special assistant does not make
authoritative decisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Second</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The position of dean is a line posi­tion
where the holder makes authoritative decisions in his own name and
responsibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A special assistant does
not rise above the level of staff position.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>Third</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The position of
dean is created by law, the university charter, and cannot be abolished even by
the Board of Regents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That of special
assistant, upon the other hand, is not so provided by law; it was a creation of
the university president.</p>

<p class="BODY">It will not avail respondents any to say that Sta. Maria retained
"the rank of Dean".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In actual
administrative practice, the term "with rank of" dean is
meaningless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is no dean at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He of course, basks in the trappings of the
dean.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A palliative it could have been
intended to be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But actually he is a
dean without a college.</p>

<p class="BODY">7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents nonetheless
insist that the "interest of the service" is the primary reason for
the transfer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They say that there was an
urgent need to bring the academic life of the university back to normal and
Sta. Maria's transfer was the only feasible solution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They point to the need for petitioner's
services in the Office of Public Affairs and University Relations purportedly
"to improve the relations of the University with its various
constituencies." They cling to the principle of "least
sacrifice".<a style="" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></span></span></a>
They urge that only three options were left to the university, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to keep Sta. Maria at all costs and risk an
indefinite paralysis of the university life; to give due course to the charges
filed against Sta. Maria, preventively sus­pend him during the investigation,
and after hearing dismiss him if the evidence so warrants; and to transfer him
as a non-discip­linary measure in the interest of the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents claim that the first option was out
of the question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason they give is
that the university could not afford an indefinite disruption of academic
life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To respondents, the second was
feasible but distasteful - the administration was in no mood to prejudice Sta.
Maria through a proceeding that would reflect on his record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So the university administration opted for
the third method, a solution said to be the most convenient and expeditious and
based on the principle of "least sacrifice".</p>

<p class="BODY">Implicit in the university's stand is that Dean Sta. Maria had to
be uprooted from his position as a price to buy the peace of the students and
induce them to return to their classes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such could have been an easy way to climb out of difficulties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But transfer could be but a ploy to cover
dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And dismissal cannot be
justified on grounds of expediency.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appropriately to be remem­bered here is that due process is associated
with the sporting idea of fair play;<a style="" href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></span></span></a>
it shuns oppression and eschews unfair dealing; it obeys the dictates of
justice and is ruled by reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Scrip­tures no less remind us to hear before we condemn.<a style="" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></span></span></a>
Fidelity to this cardinal principle must have impelled Congress, just recently,
to clarify the authority to transfer subordinate officers and employ­ees, an
authority so often misused and abused to ride roughshod over hapless civil
servants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As amended, the Civil Service
Law provides that "if the employee believes that there is no justification
for the transfer, he may appeal his case x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> and pending his appeal and decision thereon, his transfer
shall be held in abeyance." This was intended to fortify the protective
wall built around the employee's right to security of tenure, to guard against
unbridled encroachments masquerading in the "interest of the
service".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, to think that this
amendment came just a few days after Sta. Maria was transferred without prior
hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">The current climate of activism of the young people, recognized
to be worldwide, whether on or off campus, is a phenomenon in this country that
commands attention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Demonstrations and
boycotts which are manifestations of such activism are constitutionally
protected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But there are limits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A funda­mental precondition to the exercise
of such rights, we perceive, is that the activity should not impair the rights
of others whose roots are as deep and as equally protected by iron-clad guaran­tees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A high regard to a man's dignity is the
hallmark of our law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The students demanded Sta. Maria's ouster.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Presi­dent of the university acceded to
their demand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Sta. Maria's right to
be removed only, in the words of the law, "after due process" was
disregarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That Sta. Maria's right
alone was impaired is not justification for the action taken against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unless, of course, justice be replaced by
collective action as the test for validity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And, unless we admit that arbitrariness is permissible if it comes from
an impersonal multitude.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor may it be assumed that emergency could justify dis­regard of
constitutional rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would seem
pertinent to observe that a fundamental charter is for all times and for all
conditions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eloquent are these passages

at all; and the peace just now obtained is no more than a transitory lull, a
precarious interlude that could lead to even more serious disorders and

because of its consequences on the morale of the faculty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The exercise of independent judgment the

<p class="BODY">8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The argument that the
transfer of Sta. Maria was made in the interest of public service has dwindled
in strength on the face of the circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">Nor do we believe it too difficult for the UP authorities to hew
to the line drawn by the due process clause, to cause charges to be formalized,
Sta. Maria suspended, and given a fair chance to defend himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This procedure does not neces­sarily bring
about humiliation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, it

In all these cases, the courts have uniformly ruled that due process does not
require judicial inquiry as a condition to the exercise of administrative
discretion. "It is sufficient, where only property rights are concerned,
that there is at some stage an opportunity for a hearing and a judicial
determination."<a style="" href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We can go on citing cases where regulatory agencies, in a manner
of speaking, shoot first before asking questions without offending against due
process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it is pointless to cite
them here, much less rely upon them to support Sta. Maria's <span class="SpellE">unconsented</span>
trans­fer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For central to those cases is
that they involve the exercise of regulatory authority pursuant to a delegated
police power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason these agencies
are given such summary powers is that they come to grip with issues that are
mostly scientific and technical, issues that are "perhaps not readily
reducible to the simple question-and-answer method so dearly beloved by law­yers."<a style="" href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, in place of a formal hearing they resort to inspection, examination and
testing - techniques regarded as sufficient substitutes upon which to base an administrative
action.<a style="" href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></span></span></a>
Whether poultry is putrid, or drug is harmful, or a ship is <span class="SpellE">unseaworthy</span>,
are matters better left to scientific analysis or technical inspection without
the need of a formal hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Based on
such examination and inspection, summary orders for condemnation or
confiscation may follow.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the UP President's decision to summarily take the deanship
away from Sta. Maria cannot, by any stretch of imagi­nation, be cast in the
same type of administrative actions that regulatory agencies exercise under a
delegated police power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The UP
President's action here is unlike that, for instance, of the Central Bank in
removing the officers of a floundering bank in order to take over its
management.<a style="" href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></span></span></a>
Not even the so-called emergency situation in the campus could be invoked to
firm up his summary action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seemingly,
the decision to transfer Sta. Maria was dictated by the howling protest of
demonstrating students who wanted to muscle in their demands for curriculum
changes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But precisely, it is in situations
such as this that one should be on guard lest reason and justice be overwhelmed
by excitement and passion.</p>

<p class="BODY">10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, respondents cite
the so-called "crisis of con­fidence" and "failure of
leadership" in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Education</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Allegedly, these factors caused the student
boycott which UP tried to avert by the expedient of banishing Sta. Maria from,
and effectively depriving him of his deanship, of the College of Education.</p>

<p class="BODY">The boycott, we are made to understand, was called because Sta.
Maria resisted the pressures exerted by the grad­uate students.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He refused to give in to their demands -
demands that sought to eliminate or influence the direction of curricular
requirements, specifically those which pertain to foreign languages and
comprehensive examinations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The graduate
students, it is alleged, considered these requirements as "obsolete
vestiges of colonial education, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> activities which do not in any way add to the learning

Maria cannot single-handedly do away with these requirements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The responsibility for fixing the academic

Sta. Maria was not after all unreasonably inflexible, intransigent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He sympatheti­cally listened to them, and
broadly satisfied those demands that were within his power as Dean to give,
short of compromising the academic standards of the university.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the President of the Education
Graduate Student Organization appreciated the Dean's efforts to meet "some
of our demands".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Dean Sta.
Maria could go no further.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went along
with the students as far as the limits of his power and discretion would allow
him to go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only the University Council

students wanted them to be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If so, why

would not want to risk the downgrading of the university's academic standards.</p>

</span>The administration cannot act only because of a show of might; it must
have reasons for any act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it must
make these reasons known, acting because of them without waiting for the
prodding of power.</blockquote>

<blockquote>No decision of the President should be forced by emergency, or
consideration of expe­diency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
emergency, or expediency, or the fear of student power muscle are the only
reasons for a decision, then the decision should not be taken at all.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the other hand, if a decision is impending, and is going to be
taken anyway, then the decision-makers should not wait to be forced into the
decision by an emergency situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
should decide, and avert that situation which is so costly in terms of class
hours and the integrity of the decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And then, in terms of the reaction of the people involved by that
dubiously-taken decision.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Because we cannot allow it to appear that the University is being
ruled by the considerations of expediency, or by the dictates of
emergency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The University must be guided
by things less base and more basic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
must be ruled by reason, by justice, by the search for truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This should always be made clear, and always
be respected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The University can be
neither a self-designed social instrument nor an institution ruled by force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is there, if anywhere, that we must be

faculty evaluation by students, using an appropriate instrument; (d)
Recommendation for an appropriate faculty committee to look into instruction
practices, with students’ opinion taken into account in the meetings of the
student-faculty relations Committee; (e) The institution of a Graduate Record

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION<span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BARREDO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the fact that Mr. Justice Sanchez, the writer of the
main opinion is due to retire and it is best that the decision in this case be promulgated
before he leaves this Court, I am constrained to express briefly now my views
on the issues before Us, reserving my right to make a more extended opinion
later should I find it necessary to do so.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the main facts related in the main opinion, I
agree that respondents Lopez and Board of Regents acted beyond the scope of
their authority in permanently transferring petitioner from his position as
Dean of the Col­lege of Education to that of Special Assistant in the Office of
the President, even with rank of dean and without reduction of salary, for the
simple reason that such a transfer, taking all attendant circumstances into
account, did not comply with the requirements of Section 32 of the Civil
Service Act of 1959, invoked by said respondents, if only because, as the
majority holds, the position of Special Assistant in the Office of the
President, even with the empty trappings of a deanship without any particular
college to be dean of, can­not be considered as not a reduction in rank, even
if there be some element of interest of the service in the cause thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this concept, I vote that the order of
transfer in question should be stricken down as repugnant to the Constitution,
that petitioner is still the Dean of the College of Education of the University
of the Philippines and that the appointment of respondent <span class="SpellE">Ceralde</span>,
even in an <u>ad</u> <u>interim</u> capacity has no legal basis and is,
therefore, void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Parenthetically, this
is not to admit that petitioner has never had an opportunity to be heard, for
conferences, meetings, dialogues, long and deliberative, there had been many
times for months - it is only that We are not satisfied that such chances as
petitioner might have had to air his views on those occasions conform precisely
with the requirements of due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">I find it difficult, however, to agree that Dean <span class="SpellE">Santamaria</span> be returned to the vortex of controversy and
thereby <span style="">bring back </span>the
University to the chaotic condition obtaining at the time the questioned order
was issued, unless, in the meantime, prudence and sobriety have regained their
hold and <span style="">the </span>fire of excessive
student activism has already sufficiently cooled down because they have come to
understand the inimi­cal consequences of anything done to excess.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the majo­rity position of completely
setting aside the said order appears to be somehow justified, it is only
because in the face of riotous situation the authorities were lost in con­fusion
<span style="">as </span><span style="">to </span>how to meet the problem at hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To my mind, the crisis of leadership was not
a monopoly of the <span class="GramE">petitioner,</span> it pervaded even the
higher strata of the university hierarchy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To be more precise, it is not clear to me what exactly <span class="GramE"><span style="">is </span>the position of
the respondents</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If they are
serious in invoking Section 32 abovementioned, then it must be admitted that
the ordered <span style="">transfer </span>is
permanent, and since as <span class="GramE"><span style="">We</span></span><span style=""> </span>view it, the requisites of the law
for such a transfer have not been met, the petitioner is right in contending
that he is still the Dean of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Education</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, all throughout the
pleadings of the respondents, iterations and reiterations are made of the
emergency and temporary character of the transfer, to meet a crisis that could
result in the complete <span class="SpellE">paralization</span> of the activities
in the University. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Is this the real
nature of the measure taken?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this is
true, then I find no valid reason why the majority should insist on completely
striking down the order in question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Precedents there are where the court in passing upon acts questioned <span style="">as </span>merely in excess of authority has
sanctioned them only to the extent that they could be construed consistently
within the limits of legitimate authority and the fundamental law of the
land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I consider it as a prudent measure
of public administra­tion that in the face of the student demands, which I am
afraid<span style=""> this court </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">not in a position to pass upon with the </span><span style="">same </span><span style="">competence as the
Board of Regents and the university autho­rities can, it is legally possible to
detail petitioner in the position given to him under the order, without
removing him as Dean of the College of Education, only for such dura­tion as
may be needed, which must be as speedily as possible, by the Board of Regents
to clear up the matter of the demand of the students.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the deliberations, the
majority pointed out that no formal charges have been filed against
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the purposes, I have
indicated, I believe that as a conse­quence of the principle and policy
embodied in Section 32, no such charges are needed, considering the urgency of
the circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated, if
a permanent transfer can be made in the interest of the service, provided there
is no re­duction in rank and salary, without the need of any charges being
filed and any formal investigation undertaken, it should follow that a
temporary detail may also be legally made to the same end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, I do not find in the position taken
by petitioner in his last letter to respondent Board of Re­gents that he is
raising this point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What he wants is
only </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">formal investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I believe the Board is willing to </span><span style="">do that, but petitioner wants to be returned
first to his position before any investigation is started.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My answer</span> is, it is right that he
should be restored his rank and position as Dean of the College of Education,
but in the interest of the service and for broader considerations arising from
the unusual situation obtaining which calls for <span style="">a </span>little less of legalism and formalism, he should be amenable
to being provisionally detailed elsewhere, with the double advantage that he is
removed as I said, temporarily, from the vortex of controversy, and at the same
time his acknowledged special qualifications <span style="">can </span>be made use of by the university in ano­ther aspect of its
functions, to the enhancement of the purposes for which it exists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is certainly less than being suspended,
which, under the circumstances stated in the main <span style="">opinion </span>and in the pleadings of respondents, not effectively
rebutted<span style="">, in </span>my view, by
petitioner, would have been legally <span style="">possible,
had formal charges been filed against him under </span>Section 34 of the Civil
Service Act.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Before closing, I wish to
emphasize that nothing said above favorable to respondents' position is
intended to con­done, much le</span>s<span style="">s
encourage, mob rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, my
considered view is that this case can be and ought to be decided without taking
into account, speaking in the language of <span class="SpellE">civilists</span>
when referring to contracts, as a consideration, rather than as a mere reason
or motive, the urgency of placating the students' intransigent attitude, and
that what should concern Us only is whether or not there was enough substantial
basis in the demands of the students to warrant remedial measures by the
university authorities within the confines of the constitution and the settled
principles of free speech <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> the interest of
the service and the accomplishment of the ends of university education which is
exactly what the students are there for. </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span style="">Stated
differently, with or without student riots, if the demands of the demonstrators
were flimsy and capricious, the respondents should have firmly stood their
ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, with or
without such show of force, the university administration has the power and,
indeed, the duty to take adequate legal steps to meet the situation with emergency
measures that will pave the way for ultimate permanent solutions more or less
acceptable to all reasonable men.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I would also add that the security of tenure consecrated in the
constitution should not be construed as placing the government in a position as
if it owed all officers and em­ployees their respective positions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, under this constitutional
mantle, persons in the government service are not mere beasts of burden, much
less inanimate pawns on a chessboard to be moved at will by their
administrators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I feel very strongly
that public service or employment in the government is not just a means of
living - it carries with it a sense of mission, a tinge of patriotism and a
considerable degree of the spirit of sacrifice readily to be offered in the
altar of the commonweal, as long as there is no trampling of human
dignity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I recognize no primacy in any
of the rights enshrined in the constitution - rather, I hold that it is the
inescapable peculiar function and duty of the courts to determine in
appropriate instances, given God's light, where one ends and where only the
other begins.</p>

<p class="BODY">In conclusion, I hold that the order in question should be
construed as a mere temporary measure that does not in any manner minimize the
status of petitioner as Dean of the College of Education and as merely a
temporary detail of said petitioner to the Office of the President until the
Board of Regents has acted on his petition filed therewith, action on which he
impeded by somehow prematurely coming to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I vote that the petition be denied and the
transfer order in question upheld only in the character and nature explained in
this opinion, that is, as a temporary detail, without removing petitioner as Dean
<span style="">of </span>the <st1:place><st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Education</st1:placename></st1:place>.</p>

As a matter of fact, it is perhaps even possible to hold that because
petitioner Sta. Maria accepted his appoint­ment as Dean of the College of
Education for a term of five years together with the qualification "unless
sooner terminated", he is not entitled to invoke security of te­nure, just
as "a civil service eligible who accepts a position in a temporary
capacity is not entitled to the protection accorded by Republic Act No. 557 (<span class="SpellE">Hortillosa</span> <i>vs.</i> <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span>,
L-11169, Jan. 30, 1959) nor to the protection of security of tenure in office
guaranteed by the Constitu­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Taboada</span> <i>vs</i>. Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Badian</span>, et al., L-­14604, May 31, 1961).</span> The
undisturbed unanimity of the cases is that one who holds a temporary
appointment has no fixed tenure of office; his employment can be termina­ted

<p class="BODY">To me the meaning of this order is unmistakable:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sta. Maria was relieved as Dean of the <st1:place><st1:placename>U.P.</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype></st1:place> of Education and was as­signed
to the Office of the President as a Special Assistant "with the rank of
Dean." That was how the action of the respondent Lopez was understood by
certain thoughtful and knowledgeable elements of the University of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Now the respondents would minimize it as no more than a mere "temporary
transfer" or, more accurately, a detail, which does not involve removal in
the constitutional sense of the petitioner from the deanship of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Education</st1:placename></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I find myself hard put to
give the disputed order the mean­ing now ascribed to it by the
respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, if the
petitioner was not removed as dean of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Education</st1:placename></st1:place>, I do not see why it <span class="GramE">was</span> necessary to invest him with the "rank of
Dean." Was he not already a dean of a college?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To say that as Spe­cial Assistant to the
University President the petitioner would have "the rank of Dean" is
to say that he was not actually a Dean, in the same way that to say that one
has the rank of a judge is to say, albeit impliedly, that one is not a judge --
else why give him the rank of an officer which he already is?<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the second place, the issuance of an <u>ad</u> <u>interim</u>
appoint­ment to the respondent <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ceralde</span> as Acting Dean of the <st1:place><st1:placename>U.P.</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype></st1:place> of Education underscores
the fact that the petitioner had ceased to be the dean of the college.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It meant, simply, that the res­pondent <span class="SpellE">Ceralde</span> was appointed dean <u>vice</u> the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For unless the position of Dean of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Education</st1:placename></st1:place> was vacant there could
be no appointment to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Could it be
considered vacant if the petitioner had merely been temporarily detailed to the
Office of the President of the University?</p>

<p class="BODY">And finally, that the petitioner was appointed to a new posi­tion
and not merely detailed thereto was confirmed by the respon­dent Lopez's own
counsel who, at the hearing on <st1:date year="1969" day="29" month="7">July
 29, 1969</st1:date> be­fore the Board of Regents of the University, admitted
that the transfer order constituted an <u>ad</u> <u>interim</u> appointment of
the petitioner as Special Assistant to the U.P. President.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There are other overriding circumstances, already pointed out in
the opinion of the Court, which completely negate the res­pondents' claim that
the petitioner was not removed from his post but merely temporarily assigned to
another office, but I think the best and final refutation of the respondents'
pretense is to be found in the press statement given by the respondent Lopez
himself on the same day (July 23, 1969) he issued the transfer order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statement reads in part:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"After long and careful consideration, I have come to the
conclusion that as President of the Uni­versity I cannot permit the continued
disruption of the academic life of the institution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the interest of the service, therefore,
and availing myself of the authority vested in me <span style="">by </span>law, I have issued an order transferring Dean <span class="SpellE">Felixberto</span> C. Sta. Maria of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Education</st1:placename></st1:place> to other duties in the
University, without reduction in rank or salary, pursuant to the Civil Service
Law and the University Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In an effort to persuade the students to return to their
classes pending neg<span style="">o</span>tia<span style="">t</span>ion of their demands, the
Administration has called a series of meetings bet­ween the faculty, the
students, Dean Sta. Maria and the President of the University.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These meetings, how­ever, proved fruitless in
the face of the refusal of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Education</st1:placename></st1:place> students to discuss
any further their demands unless and until Dean Sta. Maria resigns his
position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>"[T]he complete shut-down of classes
in the <span class="SpellE">Diliman</span> campus has compelled me, much to my
regret, to take the decision to transfer Dean Sta. Maria to other duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In taking this difficult decision, I was
encour­aged by the vote of confidence which was unanimously adopted by the
faculty of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Education</st1:placename></st1:place>
this morning, in any decision which the President might take in the <span style="">best interest </span>of the University."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Again, in a press release issued the following day, <st1:date year="1969" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1969</st1:date>, he emphasized:</p>

<blockquote>"I proposed to the striking students that Dean Sta. Maria be
not made to resign under pressure but that he should remain in his post until
the end of the semester.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They turned
this down.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the circumstances, I decided that the only course left
open to <span style="">me in </span>order to keep the
University open was to transfer Dean Sta. Maria to other duties, in the same
rank and salary, as provided by the Civil Service Law and the University Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I deeply regret that I have had to take this difficult
decision, but I had no choice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
President Truman once said, 'The buck stops here,' and I must add, 'the <span style="">U.</span>P. is greater and more important
than any man.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">These statements made right on the heels of the issuance of the
disputed order, rather than the later statements of the respon­dent Lopez,
reveal, I believe, the true nature of the petitioner's relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They demonstrate beyond cavil that the
petitioner's head was the price demanded by the striking students and that the
petitioner's head was precisely and exactly the price paid <span style="">in </span>exchange for peace <span style="">on </span>the campus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For if the intended result of the action
taken in this case was no more than a mere "detail" of the
petitioner, then it hardly deserved the characterization as "this
difficult decision" which the U.P. President "with deep regret"
had to take, "encour­aged" by the thought that he had the vote of
confidence of the college's faculty.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may indeed be that the position of Special Assistant to the
President of the University is of a higher category than that of a college dean
and that for that reason the petitioner was not demot­ed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But to view the matter from this angle of
vision is to miss completely the point at issue, namely, that the transfer of
an employee from one post <span style="">in </span>the
civil service to another, <span style="">if o</span>bjected
to by him, can be justified only if there be some cause recognized by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Is not this what this Court meant when it ruled that the <span class="SpellE">un­consented</span> transfer of a civil service employee, no
matter how well-intended, as a promotion, is "equivalent to a
removal," and, <span style="">if </span>made
without prior hearing, is <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the
Constitution?<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
As this Court noted:</p>

<blockquote>"But in justice to the President and the Commission on
Appointments, let it be stated once again that it would seem that the transfer
of the petitioner to <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> was not meant and
intended as a punishment, a disciplinary measure or demotion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was really a promotion, at least at the
time the appoint­ment was made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only,
that later, due to a change in the category of Oriental <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
as a province, the transfer was no longer a promotion in salary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet the respondent and the Solicitor
General insisted on the transfer despite the refusal of the petitioner to
accept his new appointment."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The rule in <span class="SpellE"><u>Lacson</u></span> is now
embodied in statute:</p>

<blockquote>"[A] transfer from one position to
another without re­duction in rank or salary shall not be considered
disciplinary when made in the interest of public ser­vice, in which case the
employee concerned shall be informed of the reasons <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the employee believes that there is no
justification for the transfer, he may appeal his case to the Commission on
Civil Service through the Department Head.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pending appeal and decision thereof, his transfer shall be held in
abeyance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>..."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This statutory provision reflects the view that because by nature
a transfer (as distinguished from a mere detail) involves a removal from one
position and an appointment to another, there must first be a hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so, while the respondents Lopez and U.P. <span style="">B</span>oard of <span style="">R</span>egents might not be expected to follow the pre­cise procedure
for transfer as outlined in the amendment to the statute, since this did not
take effect until August 4, 1969 (a few days after the petitioner's relief),
they were, to my mind, nevertheless bound to observe those "canons of
decency and fairness"<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
of which the due process clause is the "summarized constitutional
guarantee of respect.”<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
And due process of law requires at the very least that there be notice and
hearing,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
lest the summary transfer of a civil service employee offend "a sense of
justice."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Is to uphold the petitioner's right to a hearing to overlook the
larger interests of society, to exalt the individual at the expense of the
community?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is it nineteenth-century
bourgeois think­ing, so wanting in relevance as to be regarded as outmoded or
ob­solete in an age of mass demonstrations and confrontations?</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Lopez justifies his action in terms of what he
conceives to be the interest of the community that is the University which had
been completely shut down by<span style=""> </span>student
boycott.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As he stressed, "the U.P.
is greater and more important than any man."</p>

<p class="BODY">But the respect due the integrit<span style="">y</span> of the individual is by <span style="">no
</span>means antithetical to the interests of society.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, one reinforces the other, as
the philosopher Reinhold <span class="SpellE">Niebuhr</span> has so beautifully
brought out in his book, "The Children of Light and the Children of
Darkness.”<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
While bourgeois democracy, with its enshrining of the individual at the center
stage of society, has now generally been replaced by a new social
consciousness, its emphasis on liberty nevertheless contains an element of
validity that transcends its excessive individualism.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Perhaps it would be closer to the truth to say that the community requires
liberty as much as does the individual and the individual <span class="GramE">requires</span>
Community more than bourgeois thought comprehended.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
As Dr. <span class="SpellE">Niebuhr</span> explains:</p>

<blockquote>"The man who searches after both
meaning and fulfillments beyond the ambiguous fulfillments and frustrations of
history exists in a height of spirit which no historical process can completely
contain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This height is not irrelevant
to the life of the community, because new richness and a higher possibility of
justice come to the community from this height of awareness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the height is destroyed by any community
which seeks prematurely to cut off this pinnacle of individuality in the
interest of the community's peace and order.''<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">And what was the community interest involved here?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it was that of the community of students
who massed in front of the Univer­sity administration building, then it was
obviously in their interest that the strike continued until the respondent
Lopez yielded to their demand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, on
the other hand, it was that of the community of stu­dents who very much wanted
to attend classes but were prevented from doing so, or that of the community of
professors and other scho­lars who could not get inside the classrooms because
they were barred by the demonstrating students, then the protection of their
rights is to be found in some solution of a police character and not in the
summary removal of the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
issue would always thus narrow down to the vindication of a principle:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the rational solution of any controversy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of more than passing relevance are these sentiments<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
articu­lated by Dr. Sidney Hook of the Department of Philosophy of the <st1:place><st1:placename>New
  York</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype></st1:place>, a
thoughtful commentator on the contemporary uni­versity scene:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Due process in the academic community
is reliant upon the process of rationality.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It cannot be the same as due process in the political community as far
as the mechanisms of determining the outcome of rational activity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For what controls the nature and direction of
due process in the academic community is derived from its educa­tional goal --
the effective pursuit, discovery, publication, and teaching of the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the political community all men are equal
as citi­zens not only as participants in, and contributors to, the political
pro­cess, but as voters and decision-makers on the primary level.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not so in the academic community.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What qualifies a man to enjoy equal hu­man or
political rights does not qualify him to teach equally with others or even to
study equally on every level.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
an authorita­tive, <u>not</u> authoritarian, aspect of the process of teaching
and learning that depends not upon the person or power of the teacher, but upon
the authority of his knowledge, the cogency of his method, the scope and depth
of his experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But whatever the
differences in the power of making decisions flowing from legitimate
differences in educational authority, there is an equality of learners, whether
of teachers or students, in the rational processes by which knowledge is won,
methods developed, and experience enriched."</p>

<p class="BODY">And on the rule of reason in a liberal educational regimen,
Professor Hook gives us pause with his incisive observations:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In a liberal educational regimen,
everything is subject to the rule of reason, and all are equals as questioners
and participants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whoever interferes
with academic due process either by violence or threat of violence places
himself outside the academic community, and incurs the sanctions appropriate to
the gravity of his offenses from censure to suspension to <span class="GramE">expulsion.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The peculiar deficiency of the ritualistic
liberal educational establishments is the failure to meet violations of rational
due process with appropriate sanctions <span style="">or
to </span>meet them in a timely and intelligent manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a tendency to close an eye to
expressions of lawless behavior on the part of students who, in the name of
freedom, deprive their fellow students of the freedom to pursue their
studies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is as if the liberal
administration sought to appease the challenge to its continued existence by
treating such incidents as if they had never happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>.... There is no panacea that can be applied
to all situations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not a question
of a hard line or a soft line, but of an intelligent line.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is easy to give advice from hindsight, to
be wise and cocksure after the event.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But it is always helpful for the faculty to promulgate in advance fair
guidelines for action, so that students will know what <span style="">to </span>expect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In general, no
negotiations should be conducted under the threat of coercion, or when adminis­trators
or faculty are held captive."</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">FERNANDO, <i>J.</i>:<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is much in the exhaustive opinion of Justice Sanchez,
impressive for its grasp of the law and breadth of <span class="GramE">scholarship,
that</span> commends itself for acceptance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nonetheless, I feel called upon to express my concurrence separately as
for me the question at issue could be viewed from a narrower perspective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could also be said, and this is not
intended by way of criticism, that the opinion of the Court could have accorded
a more explicit recognition of the complexity of the problems that sorely beset
the President of the University of the Philippines and thus result in greater
understanding and sympathy for his efforts to arrive at a correct and just
solution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the question before us is
one of power, however, even the best of motives cannot be a substitute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only must the objective sought to be
attained be within the law, but the means employed must not suffer from a legal
infirmity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be more specific, in the
case before us, I am unable to reach a conclusion other than that procedural
due process had not been observed in the removal of petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The view I take of the matter is thus in conformity with that
expressed in the opinion of the Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering all the circumstances discussed with the fullness of detail
by Justice Sanchez, the steps taken by the University administration, even if
susceptible to the interpretation that they were equivocal at most, had not
been purged of the taint of unfairness thus calling into operation the
protection afforded by the due process guaranty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There should be by this time no need to
stress the obvious that insofar as security of tenure and the right to the
perquisites are concerned, a public office is indeed property of which the <span style="">occupant cannot be deprived save in
accordance with its dictates.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Nonetheless, to erase any lingering doubts </span>on
the matter, there is nothing inappropriate in reaffirming such a
principle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is there anything
incompatible with the principle thus reiterated with the fundamental postulate
that a public office is preeminently a public trust, the exercise of the
authority thus conferred being conditioned on the official having uppermost in
mind what is best for public welfare.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Necessarily then in
accordance with the security of tenure guaranty</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">of the Constitution and its statutory
implementation under the Civil Service Act,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">this Court has been committed to the
principle that a public official may secure judicial redress for any suspension
or removal contrary to such mandate so explicitly announced, irrespec­tive </span>of
the <span style="">motives that may have inspired such
a move, </span>if thereby the ground for such disciplinary action is untenable
or the procedure followed is irregular.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A host of decisions attests to such a long, unbroken, impressive course <span style="">of </span><span style="">adjudication.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The decision reached by us in this case is
therefore solidly buttressed in authoritative pronouncements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">It
is well that it is </span><span style="">so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Whatever
inconvenience may thus be visited on attempts concededly taken in the utmost </span><span style="">good </span><span style="">faith to resolve a critical impasse </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">more than offset by
adherence to the rule of law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Constitution, being
the supreme law, its supremacy must be upheld, its mandates deemed
controlling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no justification
for any of its commands being disregarded or set at naught.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As so eloquently put in Ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> Milligan:</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> "The Constitution * * * is a law for
rulers and people, equally in war and in peace, and covers with the shield of
its protection all classes of men, at all times, and under all
circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No doctrine, involving
more pernicious consequences, was ever invented by the wit of man than that any
of its provisions can be suspended during any of the great exigencies of
government. "Petitioner, if he could show that no deference was paid to
his constitutional right to due process, could thus seek judicial relief, the
courts being duty bound to maintain inviolate the provisions of the fundamental
law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Nor is such a remedy
precluded by petitioner pursuing a course of conduct which apparently had given
cause for grave dissatisfaction on the part of the student body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much less could the expression of discontent
on the part of the student body, immoderate in character, giving rise to what
could plausibly be looked upon from the standpoint of the University
administration as an emergency call for </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">application of a
different principle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is precisely
under such circumstances that the paramount character of the Constitution must
be accorded due recognition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">As so forcefully stressed by former Chief Justice Hughes: <span style="">"Emergency </span>does not create power.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Emergency does not increase granted power or
remove or diminish the restrictions imposed upon power granted or
reserved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constitution was adopted
in a period of grave emergency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its
grants of </span><span style="">power </span><span style="">to the Federal Government and its limitations
of the power of the States were determined in the light of emergency and they
are not altered by emergency."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is to the credit of the opinion of Justice Sanchez that while
being fully cognizant of the amplitude of the constitutional right on the part
of the students to assembly and <span class="GramE">petition,</span> it reminds
them of the limits thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
beneficial results that could be expected of student activism, expressed at
tines with more vehemence than the occasion would call for, might not come to
pass if the boundaries of legally permissible conduct are overstepped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would seem to me that the sense of
maturity and the spirit of calm deliberation that should permeate an academic
atmosphere should be antidotes to what at times may be the impatience and
exuberance of the young carried to excess.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The words of Justice Frankfurter come to mind:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It must never be forgotten, however,
that the Bill of Rights was the child of the Enlightenment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Back of the guaranty of free speech <span class="GramE">lay</span> faith in the power of an appeal to reason by all the
peaceful means for gaining access to the mind.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was in order to avert force and explosions due to restrictions upon
rational modes of communication that the guaranty of free speech was given a
generous scope.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But utterance in a
context of violence can lose its significance as an appeal to reason and become
part of an instrument of force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such utterance
was not meant to be sheltered by the Constitution."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To the possible objection that there is an air of unreality to
the preceding observation as the University administration was confronted not
by what ought to have been but what in fact was, it suffices to answer that
even then deference to the rule of law was not thereby rendered
impossible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be admitted that it
was much more difficult under the circumstances, but that of itself certainly
could not justify its disregard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
not to say that there was such <span class="GramE">an intent</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Far from it.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be conceded that on the facts as
shown, there was no thought on the part of the University authorities to
trample on the rights of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their motive, as had been noted, was to solve the impasse with the best
interests of the entire University constituency uppermost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, the purest of motives, to
repeat, does not warrant a deviation from what the law prescribes.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Nor could reliance be had
on the clause that did confer on the University administration the power to put
an end to petitioner's continuance in his position as Dean.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the term was fixed at five years, it
could be "sooner terminated." In entire good faith then, it could be
interpreted as permitting what was done.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If that were all, then no </span>due process <span style="">question would have arisen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
was not the case though.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Charges, not
trivial in character, were in fact lodged against petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To put an end to his term then without giving
him a hearing </span>was <span style="">to condemn
him, considering that apparently </span>there <span style="">was no indication that such a thing was previously contemplated, until
the attitude of the students did assume such belligerent posture</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is <span style="">one
thing to inform an official that for the best interest of the service, </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">without reflection on his actuations, a new man should be placed at the
helm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an entirely different
matter, if subjected </span>as <span style="">he was
to accusations reflecting on his performance as such <span class="GramE">official,</span>
he is summarily relieved without the formal hearing to which due process
entitles him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is on this precise
ground that I vote for the granting of the petition and concur in the result
reached by the Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
