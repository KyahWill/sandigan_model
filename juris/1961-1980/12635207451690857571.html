				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Direct appeal on pure questions of law from an order of the Court
of First Instance of Iloilo dismissing for lack of jur­isdiction
plaintiffs-appellants' complaint questioning the legal­ity of the increased
assessment on their real estate and seek­ing the refund of the 100% increase in
real estate taxes paid by them under protest.</p>

<p class="BODY">The background facts are thus narrated in the lower court's
dismissal order:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Plaintiffs,
spouses Ramon A. Gon­zales and Lilia <span class="SpellE">Yusay</span> filed a
complaint against the Province of Iloilo asking for a refund of taxes on real
property they paid under protest for Lots Nos. 5733, 5886, 5666, 5913, 5669,
5735 of <span class="SpellE">Pototan</span> Cadastre located in the Municipality
of <span class="SpellE">Pototan</span>, Pro­vince of Iloilo, and Lot No. 708,
Dingle, Province of Iloilo, cor­responding to the years 1963 and 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The refund of said taxes is based on the
ground that the revised assessment on the property <span style="">in the Municipalities of <span class="SpellE">Pototan</span>
and Dingle, was null and void for it violates 'the constitutional injunction of
equality and uniformity of taxes and equal protection of the law because, while
the twenty-one (21) municipalities of Iloilo Province including the Municipa­lities
of <span class="SpellE">Pototan</span> and Dingle, where the plaintiffs' property
is lo­cated, were reassessed, twenty-two (22) other municipalities of the same
province were not reassessed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"That with reference to Lot No. 708 located at Dingle, which
the plaintiffs acquired through a contract of conditional sale executed on
April 28, 1961, from the Development Bank of the Philippines payable in ten
(10) years, the plaintiffs are not liable for the taxes of said lot which they
paid under protest for the years 1962 and 1963 inclusive, because under the law
creating the Development Bank of the Philippines, said DBP is exempted from
realty taxes and as such, the plaintiffs are not liable to pay land taxes due
the government while the said property is owned by the DBP.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The refund prayed for by the plaintiffs represent the excess
of taxes paid or the differential in the 1963-1964 taxes from the taxes of said
property in 1962 as the revision and reassessment of said property took effect
on <st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="1">Jan. 1, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the lots in <span class="SpellE">Pototan</span>,
plaintiffs asked for a refund of P637.80 while for the lot in Dingle,
plaintiffs asked a refund of the whole taxes for 1962-1963, in the amount of
P988.09 and the differential for 1964 tax of P299.50 or a total of P1,289.59
for the Dingle property alone or a grand total of P1,925.39 for the total of
the seven lots in <span class="SpellE">Pototan</span> and Dingle plus the legal
rate of interest from the filing of this complaint and costs of action.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"To plaintiffs' complaint, defendant filed a corresponding
answer upholding the validity of the reassessment on the two muni­cipalities of
<span class="SpellE">Pototan</span> and Dingle and as such the plaintiffs are not
entitled to the refund prayed for in their complaint; and with re­gards to real
property tax paid by the plaintiffs for the years 1962­-1963 of the property in
Dingle which the plaintiffs acquired from the DBP in 1961, the plaintiffs are
not entitled to the refund of said taxes because the payment of said tax is
part of the consideration of the sale executed by and between the plaintiffs
and the Development Bank of the Philippines, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Defendant further alleges that this Court has no jurisdiction
to the plaintiffs' complaint as the refund prayed for by the plaintiffs would
involve a declaration of the legality of the assessment which can only be
passed upon the Court of Tax Appeals pursuant to Sec. 7 of Republic Act No.
1125.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is aside from the fact that
from the <span style="">pleadings we find that the
plaintiffs have already filed an appeal to the Court of Tax Appeal involving
the legality of the assessment involved in the present case."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Since the issue of the lower court's lack of jurisdiction over
the case as a court of first instance as against the exclusive appellate
jurisdiction on the part of the court of tax appeals to review the challenged
assessment had been squarely joined in connection <span style="">with plaintiffs' motion for summary
judgment, the lower court issued its order of March 1, 1965, dismissing the
complaint before</span><span style=""> it and ruling
that the court of tax appeals, before whom plaintiffs had a pending appeal
likewise challenging the legality and validity of the assessment in question,
had exclusive appellate jurisdiction over the question, as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"To our way of thinking, though </span><span style="">the action is for
refund of taxes, yet the main question is the </span><span style="">le</span><span style="">gality or illegality of the assessment
involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Paragraph 3 of </span><span style="">Sec. 7 of Rep. Act
1125 above-cited speaks clearly the intention of Congress to give to the Court
of Tax Appeals the exclusive ap­pellate jurisdiction to determine the legality
of any assessment on real property arising under Assessment Law, otherwise known
as Commonwealth Act No. 470 as amended before whose Court the validity of said
assessment is at the present pending appeal as admitted by the plaintiffs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff is now riding, figuratively
speaking, on two horses, this Court and the Court of Tax Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two </span><span style="">laws, the Judiciary Act pursuant to Sec. 44 (b)</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and Republic Act 1125, Sec. 7(3),</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> both give jurisdiction to both the Courts
of </span><span style="">First
Instance and the Court of Tax Appeals to decide on cases in­volving the
legality of any tax or assessment involved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But while the Judiciary Act gives jurisdiction to Courts of First
Instance to decide on the legality of any tax or assessment involved in a
general way, Rep. Act 1125 which is a later Act than the Judiciary Act of 1948,
provides for the specific kind of tax or assessment the Court of Tax Appeals
can pass upon and among those specific taxes or assessment, is the assessment
or taxation of real property or other matters arising under the Assessment Law,
like the case at bar."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court, citing the cases of <span class="SpellE"><u>Ollada</u></span><u>

went onto "hold that the action involving the legality of the assess­ment
which is now before this Court and the Court of Tax Appeals should be decided
by that Court, though the question of refund over which the Court of Tax
Appeals has no jurisdiction, can be subse­quently brought to the court having
jurisdiction over the amount involved which in this case would fall under the
Municipal Court of the municipality where payments were made."</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs therefore filed this appeal, contending quite
plausibly on the strength of the ruling <span class="SpellE"><u>Cabanatuan</u></span>
that since they were cons­trained to pay the increased real estate taxes under
protest, their action for refund had properly <span style="">been </span>instituted in the lower court,
not­withstanding the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of their appeal to the
tax court challenging the validity of the increased assessment, since the tax
court had been held in <span class="SpellE"><u>Cabanatuan</u></span> to have no
jurisdiction over the refund of a real estate tax in appeals from an assessment
appeals board 'for the jurisdiction of that body. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>It is not extended to requiring the refund of
the tax."</p>

<p class="BODY">The ruling in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><u>Cabanatuan</u></span></st1:place></st1:city>,

to the effect that disputed assessments over real estate of the pro­vincial or
city assessor must under the Assessment Law (Common­wealth Act 470) be appealed
within the statutory period, <u>infra</u>, to the corresponding provincial or
city Board of Assessment Appeals and the tax court has <u>exclusive appellate

authority to order the refund of real estate taxes paid under a disputed

pronouncement to the contrary in the 1963 case of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Cabanatuan</span></u></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> cast a cloud of
uncertainty over the matter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The case at bar,

<u>Francisco</u> and <span class="SpellE"><u>Victorias</u></span> that actions

<p class="BODY">Under the Assessment Law, the assessment of all real pro­perty
within the province or city, i.e. the listing and valuation of real property
for purposes of taxation, is made by the provincial or city assessor.</p>

<p class="BODY">When a valuation is placed on property newly declared or when a
value greater than that stated in the declaration required of the owner (under
section 1 of Commonwealth Act 530), or where an existing assessment is
increased to an amount in ex­cess of that so stated, the assessor must
immediately give written notice of such assessment or increased assessment to
the owner.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

decided by the Court after the creation of the Court of Tax Appeals upon the
enactment on July 16, 1954 of Republic Act 1125, the Court noted that "the

involving a disputed land tax assessment of P595.92 on the public road built
within <span class="SpellE">Bislig's</span> concession, paid by it under protest
and <u>refund</u> of which was sought by it in the court of first instance, the
Court held that the case came under the tax court's exclusive and special
jurisdiction, but nevertheless deemed it "more expedition" to resolve
it on the merits on appeal (instead of ordering its remand to the <span style="">tax court) and to
affirm the judgment ordering refund, since the tax imposed on the public road
built by <span class="SpellE">Bislig</span> was clearly improper, as decided by
the court of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This early
1956 case was an action for <u>refund</u> of real estate tax paid under a
disputed assessment already filed and pending with the court of first instance
at the time of the enactment on June 16, 1954 of Republic Act 1125 creating the
tax court, and the Court held that it should have been properly certified and remanded
to the tax court "<u>for final disposition thereof</u>" as ordained
by Section 22 of said Act, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>'It is true that under section 22 of said Act the only cases that
are required to be certified and re­manded to the Court of Tax Appeals which
upon its approval are pending determination before a court of first instance
are apparently confined to those involving disputed assessment of internal
revenue taxes or custom duties, and the present case ad­mittedly refers to an
assessment of land tax, but it does not mean that because of the apparent omis­sion
or oversight the instant case should not be remanded to the Court of Tax
Appeals, for in inter­preting the context of the section above adverted to we
should not ignore section 7 of the same act which defines the extent and scope
of the jurisdiction of said court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>As
we have held in a recent case, 'sec­tion 22 of Republic Act No. 1125 should be
interpreted in such a manner as to make it harmonize with sec­tion 7 of the
same Act and that the primordial pur­pose behind the approval of said Act by
Congress is to give to the Court of Tax Appeals exclusive appel­late
jurisdiction 'over all tax, customs, and real estate assessment cases
throughout the Philippines and to hear and decide them as soon as possible</u>"
(<span class="SpellE">Ollada</span> vs. The Court of Tax Appeals, 99 Phil.,
604).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering this interpretation of
the law, it logically follows that the lower court did not act properly in
denying the motion to remand the ins­tant case to the Court of Tax
Appeals."</blockquote>

a 1964 case decided after <span class="SpellE"><u>Cabanatuan</u></span><u>,</u>
involved an action for <u>refund</u> of a protested land tax under a disputed
assess­ment filed by the taxpayer with the court of first instance in May, 1955
(when the tax court was already functioning), while her appeal from the
disputed ass<span style="">e</span>ssment was still
pending with the appeals assessment board.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court, through the now Chief Justice, <span style="">similarly upheld the court of first
instance's judgment of refund of the excessive land tax <span style="">assessed, </span>to serve "the ends of justice" since the case
had already lasted nine years and "the <span style="">assess­</span>ment complained of is manifestly <span class="SpellE">violative</span>

better had plaintiffs pursued their claim pursuant to Republic Act No. 1125, by

the in­tervention of this Court, instead of instituting this case in the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We note, however, that the defendants had advanced
this view in a motion to dismiss by them filed with the lower court <span style="">(pp. </span>7-8 Record on Appeal), and that
the same denied the motion <span style="">(pp. </span>18-21,

<p class="NUM">3. The Court, therefore, holds that the proper criterion for
determining whether an action for refund of real estate taxes paid should be
pursued before the tax court or the competent court of first instance as the court
of proper jurisdiction is whether the action for refund is based and dependent
on the outcome of a disputed assessment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>Where the right to a refund is necessarily dependent upon and a mere
incident of the action </u><u><span style="">contesting the decision upholding the real estate
tax assessment, the case falls within the exclusive and special jurisdiction of
the tax court, as in the case at bar</span></u><span style="">.</span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Here, plaintiffs concededly questioned the legality and validity
of the increased assessment against the real properties on the ground that it
violated the uniformity of taxation and equal protection clauses of the
Constitution and with respect to a certain lot at Dingle, which they had merely
conditionally purchased from the Development Bank of the Philippines, that the
institution's exemption from realty taxes inured to their benefit, and
therefore filed their appeal before the tax court, after being turned down by
the appeals assessment board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere
fact that they paid the realty taxes under protest during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of their appeal before the tax court did not
entitle them to file a separate and independent action for refund before the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> nor did it confer upon said court jurisdiction to act
upon their complaint for refund.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is self-evident that their action in the lower court for
refund of the realty taxes cannot be divorced from the action con­testing the
real estate tax assessment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In both
actions, the essential and ultimate question for resolution is whether or not
the assessment is erroneous or unlawful, as contended by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power and authority to determine such
question falls with­in the exclusive and special jurisdiction of the tax court,
and the resolution of this question would necessarily determine the merits of
the action in the lower court for refund itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their separate action for refund of the
realty taxes is necessarily dependent upon and merely incidental to the outcome
of their pending appeal in the tax court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The special jurisdiction of the tax court over the correctness and
validity of the assessment would unavoidably include with it <u>all incidental
matters</u> connect­ed thereto, more specifically, the refund of the taxes paid
by them, if they were to be upheld in their appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court has consistently held that a contrary rule, which would
uphold plaintiffs-appellants' stand "would result in a
'split-jurisdiction', which is not favored, and in multipli­city of suits, a
situation obnoxious to the orderly administra­tion of justice."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
A confused situation that would permit two courts of coordinate ranks, -
whether they be of equal jurisdiction, much less when one is of general
jurisdiction and the other is a collegiate court of special jurisdiction - to
take cognizance separately of the same question of legality of an assessment
and right to refund of the realty taxes paid and to hand down possibly two
conflicting and irreconcilable decisions, has never been favored by the Court,
for being inimical to the <span style="">orderly
processes of justice.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Again, for the same reason that the resolution of the claim for
refund would depend entirely upon the determination of the basic question of
correctness and validity of the assess­ment, and jurisdiction to decide this
question is lodged exclu­sively within the special jurisdiction of the tax
court, any reso­lution by the lower court of the question of refund - which
would necessarily call for and involve a resolution of the basic ques­tion of
correctness and validity of the assessment itself - would tend to encroach
upon, and render futile, the jurisdiction of the tax court conferred by section
7-(3) of Republic Act 1125.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus in the
analogous case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Pacis</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Averia</span>,</u><a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court held that courts of first instance have no jurisdiction to issue writs
of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> for personal property which is the
subject of forfeiture proceedings in the Bureau of Customs, since <span style="">the exercise </span>of such general
jurisdiction "tends to encroach upon and to render futile the jurisdiction
of the Collector of Customs in seizure and forfeiture proceedings" as well
as the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the tax court to review in due
course the Commissioner's decision on the collector's action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs-appellants in their reply brief have informed the
Court that their pending case in the tax court<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
was dismissed by the tax court in its resolution of October 22, 1965 for non­appearance
and failure to prosecute on their part, and now con­tend that there is no more
basis for the lower court's ruling that the main question of legality of the
reassessment or increased assessment pertains to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the tax court in said case, implying that the lower court may now alone rule on
their claim for refund.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to plaintiffs'
impression, however, the dismissal of their case disputing the assessment
before the tax court as the court of exclusive jurisdiction has now made the
assessment final and conclusive, and bars them from seeking the refund of the
taxes paid.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">4. <u>After reexamination and thorough analysis and consi­deration
of the law and precedents on the question, the Court therefore states, for the
guidance of bench and bar, that the Court of Tax Appeals, to the exclusion of
the courts of first instance, has special and exclusive appellate jurisdiction
over all cases where a real estate assessment is disputed as unjust, </u><u><span style="">erroneous and
improper, illegal or void, or excessive or unrea­sonable,</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></u></span></a><u><span style=""> after recourse to
the corresponding board of assessment appeals has failed, and even though the
disputed real estate tax has been paid</span></u><span style="">.</span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class="BODY">This restatement of doctrine overrules the holding in <span class="SpellE"><u>Cabanatuan</u></span> that a taxpayer who is <span style="">p</span>ressed for payment of <span style="">a real estate tax under a disputed assessment
upon pain of for­feiture of its properties and pays the tax under protest, may
forego the administrative remedy of appeal to the assessment appeals board and
eventual appeal to the tax court, and instead directly bring an action for
refund in the court of first instance on the premise - which the Court now
expressly rejects - that "if the real estate tax has already been paid it
is futile for a taxpayer to take the matter to the City Board of Assessment
Appeals for the jurisdiction of that body is merely confined to the
determination of the reasonableness of the assessment or taxation of the
property and is not extended to the authority <span style="">of requiring the refund of the tax unlike cases involving assess­ment
of internal revenue taxes."</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a><u><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In

the Court, aside from the considerations discussed in the preceding paragraph,
has been guided by the considerations that to require a piece-meal resort to
the tax court for a resolution of the issue only of the correctness and
validity or legality of the disputed assessment and another piece­meal resort
to the court of first instance for an award of the result­ing refund,
predicated upon the same issue, would sanction a proce­dure gravely detrimental
to the orderly administration of justice with unnecessary waste and duplication
of time, effort and expense, as well as render nugatory the primordial purpose
of the creation and grant of exclusive and special jurisdiction to the tax
court of providing a vehicle for "the expeditious determination of disputed
tax assessments" both in the interest of "prompt collection of
taxes" as well as of "the taxpayer and businessman (who) is as much
inter­ested as the Collector in the early and final determination of his
assessment."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">5. The tentative test for determining the proper court of
jurisdiction essayed in <st1:state><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><u>Victorias</u></span></st1:place></st1:state>
must be accordingly modified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The test
therein stated was that "where an assessment is illegal and void, the
remedy of a taxpayer, who has already paid the realty tax under protest, is to
sue for refund in the competent court of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, where the assess­ment is
merely erroneous, his recourse is to file an appeal in the Provincial Board of
Assessment Appeals within 60 days from receipt of the assessment," adding
the distinction that "(A)n assessment is illegal and void when the
assessor has no power to act at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is erroneous when the assessor has the power but errs in the exercise of that
power." It is difficult to find adequate support for this tentative test
between illegal­ity and error of the assessment in Section 7 of Republic Act
1125 which confers exclusive appellate jurisdiction upon the tax court to
review, without distinction, "decisions of provincial or city boards of
assessment appeals in cases involving <u>the assessment and taxation of real
property or other matters arising under the Assessment Law,</u> including rules
and regulations re­lative thereto." Furthermore, this test could not be
applied with practicality, since the property owner, in choosing the forum, would
have to anticipate as to what would ultimately be ruled by the courts as to
whether the assessment is illegal and void for lack of power on the part of the
assessor or whether the assessor merely erred in exercising his power, besides
the fact that an assessment is disputed many times for being both "illegal
and void" as well as "erroneous," as in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="NUM">6. The Court has therefore adopted the more simple test that <u>where
an assessment is disputed for whatever ground or reason, be it that the assessment
is unjust, erroneous or improper, illegal or void, or excessive or unreasonable</u>,
the action challenging the assessment, after first exhausting the
administrative remedy of appeal to the assessment appeals board, and <u>regardless
of whether the corresponding real estate tax has been paid and a refund sought</u>,
pertains to the exclusive and special jurisdiction of the tax court to the
exclusion of the courts of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, in the recently decided case of <u>Board of Assessment Appeals of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> Mining Co. and Court of Tax Appeals</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court upheld the jurisdiction of the tax court to rule upon the <u>legality
and validity</u> of the disputed real estate assessment, rejecting the con<span style="">tention therein that the property owner
should first pay the questioned realty tax before lodging an appeal from the
assessment appeals board's adverse decision to the tax court.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Where the realty assessment alone is disputed, since the tax has
not yet been paid, the tax court in its decision would rule upon the
correctness and validity of the assessment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Where the tax has in addition already been paid and a refund thereof is
sought, the tax court, if it rules <u>against</u> the correctness and validity
of the assessment, would in addition order the refund of the tax paid by the
property owner.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a></p>

5 SCRA 634.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case the Court
rejected the con­tention that <u>an original action for refund under a disputed
assessment</u> "should not be remanded to the Court of Tax Appeals because
it does not involve an appeal from the decision of a Board of Assessment
Appeals upon the theory that said Court is <span style="">merely </span>given appellate jurisdiction to
review by appeal, while the present case is an original action instituted to
test the legality of an assessment on the strength of our ruling in the case of

With the criterion and test of jurisdiction given in this decision, the writer
of the opinion believes that there would <span style="">be </span>hardly any case for refund of realty taxes that may hereafter <span style="">be </span>filed with the courts of first
instance as ordinary actions for re­covery of a sum of money due to the
property owner, since such refund cases invariably are essentially linked to a
disputed assessment or are brought to avoid and defeat the assessment itself
and would therefore pertain to the tax court's exclusive and special jurisdiction
after proper recourse to the assessment appeals board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be <span class="SpellE"><u>quaere</u></span>
if a case such as <u>NWSA vs. <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</u>, 23
SCRA 286 (1968) where NWSA filed an action <u>in the court </u><u><span style="">of first instance</span></u><span style=""> for recovery of
realty taxes <span class="SpellE">totalling</span> P984,494.51 from 1951 to 1962
"innocently paid (by it) despite its exemption, believing it was not
exempt" and was awarded a judgment of P55,160.15 representing the recovery
of only the 1961 realty tax duly paid under protest, (those paid for the other
years having been held to have prescribed after six years or to be
non-recoverable for lack of protest) would proper now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The action was filed after it had been held
in an earlier case properly instituted with the tax court, <u>Board of
Assessment Appeals of Laguna </u></span><i style=""><u><span style="">vs</span></u></i><u><span style="">. CTA and NWSA,</span></u><span style=""> 8 SCRA 225 (1963)
that NWSA properties were exempt by law from realty taxes, and hence, the
refund action was treated as a simple suit in the court of first instance for
recovery of sums of money representing the realty taxes 'innocently paid"
on exempt properties</span><span style=""> and
apparently involving no disputed assess­ment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, the questions of <span class="SpellE">NWSA's</span>
failure to appeal the assessment to the appeals assessment board within the sta­tutory
period and consequent forfeiture of any right to claim refund, under <span class="SpellE"><u>Victorias</u></span>, and as to whether the court of first
instance as against the tax court had jurisdiction to take cognizance of the
case, were not raised at all therein.</span></p>
