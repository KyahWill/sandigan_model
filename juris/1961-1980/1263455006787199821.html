				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In two <span style="">se</span>parate
actions, plaintiff-appellant <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Portland Ce<span style="">ment </span>Company sought to test the
validity of the <span class="SpellE">distraint</span> and thereafter the sale at
public auction by the principal defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
of 100,000 bags of cement for the purpose of satisfying its alleged deficiency
in the payment of the municipal license tax for 1960, municipal license tax for
1961 as well as the penalty, all in the total sum of P204,300.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court rendered a joint decision

case is now before us on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the appealed decision: "From all the evidence,
mostly documentary, adduced during the hearing the following facts have been
established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The efforts of the
defendant Treasurer to collect from the plaintiff the municipal license tax
imposed by Amended Ordinance No. 21, Series of 1959 on cement factories located
within the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
have met with rebuff time and again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
demands made on the taxpayer * * * have not <span style="">been entirely successful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
the defendant Treasurer decided on June 26, 1961 to avail of the Civil reme­dies
provided for under Section 2304 of the Revised Administrative Code <span style="">and gave the plaintiff a period of ten days
from receipt thereof with­in which to <span style="">settle
the </span>account, computed as follows * * *:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Deficiency Municipal License Tax for 1960 - P80,250.00; Municipal
License Tax for 1961 - P90,000. 00; and 20% Penalty - P34,050.00, stating in
exasperation. 'This is our last recourse as <span style="">we </span>had exhausted all efforts for an amicable solution of our
problem.'"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">was </span>further
shown: "On July 6, 1961, at 11:00 A.M., the defendant Treasurer notified
the Plant Manager of the plaintiff that he was '<span class="SpellE">distraining</span>
100,000 bags of <span class="SpellE">Apo</span> cement in satisfaction of your delinquency

notice was <span style="">received </span>by the
acting officer in charge of the plaintiff's plant, Vicente T. <span class="SpellE">Garaygay</span>, according to his own admission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first, he was not in accord with the said
letter, asking the defendant <span style="">Treasurer </span>for

<p class="BODY">As was noted in the decision, the defendant Treasurer in turn
"signed the receipt for goods, articles or effects <span style="">seized </span>under <span style="">authority of
Section 2304 of the Revised Administrative Code, certi­</span>fying that he has
constructively <span class="SpellE">distrained</span> on July 6, 1961 from the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Portland Cement Company at its plant at Tina-an, <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, 100,000 bags of <span class="SpellE">Apo</span> cement in tanks, and that 'the said articles or goods

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The lower court likewise
found </span>as a fact, that on the same day, July. 6, 1961, the municipal
treasurer posted the notice of sale to the effect that pursuant to the
provisions of Section 2305 of the Revised Administrative Code, he would sell at
public auction for cash to the highest bidder at the main entrance of the
municipal building of the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>, <span style="">Province </span>of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
Philippines on the 27th day of July, 1961, at 9 o'clock in the morning, the
property seized and <span class="SpellE"><span style="">distrained</span></span><span style=""> or levied upon from </span>the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Portland Cement Company <span style="">in satisfaction of the municipal license taxes and </span>penalties in
the amount of P204,300.00, specifying that what was to be sold was <span style="">100,</span>000 bags of <span class="SpellE">Apo</span>
cement.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
No sale, as thus announced, <span style="">was </span>held on <st1:date year="1961" day="27" month="7">July 27, <span style="">1961</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It
was likewise stated in the appealed decision that there was <span style="">s</span>tipulation by the parties to this
effect: "1. The auction sale took place on <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1962</st1:date>, * * *.

<p class="BODY">In this appeal from the above joint decision, <span style="">plaintiff-appellant
<span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Portland Cement Company upholds the view that
the <span class="SpellE">distraint</span> </span>of the <span style="">100,</span>000 bags of cement as well as the sale at public auction
thereafter made ran counter to the law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As earlier noted, we do not see it that way.</p>

 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Its contention is premised on the fact
that <span style="">in the
letter of defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> dated June 26, 1961,
requiring plaintiff-appellant to settle its account of P204,300.00, it was
given </span>a period of <span style="">10 </span>days
from receipt within which it could pay, failure to do so being the occasion for
the <span class="SpellE">distraint</span> of its property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is now alleged that the 10-day period of
grace was not allowed to lapse, the <span class="SpellE">distraint</span> having
taken place on <st1:date year="1961" day="6" month="7">July <span style="">6, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the <span style="">Revised
Administrative Code: "The </span>remedy by <span class="SpellE">distraint</span>
shall proceed as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the
failure of the person owing any municipal tax or revenue to pay the <span style="">same, </span>at <span style="">the time </span>required, the municipal
treasurer may seize and <span class="SpellE">distraint</span> any personal
property belonging to such person or any property subject to the tax lien, in
sufficient quantity to satisfy the tax or charge in question, together with any

<p class="BODY">The clear and explicit language of the law <span style="">leaves no room for </span>doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The municipal treasurer "may seize and <span class="SpellE">distrain</span> any personal property" of the individual or
entity subject to the tax upon failure "to pay the same, at the time
required * * *."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There <span style="">was </span>such a
failure <span style="">on </span>the part of
plaintiff-appellant to pay the municipal tax at the time required.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power of the municipal treasurer in
accordance with <span style="">the </span>above
provision therefore came into play.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Whatever might have been
set forth in the letter of the municipal treasurer could not change or amend
the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has to be enforced as
written.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was what the lower court
did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was done then cannot be
rightfully looked upon as a failure to abide by what the statutory provision requires.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Time and time again, it has been repeatedly
declared by this Court that where the law speaks in clear and categorical
language, there is no room for interpretation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is only room for application.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That was that occurred in this case.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

the validity of the auction sale</u> – The validity of the auction sale held on
<st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1962</st1:date> is
challenged in the next two errors assigned as allegedly committed by the lower
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff-appellant's argument is
predicated on the fact that it was not until <st1:date year="1962" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1962</st1:date> that it was notified that the public
auction sale was to take place on <st1:date year="1962" day="29" month="1">January
 29, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is its view
that under the Revised Administrative Code<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
the sale of the <span class="SpellE">distrained</span> property cannot take place
"less than twenty days <span style="">after
notice to the owner or possessor of the property [<span class="SpellE">distrained</span>]
* * * and the publication or posting of such notice."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Why such a contention could not prosper is explained clearly by
the lower court in the appealed decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus: "With respect to the claim that the auction sale held on
January 30, 1962 pursuant to the <span class="SpellE">distraint</span> was null and
void for being contrary to law because not more than twenty days have elapsed
from the date <span style="">of </span>notice, it is
believed that the defendant <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Naga</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
and Municipal Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> have substantially
complied with the requirements provided for by Section 2305 of the Revised
Administrative Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the time that
the plaintiff was first notified of the <span class="SpellE">distraint</span> on <st1:date year="1961" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1961</st1:date> up to the date of the
sale on <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1962</st1:date>,
certainly, more than twenty days have elapsed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the sale did not take place, <span style="">as
</span>advertised, on July 27, 1961, but only on January 30, 1962, it was due
to the requests for deferment made by the plaintiff which unduly delayed the
proceedings for collection of the tax, and the said taxpayer should not be
allowed now to complain that the required period has not yet elapsed when the
intention of the tax collector was already well publicized for many
months."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
The reasonableness of the above observation of the lower court cannot be
disputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circum­stances, the
allegation that there was no observance of the twenty-day period hardly carries
conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The point is further made that the auction sale took place not on
<st1:date year="1962" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1962</st1:date>, as stated
in the notice of <span style="">sale, </span>but on
the next day, <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to plaintiff-appellant: "On
this score alone, the sale * * *, was illegal as it was not made on the time
stated in the notice."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no basis to sustain such a plea as the finding of the
lower court <span style="">is </span>otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "On <st1:date year="1962" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1962</st1:date>, the defendant Treasurer informed <span class="SpellE">Garaygay</span> that he would cause the <span class="SpellE">readvertisement</span>
for sale at public auction of the 100,000 bags of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Apo</span></st1:place> cement which were under constructive <span class="SpellE">distraint</span> * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
January 19, 1962, the said defendant issued the corresponding notice of sale,
which fixed January 30, 1962, at 10:00 AM., as the date of sale, posting the
said notice in public places and delivering copies thereof to the interested
parties in the previous notice, * * *.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ultimately, the bidding was conducted on that day, <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1962</st1:date>, with the representatives of the
Provincial Auditor and Provincial Treasurer present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only two bidders submitted sealed bids.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the bidding, the defendant-Treasurer

<p class="BODY">This being a direct appeal to us, plaintiff-appellant must be
