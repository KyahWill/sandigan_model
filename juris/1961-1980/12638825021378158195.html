<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">On </span></span><st1:date year="1975" day="17" month="7"><span class="GramE"><span style="">July 17, 1975</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="">, Regional Office No.</span></span><span style=""> VII rendered a decision awarding death
compensation to herein petitioner (Annex B, pp. 11-12, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent sought a reconsideration
of this award, which was denied by Regional Office No. <span class="GramE">VII,</span>
and the case was elevated to the Commission for review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1975" day="31" month="12"><span style="">December
 31, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
Commission ordered the dismissal of the case in a decision (Annex A, pp. 8-9,
rec.), the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"After duly considering the facts of the case, this Commission
finds that this claim for death compensation benefit has prescribed already in
view of the fact that ten years had elapsed before the same was filed and,
therefore, the same may not anymore prosper as claims under the provisions of
the Workmen's Compensation Act prescribes after 10 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view thereof, the petition for review of
respondent is hereby granted and this case is ordered dismissed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On February 2, 1976,
petitioner through counsel received her copy of the Commission's decision dated
December 31, 1975, and on the same date filed a motion for reconsideration
(Annex D, pp. 15-16, rec.) of the decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner instituted
present petition dated </span><st1:date year="1976" day="5" month="5"><span style="">May 5, 1976</span></st1:date><span style=""> pending resolution by the Commission of her
motion for reconsideration dated </span><st1:date year="1975" day="2" month="2"><span style="">February 2, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1976" day="11" month="8"><span style="">August
 11, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">, this COURT
resolved to treat the petition as a special civil action and to require both
parties to submit simultaneous memoranda.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent employer had
renounced its right to controvert this claim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The records show that after respondent company's physician recommended <span class="SpellE">Baterna's</span> separation from the service due to his illness,
which eventually resulted in his death, it did not file the prescribed notice
of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> as required by Section 45 of the
Workmen's Compensation Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
contrary, as a result thereof, respondent paid him gratuity benefits on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="21" month="4"><span style="">April
 21, 1964</span></st1:date><span style=""> (p. 51,
rec. of WCC, RO7-18373).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Incidentally,
though, this payment may not validly be pleaded as a defense due to
non-compliance with certain requisites established by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the company's notice of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> of this claim (p. 52, rec. of WCC, RO7-18373)
filed on </span><st1:date year="1974" day="7" month="11"><span style="">November 7, 1974</span></st1:date><span style=""> on </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">ground that the
illness did not arise out of or in the course of employment was deemed to have
been filed out of time and the defense invoked therein deemed waived.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Be that as it may, even
on the merits, the disputable presumption that the illness of deceased employee
arose out of his employment or at least was aggravated by such employment
because it supervened at the time of his employment, has not been sufficiently
rebutted by the regional medical officer's findings that <span class="SpellE">Hodgkins</span>
disease is a disease of the node and non-nodal lymphatic tissues, the etiology
of which is unknown and its causal relation to the employment is still open to
further studies (pp. 27-28, rec. of WCC, RO7-18373).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts are clear and <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span>
that deceased employee <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> <span class="SpellE">Baterna</span>
died on October 25, 1964 and that his widow, petitioner herein, filed her claim
for death compensation on October 22, 1974 - a period of 9 years, 11 months,
and 27 days after employee's death, which is certainly well within the ten-year
period prescribed by law for the filing of such claim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It would appear that the
Commission has adopted private respondent's contention that the ten-year
prescriptive period should be reckoned from </span><st1:date year="1964" day="6" month="1"><span style="">January 6, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, the date when deceased employee was
disabled due to illness which caused his separation from the service and
ultimately his death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this argument
is clearly untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a claim
for death benefits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Logically, the
prescriptive period should run from the date of employee's death and not from
the date when he contracted the illness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Likewise of no merit is
respondent company's argument that petitioner is barred from claiming death
compensation because she has failed to make a demand for such claim within 3
months after employee's death in accordance with the Workmen's Compensation
Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This COURT has ruled that the failure
to file the claim within the period provided in Section 24 of the Workmen's
Compensation Act does not affect the jurisdiction of the Commission </span>to
entertain said claim, more especially where there is no showing that the
employer sustained damage by such delay or failure (ibid).</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, this COURT has given due course to this petition pending
resolution by respondent Commission of a motion for reconsideration filed by
petitioner on February 2, 1975, the same date when she received a copy of the
Commission's decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, respondent
company's contention that this petition has been filed beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period is baseless.</p>
