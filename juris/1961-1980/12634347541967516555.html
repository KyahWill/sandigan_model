				<H3>THE OVERSEAS BANK OF MANILA, PETITIONER-APPELLANT,
VS. HON. AMBROSIO M. GERALDEZ, PRESIDING JUDGE OF BRANCH I, COURT OF
FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, TEODOSIO VALENTON AND ANDRES A. JUAN, RESPONDENTS-APPELLEES.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Overseas Bank of Manila appealed under Republic Act No. 5440
from the orders of the Court of First Instance of Manila, dated January 4 and
February 9, 1977, dismissing, on the ground of prescription, its complaint
against <span class="SpellE">Teodosio</span> <span class="SpellE">Valenton</span>
and Andres A. Juan for the recovery of the sum of one hundred fifty thousand
pesos plus twelve percent interest <u>per</u> <u>annum</u> from February 17,
1966 and ten percent of the amount due as attorney's fees (Civil Case No. 105037).</p>

<p class="BODY">The allegations in the complaint dated October 15, 1976, which
were admitted hypothetically by <span class="SpellE">Valenton</span> and Juan,
are that on February 16, 1966 they obtained from the bank a credit
accommodation of P150,000, which was secured by a chattel mortgage, and that
written extrajudicial demands dated February 9, March 1 and 27, 1968, November
13 and December 8, 1975 and February 7 and August 27, 1976 were made upon the
debtors but they refused to pay on the ground that their obligation was assumed
by a third party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bank alleged that
the supposed assumption of obligation was made without its consent.</p>

<p class="BODY">In dismissing the complaint the trial court reasoned out that,
because the bank's cause of action accrued on February 16, 1966 (the date of
the manager's check for P150<span class="GramE">,000</span> issued by the
plaintiff bank to the Republic Bank) and as the complaint was filed on October
22, 1976 or more than ten years from the accrual of the cause of action, the
complaint was barred by the statute of limitations.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the interruption of the ten-year period by the written
extrajudicial demands, the trial court held that a demand letter tolls the
prescriptive period only for the period of time indicated in the letter within
which payment should be made and prescription commences to run again after the
expiration of that period and no payment is made.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court observed that, because in the demand letters no
period of payment was indicated, that would mean that payment should be made
within <u>one day</u> and, therefore, the six demand letters interrupted the
prescriptive period for six days only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(The trial court noted that the seventh demand letter dated August
27, 1976 was sent when the ten-year prescriptive period had allegedly expired.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court ruled that the action, which should have been
filed within ten years expiring on <st1:date year="1976" day="15" month="2">February
 15, 1976</st1:date>, was extended for <u>six days only</u> or up to <st1:date year="1976" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1976</st1:date>, and consequently,
according to its ratiocination, the action was filed out of time on <st1:date year="1976" day="22" month="10">October 22, 1976</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue is as to the effect of the bank's demand letters on the
prescriptive period or whether the action had already prescribed.</p>

<p class="BODY">We<span style=""> hold that the lower
court erred in holding that each of the demand letters suspended the
prescriptive period for one day only.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The interruption of the prescriptive period by written <span class="SpellE">extrajuducial</span> demand means that the said period would
commence anew from the receipt of the demand.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That is the correct meaning of interruption as distinguished from mere
suspension or tolling of the prescriptive period.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">An action upon a written contract must be brought within ten
years from the time the right of action accrues (Art. 1144[1], Civil Code).
"The prescription of actions is interrupted when they are filed before the
court, when there is a written extrajudicial demand by the creditors, and when
there is any written acknowledgment of the debt by the debtor" (Art. 1155,
<u>Ibid</u>, applied in Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> &amp; Sons,
Inc. vs. City of Manila, 117 Phil. 985, 993; Philippine National Bank vs.
Fernandez, L-20086, July 10, 1967, 20 SCRA 645, 648; Harden vs. Harden,
L-22174, July 21, 1967, 20 SCRA 706, 711).</p>

<p class="BODY">Interruption of the prescription of actions by means of a written
extrajudicial demand by the creditor is a rule of civil law origin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 1973 of the old Civil Code, from
which article 1155 was taken, provides that "la <span class="SpellE">prescripcion</span>
de <span class="SpellE">las</span> <span class="SpellE">acciones</span> se <span class="SpellE">interrumpe</span> <span class="SpellE">por</span> <span class="SpellE">su</span> <span class="SpellE">ejercicio</span> ante <span class="SpellE">los</span> <span class="SpellE">Tribunales</span>, <span class="SpellE">por</span> <span class="SpellE">reclamacion</span> extrajudicial <st1:state><st1:place>del</st1:place></st1:state>

demand and the acknowledgment should be in writing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A written extrajudicial
demand wipes out the period that has already elapsed and starts anew the
prescriptive period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Giorgi</span>

<p class="BODY">Under article 1973, it was held that if the action for the
collection of a sum of money accrued on August 31, 1897 and there were written <span style="">extrajudicial </span>demands by the <span style="">creditor </span>in 1906, 1907 and 1910, the
fifteen-year period for enforcing that kind of personal action had not elapsed
when the action was filed on July 18, 1913 (<span class="SpellE">Marella</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Agoncillo</span>, 44 Phil. 844, 854-5).</p>

<p class="BODY">That same view as to the meaning of interruption was adopted in <span class="SpellE">Florendo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Organo</span>, 90 Phil.
483, 488, where it ruled that the interruption of the ten-year prescriptive
period through a judicial demand means that "the full period of
prescription commenced to run anew upon the cessation of the suspension". <u>"When
prescription is interrupted by a judicial demand, the full time for the
prescription must be reckoned from the cessation of the interruption</u>"
(Spring vs. Barr, 120 So. 256 cited in 54 C.J.S. 293, note 27).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That rule was followed in <span class="SpellE">Nator</span>
and Talon vs. CIR, 114 Phil. 661, <span class="SpellE">Sagucio</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Bulos</span>, 115 Phil. 786 and Fulton Insurance Co. vs. Manila Railroad
Company, L-24263, November 18, 1967, 21 SCRA 974, 981.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> case of <u>Spring vs.
Barr</u>, which was decided under the Civil Code of Louisiana, the one-year
prescriptive period was interrupted by the filing of an action in July,
1923.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The action was terminated on <st1:date year="1926" day="2" month="3">March 2, 1926</st1:date> after the plaintiff was <span class="SpellE">nonsuited</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1926" day="10" month="6">June 10, 1926</st1:date>, the plaintiff renewed
the action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was held that the first
case interrupted the one-year period and after its termination, the one-year
period started to run again from March 2.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The second suit, filed on <st1:date year="1926" day="10" month="6">June
 10, 1926</st1:date>, was filed on time.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <span class="SpellE"><u>Florendo</u></span> case, a judgment
for support against the husband and in favor of the wife was rendered by this
Court on <st1:date year="1935" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1935</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Organo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Florendo</span>, 61 Phil.
1028, unpublished).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1943, in an action
for divorce filed by the husband against the wife, the latter filed a
counterclaim for the payment of the unpaid installments of support decreed in
the 1935 judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those installments
dated as far back as <st1:date year="1932" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1932</st1:date>,
having been fixed in an earlier judgment dated <st1:date year="1909" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1909</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was held that each monthly installment prescribed in ten years
but the prescriptive period was interrupted by the filing of the action which
culminated in the 1935 judgment already mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ten-year period commenced to run anew
from <st1:date year="1935" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1935</st1:date> when the
said judgment was rendered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1943,
when the counterclaim for support was filed in the divorce suit, the said
ten-year period had not yet completely run out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the counterclaim for support was not barred by prescription.</p>

<p class="BODY">Interruption of the prescriptive period as meaning renewal of the
original term seems to be the basis of the ruling in Ramos vs. <span class="SpellE">Condez</span>, L-22072, <st1:date year="1967" day="30" month="8">August
 30, 1967</st1:date>, 20 SCRA 1146, 1151.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">It was held that the vendees' action against the vendors on the
basis of the said deed of sale, which action was filed on <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="5">May 22, <u>1963</u></st1:date>, had not prescribed because

31, 1969, 26 SCRA 722, it appears that <span class="SpellE">Gabino</span> Marquez
executed on June 24, 1950 a promissory note wherein he bound himself to pay to
the <span class="SpellE">Namarco</span> P12,000 in installments within the

on <st1:date year="1964" day="16" month="12">December 16, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They contended that the action had prescribed
