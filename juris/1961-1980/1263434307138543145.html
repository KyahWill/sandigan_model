<p class="BODY">The foregoing facts are as testified to, among others, by Lourdes
Trinidad, particularly on her having seen in the evening of record, from the window
of her father's house, where she was living together with her brother, the
victim Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cabalona</span>
<span class="SpellE">Salik</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abonawas</span> Abdul and
Tongan <span class="SpellE">Dimatingcal</span>, standing <span style="">by </span>the gate of their family residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She recognized them well because they used to
frequent her store, but after her brother had disappeared after being brought
away by the two on the same night aforementioned, the said group stopped going
to the store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Through <st1:city><st1:place>Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city>'
testimony, it was also proven that <span class="SpellE">Cabalona</span> <span class="SpellE">Salik</span> volunteered to secure the release of Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> for a ransom of P10,000.00, naming the persons who were
detaining Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After three days of futile search, he was
given P50.00 for gasoline expenses by Eduardo's mother.</p>

<p class="BODY">The finding of the dead body of the victim on <st1:date year="1966" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1966</st1:date> along the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Linek</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Awang</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Airport</st1:placetype></st1:place> road, an uninhabited place
near bushes, was testified to by two farmers, <span class="SpellE">Juliano</span>
and Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Pantorilla</span>, father and son, respectively,
who identified the dead body as that of Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
by means of a picture of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With the wounds found on the body, there could be no doubt th<span style="">a</span>t his death was brought about by foul
means.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u><span style="">corpus</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>delicti</u></span> </span>was thus proven through the
testimonies of the state witnesses, <u><span style="">corpus</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>delicti</u></span>
being </span>the fact of the commission of the crime--the death caused by a
criminal act.</p>

<p class="BODY">The aforementioned witnesses <span style="">had </span>no motive to testify falsely against the appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is significant to note that even the
victim's sister, <st1:city><st1:place>Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city>, did not
point to the appellants herein with a directly accusing finger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She named three other persons as the ones who
spirited away <span style="">her </span>brother, never
more to come home alive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
prosecution were bent merely to have appellants convicted at all cost, as only
the two of them were present to face trial, Lourdes should have been made to
point to appellants directly as <span style="">the
ones who called for her brother to come down his house, and led him away </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">his death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The candor of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Lourdes</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> as a witness is thus amply demonstrated
which makes her worthy of credence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The other two state witnesses, father and son, <span class="SpellE">Juliano</span> and Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Pantorilla</span>,
are simple farmers who absolutely had no reason <span style="">to </span>testify having seen the dead body of the deceased unless they
had really seen and identified the corpse as that of Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were aware
that their testimony was being used against the appellants, who were just two
of the eight accused, all Muslims generally feared for their unquenchable
thirst for vengeance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only their sense
of truth could have made them hold to perform a civic public duty, but with so
much risk as intimated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The discrepancies pointed to by appellants in the testimony of
the <span class="SpellE">aforenamed</span> witnesses, could not detract from the
veracity of the essential fact testified to, which is none other than their
having <span style="">seen </span>the body of a person
whom they identified to be that of the victim through a picture shown to
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their credibility remains solid,
unimpaired by inconsistencies that are patently attributable only to the
frailty of memory, not to a <span class="SpellE">wilful</span> desire to commit
falsehood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This usually happens in
recalling dates that do not impress themselves deeply for one reason <span style="">or </span>another, to which the
inconsistencies allegedly committed refer.</p>

<p class="BODY">With such independent and very credible proof of the <u><span style="">corpus <span class="SpellE">delicti</span></span></u><span style="">, </span>as has just been shown, it cannot be
success­fully contended that the extra-judicial confessions of <span style="">ap­</span>pellants would not suffice to form
the basis of their <span style="">con­</span>viction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule is well-settled that an
extra-judicial confession, if corroborated by proof of the <u><span style="">corpus <span class="SpellE">delicti</span></span></u><span style="">, </span>independent of the confession itself
would be sufficient basis for conviction.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The only question that remains to be answered is whether the
extra-judicial confessions of the appellants are admis­sible in evidence with
their claim of having been tortured into making them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, by the abundance of
details which could not have been set forth in the confes­sions except by the <span class="SpellE">declarants</span> themselves, so evident on the face of the
confessions, particularly the mention of the names of their confederates who
went into hiding, including the individual role and distinct participation
performed <span style="">by </span><span style="">each, </span><span style="">the <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> of the confession is
vividly manifested.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, the facts proven by evidence outside of the sworn
statements of appellants tally with those found in the said statements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precautions were taken to insure against the
possibility of successful repudiation of the statements by appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were asked to sign their statements only
after it was made certain that they knew and understood what they were swearing
to, and the con­sequences of their act of signing the affidavits under
oath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, proper translation of the
questions and answers in said affidavits was made <span style="">by </span>reliable officials, the Deputy Clerk of Court and the Court
Interpreter, for appellants <span class="SpellE">Guiaman</span> and <span class="SpellE">Kudanding</span>, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Familiar with the last refuge usually taken to by accused with
extra-judicial confession by repudiating such confession, in desperate attempt
to escape conviction, these court officials must have done their job
conscientiously to maintain the integrity of the confessions and insure their
admissibility.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, to foreclose any claim of torture or of being placed
under pressure in the taking of the statement, appellants were brought to a
physician for an examination of their bodies for any external sign of
violence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctor certified to having
found no signs of <span style="">injury </span>or
violence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the bare allegation
of maltreatment against the investigators mouthed by the appellants them­selves,
without corroboration of any sort, cannot over­come the presumed regularity of
the performance of official duty, as well as the presumed <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span>
of the confession itself.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing discussion, We find no merit in appellants'
assignments of error which the court <u>a</u> <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> </span>allegedly
committed (1) in admitting their extra-judicial confessions; (2) in not
considering the discrepancies in the testimonies of the witnesses for the
prosecution; and (3) in holding that evidence of <u><span style="">corpus</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>delicti</u></span> </span>has been established by the
prosecution by means of evidence inde­pendent of their extra-judicial
confessions.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the court <u>a</u> <u><span style="">quo</span></u> should not have considered nighttime as an aggravating
circumstance, the same being already absorbed by treachery which was alleged as
the qualifying circumstance of murder.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Nevertheless, with two remaining aggravating circumstances:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) <span style="">use </span>of motor vehicle, and (2) isolated
place, <span style="">with </span>no mitigating
circumstance to offset them, and pursuant to Article 48 of the Revised Penal
Code which directs the imposition of the maximum of the penalty for the more
serious offense when the crime committed is a <span style="">complex </span>crime, the imposition of the death penalty is
inevitable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, We are constrained to affirm, <span style="">as </span>We do hereby
affirm, the judgment of conviction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, in accordance with the recommendation contained therein We
hereby impose the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>
on each of herein appellants, instead of death as meted but by the trial court,
pursuant to the provisions of the <st1:place>Mindanao</st1:place> and <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span> Code, appellants herein being Moslems or
non-Christians.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, as recommended
by the Solicitor General, the indemnity of P6,000.00 <span style="">is </span>hereby raised to P12,090.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
With the modifications as are above in­dicated, the decision appealed from <span style="">is </span>affirmed in all other respects,
with costs.</p>
