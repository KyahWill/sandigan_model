<blockquote><span style="">In Criminal Case No. 2578,
the Court after having been convinced beyond the realm of reasonable doubt of
the guilt of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Fustigo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Demen</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Pavia</span>, Felipe Benavides

to undergo subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, by reason of the
nature of the penalty imposed; and to pay the costs of this proceeding on equal
basis.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the decision, the trial court - pursuant to the Revised Penal
Code, Article 5 - recommended to the President, through the Secretary of
Justice, with respect to the accused <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>,
"that executive clemency be extended to him, or that at least his death
penalty be minimized or commuted to life imprisonment." The court so
recommended because "the testimony of this accused had contributed in a
large measure to the Court in its pursuit of truth and justice in these
cases." It should be stated here that by resolution of <st1:date year="1966" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1966</st1:date>, the Court noted the
contents of de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>'
motion withdrawing his appeal in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that on <st1:date year="1958" day="18" month="12">December
 18, 1958</st1:date>, the Anderson <span class="SpellE">Fil</span>-American
Guerrillas (AFAG) held a general meeting at the <span class="SpellE"><u>bahay-pulungan</u></span>
of the religious sect known as <span class="SpellE">Watawat</span> Ng <span class="SpellE">Lahi</span> at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Buragwis</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The locale of the meeting was so chosen because
many AFAG members are also <span class="SpellE">Watawat</span> members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the accused, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>,
presided over the meeting, which was attended by more than a hundred
members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Borja</span>,
who has the rank of a full colonel, is the AFAG head for the entire <span class="SpellE">Bicol</span> region, which is said to have 36,000 members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had good news for the members:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he announced that their <span class="SpellE">backpay</span>
was forthcoming at the rate of P36<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> for a
ranking officer, and a lesser amount for those of lower rank.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the meeting ended, <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> called an
exclusive conference among selected officers and members, including the other
accused <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Pavia</span>, <span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Demen</span>, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Fustigo</span>, Felipe Benavides, <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>
de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Alejo</span> <span class="SpellE">Balimbing</span>, and Tito <span class="SpellE">Oljina</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(The last
two, now deceased, are referred to in the title of this case as John Doe and
Richard Doe).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the secret meeting, <span class="SpellE">Balimbing</span> proposed to <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> that
they conduct a raid the following morning at the Hacienda San Miguel, located
at <st1:place><st2:sn>San</st2:sn> <st2:middlename>Miguel</st2:middlename> <st2:sn>Island</st2:sn></st1:place>,
across the bay from <span class="SpellE">Tabaco</span>, <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That same evening, <span class="SpellE">Demen</span>
cleaned a .45 caliber pistol.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
conference over, all eight men slept in the <span class="SpellE"><u>bahay-pulungan</u></span><u>.<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">When they woke up the next day, <st1:date year="1958" day="19" month="12">December 19, 1958</st1:date>, the eight men held an early-morning
conference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Balimbing</span>
aired to <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> his grievances against Santiago <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span>, Jr. the manager of the hacienda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Balimbing</span> charged
that it was <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span> who killed <span class="SpellE">Balimbing's</span>
cousin at <span class="SpellE">Rawis</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tabaco</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Albay</span></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Balimbing</span> further
complained that it was <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span> who ordered that the <span class="SpellE">camote</span> plantations of the hacienda squatters - who were
related to <span class="SpellE">Balimbing</span> - should be bulldozed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that <span class="SpellE">Balimbing</span>
was only rehashing what he had already related to <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>
several months before, at the AFAG regional headquarters at <span class="SpellE">Pili</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.</st1:place></st1:country-region></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">That same morning, the eight men left by bus

had two pistols tucked in a shoulder holster; <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pavia</span></st1:place></st1:city> had a .45 caliber pistol; <span class="SpellE">Balimbing</span> had a hunting knife with a scabbard; and <span class="SpellE">Fustigo</span> had a pistol.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were attired as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Borja</span> wore a khaki suit, black jacket, <span class="SpellE">buri</span>
hat, and sunglasses; <span class="SpellE">Demen</span> wore a khaki suit; <span class="SpellE">Fustigo</span> wore a blue shirt and khaki pants; de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Santos wore a red T-shirt, brown jacket, and <span class="SpellE">maong</span> pants; Benavides wore denim pants and printed polo shirt;
<span class="SpellE">Pavia</span> wore a striped polo shirt and denim pants with
jacket; <span class="SpellE">Balimbing</span> wore white pants; and <span class="SpellE">Oljina</span> wore a brown polo shirt and khaki pants.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Tabaco</span>, the group went to Barrio San
Jose, where they ate breakfast at the house of de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
<st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>' brother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon <span class="SpellE">Borja's</span>
instruction, <span class="SpellE">Balimbing</span> hired a motorboat operated by
Mariano <span class="SpellE">Burac</span>, who observed at the trial that the
eight men acted suspiciously and conferred <u>sotto</u> <u>voce</u> among
themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They crossed the bay, and
the group disembarked at the hacienda.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At a seashore conference, they agreed to pose as members of the
Philippine Constabulary, ostensibly on a mission to inspect the firearms of the
hacienda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this time, <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> started to wear a pair of white gloves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They proceeded on their way, and <span class="SpellE">Balimbing</span> tried to open the bamboo gate of the fence
surrounding the manager's house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
accosted by Emilio <span class="SpellE">Lanon</span>, a security guard and barrio
lieutenant of the hacienda, who was later one of the principal eyewitnesses for
the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Balimbing</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Lanon</span> knew each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Balimbing</span>
introduced his companions as PC officers and soldiers, identifying <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> as a major and <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pavia</span></st1:place></st1:city> as a sergeant.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <span class="SpellE">Lanon's</span> advice, <span class="SpellE">Balimbing</span>
proceeded to the office and emerged with <span class="SpellE">Salustiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Isorena</span>, the hacienda overseer. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">Isorena</span> told <span class="SpellE">Lanon</span> to inform <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span> about
the presence of the visitors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, on <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pavia</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="SpellE">'s</span>
advice, he and <span class="SpellE">Isorena</span> went to the house, where <span class="SpellE">Isorena</span> informed Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span>
about the visitors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gancayco's</span> suggestion, the group went to the office to wait
for <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span>, who arrived later.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span> shook hands with <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> and <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pavia</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He offered <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> a
pack of cigarettes, from which <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> took one
stick.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Informed of the group's alleged
mission, <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span> instructed <span class="SpellE">Isorena</span>
to present the license of the firearms.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But <span class="SpellE">Isorena</span> failed to find the license in the
office, so <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span> went to the house to look for it
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While in the house, he instructed
his wife to prepare a meal for the guests.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span> returned to the office, gave
the license to <span class="SpellE">Isorena</span>, and then left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Isorena</span> presented
the license to <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>, who remarked that the license
listed only five firearms, as against reports received at the headquarters in <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> that there were ten firearms in the hacienda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Borja</span> then ordered <span class="SpellE">Isorena</span> to produce the firearms for inspection; <span class="SpellE">Isorena</span>, in turn, instructed <span class="SpellE">Lanon</span>
to get the firearms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lanon</span>
went to the house and obtained a carbine, the magazine of which he removed; as
well as a shotgun.</p>

<p class="BODY">On his way back to the office, he met de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
<st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> and <span class="SpellE">Oljina</span>,
who took the firearms and the magazine from him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Isorena</span> again
instructed <span class="SpellE">Lanon</span> to get the other firearms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In compliance, <span class="SpellE">Lanon</span>
sent Jaime <span class="SpellE">Rawit</span> to get the grease-gun from <span class="SpellE">Lanon's</span> house, while <span class="SpellE">Lanon</span>
himself went to <span class="SpellE">Gancayco's</span> house to get another
grease-gun which had no magazine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Rawit</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lanon</span> met at <span class="SpellE">Gancayco's</span> house and from there, while <span class="SpellE">Lanon</span>
was carrying the two grease-guns, he met <span class="SpellE">Demen</span> and
Benavides, who took them away.</p>

<p class="BODY">The group had now succeeded in obtaining possession of four of
the five firearms, and they were not able to get the one remaining firearm only
because it was with <span class="GramE">an</span> hacienda employee guarding
cattle some kilometers away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An
atmosphere of menace descended on the hacienda as the men loaded the firearms
and took a hostile stance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An apprehensive
<span class="SpellE">Isorena</span> asked the equally perturbed <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span> for instructions, but was only cautioned to remain
calm and deal courteously with the group, as <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span>
had already sent someone to <span class="SpellE">Tabaco</span> to request police
assistance.</p>

<p class="BODY">During this time, <span class="SpellE">Balimbing</span> was
investigating <span class="SpellE">Lanon</span> inside the bodega.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lanon</span> was
surrounded by <span class="SpellE">Balimbing</span> with a hunting knife, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pavia</span></st1:place></st1:city> with a .45 caliber pistol,
and Benavides with a grease-gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
course of his interrogation, <span class="SpellE">Balimbing</span> told <span class="SpellE">Lanon</span> that they were going to kill <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Isorena</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lanon</span>, and one
Pablo <span class="SpellE">Balimbing</span>, chief herder of the hacienda,
because these employees were bootlickers to the <span class="SpellE">Gancaycos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then <span class="SpellE">Balimbing</span>
pushed <span class="SpellE">Lanon</span> out of the bodega.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span> and <span class="SpellE">Isorena</span>
were talking at the balcony of the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were approached by <span class="SpellE">Demen</span> who had a
grease-gun, and <span class="SpellE">Oljina</span> who had a shotgun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>De <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
with a carbine posted <span class="GramE">himself</span> under the citrus tree
near the water tank in front of the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span> asked to see a search warrant from <span class="SpellE">Demen</span> and <span class="SpellE">Oljina</span>, who referred
him to <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span> and <span class="SpellE">Isorena</span>
descended and inquired for the warrant from <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>,
who was standing in front of the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instead of replying, <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> talked to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pavia</span></st1:place></st1:city>, who was near the
guardhouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Borja</span>
then called <span class="SpellE">Balimbing</span> and, referring to <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span> and <span class="SpellE">Isorena</span>, ordered him
to "fix them up" since it was already getting on towards <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">noon</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Borja</span> herded the other men of the hacienda inside the
bodega, where they were guarded by Benavides who was armed with a <span class="GramE">grease-gun,</span> and <span class="SpellE">Fustigo</span> with a
pistol. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">Borja</span>
faced the hacienda personnel, holding in readiness his two pistols.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lanon</span> stood in
front of him, facing out of the bodega.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, <span class="SpellE">Balimbing</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pavia</span></st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Demen</span>,
de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>,
and <span class="SpellE">Oljina</span> escorted <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Isorena</span> towards the office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Isorena</span> went up the
stairs and turned around when he reached the top; behind him, de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> held
a carbine in a ready position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Benavides
asked <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span> for the magazine of the grease-gun he
was holding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span>
answered that it had no magazine, Benavides accused him of lying and sideswiped
him with the grease-gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then Benavides
left for the bodega.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now the men surrounded <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span> in
front of the office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Facing him was <span class="SpellE">Balimbing</span>, who was swinging his hunting knife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also facing <span class="GramE">him</span>, to <span class="SpellE">Balimbing's</span> right, was <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pavia</span></st1:place></st1:city> whose jacket, draped over

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Balimbing</span> accused <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span>
of killing <span class="SpellE">Balimbing's</span> cousin, and demanded that <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span> produce the .45 caliber pistol which he claimed
was used to perpetrate the death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span> explained <span style="">that
it was not he but Solon <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> who accidentally
shot <span class="SpellE">Balimbing's</span> cousin, and that <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span>
had no such pistol.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pavia</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> interjected that it was unbelievable for <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span>, as manager of the hacienda, not to have such a

insisted that there was none.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While this exchange was taking place, <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span>,

<p class="BODY">The trial judge characterized this narration of the shooting of <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span> and <span class="SpellE">Isorena</span> as both
watertight and airtight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He found that
the tenor of the evidence presented - consisting in the main of the testimony
of <span class="SpellE">Isorena</span>, an eyewitness; and of the accused de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Santos, who testified for the state during <span class="SpellE">Borja's</span> separate trial - was confirmed by the testimonies
of the medico-legal expert and the ballistician.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He noted that the five accused who were separately
tried from <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> admitted all the facts leading to
the shooting, but interposed the common defense of fear of <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>,
who, they claimed, had threatened disobedient AFAG members with death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was not persuaded and he
discounted this common defense, characterizing it as "an after-thought to
save their respective skins in the face of the overwhelming evidence of the
prosecution pointing to their voluntary participation in the commission of the
crimes of murder and frustrated murder." Instead, the trial judge found
that the five men participated in the killing "because they were inspired
by the juicy thought or promise of an enormous amount of <span class="SpellE">backpay</span>
for each."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Borja</span>, who was still at large at the
time the five accused were being tried, had a separate trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court found that he "has a
version entirely distinct and separate from that of the five accused, which
version in turn is astronomically far from the evidence presented by the
prosecution." <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> washed his hands <span style="">of any complicity in the killing which he
sought to lay at <span class="SpellE">Balimbing's</span> door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conveniently for <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Balimbing</span> is dead and cannot tell his tale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But like his colleagues, <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>
failed to convince the trial judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Noting that <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> was the commanding
officer of eight AFAG regiments in the entire <span class="SpellE">Bicol</span>

trial court refused to believe that <span class="SpellE">Balimbing</span> openly
defied <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> by instigating the sanguinary episode at
the hacienda.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, the trial
court declared: "The contrary was the real and painful truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pedro <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> was the
leader of the group that raided Hacienda San Miguel, and he was the very one
who ordered the liquidation of Santiago <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span>, Jr.

established" and that "the guilt of all the accused has been
established by proof above the shadow of doubt." It found that the killing
of <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span> constitutes murder, while the shooting of
<span class="SpellE">Isorena</span> constitutes frustrated murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court held that either evident
premeditation or treachery qualifies the crimes to murder and frustrated
murder; since the law requires only one qualifying circumstance, the other
should be considered as an aggravating circumstance.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found five aggravating circumstances against <span class="SpellE">Fustigo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Demen</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pavia</span></st1:place></st1:city>, Benavides, and de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>, to

<p class="BODY">With respect to Pedro <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> in both
cases, the trial court considered against him four aggravating circumstances,
consisting of the five above-mentioned, but excluding the promise of <span class="SpellE">backpay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It found
another aggravating circumstance in the case of frustrated murder, i.e. dwelling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, in the case of frustrated murder, it

court having been found to be a faithful narration of the incident as related

<p class="BODY">The five accused <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> the
findings of the trial court that there were five aggravating circumstances in
the case for murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, they contended
that the trial court should have appreciated only three aggravating
circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They reasoned that any of
the alleged aggravating circumstances should necessarily be absorbed to qualify
the crime of murder, thereby leaving only four aggravating circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, they argued that the aggravating
circumstance of promise of <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> was not alleged in
the information, and consequently should not be taken as an aggravating
circumstance.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find that the trial court correctly considered that either
treachery or evident premeditation qualifies the crime to murder, and hence the
other alternative circumstance should be considered as aggravating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We reject the contention of the five accused;
for while it is true that the aggravating circumstance of promise or reward was
not alleged in the information, nevertheless, it was proven during the trial,
and therefore can be considered as a generic aggravating circumstance, though
not a qualifying circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People of the Philippines vs. Navarro, et al., L-20860, November
28, 1964, 12 SCRA 530).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, as <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> contends, <u>infra</u>, the
other aggravating circumstances are absorbed by <span class="SpellE"><u>alevosia</u></span>
or treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, if it is treachery
which is considered as the qualifying circumstance, there remain two generic
aggravating circumstances which attended the com­mission of the two crimes with
respect to the five accused:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>evident
premeditation; and promise or reward (which does not apply with respect to <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>.)</p>

<p class="BODY">The five accused contended that there were three mitigating
circumstances in their favor:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>lack of
instruction; fear of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>; and lack of
motive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no merit in this
contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The argument of lack of
instruction is based on the allegation that the five accused did not finish
primary education.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the defense
adduced no proof to establish the existence of this circumstance, leaving in
full force the holding that extenuating circumstances must be proven positively
and cannot be based on mere deduction or inference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(PP. vs. <span class="SpellE">Sakam</span>, et al., 41566, December 7, 1934, 61 Phil. 27).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>If by "lack of instruction" the
defense refers to illiteracy, it is not sufficient to constitute a mitigating
circumstance, for there must also be lack of intelligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(PP. vs. <span class="SpellE">Gorospe</span>, L-10644-45, February 19, 1959, 105 Phil. 184; PP.

<p class="BODY">The second mitigating circumstance advanced by the five accused
is "awe and fear of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>." But the
element of fear is not one of those enumerated as a mitigating circumstance
under the Revised Penal Code, Article 13.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the defense refers to the element of "uncontrollable fear or
duress" which is an exempting circumstance under the Revised Penal Code,
Article 12, the argument is still invalid, for it has been held that the
element of duress should be based on real, imminent, or reasonable fear for
one's life or limb and should not be speculative fanciful, or remote fear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(PP. vs. <span class="SpellE">Quilloy</span>, No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-2313, </span><st1:date year="1951" day="10" month="1"><span class="GramE">January 10, 1951</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 88 Phil. 53).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
find no evidence to support the claim that <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>
threatened any or all of the other accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">The third alleged mitigating circumstance is lack of motive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are hard put to discuss this contention
because the Revised Penal Code, Article 13 does not include "lack of
motive" as one of the mitigating circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, the defense argues that "the
undiplomatic attitude of <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span> and <span class="SpellE">Isorena</span>, bordering on provocation" should be considered
as another mitigating circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
contention is not borne out by the evidence; on the contrary, it appears that
instead of being "undiplomatic", <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span>
was pacific, and he <span class="SpellE">counselled</span> <span class="SpellE">Isorena</span>
that "the best thing for us to do is to talk to them peacefully and follow
them, whatever they want." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>.

remaining assertion of the five accused the claim that "the alleged
premeditated conspiracy to kill <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span> was not
clearly revealed in the records of the case." We shall discuss this
assertion in dealing with the defense of <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Brief for the defendant-appellant Pedro <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>, the defense contended that since a separate trial
was held for <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>, the trial court erred in
rendering a single decision on which the findings of facts respecting <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>, based on evidence adduced during his separate trial,
are not distinctively set forth, thereby prejudicially impairing <span class="SpellE">Borja's</span> substantial rights.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We find no such impairment of the rights of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence shows that the prosecution
established the same facts in the two separate trials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Isorena</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lanon</span> testified as eyewitnesses to the incident of <st1:date year="1958" day="19" month="12">December 19, 1958</st1:date>; de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
testified as an eyewitness not only to the same incident, but also to events
before and after the shooting, showing conspiracy among the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other persons testified in both trials to
supply corroborating evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Borja</span> also contended that the trial
court erred in not according credence to <span class="SpellE">Borja's</span>
defense and in finding him guilty on the basis in part of what is alleged to be
incompetent evidence adduced not at his separate trial but at that of his
co-accused, and in not acquitting him upon the ground that his guilt was not
proven beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
a blanket allegation which can be dealt with summarily, because the testimonies
of common witnesses in both trials clearly establish facts incriminatory to <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More
specifically, <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> contended that the trial court
erred in finding that a conspiracy existed between <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>
and his co-accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find this
contention to be an excursion outside the perimeters of credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Borja</span> was the AFAG
commander for the <span class="SpellE">Bicol</span> region.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the second secret conference, he donned
spurious armed forces get-up, complete with uniform and two guns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he was introduced to the hacienda
personnel as a PC major in command of the group, it does not appear that he
raised any protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, the
evidence shows that he issued the order to <span class="SpellE">Balimbing</span>
to "fix them up," referring to <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span> and
<span class="SpellE">Isorena</span>; and he also issued the order "<span class="SpellE"><u>Habulin</u></span><u>!</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Habulin</u></span>!"
when <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span> ran for his <span style="">life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Borja</span>
consistently acted the leader as he led the dash for illicit freedom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He led the group in fleeing the island; instructed
that the firearms should be secreted away in a jute sack; and ordered his men
to separate into two groups when his group was surrounded by <span class="SpellE">Tabaco</span> policemen near <span class="SpellE">Tiwi</span>, where
<span class="SpellE">Borja</span> led the gunfight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">He eluded his trackers for more than two months until his
capture. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>To flee the fold of the law is

uncontested actions would be gratuitous and illogical, unless located within

SCRA 388; PP. vs. Peralta, L-19069, October 29, 1968, 25 SCRA 759; PP. vs. <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>, L-26867, June 30, 1970, 33 SCRA 812).</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Borja</span> further contended that assuming
his criminal liability, the trial court erred in appreciating the qualifying
circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation; and the generic
aggravating circumstances of band or aid of armed men; use of means to weaken
the defense; craft, fraud, and/or disguise.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This contention for the first part flies in the face of the
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Treachery was present because <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span> was killed while he was unarmed, and surrounded by
enemies with firearms, including two grease-guns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Gancayco</span></span><span style=""> was deprived of any means of defense while his enemies were exposed to
no risk arising from the defense which the offended party might have made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True, <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> was
inside the bodega when the shooting took <span class="GramE">place</span>; at his
physical absence does not exonerate him, for it was he who ordered the execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, where there is conspiracy,
treachery is considered against all the offenders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(PP. vs. <span class="SpellE">Carandang</span>, et al., 32039, February 26, 1930, 54 Phil. 503).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The aggravating circumstance of evident
premeditation was sufficiently proved, for prior to the shooting on December
19, 1958, the accused met in two secret conferences and discussed the raid on </span>the
hacienda in order to avenge themselves by exacting redress from <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span> for allegedly killing <span class="SpellE">Balimbing's</span>
cousin and bulldozing the <span class="SpellE">camote</span> plantations of <span class="SpellE">Balimbing's</span> relatives.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, <span class="SpellE">Borja's</span> contention for the
second part is well taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense
argues that the circumstance of band and aid of armed men, cannot be taken
separately from the circumstance of use of means to weaken the defense, and advantage
of superior strength.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was correctly
pointed out that all these circumstances are absorbed in treachery and may not
be considered independently.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(U.S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Estopia</span>, et al., No. 9411, September 29, 1914, 28 Phil. 97;

was also correctly pointed out that treachery absorbs the circumstance of
craft, fraud and disguise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(PP. vs. <span class="SpellE">Malig</span>, et al., L-2083, May 30,
1949, 83 Phil. 804).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
this leaves the aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation, which
applies to all the accused; and the aggravating circumstance of promise of <span class="SpellE">backpay</span>, which applies to all the accused, except <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> contended that, assuming
he is criminally liable, the trial court erred in not according him the benefit
of the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not view this as error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>
did not surrender but was captured on <st1:date year="1959" day="27" month="2">February
 27, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His own witness,
Captain <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> <span class="SpellE">Farol</span> of the
Armed Forces of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
testified that he received a report that <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> was
holed up at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Sumakap</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cavinte</span>,
<span class="GramE">Laguna</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, he sent a ranger team which located the house and called on
<span class="SpellE">Borja</span> to come down.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As <span style="">the house was surrounded by
soldiers, <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> offered no resistance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Capt. <span class="SpellE">Farol</span> also
testified that while <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> was at large, he killed a
PC soldier in an armed encounter at <span class="SpellE">Catanauan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, as a result of which he was indicted for murder in
the court of first instance in that province.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Capt. <span class="SpellE">Farol</span> also declared that a prize of </span><span style="">P2<span class="GramE">,<span style="">000.00</span></span></span><span style=""> was
put on <span class="SpellE">Borja's</span> head for being a dangerous
fugitive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are not indicia of the
personality seeking voluntary surrender.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Mr. Santiago <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span>, Jr., manager of
a 1,700-hectare hacienda and scion of a prominent family, is dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His demise when he was only in his early
thirties was rendered more tragic in that he breathed his last in the bosom of
his grieving family, consisting of his wife and six small children, in the
course of his flight from ostensible visitors who had suddenly been transformed
into cold-blooded killers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Rizalino</span> Reyes, Chief of the Medico-Legal Division of the
National Bureau of Investigation who performed an autopsy on the body of
Santiago <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span>, Jr. testified that his death was
due to hemorrhage, severe, secondary to multiple gunshot wounds of the body and
that shock, traumatic was contributory.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was abundantly established in the trial court that his killing was
attended by treachery, which qualifies the crime committed by the perpetrators
into murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">Five of the accused, namely:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pedro <span class="SpellE">Fustigo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Demen</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Pavia</span>, Felipe Benavides and <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>
de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Santos have been in custody since December 19,
1958, or shortly thereafter; while Pedro <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> was
apprehended on February 27, 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can
thus be seen that all of them have been under detention for over twenty years.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of the lower court in Criminal

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">CONCURRING
OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BARREDO, <i>J.</i>:<span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I concur, and I would like to explain why I am voting to impose
upon appellants the penalty of <u>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></u>
in Criminal Case No. 2578, the murder case, notwithstanding that the record is
clear that the commission of said offense was attended by aggravating
circumstances not correspondingly offset by any mitigating circumstances, for
which reason, by mandate o<span style="">f </span>Art.
64 (4) of the Revised Penal Code in relation to its Article 248, the penalty
legally imposable is death.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been my insistent position ever since I joined this Court
ten years ago that the imposition of the penalty in capital <span class="GramE">offenses,</span>
is a matter of strict law and does not and may not be based on the individual
feelings of the Justices, singly or jointly, about the propriety or impropriety
of the death penalty <u>per se</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, when the required number of Justices are agreed on the
guilt of the accused as well as the existence of any aggravating circumstance
which under the above-mentioned provisions of the Code require the imposition
of the death penalty, in my view, it is not for any of us to say that he votes
for a lesser penalty simply because he does not believe in the death penalty
itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is because we have sworn to
apply the law regardless of our personal predilections, and in the premises
just indicated, it leaves us no other alternative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, I have always maintained that just as
the Court would not countenance any trial judge doing less than what the
Revised Penal Code requires under the proven circumstances <span style="">of </span>any case, no member of the Court
may refuse to vote for the imposition of death in appropriate instances, unless
he expressly makes an individual finding or holding that the circumstances
warranting the imposition of such penalty do not in his judgment appear.</p>

<p class="BODY">A general statement in the decision that for lack of necessary
votes, life imprisonment is being imposed does not reflect who o<span style="">f </span>the Justices have not voted for the
death penalty and their reasons <span style="">for </span>their
votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such a situation, it follows,
in my humble opinion, <span style="">that </span>there
is no way of knowing whether or not the finding or holding <span style="">of </span>the existence or non-existence of
the pertinent aggravating circumstances is justified or not, and consequently,
it would be d<span style="">ifficult to ascertain
whether or not the legal norms established by the code and by jurisprudence
have been observed and worse, whether or not justice has been done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, I do not deny the prerogative of
any member of the Court to act according to he dictates of his conscience, but
I am unable to discern how</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">anyone of us can ignore the unequivocal and
terse injunction of the Constitution that "<span class="GramE">any</span>
Member dissenting from a decision -- and non-conformity with the penalty
imposed in the main opinion is a dissent -- shall state the reasons for his
dissent." (Section 8, Article X, Constitution of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.) <span class="GramE">Which, of course, means
that the reasons must be of law and justice and all the parties and the people
have a right to know them.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am not
certain that the sense of responsibility which should be assumed motivate every
Justice of the Supreme Court can sufficiently justify the omission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, therefore, I deem it imperative that I should
give my legal reasons for my vote that herein appellants should be penalized
only with life imprisonment despite my being convinced on the basis of the
evidence on record that aggravating circumstances attended their commission of
the crime the Court has found them to be guilty of.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated in the main opinion, all the appellants have been under
detention for more than twenty years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>More than that, they have been living under the shadow of a sentence of
death since <st1:date year="1960" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1960</st1:date>,
almost nineteen years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the light
of these facts, I hold that while unquestionably, appellants deserved the death
penalty at the time they were sentenced by the trial court, the passage of so
many years of mental torture under the deplorable conditions obtaining in the
national penitentiary during all those years has transformed that penalty into
a cruel one within the contemplation of the human proscription of the
Constitution against the inflicting of cruel and unusual punishment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Section 21, Bill of Rights.)</p>

<p class="BODY">It was certainly no fault of appellants that proceedings leading
to their final conviction by this Court now have been prolonged beyond the
reasonable period for the purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
it is hardly <span style="">of </span>any materiality
at this juncture, to inquire where the fault for such a happenstance actually
lies, for it cannot lessen the extreme agony they have already undergone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do not believe it can be denied that living
under the shadow of a sentence of death for more than ten years, what with the
deplorable conditions in the death row and other parts of our national
penitentiary, is a life that can be worse than death itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, <span class="GramE">such an unusually
long waiting amounts to cruelty, which should never be added -- and the law,</span>
I dare say, does not contemplate that it may be added -- to the penalty of
death.</p>

<p class="BODY">I do not believe that any new legislation <span style="">is needed to legalize this </span>position of
mine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is my considered opinion and I
so hold t<span style="">hat </span>the prohibition in
the Bill of Rights of the Constitution that no "<span style="">cruel </span>or unusual punishment" shall be "inflicted"
operates <u>ex <span class="SpellE">propio</span> <span class="SpellE">vigore</span></u>
upon the legislature, the courts and the executive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it may be said it contemplates any
proceeding where some kind of punishment<span style="">
is imposed, whether criminal, civil, or administrative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Withal, I maintain that just as under our
jurisprudence in civil cases, even a final judgment may not be executed
pursuant to its specific terms when circumstances intervene that would make
such rigorous execution inequitable, similarly, the imposition of the capital
penalty under circumstances more afflictive and painful to the culprit than it
should normally be should not be done.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If it is borne in mind that in <span style="">all
</span>civilized countries of the world where the death penalty is still in <span style="">vogue, </span>every effort is always made to
make its execution as painless and as humane as possible -- thus, the electric
chair and the gas chamber in lieu of hanging or other more cruel means -- one
cannot but realize that to add years and years of detention to the death
penalty itself is revolting to one's sense of humanity and justice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It goes without saying that the Supreme Court can itself prevent
the occurrence of such situation as herein contemplated -- by hastening the
disposition of the unusual number of appeals involving capital offenses pending
before it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is easier said than
done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Multiple compelling factors have
contributed to cause such a lamentable backlog, and while remedial measures
being taken may eventually minimize or altogether solve the problem, what is
important at the moment <span style="">is </span>that
we cannot escape the reality that until the desired improvement shall have
materialized something has to be done for the poor innocent victims of the
situation, in the interest of humanity and justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before closing, I would like to make of record that I have
proposed to the Court that this position of mine be adopted as a general rule
to be observed in the cases before <span class="GramE">Us</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I regret I have not been heeded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some members of the Court feel that there are
cases wherein the accused really deserve to be punished strictly <span style="">in </span>accordance with the applicable
provisions of the Revised Penal Code because of the undeniable atrociousness
and viciousness or obvious incorrigible criminal perversity characterizing the
commission of the offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I respect
their views, but I submit that the injunction of the Constitution against
"cruel and unusual punishment" contemplates the most heinous crime
conceivable and yet does not distinguish.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the cases I have in mind, there is no justification for adding, in
effect, another penalty to the one prescribed by the Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, if the law says the penalty should be
death and no more, how can we impose an additional penalty of prolonged
detention thru no fault of the convict?</p>
