</span><st1:date year="1972" day="30" month="9"><span style="">September 30, 1972</span></st1:date><span style="">, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cutaran</span> of <span class="SpellE">Bayombong</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>, charged
Judge Solomon Villanueva of the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Ambaguio</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>, with being
"always absent from (his) official station and yet received full salary
every month." The complaint also included as respondents several other
municipal judges, a fiscal and a BIR provincial officer charging them likewise
with other alleged irregularities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In his comment of </span><st1:date year="1973" day="3" month="1"><span style="">January
 3, 1973</span></st1:date><span style="">, respondent
Judge Villanueva denied the accusation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He categorically stated that the complainant is nowhere to be found in <span class="SpellE">Bayombong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According
to him, even the postal employees of <span class="SpellE">Bayombong</span> tried
hard to locate the complainant because there are three (3) letters of the
Department of Justice addressed to him which are still undelivered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also explained that complainant, in
connection with the charge of "absenteeism" might b</span><span style="">e</span><span style="">
referring to the time when he was detailed for three months with the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>,
Branch II, or during the rainy season when the mountain trails are impassable
due to mountain slides and he had to hold office at a Sub-Office established at
barrio <span class="SpellE">Masok</span> with the concurrence of other municipal
officials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent concluded that his
service record and communications with the Department of Justice will bear out
his travails and hardships.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot give due course to this unverified complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be stressed that administrative complaints
are accusatorial in nature, hence, they should be subscribed and sworn to and
accompanied by such testimonial and/or documentary evidence as will evince respondent's
culpability and thus bring him within the supervisory power of this
Tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that the charge is
a mere conjecture, surmise or inference.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Administrative charges against judge cannot be based on mere suspicion,
surmise or inference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant
has the burden of proof and such proof must be solid, clear and convincing to
compel the exercise of disciplinary power over the person indicted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the comment of respondent Judge is satisfactory.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> this administrative complaint against Municipal
Judge Solomon Villanueva is dismissed for lack of merit.</p>
