original measurement - 8 meters wide - of the dead end of <span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span>
Street are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) Resolution No. 132,
Series of 1961, authorizing the lease by the City of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
(hereinafter referred to as the City) to Shell Company of the Philippines,
Limited (Shell, for short) of Lot 25 of the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
Market Subdivision and a portion of <span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span> Street
abutting said lot; and (2) Resolution No. 215, Series of 1961, amending the
first mentioned resolution by authorizing the vacation of the leased portion of
<span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span> Street and the conversion of the remainder
by the side thereof into an alley of 5 meters wide (4 meters in actual
use).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff wants these resolutions
stricken down as invalid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court
below ruled in the negative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This appeal
is the offshoot.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1957" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1957</st1:date>,
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Favis</span> bought a parcel of land of about 1,000
square meters - <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2-E-3-B-3-B-2 of the subdivision
plan (LRC) Psd-2179 - from the Assumption Convent, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said lot is bounded on the southwest by <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
2-E-3-B-3-B-1 (proposed road), owned by Assumption Convent, Inc. and part of
subdivision plan Psd-2179.</p>

<p class="BODY">Simultaneous with the sale, Assumption donated to the City -
"for road purposes" - the lot indicated in its subdivision plan as
the proposed road - <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2-E-3-B-3-B-1 aforesaid, <span class="GramE">This</span> donated road is used by <span class="SpellE">Favis</span>
as his means of egress and ingress from his residence to a public street called
<st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span>
  Street</st1:address></st1:street> is actually <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 27
in the amendatory plan (Bcs-56-Amd <u>2</u>, Residence Section "B")
and is a portion of a big tract of land registered in the name of the City,
known as <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> Market Subdivision, for all of which
the City holds Transfer Certificate of Title No. 2208.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It branches out to various parts of the
market subdivision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From its

it abruptly ends as it meets portions of two lots - the donated road
aforementioned and the lot owned by <span class="SpellE">Olmina</span> Fernandez
(<st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2-E-3-B-1-A, Bsd-26963).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fernandez' lot is fenced, with buildings; and
there is a sharp depression of at least 2 meters at the precise point it meets <span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span> Street.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ocular inspection conducted by the trial court dis­closed that at the
exact connecting <st1:street><st1:address>point of <span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span>
  Street</st1:address></st1:street> and the donated road (which leads to
appellant's land)<span class="GramE">,</span> the road opening is only 2.5 meters
wide.</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 25 of the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
Market Subdivision is northernmost in said subdivision and contains an area of
approxi­mately 400 square meters.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Immediately next to it, to the north, is the lot of <span class="SpellE">Olmina</span>
Fernandez aforesaid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As far back as
June, 1947, the City, by virtue of Resolution No. 115, Series of 1947, of the
City Council of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>, leased this <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
25 to Shell for a ten-year period renewable for another ten years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shell constructed thereon a service station
of about 335 square meters.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="10" month="5">May 10, 1961</st1:date>,
the City Council of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> passed Resolution No. 132
authorizing the City thru its Mayor to lease to Shell two parcels of land
described as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"A parcel of land, known as Lot No. 25, of the Market
Subdivision and shown as <span class="GramE">‘</span><st1:place><span class="GramE">Lot</span></st1:place><span class="GramE"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>A'</span> on Sketch Plan x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> marked 'Exhibit A' and made a
part hereof, situated in the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
containing an area of 335 sq. m.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">and</span></p>

<blockquote>"Also a parcel of land containing an area of 100 sq. m. more
or less, marked as 'Lot B' on Sketch Plan x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>".</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Lot 25 (Lot A), it is to be noted, is the same lot leased to
Shell way back in June, 1947 and the lease of Lot B is merely an addition
thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This additional area, taken
from <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>
is five (5) meters wide and twenty (20) meters long and abuts <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
25.</p>

<p class="BODY">About three weeks later, the City, thru its Mayor, entered into a
formal contract of lease with Shell.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Shell filed an application with the Office of the City Engineer
of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> for a building permit for the cons­truction
of a new and bigger gasoline station on the leased premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said office, in a letter to the City Council
thru the City Mayor dated June 30,1961, noted that the leased "[l]<span class="SpellE">ot</span> 'B' which consists of 100 square meters is exactly
within the road right-of-way of <span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span>
Street," is for public use, and may not be leased.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="5" month="7">July 5, 1961</st1:date>,
appellant Antonio C. <span class="SpellE">Favis</span> lodged a letter-protest
against the additional lease made in favor of Shell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claimed that it would diminish the width
of <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>
to five meters only; that it would destroy the symmetry of the said street thus
making it look very ugly; and that the City was bereft of authority to lease
any portion of its public streets in favor of anyone.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apparently to obviate any and all objections to the lease of the
additional area to Shell, the City Council of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>,
on July 19, 1961, passed Resolution No. 215, amending Resolution No. 132,
Series of 1961, by converting that "portion of <span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span>
Street lying southeast from Lot B of the sketch plan prepared March 10, 1961 by
Private Land Surveyor Perfecto B. <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>, beginning
at this portion's intersection with <span class="SpellE">Dagohoy</span> Street,
into an alley 5.00 meters wide (4 m. now in actual use); declaring for this
purpose, that said Lot B shall not be a part of this alley."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1961</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Favis</span> commenced suit for the annulment of the lease
contract with damages in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
He prayed that (1) defendants be ordered to stop, remove and/or demolish
whatever constructions had been introduced at the additional leased area on <span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span> Street; (2) the building permit and con­tract of
lease entered into by and between the defendants be cancelled and revoked for
being null and void; and (3) defendants be directed to pay, jointly and
severally, actual, compensatory, corrective and consequential damages <span class="SpellE">totalling</span> P50,000, attorneys' fees in the sum of P2,000,
and the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing, the lower court, on <st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="5">May 21, 1962</st1:date>, rendered judgment upholding the two
questioned resolutions and dismissing the complaint, with costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">We first address ourselves to the preliminary questions raised in
the appeal.</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Amongst these is appellant's charge that the
resolutions directing the partial closing of <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street> and the lease
thereof are invalid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, so
appellant avers, those resolutions contravene the City Charter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He relies on subsection (L) of Section 2553
of the Revised Administrative Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
provides that the powers granted to the City - including the power to close
streets - shall be carried "into effect by ordinance."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This objection is directed at form, not at substance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been held that "even where the
statute or municipal charter requires the municipality to act by ordinance, if
a resolution is passed in the manner and with the statutory formality required
in the enactment of an ordinance, it will be binding and effective as an
ordinance."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Such resolution may operate regardless of the name by which it is called.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Resolutions No. 132 and 215, Series of 1961, were una­nimously
approved with all the councilors present and voting, carried the seal of the
city council, were signed by the City Vice-Mayor, the Presiding Officer, approved
by the City Mayor, and attested by the City Secretary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the presumption of validity of the
resolution and the other presumption that official duty has been regularly
performed, the embattled resolutions are just as good as ordinances and have
the same force.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant cites lack of
advertisement or direct notice to owners of contiguous properties whose rights
might be affected, as another ground to show invalidity of the
resolutions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent provision of
the charter reads, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> to
carry into effect by ordinance the powers hereinbefore granted in this sub­section,
but no ordinance shall provide for more than one project of any of the kinds
named herein, nor create more than one district, as­sessment, and fund
necessary and appropriate <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, and <u>in each
and every such ordinance provision shall</u> be made for notice to any and all
persons interested, giving them and each of them not less than two weeks from
and after the date of depositing a notice in the post-office at <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> in a securely sealed post­paid wrapper addressed to
each person affected thereby and assessed <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>
at his last known place of residence, or at <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> if
no place of residence is known, or to an agent who may be or may have been
appointed by such person in writing, in which to appear and file objection to
either the <u>work</u> itself, the method or <u>manner of assessment</u>, the
time or times and method of <u>payment</u> <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
or to all thereof, and such other and further objection or objections as may
seem to any such person or persons reasonable and proper in the premises:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>such notice shall set forth the nature of the
proposed <u>improvement</u>, the estimated <u>cost</u> <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
the total <u>amount of the assessment</u> to be levied <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
and the amount <u>to be levied upon each parcel</u> of the property or
possession of the addressee; any and every such appearance and objection shall
be made and heard only before the city council, and council may, at any such
hearing alter, modify, or increase the area of such district, the total assessment
thereof, or any individual area or assessment objected to therein, and shall
decide any and ever such objection within ten days after the filing thereof and
give notice of such de­cision to the person or persons interested in the manner
hereinbefore provided for no­tice of such assessment within five days
thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>"<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The requirement of notice specified in the afore-quoted provision
of the city charter is not applicable to the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will be observed that the notice is to be
given "to <span class="GramE">any,</span> and all persons interested",
to be placed in a securely sealed postpaid wrapper addressed "to each
person affected thereby and <u>assessed <span class="SpellE">thereunde<span style="text-decoration: none;">r</span></span></u>." The
accent is on the word <u>and</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
person "affected" must also be "assessed".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And then, "such notice shall set forth
the nature of the proposed improvement, the estimated cost <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
the total amount of the assessment to be levied <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
and the amount to be levied upon each parcel of the property or possession of
the addressee." In turn, the council, after hearing objections, may
"alter, modify, or increase the area of [the] district, the total assess­ment
thereof, or any individual area or assessment ob­jected to therein."</p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly then, this method of giving notice applies only when an
ordinance calls for an assessment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
that where no assessment has been made or is to be made, such notice need not
be given.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the resolutions in question do not at all
call for any kind of assessment against appellant or his land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the notice that appellant would want
to have, need not be given.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, appellant did actually protest Resolution 132
authorizing the lease to Shell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
protest was, however, overruled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the
council passed Resolution 215, in effect, confirming the lease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of notice - on the assumption
that appellant is entitled thereto - is <span class="SpellE">subserved</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant has no cause for complaint.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We now direct attention
to appellant's plaint that the questioned resolutions narrowed down, much to
his prejudice, the width of <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span>
  Street</st1:address></st1:street> at its connect­ing point with the donated
road which, in turn, leads to his land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reduction of the usable width from 8 meters to 4 meters cannot be
done, so he argues, because said resolutions violate Executive Order No. 113,
Series of 1955, issued by President Ramon <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>,
particularly the fol­lowing:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.3in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">"IV. MUNICIPAL ROADS:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>All highways not included in the above classifications, Municipal
and <u>city roads shall have a right-of-way of not less than ten (10) meters</u>;
provided that the principal streets of town sites located on public lands shall
have a width of sixty (60) meters and all other streets a width of not less
than fifteen (15) meters."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We do not go along with appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">First, because the 2.5
meter opening connecting the donated road and </span><st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Lapu­-Lapu</span></span><span class="GramE">
  Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span class="GramE"> has always been
that wide since the donated road was opened.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that this opening is 2.5 <span class="GramE">meters,</span> is confirmed by the ocular inspection personally
made by the trial judge himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
occupancy by Shell of a portion of the road right-of-way did not in any way put
appellant to any more inconvenience than he already had.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>His outlet of </u><st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE"><u>Lapu-Lapu</u></span><u> Street</u></st1:address></st1:street><u>
of 2.5 meters still remains the same</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the second place, the resolutions in question do not have the
effect of decreasing the width of the opening because said opening is far from
the leased portion of <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span>
  Street</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
said leased portion is on the left side of <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Lapu-­Lapu</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, whereas the
opening lies on the right-uppermost part of <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That leased strip does not reach said
opening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, while the lease
contract authorized Shell to take 5 meters wide of <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, Shell occu­pied
only 4 meters wide.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thirdly, the executive order could not have been vio­lated
because even before its promulgation, <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street> was only 8
meters wide, and the said executive order did not demand widening to 10 meters
of existing streets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it to have so
ordered would have entailed huge expenditure not only on the part of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
but many other mu­nicipal corporations as well which have streets less than 10
meters wide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, compensation for the
expropriation of private property would have to be given.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main thrust of
appellant's arguments is that the city council does not have the power to close
city streets like <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span>
  Street</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
asserts that since municipal bodies have no inherent power to vacate or
withdraw a street from public use, there must be a specific grant by the
legislative body to the city or municipality concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that "municipal corporations in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Phil­ippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
are mere creatures of Congress; that, as such, said corporations possessed, and
may exercise, <u>only</u> such power as Congress may deem fit to grant
thereto",<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> a
reference to the organic act of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city> appears to be in
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In subsection (L) of Section 2553
of the Revised Administrative Code (<span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> Charter),
the language of the grant of authority runs thus -</p>

<blockquote>"(L)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To provide for laying out, opening, extending,
widening, straightening, <u>closing up</u>, constructing, or regulating, in <u>whole
or in part</u>, any public plaza, square, street, sidewalk, trail, park,
waterworks, or water mains, or any cemetery, sewer, sewer connection or
connections, either on, in, or upon public or private property; x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Undoubtedly, the City is explicitly empowered to close a city
street.</p>

<p class="BODY">We may drive home the point by presenting here the converse of
the rule as set forth in <span class="SpellE"><u>Unson</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>, supra</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There, as here, the municipal board passed an or­dinance (No. 3470)
withdrawing the northern portion of <span class="SpellE">Cal­lejon</span> del
Carmen from public use, declaring it patrimonial property of the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
and authorizing its lease to <span class="SpellE">Genato</span> Commercial
Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Unson</span>
had a lot border­ing <span class="SpellE">Callejon</span> <span class="GramE">del</span>
Carmen on which several buildings stood.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One of such buildings was known as "<st1:place><st1:placename>Commerce</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prior to the construction of <span class="SpellE">Genato's</span> building on the leased premises, <span class="SpellE">Unson's</span> lot had on its southern boundary two exits on <span class="SpellE">Callejon</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> Carmen which had to
be closed upon the cons­truction of said building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Unson</span> went to court
alleging that the ordinance and the contract of lease with <span class="SpellE">Geneto</span>
were illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court upheld the
city's authority to withdraw such alley for public use and to convert it into
patrimonial property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, on appeal, we
held:</p>

<blockquote>"In this connection, respondents have been unable to cite any
legal provision specifically vesting in the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
the power to close <span class="SpellE">Callejon</span> <span class="GramE">del</span>
Carmen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, section 18(x) of
Republic Act No. 409 - upon which <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> rely -
authorizes the Municipal Board of Manila 'subject to the provisions of existing
laws, to pro­vide for the laying out, <u>construction</u> and improvement .....
<span class="GramE">of</span> streets, avenues, alleys ..... <span class="GramE">and</span>
other public places,' but it says <u>nothing</u> about the <u>closing</u> of
any such places.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The significance of
this silence becomes apparent when contrasted with section 2246 of the Revised
Administrative Code, explicitly <u>vesting</u> in municipal councils of
regularly organized munici­palities the power to <u>close any municipal</u>
road, <u>street</u>, alley, park or square, provided that persons prejudiced
thereby are duly indemnified, and, that the previous approval of the Department
Head shall have been secured. The express <u>grant of such power</u> to the
aforementioned municipali­ties and the absence of said grant to the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
lead to no other conclusion than that the power was intended to be withheld
from the latter."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it is<span class="GramE">,</span> that appellant may not challenge the city council's act of
withdrawing a strip of <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span>
  Street</st1:address></st1:street> at its dead end from public use and
converting the remainder thereof into an alley.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These are acts well within the ambit of the power to close a city
street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The city council, it would seem
to us, is the authority competent to determine whether or not a certain
property is still ne­cessary for public use.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Such power to vacate a street or alley is discretion­ary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the discretion will not ordinarily be
controlled or interfered with by the courts, absent a plain case of abuse or
fraud or collusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Faithfulness to the

<p class="BODY">Deemed as material factors which a municipality must consider in
deliberating upon the advisability of closing a street are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"the topography of the property
surrounding the street in the light of ingress and egress to other streets; the
relationship of the street in the road system throughout the subdivision; the
problem posed by the 'dead end' of the street; the width of the street; the
cost of rebuilding and maintaining the street as contrasted to its ultimate
value to all of the property in the vicinity; the inconvenience of those
visiting the subdivision; and whether the closing of the street would cut off
any property owners from access to a street."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We now take a look at the factors considered by the City Council
of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> in vacating a portion of <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These appear in the resolution (Resolution
215) itself, thus: </p>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, that portion of the road right-of-way of <st1:address><st1:street><span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span> Street</st1:street>, <st1:city><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:city></st1:address>, beginning with its
intersection, with <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Dagohoy</span>
  Street</st1:address></st1:street> does not have much traffic, being in fact a
dead-end street;</blockquote>

<blockquote>AND WHEREAS, the conversion of this portion of <span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span>
Street into a five-meter alley would neither prejudice nor damage any person or
property;</blockquote>

<blockquote>AND WHEREAS, in the subdivision scheme of the burned area of the
City Market Subdivision, already approved by the City Council, provision was
made for another road behind <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span>
  Street</st1:address></st1:street> intersecting <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Dagohoy</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Besides, there are the specific findings by the trial court that
the "2.5 opening is sufficient for Plaintiff to enter and exit from the
lot he purchased from Assumption Convent, Inc."; that the "present
road right of way was rend­ered narrow by surrounding properties and is <u>sufficient</u>
for the needs of the Plaintiff"; and that the "portion leased to
Shell Company was not necessary for public use." We are bound by these
findings of fact.</p>

<p class="BODY">By the embattled resolutions, no right of the public is
overwhelmed, none defeated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Public
interest was not at all disregarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the contrary, some benefit did flow from the withdrawal of a portion of the
street and the lease there­of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The City
saves from the cost of maintenance, gets some income yet.</p>

<p class="BODY">Given the precept that the discretion of a municipal corporation
is broad in scope and should thus be accorded great deference in the spirit of
the Local Autonomy Law (R. A. 2264), and absent a clear abuse of discretion, we
hold that the withdrawal for lease of the disputed portion of <span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span> Street and the conversion of the remainder of the
dead-end part thereof into an alley, does not call for, and is beyond the reach
of, judicial interference.</p>

<p class="NUM">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the fact that the
leased strip of 100 square meters was withdrawn from public use, it necessarily
follows that such leased portion becomes patrimonial property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 422 of the Civil Code indeed provides
that property of public domain, "when no longer intended for public use or
public service, shall form part of the patrimonial property of the State."
Authority is not wanting for the proposition that "[p]<span class="SpellE">roperty</span>
for public use of provinces and towns are governed by the same principles as
property of public dominion of the same character."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
There is no doubt that the strip withdrawn from public use and held in private
ownership may be given in lease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
amongst the charter powers given the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city> (Section 2541, Re<span style="font-size: 12pt;">vised Administrative Code [Charter of the City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Baguio</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 12pt;">]) </span>is to "lease x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> real x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> property, for the benefit of the city x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</p>

<p class="NUM">7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We now look into
appellant's averment that by reducing the original width of <span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span>
Street, his entrance and exit to and from his property has become very
difficult; that it is now impossible for his big trucks and trailers to turn
around; that it made the area around it very dangerous in case of fire; and
that it has caused perpetual danger, annoyance, irreparable loss and damage not
only to the public in general but especially to herein plaintiff in
particular.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For all these, he asks for
damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">First to the governing principle:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The general rule is that one whose property does not abut on the
closed section of a street has no right to compensation for the closing or vacation
of the street, if he still has reasonable access to the general system of
streets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The circumstances in some cases
may be such as to give a right to damages to a property owner, even though his
property does not abut on the closed section.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>But to warrant recovery in any such case the property owner must show
that the situation is such that he has sustained special damages differing in
kind, and not merely in degree, from those sustained by the public generally</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, no private right of appellant has been
invaded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No special damage or damages he
will incur by reason of the closing of a portion of <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street> at its dead
end, His property does not abut that street.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, the court has found that the remaining portion of <span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span> Street, which actually is 4 meters in width, is
sufficient for the needs of appellant and that <u>the leased portion</u> -
subject of this suit - "<u>was not necessary for public use</u>."
Furthermore, it is <u>physically impossible</u> to connect <span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span>
street in its entire width - 8 meters - with the area donated to the City by
Assumption Convent, for the reason that the <u>only</u>, outlet between them is
2.5 meters wide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even appellant's
allegation that by reducing the width of <span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span>
Street it is now impossible for his big trucks to turn around is of dubious
veracity on the face of his testimony that turning around at the original <span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span> Street or at the junction of <span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span>
Street and the donated road has not been tried before and that his trucks
actually do their maneuvering at the intersection of <span class="SpellE">Dagohoy</span>
Street and <span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span> Street.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Further, as stated in the resolution, provision has been "<u>made for
another road behind </u><st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE"><u>Lapu-Lapu</u></span><u>
  Street</u></st1:address></st1:street><u> and intersecting </u><st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE"><u>Dagohoy</u></span><u> Street</u></st1:address></st1:street>.”
It has been said that -</p>

<blockquote>"The Constitution does not undertake to guarantee to a
property owner the public main­tenance of the most convenient route to his
door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law will not permit him to be
cut off from the public thoroughfares, but he must content himself with such
route for outlet as the regularly constituted public authority may deem most
compatible with the public welfare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
he acquires city pro­perty, he does so in tacit recognition of these
principles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, subsequent to his ap­preciation,
the city authorities abandon a portion of the street to which his property is
not immediately adjacent, he may suffer loss because of the inconvenience
imposed, but the public treasury cannot be required to recompense him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such case is <span class="SpellE">damnum</span>

the solemnities which the law requires in the case of an act complying with the
