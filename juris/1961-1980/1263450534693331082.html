				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In these two cases, both of which stand submitted for decision by
this Court, the Solicitor General, representing the Commissioner of Immigration
and the Security Officer or Overseer of the Immigration Detention Station,
launches a two-pronged attack - certiorari and appeal - against the lower
court's decision of <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1965</st1:date>
rendered in the case below.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>That decision granted Corazon Perez <span class="SpellE">Pitcock's</span> petition for <u>habeas</u> <u><span style="">corpus</span></u><span style="">, </span>and ordered the Commissioner of Immi­gration, the Overseer of
the Immigration Detention Station and/or any officer acting by authority of
said Commissioner, to release her husband, Leonard E. <span class="SpellE">Pitcock</span>,
Jr., an American citizen, from custody within twenty-four hours from receipt of
a copy of the decision, without pre­judice to placing the said <span class="SpellE">Pitcock</span> under the surveillance of immigration authorities,
in such form and manner as may be reasonable and/or adequate to insure that he
keep the peace and be available if and when the Government becomes ready to
deport him; and without prejudice to requiring a bond under Section 40 of
Commonwealth Act 613 to assure <span class="SpellE">Pitcock's</span> surrender
upon orders of the Commissioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <u>habeas</u> <u><span style="">corpus</span></u><span style=""> </span>case, filed below on <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1965</st1:date>, came about because of
the arrest and apprehension on <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="4">April
 12, 1965</st1:date> by NBI authori­ties of Leonard E. <span class="SpellE">Pitcock</span>,
Jr. and his subsequent detention by immi­gration authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These were upon a warrant of deportation
issued in pursuance of an order of deportation by the Board of Commissioners
rendered on <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="6">June 7, 1963</st1:date>,
which found that at the time of <span class="SpellE">Pitcock's</span> entry, he
was not lawfully admissible in this country.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This order of deportation became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
upon denial by said Board on <st1:date year="1963" day="12" month="7">July 12,
 1963</st1:date> of a reconsideration of said order.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the facts of record, <span class="SpellE">Pitcock</span> was,
on <st1:date year="1960" day="17" month="3">March 17, 1960</st1:date>, ordered
deported for overstaying the limited period allowed him to remain in this
country as a temporary visitor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1960" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1960</st1:date>, after he was allowed an
extension of stay, he left the country voluntarily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, on <st1:date year="1960" day="12" month="6">June 12, 1960</st1:date>, he was able to reenter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="28" month="2">February
 28, 1962</st1:date>, he again left the country voluntarily, but two days later
- <st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="3">March 2, 1962</st1:date> - came back,
a temporary visitor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1962</st1:date>, he was about to leave
when he was arrested at the airport by the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:place></st1:city> police authorities to answer
criminal charges for slight physical injuries and oral defamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He posted bail for his provisional
liberty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later on, he voluntarily
surrendered to the immigration authorities when the former issued a warrant for
his arrest for deportation purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was released from custody upon his filing of a P2,000-cash bond and a
P5,000-surety bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then came, as stated
earlier, his arrest and detention on <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="4">April
 12, 1965</st1:date> at a time when the order for his deportation became final
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1965</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Pitcock</span>, then under detention, requested the Commis­sioner
to allow him to depart voluntarily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
latter, however, required <span class="SpellE">Pitcock</span> first to secure the
dismissal of the criminal charges against him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u> case filed below, in which
Corazon Perez <span class="SpellE">Pitcock</span> averred, amongst others, that
her husband was not deportable because there was already an implied waiver of
his exclusion when he was granted an extension of stay before his departure on <st1:date year="1960" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1960</st1:date>, and when he was allowed
to reenter the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
on <st1:date year="1960" day="12" month="6">June 12, 1960</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In rendering the decision aforesaid in the <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u>
case, the lower court came to the conclusion that Leonard E. <span class="SpellE">Pitcock</span>, Jr., detained by the immigration authorities
preparatory to deportation, should not be deported until the final disposition
of pending criminal cases.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
against him and until the dissolution of the writ of preliminary injunction
issued in Civil Case 50339 in another branch of the court,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
restraining the immigration authorities from ordering his arrest and
deportation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two cases now at bar are offshoots of the proceedings below.</p>

<p class="BODY">One is a direct appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
(L-24525) by the immigration authorities, thru the Solicitor General, seeking
to reverse the lower court's judgment of <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1965</st1:date> hereinbefore mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal is based essentially upon the
grounds that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) <span class="SpellE">Pitcock</span>
should be deported even with the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the
criminal cases against him because the execution of a final order of
deportation takes precedence over other processes and proceedings of this
Republic as it is a supreme and para­mount act of the State, an act of
self-preservation of a national scale, predicated on the finding that an
alien's continued presence here is inimical to its interest, welfare and
safety; and the interest of any party in any pending criminal case must be
deemed subordinate thereto and must yield to such overriding necessity; and (2)
the writ of prelim­inary injunction issued in Civil Case 50339 of the Court of
First Instance of Manila, heretofore adverted to, restraining the Commissioner
of Immigration from arresting and deporting <span class="SpellE">Pitcock</span>,
no longer subsists, because it was, on June 5, 1962, dissolved and for the
reason that Civil Case 50339 had since been dismissed without prejudice
"for lack of interest to prosecute" and that reconsideration of the
order of dismissal was denied on July 13, 1963.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other case (L-24510) is an original action in this Court
lodged likewise by the immigration authorities thru the Solicitor General, for
certiorari and prohibition with preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners, in this second case, contend
that the lower court lacks jurisdiction to take cognizance of the <u>habeas</u>
<u>corpus</u> case because the detention of <span class="SpellE">Pitcock</span>,
preparatory to exclusion or expulsion pursuant to a final order of depor­tation,
is valid and the courts have no authority to assert jurisdiction unless there
is abuse of power or legal error or lack of a fair hearing, and none exists in <span class="SpellE">Pitcock's</span> case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners also assail the validity of the lower court's two orders of
May 3, 1965, the first fixing a P5,000-bond for <span class="SpellE">Pitcock's</span>
immediate release pending proceedings on appeal; and the second ordering <span class="SpellE">Pitcock's</span> immediate release from custody - the P5,000-bond
having been filed - upon receipt of the order of release; and another order of
May 5, 1965, directing the release of <span class="SpellE">Pitcock</span> within
thirty-six hours from receipt thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The government assault on these three orders just mentioned is planted
upon its averment that upon the perfection of an appeal in the <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u>
case below, which was on the same day the decision therein was rendered (April
30, 1965), the trial court lost jurisdiction over the case, which jurisdiction <span style="">was </span>instantly transferred to this
Court to which the appeal was made.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="6" month="5">May 6, 1965</st1:date>,
this Court issued a temporary restraining order in the second case (L-24510)
effective until <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="5">May 12, 1965</st1:date>
enjoining respondents therein from enforcing or implementing the decision dated
<st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1965</st1:date>, the two
orders dated <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1965</st1:date>,
and the order of <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, at the hearing on the motion for preliminary injunction on <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="5">May 12, 1965</st1:date> in L-24510, the parties
agreed that Leonard E. <span class="SpellE">Pitcock</span>, Jr. shall depart from
the country on or before <st1:date year="1965" day="22" month="5">May 22, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same date, <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="5">May 12, 1965</st1:date>, this Court resolved to continue the
restraining order until <st1:date year="1965" day="22" month="5">May 22, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the Solicitor General's motion, <span class="SpellE">Pitcock's</span>
passports were withdrawn from the evidence submitted in the case (L-24510) and
replaced with photographic copies.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1965</st1:date>,
the Solicitor General manifested to this Court in L-24510 and L-24525 that
Leonard E. <span class="SpellE">Pitcock</span>, Jr. "had left the country on
<st1:date year="1965" day="22" month="5">May 22, 1965</st1:date>, in accordance
with the decision of the Board of Commissioners, and the warrant of
deportation, both dated <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="6">June 7, 1963</st1:date>."
A similar manifestation was also filed on <st1:date year="1965" day="17" month="9">September 17, 1965</st1:date> for the two cases (L-24510 and L-24525)
by counsel for respondents Leonard E. <span class="SpellE">Pitcock</span>, Jr.
and Corazon Perez <span class="SpellE">Pitcock</span> in L-24510, also counsel
for petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Corazon Perez <span class="SpellE">Pitcock</span> in L-24525.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his memorandum in lieu of oral arguments filed on <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="9">September 2, 1965</st1:date> in L-24510, the
Solicitor General stated that the case "has become moot and academic"
in view of <span class="SpellE">Pitcock's</span> departure.</p>

<p class="BODY">These two cases should be dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the departure of Leonard E. <span class="SpellE">Pitcock</span>, Jr., the subject of these two proceedings, the
question of the legality of his detention preparatory to deportation becomes
moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any decision on the
merits of either case would be of no practical value or effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it would be idle cere­mony if we rule
upon the merits that <span class="SpellE">Pitcock's</span> detention was illegal
and, therefore, he should be released from custody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, he is no longer detained nor in
custody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Useless, too, would be a
reverse holding that <span class="SpellE">Pitcock's</span> detention is valid and
that he is deportable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, <span class="SpellE">Pitcock</span> is now beyond the legal processes of this country.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>
