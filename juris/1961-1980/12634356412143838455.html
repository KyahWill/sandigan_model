ZACARIAS PANGAN <br>( T&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ) ZACARIAS PANGAN<br></div><br><center>(Jurat)"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></center></blockquote>Isidoro Magtira died intestate in 1953 leaving as his sole compulsory heir, the petitioner SOFIA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>It is SOFIA's submission that it was only some­time in 1955 during the cadastral survey in Paombong, Bulacan, that she came to know that ZACARIAS was claiming ownership of the land which the latter wanted to be surveyed in his name.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On June 18, 1956, SOFIA commenced this action against ZACARIAS for "accounting, cancellation of real estate mortgage and for recovery of ownership" in the Court of First Instance of Bulacan, Branch II, docketed therein as Civil Case No. 1318.<br><br>The Amended Complaint alleged mainly that the amount of P725.00 obtained by ISIDORO from ZACARIAS was a loan secured by a real estate mortgage over the subject land, evidenced by a public instrument (Annex "A"); that while a phrase in said document speaks of a contract of sale with right of repurchase, the whole agreement and the only intention of the parties was in reality one of loan with equitable mortgage.<br><br>In his Answer to the Amended Complaint, ZACARIAS insisted that the sum of P725.00 which ISIDORO had obtained from him was not a loan secured by a real estate mortgage but the consideration paid by ISIDORO by virtue of a sale with <i><i>pacto de retro</i></i> of the pro­perty being litigated; that the additional amounts secured from him represented an additional consider­ation for the sale with right to repurchase; that in the interpretation of contracts, the title of the instrument is not controlling but only the recitals thereof; that during the period for repurchase the Magtiras evidenced no intention to repurchase the property, nor had they made any tender of payment, nor did they file the necessary action for the protection of their rights; that he has been in possession of the property for exactly 30 years, 4 months and ten days computed from February 28, 1926 to the date of the filing of the Complaint on June 18, 1956, so that he has acquired absolute ownership by extraordinary acquisitive prescription and plaintiff's right to recover the same had been extinguished by prescription; and finally, the property having been sold by <i>pacto de retro</i>, he is under no obligation to render an account­ing of the fruits thereof.<br><br>On February 23, 1959, the trial Court rendered its Decision dismissing the Complaint reasoning that from the documentary evidence it is shown that ISIDORO intended to sell his property by means of a <i>pacto de retro</i> sale for a term of 4 years, which was later ex­tended to 5 years, and he failed to take any step to recover said property notwithstanding the lapse of a considerable length of time; and that whatever doubt there may be as to the exact nature of their agree­ment has lost significance because ZACARIAS Pangan has become owner of the property by acquisitive prescription.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>SOFIA appealed to the Court of Appeals which, in a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> promulgated on January 22, 1966, affirmed the judgment of dismissal of the trial Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> SOFIA's Motion for Reconsideration was denied by the majority in a Special Division of Five,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">**</sup> with two (2) Justices voting to grant reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In the present Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i>, petitioner maintains that the Court of Appeals erred in concluding 1) that the agreement between the parties is a sale with <i>pacto de retro</i> instead of a loan with equitable mortgage and 2) that she is guilty of laches which estops her from asserting her cause of action.<br><br>We uphold respondent Court's finding that the words "<i>aking inilipat, ipinagbili nang biling mabibi­ling muli</i>" used by the parties in the document, Exhi­bit "A", are expressive of their intent that the property be sold with a right of repurchase.&nbsp; Those words must be given their ordinary and common meaning.&nbsp; That the document, Exhibit "A", is entitled "<i>Kasulatang Sanglaan</i>" is not a decisive factor.&nbsp; It is settled that:<br><blockquote>"To determine the nature of a contract courts do not have or are not bound to rely upon the name or title given it by the contracting parties, should there be a controversy as to what they really had intended to enter into, but the way the contracting parties do or perform their respective obligations stipulated or agreed upon may be shown and inquired into, and should such performance conflict with the name or title given the contract by the parties, the former must prevail over the latter."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </blockquote> The actuations of both parties after entering into the agreement show that ZACARIAS immediately entered into the possession of subject land, paid taxes thereon, and enjoyed its fruits.&nbsp; In fact, Exhibit "A" made specific mention of ZACARIAS' obli­gation to pay taxes, a burden attached to ownership of property.&nbsp; Thus, the document, Exhibit "A", can­not even be presumed as one of equitable mortgage considering that the conveyance does not fall within the purview of any of the cases mentioned in Article 16.02 of the new Civil Code, a provision which may be applied retroactively since it is remedial in nature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Nor did respondent Court err in holding SOFIA guilty of laches.&nbsp; Not even once did she disturb ZACARIAS' possession for exactly 30 years, 4 months and 10 days from February 8, 1926, the date the first agreement (Exhibit "A") was entered into, up to the time of the filing of the complaint on June 18, 1956.&nbsp; Further, SOFIA showed inexcusable negligence in effectively asserting and protecting her rights as the alleged mortgagee by her failure to either seek a reformation of their agreement, or to make proper consignation of the repurchase price, or to file the action for redemption and cancellation of the alleged mortgage as early as after the Japanese occu­pation when for the third time her alleged offer to redeem was refused by ZACARIAS.&nbsp; Again, from April 30, 1935, the last day of redemption, up to August 23, 1945, the date of the filing of the Affidavit for Consolidation by ZACARIAS, more than ten years had elapsed without SOFIA having undertaken any positive and decisive step to assert and protect her rights to the property, contenting herself with mere feeble requests for redemption.<br><br>SOFIA's contention that the consolidation of ownership in ZACARIAS' name in 1945 was kept a secret from her and that ZACARIAS had done nothing else to her knowledge which indicated that he was claiming the land as his own,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> does not negate the presence of laches.&nbsp; "It is a general rule that actual knowledge on the part of the plaintiff of the existence of a cause of action against the defendant, is not necessary or essential, but that it is enough if such knowledge may be imputed to plaintiff by reason of the existence of opportunity on his part to acquire such knowledge, or because of circumstances of which he was cognizant."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Respondent Court, therefore, correctly considered peti­tioner guilty of laches.<br><blockquote>"Laches, in a general sense, is failure or neglect, for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time, to do that which, by exercising due diligence, could or should have been done earlier; it is negligence or omission to assert a right within a reasonable time, warranting a presumption that the party entitled to assert it either has abandoned it or declined to assert it".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote>Additionally, acquisitive prescription operates to bar any action by SOFIA.&nbsp; From the date of the filing of the Affidavit for Consolidation of Owner­ship by ZACARIAS with the Register of Deeds on August 23, 1945 up to the date of the filing of the complaint by SOFIA on June 18, 1956, or for almost eleven (11) years, ZACARIAS enjoyed an uninterrupted, adverse, public and peaceful possession of the liti­gated property in the concept of owner, which under Article 1134 of the Civil Code ripened into owner­ship by ordinary prescription through possession of at least ten years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Contrary to SOFIA's claim, the period of prescription should be reckoned not merely from the time when she allegedly came to know of the claim of ownership of ZACARIAS during the cadastral survey in 1955, but from the date of regis­tration of the Affidavit for Consolidation with the Register of Deeds because registration of an instru­ment in the Office of the Register of Deeds consti­tutes constructive notice to the whole world.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The collective weight of the foregoing consi­derations justify the conclusion of respondent Court that the contract between the parties was indeed a conditional sale.&nbsp; It appearing that SOFIA had failed to exercise the right of repurchase, ZACARIAS acted well within his rights under the old Civil Code when he consolidated the ownership unto himself in 1945.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from, dismissing the Complaint, is hereby affirmed.<br><br>With costs against petitioner.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Teehankee, (Chairman), Acting C.J.,&nbsp;
