<p class="BODY">On November 17, 1959, plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
<span class="SpellE">Octavio</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Kalalo</span>
(hereinafter referred to as <span class="SpellE"><u>appellee</u></span>), a
licensed civil engineer doing business under the firm name of O.A. <span class="SpellE">Kalalo</span> and Associates, entered into an agreement (Exhibit

with defendant-appellant Alfredo J. Luz (hereinafter referred to as <u>appellant</u>),
a licensed architect, doing business under the firm name of A.J. Luz and
Associates, whereby the former was to render engineering design services to the
latter for fees, as stipulated in the agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The services included design computation and
sketches, contract draw­ing and technical specifications of all engineering
phases of the project designed by O.A. <span class="SpellE">Kalalo</span> and As­sociates,
bill of quantities and cost estimate, and con­sultation and advice during
construction relative to the work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
fees agreed upon were percentages of the architect's fee, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>structural engineering, 12-1/2%; electrical
engineering, 2-1/2%; mechanical engineering, 2-1/2%; and sanitary engineering,
2-1/2%.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The agreement was subsequently
supplemented by a "clarification to letter-proposal" which provided,
among other things, that "the schedule of engineering fees in this
agreement does not cover the following:<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="12" day="11" year="1961">December 11, 1961</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> sent to appellant a statement of account
(Exhibit "1")<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>,
to which was attached an itemized statement of defendant-appellant's account (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "1-A"), according to which the total
engineering fee asked by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> for services
rendered amounted to P116,565.00 from which sum was to be deducted the previous
payments made in the amount of P57,000.00, thus leaving a balance due in the
amount of P59,565.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="5" day="18" year="1962">May 18, 1962</st1:date>
appellant sent <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> a resume of fees due to the
latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said fees, according to ap­pellant,
amounted to P10,861.08 instead of the amount claimed by the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date month="6" day="14" year="1962">June
 14, 1962</st1:date> appellant sent <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> a check
for said amount, which <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> refused to accept as
full payment of the balance of the fees due him.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="8" day="10" year="1962">August 10, 1962</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed a complaint against appellant,
containing four causes of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
first cause of action, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> alleged that for
services rendered in connection with the different projects therein mentioned
there was due him fees in sums consisting of $28,000 (U.S.) and P100,204.46,
excluding interests, of which sums only P69,323.21 had been paid, thus leaving
unpaid the $28,000.00 and the balance of P30,881.25.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the second cause of action, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> claimed P17,000.00 as consequential and moral
damages; in the third cause of action he claimed P55,000.00 as moral damages,
attorney's fees and expenses of litiga­tion; and in the fourth cause of action
he claimed P25,000.00 as actual damages, and also for attorney's<span style="">&nbsp; </span>fees and expenses of litigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his answer, appellant admitted that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
rendered engineering services, as alleged in the first cause of action, but
averred that some of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> services were not in
accordance with the agreement and <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> claims
were not justified by the services actually rendered, and that the aggregate
amount actually due to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was only P80,336.29,
of which P69,475.21 had already been paid, thus leaving a balance of only
P10,861.08.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant denied liability
for any damage claimed by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to have suffered,
as alleged in the second, third and fourth causes or action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant set up affirmative and special
defenses, alleging that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had no cause of
action, that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
because of certain acts, representations, admissions and/or silence, which led
appellant to believe certain facts to exist and to act upon said facts, that <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> claim re­garding the <span class="SpellE">Menzi</span>
project was premature because appellant had not yet been paid for said project,
and that <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> services were not complete or
were performed in violation of the agreement and/or otherwise unsatisfactory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant also set up a counterclaim for
actual and moral damages for such amount as the court may deem fair to assess,
and for attorney's fees of P10,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as the pleadings showed that the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
right to certain fees for services rendered was not denied, the only question
being the assessment of the proper fees and the balance due to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> after deducting the admitted payments made by
appellant, the trial court, upon agreement of the parties, authorized the case
to be heard before a Commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Commissioner rendered a report which, in resume, states that the amount due to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was $28,000.00 (U.S.) as his fee in the
International Research Institute Project which was twenty per cent (20%) of the
$140,000.00 that was paid to appellant, and P51,539.91 for the other projects,
less the sum of P69,475.46 which was already paid by the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commissioner also recommended the payment
to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> of the sum of P5,000.00 as attorney's
fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing on the Report of the Commissioner, the respective
counsel of the parties manifested to the court that they had no objection to
the findings of fact of the Commissioner contained in the Report, and they
agreed that the said Report posed only two legal issues, namely: <span style="">&nbsp;</span>(1) whether under the facts stated in the
Report, the doctrine of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> would apply; and (2)
whether the recommendation in the Report that the payment of the amount due to
the plaintiff in dollars was legally permissible, and if not, at what rate of
exchange it should be paid in pesos.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the parties had submitted their respective memorandum on said
issues, the trial court rendered its decision, dated February 10, 1967, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered in favor of plaintiff and
against the defendant, by ordering the defendant to pay plaintiff the sum of
P51,539.91 and $28,000.00, the latter to be converted into the Philippine
currency on the basis of the current rate of exchange at the time of the payment
of this judgment, as certified to by the Central Bank of the Philippines, from
which shall be deducted the sum of P69,475.46, which the defendant had paid the
plaintiff, and the legal rate of interest thereon from the filing of the
complaint in this case until fully paid for; by ordering the defendant to pay
to plaintiff the further sum of P8,000.00 by way of attorney's fees which the
Court finds to be reasonable in the premises, with costs against the
defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The counterclaim of the
defendant is ordered dismissed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the decision, this appeal was brought directly to this
Court, raising only questions of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of this appeal, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed a petition for the issuance of a writ of
attachment under Section 1 (f) of Rule 57 of the Rules of Court upon the ground
that appellant is presently residing in Canada as a permanent resident
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On June 3, 1969, this Court
resolved, upon <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> posting a bond of
P10,000.00, to issue the writ of attachment, and ordered the Provincial Sheriff
of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> to attach the estate, real and personal, of
appellant Alfredo J. Luz within the province, to the value of not less than
P140,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant made the following assignments of errors:</p>

<blockquote>I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court erred in
not declaring and holding that plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
letter dated December 11, 1961 (Exhibit "1") and the statement of
account (Exhibit "1-A") therein enclosed, had the effect,
cumulatively or alternatively, of placing plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> from thereafter modifying the
representations made in said exhibits, or of making plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> otherwise bound by said rep­resentations, or of
being of decisive weight in determining the true intent or the parties as to
the nature and extent of the engineering services ren­dered and/or the amount
of fees due.</blockquote>

<blockquote>II.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court erred in
declaring and holding that the balance owing from defendant-appellant to
plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> on the IRRI Project should be paid
on the basis of the rate of exchange of the U.S. dollar to the Philippine peso
at the time of payment of judgment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>III.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court erred
in not declaring and holding that the aggregate amount of the balance due from
defendant-appellant to plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is only
P15,792.05.</blockquote>

<blockquote>IV.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court erred in
awarding attorney's fees in the sum of P8,000.00, despite the commissioner's
finding, which plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> has accepted and
has not questioned, that said fee be only P5000.00; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>V.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court erred in
not granting defendant-appellant relief on his counter­claim."</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of his
first assignment of error appellant argues that in Exhibit 1-A, which is a
statement of accounts dated December 11, 1961, sent by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
to appellant, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> specified the various projects
for which he claimed engineering fees, the precise amount due on each
particular engineering service rendered on each of the various projects, and
the total of his claims; that such a statement barred <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
from asserting any claim contrary to what was stated therein, or from taking
any position different from what he asserted therein with respect to the nature
of the engineering services rendered; and consequently the trial court could
not award fees in excess of what was stated in said statement of accounts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant argues that for <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
to apply it is not necessary, contrary to the ruling of the trial court, that
the appellant should have <u>actually</u> relied on the representation, but
that it is sufficient that the representations were intended to make the
defendant act thereon; that assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span>
that Exhibit 1-A did not put <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>, the said Exhibit 1-A nevertheless constituted a
formal admission that would be binding on <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
under the law on evidence, and would not only belie any inconsistent claim but
also would discredit any evidence adduced by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
in support of any claim inconsistent with what appears therein; that, moreover,
Exhibit 1-A, being a statement of account, establishes <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>
the accuracy and correctness of the items stated therein, and its correctness
can no longer be impeached except for fraud or mistake; that Exhibit 1-A,
furthermore, constitutes <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> own
interpretation of the contract between him and appellant, and hence, is
conclusive against him.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> admits that
Exhibit, 1-A itemized the services rendered by him in the various construction
projects of appellant and that the total engineering fees charged therein was
P116,565.00, but maintains that he was not in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>first, because when he prepared Exhibit 1-A
he was laboring under an innocent mistake, as found by the trial court; second,
because appellant was not ignorant of the services actually rendered by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> and the fees due to the latter under the original
agreement, Exhibit A; and, third, because appellant did not rely on the data <span class="SpellE">appaering</span> in Exhibit 1-A, nor did he act by reason there­of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> further
maintains that he cannot be bound by Exhibit 1-A after it was satisfactorily
shown that there were services not included therein although actually rendered
by him to appellant, and that the fees were not correctly charged because of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> ignorance of the legal implications or the terms
of the agreement, Exhibit "A".</p>

<p class="BODY">We find merit in the stand of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The statement of accounts (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1-A)
could not <span class="SpellE">estop</span> <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
because appellant did not rely there­on as found by the Commissioner, from
whose Report we read:</p>

<blockquote>"While it is true that plaintiff vacillated in his claim, yet,
defendant did not in anyway rely or believe in the different claims asserted by
the plaintiff and instead insisted on a claim that plaintiff was only entitled
to P10,861.08 as per a separate resume of fees he sent to the plaintiff on <st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1962</st1:date> (See Exhibit 6)."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The foregoing finding of the Commissioner,
not dis­puted by appellant, was adopted by the trial court in its
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under article 1431 of the
Civil Code, in order that <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> may apply the
person, to whom representations have been made and who claims the <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> in his favor must have relied or acted on such
representations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said article provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 1431. Through <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> an
admission or representation is rendered conclusive upon the person making it,
and cannot be denied or disproved as against the person relying thereon."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">An essential element of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> is
that the person invoking it has been influenced and has relied on the
representations or conduct of the person sought to be <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>,

this Court held that no <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> based on a document

this Court ruled that there is no <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> when the
statement or action invoked as its basis did not mislead the adverse
party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Estoppel</span>
has been characterized as harsh or odious, and not favored in law<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When misapplied, <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>

<p class="BODY">The essential elements of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> in <span class="SpellE">pais</span> may be considered in relation to the party sought to

impression that the facts are otherwise than, and inconsistent with, those
which the party subsequently attempts to assert; (2) intent, or at least

the <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>, the essential elements are (1) lack of
knowledge and of the means of knowledge of the truth as to the facts in
question; (2) reliance, in good faith, upon the conduct or statements of the
party to be <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>; (3) action or inaction based
thereon of such character as to change the position or status of the party
claiming the <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>, to his injury, detriment or

<p class="BODY">The first essential element in relation to the party sought to be
<span class="SpellE">estopped</span> does not obtain in the instant case, for, as
appears in the Report of the Commissioner, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
testified "that when he wrote Exhibit 1 and prepared Exhibit 1-A, he had
nor yet consulted the services of his counsel and it was only upon advice of
counsel that the terms of the contract were interpreted to him resulting in his
subsequent letters to the defendant demanding payments of his fees pursuant to
the contract Exhibit A."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
This finding of the Commissioner was adopted by the trial court.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
It is established, therefore, that Exhibit 1-A was written by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> through ignorance, or mistake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anent this matter, it has been held that if
an act, conduct or misrepresentation of the party sought to be <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> is due to ignorance founded on innocent mistake, <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> will not arise.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Regarding the essential elements of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> in
relation to the party claiming the <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>, the
first element does not obtain in the instant case, for it cannot be said that
appellant did not know, or at least did not have the means of knowing, the
services rendered to him by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> and the fees due
thereon as provided in Ex­hibit A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
second element is also wanting, for, as adverted to, appellant did not rely on
Exhibit 1-A but consistently denied the accounts stated therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither does the third element obtain, for
appellant did not act on the basis of the representations in Exhibit 1-A, and
there was no change in his position, to his own injury or prejudice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant, however, insists that if Exhibit 1-A did not put <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>, it at least
constitu­ted an admission binding upon the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, it cannot be gainsaid
that Exhibit 1-A is not a judicial admission.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Statements which are not estoppels nor judicial admissions have no
quality of conclusiveness, and an opponent whose admissions have been offered
against him may offer any evidence which serves as an explanation for his
former assertion of what he now denies as a fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This may involve the showing of a mistake.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>

it was held that when a party to a suit has made an admission of any fact
pertinent to the issue involved, the admission can be received against him; but
such an admission is not conclusive against him, and he is entitled to present
evidence to overcome the effect of the admission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> did
explain, and the trial court concluded, that Exhibit 1-A was based on either
his ignorance or innocent mistake and he, therefore, is not bound by it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant further contends that Exhibit 1-A, being a statement of
account, establishes <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> the accuracy and correctness of
the items stated therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If <u>prima</u>
<u>facie</u>, as contended by appellant, then it is not absolutely conclusive
upon the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An account stated may
be impeached for fraud, mistake or error.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In American Decisions, Vol. 62, p. 95, cited as authority by appellant
himself, we read thus:</p>

<blockquote>"An account stated or settled is a mere admission that the
account is correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not an <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
account is still open to impeachment for mistakes or errors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its effect is to establish, <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>,
the accuracy of the items without other proof; and the party seeking to impeach
it is bound to show affirmatively the mistake or error alleged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The force of the admission and the strength
of the evidence necessary to overcome it will depend upon the circumstances of
the case."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In the instant case, it is Our view that
the ignorance or mistake that attended the writing of Exhibit 1-A by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was sufficient to overcome the <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>
evidence of correctness and accuracy of said Exhibit 1-A.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant also urges that Exhibit 1-A constitutes <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> own interpretation or the contract, and is,
therefore, conclusive against him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although the practical construction of the contract by one party,
evidenced by his words or acts, can be used against him in behalf of the other
party,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
yet, if one of the parties carelessly makes a wrong interpretation of the words
of his contract, or performs more than the contract requires (as reasonably
interpreted independently of his performance), as happened in the instant case,
he should be entitled to a <span class="SpellE">restitutionary</span> remedy,
instead of being bound to continue to his erroneous interpretation or erroneous
performance, and "the other party should not be permitted to profit by
such mistake unless he can establish an <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> by
proving a material change of position made in good faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule as to <span class="SpellE">pratical</span>
construction does not nullify the equitable rules with respect to performance
by mistake."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
In the instant case, it has been shown that Exhibit 1-A was written through
mistake by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> and that the latter is not <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> by it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, even if said Exhibit 1-A be considered as prac­tical construction
of the contract by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, he cannot be bound by
such erroneous interpretation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has
been held that if by mistake the parties followed a practice in violation of
the terms of the agreement, the court should not perpetuate the error.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of the
second assignment of error, that the lower court erred in holding that the
balance from appellant on the IRRI project should be paid on the basis of the
rate of exchange of the U.S. dollar to the Philippine peso at the time of
payment of the judgment, appellant, contends:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>first, that the official rate at the time appellant received his
architect's fees for the IRRI project, and correspondingly his obligation to <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> fee on August 25, 1961, was P2.00 to $1.00, and
cites in support thereof Section 1612 of the Revised Administrative Code,
Section 48 of Republic Act 265 and Section 6 of Commonwealth Act No. 699;
second, that the lower court's conclusion that the rate of exchange to be
applied in the conversion of the $28,000.00 is the current rate of exchange at
the time the judgment shall be satisfied was based solely on a mere presumption
of the trial court that the defendant did not convert, there being no showing
to that effect, the dollars into Philippine currency at the official rate, when
the legal presumption should be that the dollars were converted at the official
rate of $1.00 to P2.00 because on August 25, 1961, when the IRRI project became
due and payable, foreign exchange controls were in full force and effect, and <u>partial</u>
<u>decontrol</u> was effected only afterwards, during the <span class="SpellE">Macapagal</span>
administration; third, that the other ground advanced by the lower court for
its ruling, to wit, that appellant committed a breach of his obligation to turn
over to the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> the engineering fees received in
U.S. dollars for the IRRI project, cannot be upheld, because there was no such
breach, as proven by the fact that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> never
claimed in Exhibit 1-A that he should be paid in dollars; and there was no
provision in the basic contract (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "A")
that he should be paid in dollars; and, finally, even if there were such
provision, it would have no binding effect under the provision or Republic Act
529; that, moreover, it cannot really be said that no payment was made on that
account, for appellant had already paid P57,000.00 to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
and under Article 1254 of the Civil Code, said payment could be said to have
been applied to the fees due from the IRRI project, this project being the
biggest and this debt being the most onerous.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In refutation of appellant's argument in support of the second
assignment of error, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> argues that
notwithstanding Republic Act 529, appellant can be compelled to pay the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> in dollars in view of the fact that appellant
received his fees in dollars, and <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> fee is
20% of appellant's fees; and that if said amount is to be converted into
Philippine Currency, the rate of exchange should be that at the time of the
execution of the judgment.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear, therefore, that what was submitted by appellant to
the lower court for resolution did not include the question of correctness or
propriety of the amounts due to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> in
connection with the different projects for which the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
had rendered engineering services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only
legal questions, as above enumerated, were submitted to the trial court for
resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So much so, that the lower
court in another portion of its decision said, as follows.</p>

<blockquote>"The objections to the Commissioner's Report embodied in defendant's
memorandum of objections, dated <st1:date month="3" day="18" year="1966">March
 18, 1966</st1:date>, cannot likewise be entertained by the Court because at
the hearing of the Commissioner's Report the parties had expressly manifested
that they had no objection to the findings of facts embodied therein."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, hold that the third assignment of error of the
appellant has no merit.</p>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his fourth
assignment of error, appellant questions the award by the lower court of
P8,000.00 for attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant
argues that the Commissioner, in his report, fixed the sum of P5,000.00 as
"just and reasonable" attorney's fees, to which amount <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> did not interpose any objection, and by not so
objecting he is bound by said finding; and that, moreover, the lower court gave
no reason in its decision for increasing the amount to P8,000.00.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> contends that while the
parties had not objected to the findings of the Commissioner, the assessment of
attorney's fees is always subject to the court's appraisal, and in increasing
the recommended fees from P5,000.00 to P8,000.00 the trial court must have
taken into consideration certain circumstances which warrant the award of
P8,000.00 for attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">We believe that the trial court committed no error in this
connection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 12 of Rule 33 of the
Rules or Court, on which the fourth assignment of error is presumably based,
provides that when the parties stipulate that a commissioner's findings of fact
shall be final, only questions of law arising from the facts mentioned in the
report shall thereafter be considered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, an agreement by the parties to abide by the findings of
fact of the commissioner is equivalent to an agreement of facts binding upon
them which the court cannot disregard.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The question, therefore, is whether or not the estimate of the
reasonable fees stated in the report of the Commissioner is a finding of fact.</p>

<p class="BODY">The report of the Commissioner on this matter reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>'"As regards attorney's fees, under the provisions of Art.
2208, par. (11), the same may be awarded, and considering the number of
hearings held in this case, the nature of the case (taking into account the
technical nature of the case and the voluminous exhibits offered in evidence),
as well as the way the case was handled by counsel, it is believed, <u>subject
to the Court's appraisal of the matter</u>, that the sum of P5,000.00 is just
and reasonable as attorney's fees."<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is thus seen that the estimate made by the Commissioner was an
expression of belief, or an opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An <u>opinion</u>
is different from a <u>fact</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
generally recognized distinction between a statement of "fact" and an
expression of "opinion" is that whatever is susceptible of exact
knowledge is a matter of fact, while that not susceptible of exact knowledge is
generally regarded as an expression of opinion<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has also been said that the word
"fact", as employed in the legal sense, includes "those
conclusions reached by the <span class="SpellE">trior</span> from shifting
testimony, weighing evidence, and passing on the credit of the witnesses, and
it does not denote those inferences drawn by the trial court from the facts
ascertained and settled by it.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, the estimate made by the Commissioner of the attorney's
fees was an inference from the facts ascertained by him, and is, therefore, not
a finding of fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court, was,
consequently, not bound by that estimate, in spite of the manifestation of the
parties that they had no objection to the findings of facts of the Commissioner
in his report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, under Section
11 of Rule 33 of the Rules of Court, the court may adopt, modify, or reject the
report of the commissioner, in whole or in part, and hence, it was within the
trial court's authority to increase the recommended attorney's fees of
P5,000.00 to P8,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a settled
rule that the amount of attorney's fees is addressed to the sound discretion of
the court<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true, as appellant contends, that the trial court did not
state in the decision the reasons for increasing the attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court, however, had adopted the report
of the Commissioner, and in adopting the report the trial court is deemed to
have adopted the reasons given by the Commissioner in awarding attorney's fees,
as stated in the above-quoted portion of the report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Based on the reasons stated in the report,
the trial court must have considered that the reasonable attorney's fees should
be P8,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that the
judgment against the appellant would amount to more than P100,000.00, We
believe that the award of P8,000.00 for attorney's fees is reasonable.</p>

<blockquote>5. In his fifth assignment of error appellant urges that he is
entitled to relief on his counterclaim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In view of what We have stated in connection with the preceding four
assignments of error, We do not consider it necessary to dwell any further on
this assignment of error.</blockquote>

This ruling modifies the decision in <span class="SpellE">Arrieta</span> <i>vs</i>.
National Rice and Corn Corporation, L-15645, January 31, 1964 (10 SCRA 79), where
it was held that the obligation based on dollar should be converted into the
Philippine peso at the rate of exchange prevailing at the time the obligation
was incurred, or on July 1, 1952.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
provision of Rep. Act 529 was wrongly applied in this case, because the
obligation arose after the enactment of Rep. Act 529 (June 16, 1950).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rate of exchange prevailing at the time
the obligation was incurred would apply only to obligations that were incurred
prior to the enactment of Rep. Act 529, but not to obligations incurred after
the enactment of said Act.</p>
