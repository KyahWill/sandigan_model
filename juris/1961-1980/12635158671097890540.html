defendants People's <span class="SpellE">Homesite</span> and Housing Corporation

<span class="SpellE">Teves</span> interposed the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent averments of the complaint in this case, filed on <st1:date year="1963" day="9" month="1">January 9, 1963</st1:date>, read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"2. That sometime in October, 1950, the herein plaintiff and
her husband <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span> <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>
who died in a plane crash with the late President Ramon <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>
x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>occupied a portion of land of the <span class="SpellE">Diliman</span> Estate Subdi­vision, known as the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Memorial Grove,<span style=""> belonging to the defendant PHHC, said por­tion of land with an area of
252 square meters, more or less, is known and desig­nated as Lot 9, Block K-70
of the <span class="SpellE">Diliman</span> Estate Subdivision located in <span class="SpellE">Diliman</span>, <span class="SpellE">Que­zon</span> City.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“3. That since then (October, 1950) the herein plaintiff and her
deceased husband have continuously occupied said por­tion of land and have
constructed thereon their residential house with an assessed value of P3,250.00
and which still remains existing to the present time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4. That, because at the time that portion of the <span class="SpellE">Diliman</span> Estate Subdivision known as the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
Memorial Grove was not intended for subdivision and distribution <span style="">the occupants thereof, including the herein
plaintiff and her deceased husband, have joined themselves together and made
repeat­ed requests and insistent representations with the officials of the PHHC
and, with the help and assistance of the Social Welfare Administration, the
Board of Directors of the defendant PHHC acceded to the </span><span style="">oc­</span><span style="">cupants' petition and by virtue of Resolu­tion
No. 21, Fiscal Year 1951-52, adopted on September 19, 1951, converted said
estate into a subdivision for distribution and sale to the actual occupants
thereof who are qualified to acquire residential lots under the rules and
regulations of the defendant</span><span style=""> PHHC.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“5. That, after due investigation conducted sometime before August,
1951, the then Chief of the Sales Division of the defendant PHHC found the
husband of the here­in plaintiff to be the actual occupant of said Lot 9, Block
K-70 of the <span class="SpellE">Diliman</span> Es­tate Subdivision and, having
been found to be likewise qualified to acquire said lot by purchase it <span style="">was </span>recommended that same be awarded
to him.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">“6. </span>That after the
death of the plaintiff's husband on March 17, 1957, the here­in plaintiff filed
another application in her own name to purchase said Lot 9, Block K-70 of the <span class="SpellE">Diliman</span> Estate Subdivision and thereafter made repeated and
insistent re­quests <span style="">and </span>representation
with the officials and personnel of the <span style="">Sales
</span>Division of the defendant PHHC to process and for<span style="">ward her application for approval by the Board of Directors of the said
defendant corporation but said officials and person­nel of the Sales Division
of defendant cor­poration in flagrant disregard </span>a<span style="">nd violation of their duties and with evident bad faith prejudicial to
the rights of the plaintiff deliberately refused to act on the requests and
insistent representation of the plaintiff.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"7. That on or about February 23, 1961, the defendant <span class="SpellE">Melisenda</span> L. Santos, through her attorney-in-fact <span class="SpellE">Estela</span> <span class="SpellE">Leyva</span>, filed with the
Sales Division of the defendant PHHC <span style="">her
application </span>to purchase said Lot 9, Block K-70 of the <span class="SpellE">Diliman</span> Estate Subdivision, and <span style="">in spite </span>of the fact that the officials and personnel of the said
office have actual know­ledge <span style="">that said
lot has long </span>been occupied and applied for by the herein plaintiff they
deliberately concealed from the latter the filing of the application of the
defendant <span class="SpellE">Melisenda</span> L. Santos, thus depriving said
plain­tiff of her legal rights to oppose the ap­proval of said application and
to bring to the higher authorities her preferential rights to acquire the said
lot in question.</blockquote>

the officials and personnel of the defendant <span style="">PHHC </span>to act accord­ingly on the plaintiff's application, <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>the defendant <span class="SpellE">Melisenda</span>

favor of the deed of sale of the lot in question, <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

Transfer Certificate of Title No. 59796 in favor of the defendant </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Melisenda</span></span><span style=""> </span>L. Santos.</blockquote>

</span>was made in violation of the established policy, rules and regulations
of the defendant PHHC, particular­ly Resolution No. 21, fiscal year 1951-52 of
the Board of Directors of the defendant corporation.</blockquote>

transaction between the defendants with respect to the lot in question the

<p class="BODY">The complaint prayed, among others, that judg­ment be rendered
declaring the deed of sale in favor, and the transfer certificate of title
issued in the name of defendant <span class="SpellE">Melisenda</span> L. Santos
null and void, and directing defendant PHHC to execute in favor of plain­tiff
the corresponding deed of sale over the lot in con­troversy on installment

of said corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 6 and 12, 1963, defendant PHHC and defendants <span class="SpellE">Melisenda</span> L. Santos and Cesar L. Santos, res­pectively,

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The paragraphs of the
complaint, hereinbefore quoted, contain allegations of facts, which show that
the plaintiff had acquired a right -- a preferential right to buy Lot 9, Block
K-70 of the <span class="SpellE">Diliman</span> Estate Subdivision, that the
defendants </span><span style="">were </span><span style="">aware of plain­tiff's
right, and that defendants had committed acts in violation of plaintiff's
rights; and such being the case, the plaintiff </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">entitled to a relief as against </span>the defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">The right asserted by the plaintiff, in her com­plaint, has for
its basis the policy that <span style="">was </span>adopted
by the PHHC, an instrumentality of the government, as embodied in its
Resolution No. 21, Fiscal Year 1951-52, the <span class="SpellE">resolutory</span>
part of which provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"RESOLVED, that in the sale of lots in the former <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Memorial Grove site, the occupants therein be given
the first chance in purchasing said lots; Provided, however, that no sale shall
be made to any person, whether an occupant or an outsider unless previously
investigated and cleared by the MIS; and Provided further, that nothing in this
resolution shall be construed to affect nor encroach the rights and pre­rogatives
of the corporation."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The complaint alleges that since October, 1950 plaintiff and her
husband had been occupying Lot 9, Block K-70 of the <span class="SpellE">Diliman</span>
Estate Subdivision (formerly known <span style="">as </span>the
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Memorial Grove), and they had built thereon
their residential house with an assessed value of P3,250.00; that upon due
investigation conducted sometime before August, 1951 the Chief of the Sales Di­vision
of the PHHC found plaintiff's husband to be the actual occupant of said land
and having been found to be qualified to acquire <span style="">said </span>land by purchase it was recommended that the lot be sold to
plaintiff's husband; that plaintiff's husband died on March 17, 1957, before
the lot was actually sold to him, and so plaintiff, as successor in interest of
her husband, filed an application in her own name to purchase the lot in
question; that thereafter plaintiff made repeated and insistent requests and
representations with the officials and per­sonnel of the Sales Division of the
PHHC to process and forward her application to the Board of Directors of the
PHHC for approval, but said officials and personnel ignored the requests and
representations of the plaintiff; that instead of respecting plaintiff's
preferential right, and in spite of the fact that the officials and person­nel
of the PHHC knew that plaintiff was the actual occupant of the lot,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and without giving notice to the plaintiff
that a party was applying to purchase the same lot, the PHHC sold the same Lot
to defendant <span class="SpellE">Melisenda</span> L. Santos who applied for it
only on February 23, 1961 through an agent; that on January 12, 1962, a deed of
sale of the lot -- with the full price actually paid – was executed, and
shortly thereafter, or on January 23, 1962, Transfer Certificate of Title No.
95976 covering the lot was issued by the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City in favor of said defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint contains al­legations that the
plaintiff was fraudulently deprive <span style="">of
her preferential right </span>to <span style="">buy
the </span>lot <span style="">in question, </span>and
that defendant <span class="SpellE">Melisenda</span> L. Santos was able to secure
the approval of her application to purchase the lot and the execution of the
deed of sale in her favor through the help of an influential politician.</p>

<p class="BODY">A perusal of the complaint would elicit the position of the
plaintiff in her case against the defendants, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>she had a right which she had acquired
pursuant to the very policy promulgated by the defendant PHHC; she was deprived
of the enjoyment of that right when defendant PHHC sold the lot in question to
defendant <span class="SpellE">Melisenda</span> L. Santos who was never an
occupant of the lot and who ap­plied to purchase said lot through an agent much
later; the <span style="">sale </span>of the lot to
the defendant <span class="SpellE">Melisenda</span> L. Santos was made without
her knowledge, much less with her con­sent, and was in violation of the policy
of the PHHC, <span style="">so </span>that the sale
should not be given effect; that she was deprived of her rights through fraud
and/or bad faith, on the part of the officials and personnel of the PHHC and of
defendant <span class="SpellE">Melisenda</span> L. Santos; that defendant <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Melisenda</span></span><span style=""> </span>L. Santos had taken advantage over
her by availing of <span style="">the </span><span style="">help </span>of an
influential politician; and that she had su<span style="">ffered damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In
contending that </span>the complaint states no cause of <span style="">action, </span>the defendants urge that since
plaintiff is not a party to the deed of sale which was executed between the
PHHC and defendant <span class="SpellE">Melisenda</span> L. Santos, and neither
was there in said deed any stipulation referring to plaintiff, the plaintiff
cannot maintain an action to annul the deed of sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants cite the provision of Article
1397 of the Civil Code which states that "The action for the annulment of
contract may be instituted by all who are thereby obliged principally or <span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span>...", and point out that because in the
deed of <span style="">sale </span>plaintiff was
not:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a party and she has no obligation <span style="">under th</span>at deed, either principally or
<span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span>, she cannot maintain the action to annul
said deed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court sustained the
contention of the defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">We note, however, in reading the complaint, that the plaintiff is
seeking the declaration of the nullity of the deed of <span style="">sale </span>not as a party in the deed, or
because she is obliged principally or <span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span>
under the deed, but because she has an interest that is affected by the
deed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has held that a person
who is not a party obliged principally or <span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span>
in a contract ma<span style="">y </span>exercise an
action for nullity of the contract if he is prejudiced in his rights with
respect to one of the contracting parties, and can show the detriment which
would positively result to him from the contract in which he had no
intervention.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, in the case now before <span class="GramE">Us</span>, the complaint
alleges facts which show that plaintiff suffered detriment as a result of the
deed of sale entered into by and between defend­ant PHHC and defendant <span class="SpellE">Melisenda</span> L. Santos.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">We </span>believe that the
plaintiff should be given a chance to present evidence to establish that she
suffered detriment and that she is entitled to relief.</p>

<p class="BODY">We gather from the reading of the complaint that plaintiff seeks
the declaration of the nullity of the deed of sale because it was executed
contrary to public policy and that fraud was exercised by defendants PHHC and <span class="SpellE">Melisenda</span> L. Santos in its execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint, therefore, had posed before
the trial court the question of whether that deed of <span style="">sale was </span>null and void because it was executed in violation of a
public policy, and whether that contract was executed in fraud of a third
person.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The ruling of this Court in the case of Huerta
vs. Acosta, G.R. No.</span> L-20497, promulgated on January 31, 1966, has
relevance to the question of whether the plain­tiff in the case now before Us <span style="">has a </span>cause of action based on the
policy, <span style="">in
connection with the sale of re­sidential lands owned </span>by the government,
of giving pre­ferential right to purchase the land to persons who are prior
actual occupants of the Land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this <span style="">case </span>it appears: that long before the
Government acquired the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Fabie</span></span><span style=""> Estate through expropriation proceedings
under </span>Republic Act 1162 for the purpose of subdividing the same and
reselling the subdivided lots to the tenants or occupants or other persons <span style="">qualified under the law to acquire said lots,
Antonia <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> Huerta had
occu­pied a </span>portion of the aforementioned estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order to carry out the function of
subdividing the <span class="SpellE">Fabie</span> Estate into small lots the Land
Tenure Administration prepared a plan showing the subdivided lots and allotted
the sub­divided lots to the tenants or occupants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Antonia <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE"><span style="">de</span></span><span style=""> Huerta filed an application to purchase Lot
No. 14 and an agreement to sell covering said lot was entered into between </span>her
and the Land Tenure <span style="">Administration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> H. Acosta </span>filed
an <span style="">application to buy Lot No. 13, which
adjoins </span><st1:place><span style="">Lot</span></st1:place><span style=""> 14 that was sold to Huerta, and an outright
sale was executed in Acosta's favor and Transfer Certificate of Title No. 50570
was issued in his name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finding later
that the septic tank of her house and other improvements previously put up by
her are found in </span>portion of Lot 13, Huerta requested the Land Tenure
Administration to award to <span style="">her Lot 13
in addition </span>to Lot 14, <span style="">or that:
portion of Lot 13 where her septic tank is found be segregated and made part of
Lot 14 inasmuch as said portion </span>was never occupied by Acosta.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Huerta's request was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since Huerta continued occupying the disputed
portion of Lot 13, Acosta filed an action before the Court of First Instance of
Manila to recover possession and owner­<span style="">ship
of that portion of Lot </span>13 occupied by Huerta.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Huerta, in her answer, set up the defense
that she had <span style="">a preferential right to
purchase the disputed portion because she was the <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u>
tenant or occupant thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial
court decided </span>the case <span style="">in </span>favor
of Huerta, and adjudicated to her the portion of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 13
where her septic tank <span style="">was </span>located,
with an area of thirty square meters.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the trial court, but on
appeal to this Court the decision of the Court of Appeals was reversed. This
Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"It <span style="">is </span>admitted
that the disputed portion of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 13 containing 30 sq. m.
had never been occupied by <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> Acosta, for even
long before the Government acquired the <span class="SpellE">Fabie</span> Estate
