				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Broadly stated, petitioner's appeal challenges the Correctness of
the Auditor General's ruling that "[r]<span class="SpellE">emittances</span>
of <span class="SpellE">premia</span> on insurance policies issued or renewed on
or after July 16, 1959, or even if issued or renewed before the said date, but
their reinsurance was effected only thereafter, are not exempt from the margin
fee, even if the reinsurance treaty under which they are reinsured was approved
by the Central Bank before July 16, 1959."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So stated, the case calls into question the applicability of Section 3
of the Margin Law (Republic Act 2609, approved on July 16, 1959) which exempts
certain obligations from payment of the margin fee, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 3. The provisions of this Act shall not apply to the
liquidation of drafts drawn under letters of credit nor of contractual
obligations calling for payment of foreign exchange issued, approved and
outstanding as of the date this Act takes effect and the extension thereof,
with the same terms and conditions as the original contractual
obligations:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>, That the
repayment of loans contracted by the government of the Philippines with foreign
governments and/or private banks and the importation of machineries and
equipment by provinces, cities or municipalities for the exclusive use in the
operation of public utilities fully-owned and maintained by them shall likewise
be exempted from the operation of this Act."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appropriate to state here is that - except as otherwise in the
law stated - the Margin Law subjects all sales of foreign exchange by the
Central Bank and its authorized agent banks to a uniform margin of not more than
forty per cent (40%) over the banks' selling rates.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Monetary Board is empowered to fix the

<p class="BODY">Following are the facts that gave rise to the present controversy:</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 1, 1950, Philippine American Life Insurance Company [<span class="SpellE">Philamlife</span>], a domestic life insurance corporation, and
American International Reinsurance Company [<span class="SpellE">Airco</span>] of
Pembroke, Bermuda, a corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of Panama,
entered into an agreement - reinsurance treaty - which provides in its
paragraph 1, Article I, the following:</p>

<blockquote>"ARTICLE I On and after the 1st day of
January 1950, the Ceding Company [<span class="SpellE">Philamlife</span>] agrees
to reinsure with AIRCO the entire first excess of such life insurance on the
lives of persons as may be Written by the Ceding Company under direct
application over and above its maximum limit of retention for life insurance,
and AIRCO binds itself, subject to the to terms and provisions of this agreement,
to accept such reinsurances on the same terms and for an amount not exceeding
its maximum limit for automatic acceptance of life reinsurance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">By the third paragraph of the same Article I, it is also
stipulated that even though <span class="SpellE">Philamlife</span> "is already
on a risk for its maximum retention under policies previously issued, when new
policies are applied for and issued [<span class="SpellE">Philamlife</span>] <u>can
cede</u> <u>automatically</u> any amount, within the limits x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> specified, on the same terms
on which it would be willing to accept the risk for its own account, if it did
not already have its limit of retention."</p>

<p class="BODY">Reinsurances under said reinsurance treaty of January 1, 1950 <u>may</u>
<u>also</u> be had <span class="SpellE">facultatively</span> upon other cases
pursuant to Article II thereof, whereby <span class="SpellE">Airco's</span>
liability begins from acceptance of the risk, These cases include those set
forth in paragraph 2 of the treaty's Article I which expressly excludes from
automatic reinsurance the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a)
any application for life insurance with <span class="SpellE">Philamlife</span>
which, together with other papers containing information as to insurability of
the risk, shows that "the total amount of life insurance (including
accidental death benefit) applied for to or already issued by all com­panies
[other life insurance companies which had previously accepted the risk] exceeds
the equivalent of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) United States
currency;" and (b) any life on which <span class="SpellE">Philamlife</span>
"retains for its own account less than its regular maximum limit of
retention for the age, Sex, plan, rating and occupation of the risk."</p>

<p class="BODY">Every life insurance policy reinsured under the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> agreement "shall be upon the yearly
renewable term plan for the amount at risk under the policy reinsured."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Philamlife</span> agrees to pay premiums for all reinsurances
"on an annual premium basis."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is conceded that no question ever arose with respect to the
remittances made by <span class="SpellE">Philamlife</span> to <span class="SpellE">Airco</span>
before <st1:date year="1959" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1959</st1:date>, the
date of approval of the Margin Law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Central Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
collected the sum of P268,747.48 as foreign exchange margin on <span class="SpellE">Philamlife</span> remittances to <span class="SpellE">Airco</span>
purported <span class="SpellE">totalling</span> $610, 998.63 and made subsequent
to <st1:date year="1959" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1959</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Philamlife</span> subsequently filed with the
Central Bank a claim for the refund of the above sum of P268,747.48.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ground <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
was that the reinsurance premiums so remitted were paid pursuant to the <st1:date year="1950" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1950</st1:date> reinsurance treaty,
and, therefore, were pre-existing obligations expressly exempt from the margin
fee.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 7, 1960, the Monetary Board in line with the opinion of
its Acting Legal Counsel - resolved that "reinsurance contracts entered
into and approved by the Central Bank before July 17, 1959 are exempt from the
payment of the 35% foreign exchange margin, even if remittances thereof are
made after July 17, 1959," because such remittances “are only made in the
implementation of a mother contract, a continuing contract which is the
reinsurance treaty."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing resolution notwithstanding, the Auditor of the
Central Bank, on <st1:date year="1961" day="19" month="4">April 19, 1961</st1:date>,
refused to pass in audit <span class="SpellE">Philamlife's</span> claim for
refund.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1961</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Philamlife</span> sought reconsideration with the Auditor
General.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="24" month="10">October 24, 1961</st1:date>,
the request for reconsideration was denied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Auditor General in effect expressed the view that the existence of
the reinsurance treaty of <st1:date year="1950" day="1" month="1">January 1,
 1950</st1:date> did not place reinsurance <span class="SpellE">premia</span> -
on reinsurance effected <u>on</u> <u>or</u> <u>after</u> the approval of the
Margin Law on <st1:date year="1959" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1959</st1:date>
- out of the reach of said statute.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present petition for review.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The thrust of
petitioner's argument is that the <span class="SpellE">premia</span> remitted
were in pursuance of its reinsurance treaty with <span class="SpellE">Airco</span>
of <st1:date year="1959" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1959</st1:date> a
contract antedating the Margin Law, which took effect only on July 16.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the validity of such claim must be tested by the provisions
of Section 3 of the Margin Law quoted earlier in this opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said Section expressly withholds the
enforcement of the provisions of said Act on "contractual obligations
calling for payment of foreign exchange issued, approved and outstanding as of
the date this Act takes effect and the extension thereof, with the same terms
and conditions as the original contractual obligations."</p>

<p class="BODY">True, the reinsurance treaty precedes the Margin Law by over nine
years. Nothing in that treaty, however, obligates <span class="SpellE">Philamlife</span>
to remit to <span class="SpellE">Airco</span> a fixed, certain, and obligatory
sum by way of reinsurance premiums.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
that the reinsurance treaty provides on this point is that <span class="SpellE">Philamlife</span>
"agrees to reinsure." The treaty speaks of a probability; not a
reality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, without it reinsurance, no
premium is due.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course the
reinsurance treaty lays down the duty to remit premiums - if any reinsurance is
effected on the covenants in that treaty written. So it is that the reinsurance
treaty <u>per</u> <u>se</u> cannot give rise to a contractual obligation
calling for the payment of foreign exchange "issued, approved and
outstanding as of the date this Act (Republic Act 2609] takes effect."</p>

<p class="BODY">For an exemption to come into play, there must be a reinsurance
policy <u>or</u>, as in the reinsurance treaty provided, a "reinsurance
cession"<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
which may be automatic or facultative. <a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There should not be any misapprehension as to the distinction
between a <u>reinsurance</u> <u>treaty</u>, on the one hand, and a <u>reinsurance</u>
<u>policy</u> or a <u>reinsurance</u> <u>cession</u>, on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The concept of one and the other is well
expressed thus:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> A
reinsurance policy is thus a contract of indemnity one insurer makes with
another to protect the first insurer from a risk it has already assumed. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>. .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In contradistinction, a reinsurance treaty is
merely an agreement between two insurance companies whereby one agrees <u>to</u>
<u>cede</u> and the other <u>to</u> <u>accept</u> reinsurance business pursuant
to provisions specified in the treaty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The practice of issuing policies by insurance companies includes, among
other things, the issuance of reinsurance policies on standard risks and also
on substandard risks under special arrangements. The <u>lumping</u> of the
different agreements <u>under</u> <u>a</u> <u>contract</u> has resulted in the
term known to the insurance world as 'treaties.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a treaty is, in fact, an agreement
between insurance companies to cover the different situations described:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reinsurance treaties and reinsurance policies
are not synonymous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Treaties are
contracts <u>for</u> insurance; reinsurance policies or cessions x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> are contracts <u>of</u>
insurance."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Philamlife's</span> obligation to remit
reinsurance premiums becomes fixed and definite upon the execution of the
reinsurance cession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, for every
life insurance policy ceded to <span class="SpellE">Airco</span>, <span class="SpellE">Philamlife</span> agrees to pay premium.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only after a reinsurance cession is
made that pay­ment of reinsurance premium may be exacted, as it is only after <span class="SpellE">Philamlife</span> seeks to remit that reinsurance premium that the
obligation to pay the margin fee arises.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the premise that the margin fee of P268,747.48 was collected
on remittances made on reinsurance effected on or after the Margin Law took
effect, refund thereof does not come within the coverage of the exemption
circumscribed in Section 3 of the said law.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor will the argument
that the Margin Law impairs the obligation of contract - constitutionally
proscribed - under the reinsurance treaty, carry the day for petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's point is that if the Margin Law were applied, it
"would have paid much more to have the continuing benefit of reinsurance
of its risks then it has been required to do so by the reinsurance treaty in
question" and that "the theoretical equality between the contracting
parties x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> would be
disturbed and one of them placed at a distinct disadvantage in relation to the
other."</p>

<p class="BODY">This pose at once loses potency on the face of the rule
long" recognized that existing laws form part of the contract "as the
measure of the obligation to perform them by the one party and the right acquired
by the other."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated otherwise, "[t]he obligation does
not inhere, and subsist in the contract itself, <span class="SpellE">propio</span>
<span class="SpellE">vigore</span>, but in the law applicable to the
contract."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, Article 1315 of the Civil Code gives
out the precept that parties to a perfected contract "are bound x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> to all the consequences
which, according to their nature, may be in keeping with x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <u>law</u>."</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, when petitioner entered into the reinsurance treaty
of <st1:date year="1950" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1950</st1:date> with <span class="SpellE">Airco</span>, it did so with the understanding that the municipal
laws of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
at the time said treaty was executed, became an unwritten condition
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such municipal laws constitute
part of the obligation of contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is in this context that we say that Republic Act 265, the Central Bank Act,
enacted on <st1:date year="1948" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1948</st1:date> -
previous to the date of the reinsurance treaty - became a part of the
obligation of contract created by the latter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And under Republic Act 265, reasonable restrictions may be imposed by
the State through the Central Bank on all foreign exchange transactions
"in order to protect the inter­national reserve of the Central Bank during
an exchange crisis."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Margin Law is nothing more than a
supplement the Central Bank Act; it is a reasonable restriction on transactions
in foreign exchange.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It, too, is an
additional arm given the Central Bank to attain its objec­tives, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) "[t]o maintain monetary stability in
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>;"
and (2) "([t]o preserve the international value of the peso and the
convertibility of the peso into other freely convertible currencies."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>On top of all these is that that statute was
enacted in a background of "dangerously low international reserves."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The following explanatory note by the Committee on Banks,
Currency and Corporations on House Bill No. 3663, which later became the Margin
Law; Republic Act 2609, is expressive of the purpose of the law, namely, to
reduce the excessive demand on and prevent further decline of our international
reserves; <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:</p>

<blockquote>“The international reserves of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
have reached such a low level as to require remedial action beyond that
provided in Republic Act No. 265, in spite of exchange controls which have been
in force since 1949.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decline in the
level of our international reserves has persisted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The means and the measures presently
authorized in the Charter of the Central Bank for dealing with the balance of
payments problem have been found inadequate.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The purpose of this Bill is to provide the Central Bank with an
additional instrument for effectively coping with the problem and achieving
domestic and international stability of our currency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The additional instrument of Central Bank
action provided for by this bill consists of a cost restriction on all imports,
as well as invisibles, to reduce the excessive demand for foreign
exchange.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proceeds that may accrue
to the Central Bank from the margin will be distributed in accordance with the
provisions of section 41 of the Bank's Charter."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">That some such law as Republic Act 2609 was envisioned by the
contracting parties, <span class="SpellE">Philamlife</span> and <span class="SpellE">Airco</span>, when the January 1, 1950 reinsurance treaty was
executed, may be gleaned from the provisions of Article VI of said treaty <span class="SpellE">whereunder</span> "[e]<span class="SpellE">xcept</span> in
those instances where AIRCO is taxed directly and independently on premiums
collected by it from the Ceding Company, AIRCO shall reimburse the Ceding
Company for the tax paid on reinsurance premiums, paid AIRCO by the Ceding.
Company which are not allowed the Ceding Company, as a deduction in the tax
statement of the Ceding Company."</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner complains that reinsurance contracts abroad would be
made impractical by the imposition of the 25% margin fee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reasons there are which should deter us from
giving in to this view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, there is
no concrete evidence that such imposition of the 25% margin fee is
unreasonable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Second, if really
continuance of the existing reinsurance treaty becomes unbearable, that
contract itself provides that petitioner may <span class="SpellE">potestatively</span>
write <u>finis</u> thereto on ninety days' written notice.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In truth, petitioner is not forced to
continue its reinsurance treaty indefinitely with <span class="SpellE">Airco</span>.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another roadblock is
astride petitioner's route to refund.</p>

<p class="BODY">To maintain domestic and international stability in currency is a
primary concern of the State; it is in pursuance of the consti­tutional
mandate, in the preamble ordained, to "promote the general welfare";
it is a Matter of public policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
could mean action to forestall a currency debacle, to improve the low international
reserve, or to conserve and even increase such reserve.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Margin Law, Republic Act 2609, it is well to remember, is a
remedial currency measure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was thus
passed to reduce as far as is practicable the excessive demand for foreign
exchange.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's stand that
because it had a continuing - though revocable – reinsurance treaty with <span class="SpellE">Airco</span>, all remittances of reinsurance <span class="SpellE">premia</span>
made by it to its foreign <span class="SpellE">reinsurer</span> should be
withdrawn from the operation of the Margin Law, we are constrained to state, is
at war with the State's economic policy of preserving the stability of our
currency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner may not, in the
words of the Solicitor General, "tie the hands of the State and render it
powerless to impose certain margin or cost restrictions on its remittances of
reinsurance <span class="SpellE">premia</span> in foreign exchange to fall due as
policies become <span class="SpellE">reinsurable</span> under said treaty,
whenever such remittances would constitute an excessive demand on our
international reserves."</p>

<p class="BODY">Viewed from this focal point, there cannot be an impairment of
the obligation of contracts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, the
State may, through its police power adopt whatever economic policy may
reasonably be deemed to promote public welfare, and to enforce that policy by
legislation adapted to its purpose.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have, in <u>Abe</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Foster</u>

reasonable legislative regulation aimed at the promotion of public health,
morals, safety and welfare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, the constitutional guaranty of non-impairment of obligations of contract
is limited by the exercise of the police power of the State, in the interest of
public health, safety, morals and general welfare."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been said, and we believe correctly,
that "the economic interests of the State may justify the exercise of its
continuing and dominant protective power notwithstanding interference with
contracts."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It bears repetition to state at this point

reasons out that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Under our form
of government the use of property and the making of contracts are normally
matters of private and not of public concern. The general rule is that both
shall be free of governmental interference.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But neither property rights nor contract rights are absolute; for
government cannot exist if the citizen may at will use his property to the
detriment of his fellows, or exercise his freedom of contract to work them
harm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Equally fundamental with the
private right is that of the public to regulate it in the common
interest."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As emphatic, if not
more, is the following from <st1:city><st1:place><u>Norman</u></st1:place></st1:city>
<u>vs</u>. <u>Baltimore</u> <u>&amp;</u> <u>Ohio</u> <u>Railroad</u> <u>Company</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“Contracts, however express,
cannot fetter the constitutional authority of the Congress. Contracts may
create rights of property, but when contracts deal with a subject matter which
lies within the control of the Congress, they have a congenital infirmity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Parties cannot remove their transactions<span style="">&nbsp; </span>from the reach of dominant constitutional
power by making contracts about them."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>More. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>In another case,
pronouncement was made that: "Not only are existing laws read into
contracts in order to fix obligations as between the parties, but <u>the</u> <u>reservation</u>
<u>of</u> <u>essential attributes</u> <u>of</u> <u>sovereign</u> <u>power</u> <u>is</u>
<u>also</u> <u>read</u> <u>into</u> <u>contracts</u> <u>as</u> <u>a</u> <u>postulate</u>
<u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>legal</u> <u>order</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The policy of protecting contracts against impairment presupposes the
maintenance of a government by virtue of which contractual relations are worth
while, - a government which retains adequate authority to secure the peace and
good order of society."<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0in;"><u>In</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>pari</u></span>

brief may be cited:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> Even in the field of taxation, authorities are
numerous to the effect that a lawful tax on a new subject, or an increased tax
on an old one, interferes not with a contract or impairs its obligation within
the meaning of the Constitution, even though such taxation may affect
particular contracts so as to increase the debt of one party or lessen the
security of another, or impose additional burdens upon one class and release
the burdens of the other class (La Insular <i style="">v</i>.
<span class="SpellE">Machuca</span> Go-<span class="SpellE">Tauco</span>, 39 Phil.
567, and authorities cited therein).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, the imposition of a tax under a statute passed after a contract
has been entered into was held not an impairment of the obligation of contract
even if the immediate consequence of the tax is to make the contract less
profitable to one of the parties (<span class="SpellE">Kehrer</span> <i style="">v</i>. Stewart, 197 U S 60, 49 L. ed. 663;
Tanner <i style="">v</i>. Little, 240 U.S. 369, 60 L.
ed. 691; La Insular <i style="">v</i>. <span class="SpellE">Machuca</span> Go-<span class="SpellE">Tauco</span>, <i style="">supra</i>), the reason being that all
contracts are made subject to the taxing powers of the government (Clement
National Bank <i style="">v</i>. State of Vermont,
231 U.S. 120, 58 L. ed. 148)."</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">FERNANDO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">Let me make clear at the outset that I join the rest of my
colleagues in giving assent to the opinion of the Court distinguished by the
usual high standard invariably associated with the pen of Justice Sanchez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No possible objection exists either as to the
statement of the legal issue posed or the result arrived at.</p>

<p class="BODY">This opinion deals solely with the possible unconstitutional
application of Section 3 of the Law in view of the command of the
non-impairment clause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is undeniable
that the claim made by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Philamlife</span> as to
its applicability cannot be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is equally accurate to affirm that "the State may through its
police power, adopt whatever economic policy may reasonably be deemed to
promote public welfare, and to enforce that policy by legislation adopted to
its purpose."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that sense
necessarily, the guarantee against non-impairment as the majority opinions so
aptly states "does not bar a proper exercise of the police power."</p>

<p class="BODY">Such a statement provokes further thought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be said without rendering nugatory
the constitutional guarantee of non-impairment, and for that matter both the
equal protection and due process clauses which equally serve to protect
property rights, that at the mere invo­cation of the police power, the
objection on non-impairment grounds automatically loses force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, as in other cases where governmental
authority may trench upon property rights, the process of balancing, adjustment
or harmonization is called for.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not then the <u>formulation</u> of the applicable consti­tutional
principle which, as above stated, has been set forth with clarity and accuracy
that invites further scrutiny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
rather the <u>process</u> by which the disposition of a controversy whenever
the protection of the contract clause is sought that, to my mind, needs
additional emphasis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this
concurring opinion.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constitution
provides:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No law impairing the
obligation of contracts shall be passed.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The above constitutional provision is
self-explanatory. This Court had occasion once to look upon it as implementing
the constitutional right to freedom of contract. <a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>A similar provision exists in the
Constitution of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as a restriction against any state legislation of that character.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It serves as an added protection to pro­perty
rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That such is its aim and intent
is made clear by an excerpt from the opinion of Chief Justice Hughes in the
leading case of <u>Home Building &amp; Loan Association v. <span class="SpellE">Blaisdell</span></u>:<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
"In the construction of the contract clause, the debates in the
Constitutional Con­vention are of little aid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But the reasons which led to the adoption of that clause, and of the
other prohibitions of section 10 of article 1, are not left in doubt, and have
frequently been described with eloquent emphasis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The widespread distress following the
revolutionary period and the plight of debtors had called forth in the States
an ignoble array of legislative schemes for the defeat of creditors and the
invasion of contractual obligations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Legislative interferences had been so numerous and extreme that the
confidence essential to prosperous trade had been undermined and the utter
destruction of credit was threatened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘The
sober people of <st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region>'
was convinced that some 'through reform' was needed which would 'inspire a
general prudence and industry, and give a regular course to the business of
society.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Federalist, No. 44.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was necessary to interpose the restraining
power of a central authority in order to secure the foundations even of
'private faith.’"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The framers of
the Constitutional Convention chose to incorporate such a provision in our
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our people voiced their
agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should not be reduced to a
barren form of words.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Rutter</span>
v. Esteban<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
lends support to such an approach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
that leading case, the continued operation and enforcement of the Moratorium
Act<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
which allowed an eight-year period of grace for the payment of prewar
obligations on the part of debtors who suffered as a consequence of World War
II was, in a 1953 decision, held "unreasonable and oppressive, and should
not be prolonged a minute longer" for being <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of the constitutional provision prohibiting the impairment of the obligation of
the contracts "and, therefore, * * should be declared null and void and
without effect."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is one conspicuous instance then, where
notwithstanding the admission earlier in the opinion that police power could be
relied upon to sustain its validity at the time of its enactment in 1948, in
view of the serious economic condition faced by the country upon liberation and
the state of penury that then afflicted a greater portion of the Filipino
people, could by 1953 be rightfully considered as an infringement of the
non-impairment clause, as the economy had in the meanwhile considerably changed
for the better. There is no clearer instance then of the process of
harmonization and balancing which is incumbent upon the judiciary to undertake
whenever a regulatory measure under the police power is assailed as <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of Constitutional guarantees, whether of
non-impairment, due process or equal protection, all of which are intended to
safeguard property rights.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the opinion of Justice Bautista Angelo in <span class="SpellE">Rutter</span>
v. Esteban, there was this categorical declaration:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"There are at least three cases where the
Supreme Court of the United States declared the moratorium laws <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the contract clause of the Constitution
because the period granted to debtors as a. relief was found unwarranted by the
contemplated emergency."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further on, in his opinion, was the
following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In addition, we may
cite leading state court decisions which practically involved the same ruling
and which reflect the tendency of the courts<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>towards legisla­tion involving modification of Mortgage or monetary
contracts which contains provisions that are deemed un­reasonable or
oppressive."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It may be out of excess of caution, but I feel that no such
overtone or nuance should be considered as emanating from our decision today, the
effect of which would be to diminish the force and cogency of the <span class="SpellE">Rutter</span> holding insofar as the continued vitality of the
non-Impairment clause in appropriate situations is concerned.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The opinion of the Court
is strengthened and for­tified by a citation of three leading decisions of the
United States Supreme Court, Home Building &amp; Loan Association v. <span class="SpellE">Blaisdell</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Nebbia</span> v. <st1:state><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:state>,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
and <st1:city><st1:place>Norman</st1:place></st1:city> v. Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad Co.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">All of the above decisions reflect the view that an enactment of
a police power measure does not <u>per</u> <u>se</u> call for the overruling of
objections based on either due process or non-impairment grounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There must be that balancing, or adjustment,
or harmonization of the conflicting claims posed by an exercise of state
regulatory power on the one hand and assertion of rights to property, whether
of natural or of juridical persons, on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is the only way by which the
constitutional guarantees may serve the high ends that call for their inclusion
in the Constitution and thus effectively preclude any abusive exercise of
governmental authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, it may be observed that the above three
decisions, the <span class="SpellE">Blaisdell</span> case upholding the validity
of the Minnesota Mortgage Moratorium Law, the <span class="SpellE">Nebbia</span>
case sustaining the constitutionality of a price-fixing statute to protect the
dairy industry of New York dealing as it does with such a vital but perishable
commodity as milk, and the Norman decision affirming a lower court decree
deciding that the joint Resolution of June 5, 1933 of the American Congress to
the effect that a requirement as to payment in gold or in a particular kind of
coin or currency is against public policy and that every obligation theretofore
or thereafter incurred should be discharged upon payment, dollar for dollar, in
any coin or currency which at the time of payment is legal tender for public
and private debts, all deal with emergency legislation necessitated by the
grave economic situation then con­fronting the United States in the thirties,
faced as she was with a major business depression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Margin Law,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
which called for interpretation in this case was likewise a response to an
economic problem, perhaps not as grave but sufficiently serious in character.</p>

<p class="BODY">But enough of generalities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the opinion of <span class="SpellE">Blaisdell</span> case, penned by
the then Chief Justice Hughes, there was this understandable stress on
balancing or harmonizing, which is called for in litigations of this
character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The policy of protecting contracts
against impairment presupposes the maintenance of a government by virtue of
which contractual relations are worthwhile - a government which retains
adequate authority to secure the peace and good order of society.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This principle of harmonizing the
constitutional prohibition with the necessary residuum of state power has had
progressive recognition in the decisions of this Court."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also to the same effect:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Undoubtedly, whatever is reserved of
state power must be consistent with the fair intent of the constitutional
limitation of that power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reserved
power cannot be construed so as to destroy the limitation, nor is the
limitation to be construed to destroy the reserved power in its essential
aspects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They must be construed in
harmony with each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Principle
precludes a construction which would permit the State to adopt as its policy
the repudiation of debts or the destruction of contracts or the denial of means
to enforce them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it does not follow
that conditions may not arise in which a temporary restraint of enforcement may
be consistent with the spirit and purpose of the consti­tutional provision and
thus be found to be within the range of the reserved power of the State to
protect the vital interests of the community."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further on, Chief Justice Hughes likewise stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is manifest from this review of our
decisions that there has been a growing appreciation of public needs and of the
necessity of finding ground for a rational compromise between individual rights
and public welfare."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was also Chief Justice Hughes, who spoke for the Court in <st1:city><st1:place>Norman</st1:place></st1:city>
v. Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Co.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
was emphasized there by him reflected with fidelity this particular approach.
Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Despite the wide range of
the discussion at the bar and the earnestness with which the arguments against
the validity of the Joint Resolution have been pressed, these contentions
necessarily are brought, under the dominant principles to which we have
referred, to a single and narrow point.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That point is whether the gold clauses do constitute an actual
interference with the monetary policy of the Congress in the light of its broad
power to determine that policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether
they may be deemed to be such an interference depends upon an appraisement of
economic conditions and upon determinations of questions of fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to those conditions and
determinations, the Congress is entitled to its own judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We may inquire whether its action is
arbitrary or capricious, that is whether it has reasonable relation to a
legitimate end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it is an appropriate
means to such an end, the decision, of the Congress as to the degree of the
necessity for the adoption of that means, is final."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was Justice Roberts' turn to announce the opinion of the Court
in <span class="SpellE">Nebbia</span> v. <st1:state><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:state>.
According to him:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The Fifth
Amendment, in the field of federal activity, and the Fourteenth, as respects
State action, do not prohibit governmental regulation for the public
welfare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They merely condition the
exertion of the admitted power, by securing that the end shall be accomplished
by methods consistent with due process.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And the guaranty of due process, as has often been held, demands only
that the law shall not be unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious, and that the
means selected shall have a real and substantial relation to the object sought
to be attained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It results that a
regulation valid for one sort of business, or in given circumstances, may be
invalid for another sort, or for the same business under other circumstances,
because the reasonableness of each regulation depends upon the relevant
facts."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>That a process of balancing or harmonization
is the medium through which the requirement of reasonableness could be met was
stressed later In his opinion by Justice Roberts in these words:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is clear that there is no closed
class or category of business affected with a public interest, and the function
of courts in the application of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments is to
determine in each case whether circumstances vindicate the challenged
regulation as a reasonable exertion of governmental authority or condemn it as
arbitrary or discriminatory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The phrase
'affected with a public interest' can, in the nature of things, mean no more
than that an industry, for adequate reason, is subject to control for the

laid, as this concurring opinion does, on the pressing and inescapable need for
such an approach whenever a possible collision between state authority and an
assertion of constitutional right to pro­perty may exist, it is not to depart
from what sound consti­tutional orthodoxy dictates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is rather to abide by what it
compels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In litigations of this
character then, perhaps much more so than in other disputes, where there is a
reliance on a constitutional provision, the judiciary cannot escape what Holmes
fitly referred to as the sovereign prerogative of choice, the exercise of which
might possibly be impugned if there be no attempt, however slight, at such an
effort of adjusting or reconciling the respective claims of state regulatory
power and constitutionally pro­tected rights.</p>

290 US 398 (1934) To the same effect is this statement by Professor Hale:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The framers of the Constitution were
resolved to prevent, if they could, a repetition of attacks which state
legislatures had from time to time made upon property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With an apprehension of ‘the violent acts
which might grow out of the feelings of the moment', the 'people,’ in adopting
the Constitution, 'manifested a determination to shield themselves and their
property from the effects of those sudden and strong passions to which men are
exposed' - as Marshall expressed it."<span style="">&nbsp;
