entry of the decree of registration awarding a certificate of title in defendant's
favor on <st1:date year="1964" day="18" month="12">December 18, 1964</st1:date>,
no rights of an innocent purchaser for value have supervened.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint prayed that the decree of registration and the
title issued in the defendant's name <span style="">be
cancelled and/or amended with respect to the portion actually and continuously
occupied and cultivated by plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Gabila</span>, and that
the said plaintiff </span><span style="">be </span><span style="">granted such other relief as the court might
deem just and equitable in the </span><span style="">premises.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On December <span style="">8, </span>1967, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the amended
complaint on the grounds that the action being one for cancellation of a free
patent and of the certificate of title issued on the basis thereof, the
Government, through the Solicitor General - not a private individual like
plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Gabila</span> - was the real party in interest;
and that although the Director of Lands was included as party plaintiff, the
complaint was signed by a lawyer representing only plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Gabila</span>, without any showing as to who was appearing for and
in behalf of the Director of Lands, who - by the way - was not shown to have
been authorized by the Solicitor General to enter the case as plaintiff; thus,
the said Director of Lands was without legal capacity to sue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Gabila</span>
opposed the motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The parties were heard on the motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1968" day="9" month="2">February
 9, 1968</st1:date>, the court below granted the motion for lack of
jurisdiction over the subject matter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court was of the opinion that while the Director of Lands was
included as a party plaintiff, there was no showing in the complaint that he
was being represented by an authorized agent or representative; hence,
actually, the only plaintiff in the case was Carlos S. <span class="SpellE">Gabila</span>
who, however, had neither legal competence nor interest to sue the defendant
for cancellation of the latter's title.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to the trial court, the real party in interest was the
Republic of the Philippines, which is the only entity that can legally maintain
- thru the Solicitor General - an action to cancel a title issued by virtue of
a land patent, considering especially, as the court said, that the defendant's
title has already become indefeasible.</p>

<p class="BODY">The present motion to <span style="">dismiss </span>is actually predicated on Section
1(g), Rule 16 of the Revised Rules of Court, i.e., failure of the complaint to
state a cause of action, for it alleges in paragraph 12 thereof that the
plaintiff admits that he has no right to demand the cancellation or amendment
of the defendant's title, because, even if the said title ware cancelled or
amended, the ownership of the <span style="">land </span>embraced
therein, or of the portion thereof affected by the amendment, would revert to
the public domain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his amended
complaint the plaintiff makes no pretense at all that any part of the land <span style="">covered </span>by
the defendant's title was privately owned by him or by his predecessors-in-interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it is admitted therein that the said
land was at all times a part of the public domain until <st1:date year="1964" day="18" month="12">December 18, 1964</st1:date>, when the government issued a
title thereon in favor of the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, if there is any person or entity entitled to relief, it can only
be the government.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the plaintiff's own averments negate the
existence of such a right, for it would appear <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
that whatever right might have been violated by the defendant belonged to the
government, not to the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Plaintiff-appellant </span>argues that
although his complaint is captioned as one for cancellation of title, he has
nevertheless stated therein several causes of action based on his alleged
rights of possession and ownership over the improvements, on defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> alleged fraudulent acquisition of the land, and
on the damages allegedly incurred by him (plaintiff-appellant) in relation to
the improvements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These matters are
merely ancillary to the central issue of whether or not defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> title should be cancelled or amended, and they
may not be leaned upon in an effort to make out a cause of action in relation
to the said focal issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the
principal relief prayed for in the amended complaint is the cancellation or
amendment of defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> title.</p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that the amended complaint has included the
Director of Lands as a party plaintiff, the said government official is <span style="">a </span>plaintiff only in name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amended complaint is signed by a lawyer
admittedly representing only plaintiff Carlos <span style="">S. </span><span class="SpellE">Gabila</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General or his representative,
or anyone else for that matter, has not represented the Director of Lands at
any stage of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, it
would appear that the inclusion of the Director of Lands in the amended
complaint without his knowledge or consent was but an afterthought of plaintiff
<span class="SpellE">Gabila</span> engendered by his correct belief that the
nature of the suit he wanted to file called <span style="">for </span>the inclusion of the government as a party to the case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order appealed from is hereby set
aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records of this case are
ordered returned to the court of origin where the party interested should
formally <span class="SpellE">implead</span> the Director of Lands, with notice
to the Solicitor General, subject to terms and conditions which the trial court
may impose, with the understanding that if the aforementioned official is not <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span>, this case shall be dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No special pro<span style="">nouncement </span>as to costs.</p>
