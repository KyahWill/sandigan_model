				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by defendant, Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>,
from a decision and a supplemental decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Isa­bela</span>, ordering him to execute a deed conveying the
property in litigation to plaintiff, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>,
and to transfer to his name the corresponding tax declaration, as well as to
surrender to the court, within three (3) days from notice, the owner's dupli­cate
of TCT No. T-16798 of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, and sentencing <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> to pay to <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> the
following sums, namely; (1) P400, as attorney's fees; (2) P400, as expenses of
litigation; (3) P200, as exemplary or corrective damages; (4) P30, for
certified true copies presented as exhibits; (5) P50, as nominal damages; (6)
P48.87, as docket and sheriff fees; and (7) double costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The subject-matter of this case is part of Lot No. 5463 of the
Santiago <span class="SpellE">Cadaster</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Isabela</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
which lot has an area of 23.1749 hectares.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lot originally belonged to <span class="SpellE">Romualdo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gaffud</span>, in whose favor OCT No. I-2174 of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span> had been issued.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1940" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1940</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Gaffud</span> conditionally sold to <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> - father-in-law of plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> - a portion of said lot, of about 16 hectares,
which had been in <span class="SpellE">Clemente's</span> possession since
1939.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1943" day="3" month="3">March 3, 1943</st1:date>, upon full payment of the stipulated price,
the corresponding deed of absolute sale - subsequently approved by the Secretary
of Agriculture and Natural Resources - in favor of <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>,
was executed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The portion thus conveyed
was there­upon segregated - through subdivision plan <span class="SpellE">Psd</span>
21575, approved on September 30, 1947 - and designated as Lot No. 5463-A, with
an area of 15.9987 hectares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> tried to register said deed of absolute sale with
the office of the Register of Deeds, but failed to accomplish his purpose,
seemingly, because of absence of the owner's duplicate certificate of title,
which, <span class="SpellE">Gaffud</span> said, was in the possession of a
priest.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1949" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1949</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Gaffud</span> executed, in favor of Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Cachen</span>, another deed of absolute sale of Lot No. 5463, for
the sum of P5,000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It turned out, later
on, that this sum had not been paid to <span class="SpellE">Gaffud</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon presentation of the deed of sale in
favor of <span class="SpellE">Cachen</span> and of the owner's duplicate of OCT
No. I-2174, said certificate of title was, on <st1:date year="1949" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1949</st1:date>, cancelled and, in lieu thereof, TCT No.
T­-1633 was issued, in the name of <span class="SpellE">Cachen</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter did not, how­ever, take possession
of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On July 1, 1950 - or over
two (2) months after the death of <span class="SpellE">Gaffud</span>, on April
15, 1950 - <span class="SpellE">Cachen</span> instituted Civil Case No. 275 of
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Isa­bela</span>, against <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>, to obtain possession of said land, as its alleged
owner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>
traversed this averment and affirmed that the land belongs to him, he having
acquired it from <span class="SpellE">Gaffud</span>; that he (<span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>)
had been in actual, open and uninterrupted possession thereof for over ten (10)
years before June 20, 1950; and that, if <span class="SpellE">Cachen</span> had
any transfer certificate of title in his name, he must have secured it
fraudulently, in bad faith and without any consider­ation.</p>

<p class="BODY">After appropriate proceedings, said court rendered its <span style="">deci</span>sion, on June 24, 1953, holding
that the sale to <span class="SpellE">Cachen</span> was null and void for lack of
consideration, and that, having been first in securing possession of the land,
in good faith, <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> has a better right thereto,
and, accordingly, dismissing <span class="SpellE">Cachen’s</span> complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal taken by <span class="SpellE">Cachen</span>,
this decision was, on <st1:date year="1958" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1958</st1:date>,
affirmed in CA-G.R. No. 13737-R of the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cachen</span> <span style="">sought a review on <i style="">certiorari</i> of the latter's decision in G.R. No. L-13673 of the
Supreme Court, which, on </span><st1:date year="1958" day="14" month="5"><span style="">May 14, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, dismissed the petition for review, upon the
ground that it raised factual issues and lacked merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resolution of the Supreme Court to this
ef­fect<span style="">&nbsp; </span>became final on </span><st1:date year="1958" day="13" month="10"><span style="">October
 13, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1962</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> caused to be annotated on the back of TCT
No. T-1633, a notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span> stating that the land in question is under
litigation in Civil Case No. 275 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, which had been appealed to the Court of Appeals in
CA-G.R. No. 13737-R and later brought to the Supreme Court in G.R. No.
L-13673.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A little over a month later, or
on <st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1962</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Cachen</span> conveyed Lot No. 5463 to herein defendant,
Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon registration of the deed of sale in his favor, on <st1:date year="1962" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1962</st1:date>, TCT No. T-1633, in the
name of <span class="SpellE">Cachen</span>, was cancelled and transfer
certificate of title No. T-16798, in the name of <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>,
was issued, with the anno­tation of the notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span> appearing on TCT No. T-1633.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> sought
to take possession of the land, in 1963, he found that the tenants working
thereon had delivered the owner's share of the harvest to <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>,
who had secured the correspon­ding writ of possession, in said Civil Case No.
275.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>
filed therein a motion to set aside said writ, which was objected to by <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>, likewise, went to the Court of Agrarian Relations,
in CAR Case No. 55, and prayed therein that <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>
and said tenants be required to deliver to him (<span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>)
the landowner's share of the harvest, but the CAR suspended its proceedings
until the final resolution of the case at bar, which had, meanwhile,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
been commenced by <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>, in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, as Civil Case No. II-712
thereof, against <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>, for the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> No. 5463-A and damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his answer, defendant admitted, with some qualifications, most
of the allegations in plaintiff's complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As special de­fenses, defendant contested the venue and alleged lack of
cause of action, as well as pleaded the statute of limitations of actions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He, likewise, set up a counterclaim for
attorney's fees, upon the ground that plaintiff's complaint was malicious.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Plaintiff, in turn, filed
his answer to defendant's counter­claim, denying the allegations thereof, and
then moved for a summary judgment, upon the ground that the defendant has not
raised any genuine issue of fact, since the allegations of fact made in </span>his
answer to the complaint are belied by the decision of the Court<span style=""> of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 13737-R, which is
already final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, and by an attestation of
the Provincial Assessor of <span class="SpellE">Isa­bela</span> and the
corresponding tax declaration, copies of which were attached to the
motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff, likewise, attached
thereto his affidavit of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite
defendant's opposition to said motion, the same, was, after due hearing,
granted by the lower court, which, accordingly, rendered the appealed decision
ordering the defendant to convey the disputed lot to the plaintiff, to transfer
to his name the corresponding tax declaration and to surrender to the Court the
owner's duplicate of TCT No. T-16798, as well as setting for hearing
plaintiff's claim for damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the
recep­tion of evidence thereon, said court, subsequently, rendered a
supplemental decision sentencing the defendant to pay damages, as set forth at
the beginning of this decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
the present ap­peal by writ of error.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The issues calling for
our determination in this appeal are two-fold - one is procedural in nature and
the other concerns the merits of the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first refers to the propriety of the sum­mary judgment appealed
from, which is assailed upon the ground:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) that venue has been improperly laid; and (2) that there are
unsettled questions of fact.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As regards venue, defendant maintains that the land in ques­tion
is now within the jurisdiction of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This pretense is, however, based <u>exclusively</u>
upon <u>his own</u> tax de­claration, stating that said land is in <span class="SpellE">Malasian</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dif­fun</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, it is not disputed that
the property in question is part of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 5463 of the <st1:city><st1:place><u>Santiago</u></st1:place></st1:city>
<span class="SpellE">Cadaster</span>, <span class="SpellE"><u>Isabela</u></span>;
that it was covered by OCT No. I-2174 of the <u>same pro­vince</u>, in the name
of <span class="SpellE">Gaffud</span>; that, upon cancellation thereof, it was
substituted by TCT No. T-1633 of <span class="SpellE"><u>Isabela</u></span>, in
the name of <span class="SpellE">Cachen</span>, or defendant's predecessor in
interest; and that, upon the sale of said lot to defendant, this TCT No. T-1633
<u>of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span></u> was super­seded by TCT No. T-16798 <u>of
<span class="SpellE">Isabela</span></u>, in his (defendant's) name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it is alleged in paragraph 2 of the
complaint herein that said property is "situated in the Barrio of Luna
(formerly <span class="SpellE">Malasian</span>), <u>Municipality of Santiago, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span></u>", and this allegation was <u>impliedly
admitted</u> in paragraph 2 of defendant's answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, this admission and the foregoing facts and circums­tances
far outweigh defendant's self-serving tax declaration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Urmaneta</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Manzano</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"There was really no genuine issue of fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If there is, the same was easily determinable
from the pleadings and documents attached there­to; hence, the trial court
correctly rendered the summary judgment on said pleadings and documents."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Let us now consider defendant's allegation to the effect that
"there are issues of fact which should be threshed out in a trial on the
merits." In this connection, plaintiff alleged in his complaint herein
that, "by virtue of" the "decision of the Court of Appeals in
CA-G.R. No. 13737-R (Civil Case No. 275, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>)
copy of which is hereto attached" and the "resolution of the Supreme
Court in Case No. G.R. No. L-13673, dismissing the pe­tition for review by <i style="">certiorari</i> of said decision," he
had been "declared as owner" of the lot in question; that,
"pending final decision in said case," he had caused the
aforementioned "notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span>" to be "annotated on TCT No.
T-1633 issued in the name of Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Cachen</span>";
that, despite said notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span> and "with full knowledge of the
same," defendant acquired said lot and secured a new TCT thereto, which
"carried" the annotation of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span> appearing on the cancelled TCT No. T-1633;
that, "despite <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>repeated
demands", defendant failed and refused to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span>
said land to the plaintiff; and that, as a consequence, plaintiff had been
constrained to bring this action, thereby incurring in expenses for attorney's
fees and costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Except as regards the last allegation, as to which defendant
claimed to have "no knowledge nor information as to the truth"
thereof, the facts alleged in the complaint were admitted by the defendant,
although he denied that plaintiff herein had been de­<span style="">clared, in </span>the previous case, owner of the lot in dispute, and as­serted
that the only question posed and decided in said case was the right to the
possession of said lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue thus
raised by defendant herein - whether or not the title to said lot had been set­tled
in the previous case - is entirely dependent, for its resolution, upon the
interpretation of the decisions rendered in said case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, said issue, like that of prescription
of action - which is no longer pressed by the defendant - and that of alleged
lack of cause of action in plaintiff's favor, is a question purely of law, not
of fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, "there is no
genuine issue as to any material fact and <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>the
moving party" was "entitled to a judgment as a matter of law,"
so that the lower court did not err in rendering a summary judgment.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Defendant insists that
since the previous litigation was merely an <span class="SpellE"><u>accion</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>publiciana</u></span>, which hinged on the right of possession,
the decision dismissing the complaint therein did not settle the title to the
property in dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both parties, in
that case, however, based their respective right of possession upon their
alleged title as owner of said property, resulting from the two (2) sales made
by <span class="SpellE">Gaffud</span>, the first to plaintiff herein, and the
second, several years later, to herein defen­dant's predecessor in interest,
Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Cachen</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In order to decide the case, the Court was constrained, therefore, to
pass upon the question of ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
doing so, the lower court re­jected the claim of <span class="SpellE">Cachen</span>,
stating that the sale in his favor was "null and void for want of
consideration." Similarly, in its de­cision, the Court of Appeals
explicitly declared:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In view of the mounting evidence on record showing that
Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Cachen</span> has not paid the con­sideration of
the sale; that he (h)as not taken possession of the land; that he has not
declared the property in his name for taxation purposes; that prior to the
execution of the deed of sale in his favor, to wit, on July 7, 1949, Andres
Castillo, a brother in law of <span class="SpellE">Gaffud</span>, told <span class="SpellE">Cachen</span> in the presence of the latter's brother-in-law and <span class="SpellE">Gaffud</span> that the latter could not sell a portion of about 16
hectares of the land, because that much had already been sold by <span class="SpellE">Gaffud</span> to Antonio <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>, the
defendant herein; and that notwithstanding his knowledge of the flaw and defect
of the title of his vendor, he entered into the transaction, <u>it is evident
that <span class="SpellE">Cachen</span> was not an innocent purchaser of title
No. T-1633 in his name</u>, did not give him any right to the proper­ty
superior and paramount to those of defendant who, indisputably, and in all
respects, has acted in good faith and has paid valuable consideration, and has <span style="">been in possession of the land long before
the plain­tiff acquired a claim over the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whatever right the plaintiff may have acquired over the land by virtue
of the deed of sale executed in his favor is subordinated to the rights of the
defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if the plaintiff is
declared to have a right over that portion of about 16 hectares paramount to
the rights of the defendant, the prejudice to the latter is ob­viously
manifest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>In the clash of rights
between an innocent purchaser for value and one whose claim is tainted with bad
faith and with knowledge of the defect of the title of his grantor, the answer
is not difficult to find</u>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"<u>We, </u></span><u>therefore,
declare</u> that Antonio <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> is the <u>absolute
owner</u> of the land described as Lot 5463-A of the subdivision plan Psd-21575
with an area of 15.9987 hectares which is a part of the land described in
transfer certificate of title No. T-1633 of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Isabela</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
and he is entitled to the possession thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The decision of the trial court dismissing the complaint is hereby
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs is taxed against the
plaintiff-appellant."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In other words, the complaint in the previous case was dismissed
upon the ground that, as the first buyer who took possession of the lot in
question, in good faith, plaintiff herein had become the absolute owner of said
lot, and that, as such, he had a better right to its possession than <span class="SpellE">Cachen</span>, who had bought it in bad faith, apart from the fact
that the sale in his (<span class="SpellE">Cachen's</span>) favor is null and
void.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, since defendant herein was, in view of the
notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span>,
aware of the proceedings in the previous case, when he purchased the lot in
question from <span class="SpellE">Cachen</span>, it follows that he (defendant)
cannot invoke the rights of a purchaser in good faith of a registered land and
has acquired no more rights than those of <span class="SpellE">Cachen</span>, who
had none.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b><span style="">,</span>
the decision appealed from should be, as it is hereby affirmed, with costs.</p>
