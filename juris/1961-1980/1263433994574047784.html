				<BR><STRONG>AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a review <u>en</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>consulta</u></span>
of the decision of the Circuit Criminal Court at <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, convicting <span class="SpellE">Laurenzo</span>
(Lorenzo) <span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span> of murder, sentencing him to death
and ordering him to pay the heirs of Fernando Rivas an indemnity of P22,000
(Criminal Case No. 988).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not
appeal from that decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1971" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1971</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span>,
31 or 32, a native of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> and a prisoner in the national
penitentiary at <span class="SpellE">Muntinlupa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
since 1963, inflicted two stab wounds on Rivas, another prisoner, while the
two, together with more than eighty prisoners, were being brought from the
prison kitchen to Building 13.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rivas
died at the prison hospital at four-fifty-five on that same afternoon.</p>

<p class="BODY">He sustained a fatal stab wound eleven centimeters deep in the
iliac region which cut an artery and another stab wound four centimeters deep
in the back below the right shoulder blade or <span class="SpellE">infrascapular</span>
region.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span> testified that he acted in
self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His version was that on
that afternoon, after coming from the prison kitchen, together with around
eighty prisoners and after he had reached his brigade (meaning he was out in
the open) and after the prisoners were counted, Rivas, who was following him,
boxed him on the right temple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That blow
made him dizzy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In retaliation, he boxed
Rivas.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, Rivas drew a bladed weapon which <span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span>
grabbed from Rivas by twisting his right hand.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With that weapon, he stabbed the latter in the abdomen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rivas ran to the "bar stand" or the
office of the officer of the day where he collapsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prison guard, <span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span>
Bautista, hit <span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span> on the left ear with his
club.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He allegedly surrendered to
Bautista.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was brought to the officer
of the day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told the officer of the
day that he stabbed somebody but he did not claim that he acted in self-defense
(20 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> <st1:date year="1972" day="10" month="5">May
 10, 1972</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The stabbing took place not inside the "<span class="SpellE">gola</span>"
but near the gate of the brigade or Dormitory 13-C in the presence of more than
eighty prisoners, <span class="SpellE">Alquizar's</span> "co-kitchen
boys".</p>

<p class="BODY">Rogelio Llamas, a native of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
who was convicted of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> through falsification and
was also a prisoner working in the kitchen, corroborated the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span> that he was boxed by somebody, that <span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span> retaliated by boxing his assailant and that the
latter drew a knife and attacked <span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Antonio Rivera, a native of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
a prisoner convicted of robbery and evasion of service of sentence, the
"assistant mayor" of a brigade and a member of the <span class="SpellE">Oxo</span> gang, also corroborated <span class="SpellE">Alquizar's</span>
testimony that Rivas boxed <span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rivera did not know what <span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span>
did to Rivas after he was boxed by the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">In rebuttal, prison guard Bautista testified that Llamas was not
at the scene of the killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was not
among the more than eighty prisoners who were to be brought to Dormitory 13-C.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prison guard Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Bersabe</span> testified
that Rivera in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1971" day="10" month="4">April
 10, 1971</st1:date> was confined in Dormitory 7-C and that he was not near the
gate of Building 13 where the killing was perpetrated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Certain circumstances militate against <span class="SpellE">Alquizar's</span>
plea of self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He made it appear
that Rivas boxed him without any provocation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He did not state the motive as to why Rivas boxed him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to his version, he did not even
know Rivas by name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not explain
why Rivas would dare to box him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He (<span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span>) had undergone training as a boxer and was a
well-known boxer in prison.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not plausible that Rivas would box <span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span>
near the gate of Building 13 in the presence of more than eighty prisoners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If Rivas had any felonious intent against <span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span> and if, according to his version, Rivas was armed
with an improvised bladed weapon, <span class="GramE">then</span> it is not
probable that Rivas would merely box him initially.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would have stabbed <span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span>
at the outset instead of waiting for <span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span> to
strike him and then drawing his weapon after he was hit by <span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Also incredible is his testimony that he grabbed the blade of the
weapon (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D) <span class="GramE">but</span> his
hands were not injured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He merely
sustained a slight wound in the small finger.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, right after the stabbing, <span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span>
was brought to the officer of the day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He did not apprise that official that he acted in self-defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the prosecution's version was that at about
three-forty in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1971" day="10" month="4">April
 10, 1971</st1:date>, Bautista, the prison guard, was leaning near the window
of the "<span class="SpellE">gola</span>" between "post
towers" Nos. 11 and 13 of the national penitentiary in <span class="SpellE">Muntinlupa</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had
just come out of the prison kitchen and had escorted eighty-five prisoners who
were to be returned to their dormitory in Building 13.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The kitchen was about one hundred fifty yards
away from the dormitory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bautista was
waiting for the keeper of the dormitory.</p>

<p class="BODY">He heard a shout or exclamation of pain, "<span class="SpellE">Inang</span> <span class="SpellE">ko</span> <span class="SpellE">po</span>",
emanating from the direction behind his back.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He turned and saw <span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span> stabbing
Rivas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He approached them and hit <span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span> on the head with his club to prevent him from
killing Rivas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span>
held the clothes of Rivas and stabbed him for the second time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rivas ran towards the office of the officer
of the day pursued by <span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bautista and <span class="SpellE">Eulalio</span>
G. <span class="SpellE">Solmayor</span>, the keeper of Buildings 11 and 13,
blocked the path of <span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was apprehended by the two prison
employees.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the prosecution's version to be credible and a sufficient
proof that <span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span> did not act in self-defense.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span> impugned the <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> of his confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
contends that no probative value should be given to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He repeatedly testified that he signed it
because he was maltreated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
confession was taken about four days after the stabbing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why it took the investigator more than
seventy-two hours to take <span class="SpellE">Alquizar's</span> statement was
not explained.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The confession was signed
in the presence of two witnesses and it was sworn to before an administrative
officer of the Bureau of Prisons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
witnesses and the swearing officer did not testify at the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no showing that the swearing officer
read to <span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span> that confession.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is in the <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span> dialect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not contain any notice to the accused
that he had the right to remain silent and that any statement made by him might
be used against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that statement,
it appears that when he was asked whether he knows <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>,
his answer was:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Maka</span> <span class="SpellE">intindi</span>, sir, <span class="SpellE">pero</span> <span class="SpellE">hindi</span> <span class="SpellE">masiyadong</span>
<span class="SpellE">makasalita</span>" ("I understand it, sir, but I
do not speak it well.").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
an examination of <span class="SpellE">Alquizar's</span> answers in his
confession shows that he speaks <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span> well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This may indicate that the answers therein
were not in <span class="GramE">his own</span> words.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cebuano</span> is his
native dialect.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the confession cannot be admitted as evidence
against <span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is doubt as to whether it was freely and voluntarily made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The investigator did not testify as to how he
took the confession of <span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, there is a discrepancy between the confession and the
investigator's report which was made ten days after the stabbing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">According to the confession
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> B), <span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span>
allegedly told the investigator, Buenaventura de la <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span>,
that he stabbed Rivas because he thought that Rivas was a mem­ber of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Sigue-Sigue</u></span> gang that was responsible for the
killing of <span class="SpellE">Alquizar's</span> alleged cousin, Salvador <span class="SpellE">Alcontin</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span> denied that <span class="SpellE">Alcontin</span> was
his cousin.) However, De la <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span> in his report
stated that both <span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span> and Rivas were members of
the <u>Sputnik</u> gang.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, De la <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span> said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Napagalaman</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">tagapagsiyasat</span> <span class="SpellE">matapos</span> <span class="SpellE">mapagaralan</span> <span class="SpellE">ang</span> <span class="SpellE">mga</span> <span class="SpellE">natipong</span>

p. 17, Record).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The investigator
was confused in assuming that Rivas and <span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span>
belonged to allied prison gangs.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was alleged in the information that the killing was qualified
by treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No other qualifying
circumstance was alleged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Treachery was
not proven by means of the testimony of Bautista, the only prosecution witness
who saw the stabbing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not witness
the inception of the stabbing.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first thing that he witnessed was that <span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span>
had already inflicted the first stab wound on Rivas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He saw them because Rivas gave a cry of
pain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bautista's back was turned when <span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span> initially assaulted Rivas.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the confession that may prove that the assault was
treacherous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But since, as already
stated, no credence can be accorded to the confession, only Bautista's
testimony should be taken into account as to the manner of the attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His testimony is deficient on that
point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be noted that since the
first wound was inflicted in the abdomen, the logical conclusion would be that
Rivas and <span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span> were face to face when the initial
assault was made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That circumstance may
negative the existence of treachery.</p>

<p class="BODY">Therefore, there is no justification for holding that the
stabbing was treacherous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
prosecution's evidence on that point is not conclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
is correct in contending, alternatively, that the killing should be charac­terized
as homicide.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span> was a quasi-recidivist because
at the time he stabbed Rivas he (<span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span>) was
confined in the national penitentiary, serving sentences for (1) robbery with
slight physical injuries, (2) theft and (3) evasion of service of sentence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The penalty for homicide should be imposed in
its maximum period pursuant to article 160 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span> is not entitled to an
indeterminate sentence because he escaped from confinement and evaded the
service of his sentences for robbery and theft (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
F)<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The</span>
mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender to the authorities cannot be
appreciated in his favor because, when he supposedly surrendered, he was still
pursuing the victim after inflicting the stab wounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span> could have
surrendered after Bautista had struck him with a club.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of doing so, he inflicted a second
stab wound and pursued the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span> was really apprehended or arrested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not surrender voluntarily.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the trial court's death sentence is set
aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alquizar</span>
is convicted of homicide and sentenced to twenty (20) years of <u>reclusion</u>
<u>temporal</u> maximum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The indemnity
imposed by the trial court is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.</span><u><o:p></o:p></u></p>
