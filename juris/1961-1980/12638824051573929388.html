				<h4>
				G.R. No. L-45995, August 31, 1977</h4>
				<H3>SEGUNDO LAZARTE, PETITIONER, VS. THE HON.
COURT OF APPEALS* AND DAVID GRIEGO, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>TEEHANKEE, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Court sets aside respondent appellate court's peremptory dismissal
of petitioner's appeal for failure to file mimeographed/ typewritten copies of
the record on appeal within the sixty-day <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period notwithstanding that such failure had been for justly excusable reasons
and petitioner had thereafter promptly submitted such record on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent appellate court in its Resolution of January 28, 1977 <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span>
dismissed herein petitioner's pending appeal before it as defendant-appellant<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
<u>in forma <span class="SpellE">pauperis</span></u> for failure of his counsel,
Citizens Legal Assistance Office (CLAO), to file the mimeographed/typewritten
record on appeal within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period as
per "docket report dated January 27, 1977."</p>

<p class="BODY">The dismissal resolution was received on <st1:date year="1977" day="7" month="2">February 7, 1977</st1:date> by the CLAO branch office in <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span> and was
forwarded to and received at its Special and Appealed Cases Division in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
on <st1:date year="1977" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It turned out that due to the <span class="SpellE">CLAO's</span> "great influx of cases coming from all over the
country" its records of the case had been "inadvertently misplaced
and (could) no longer be located" but borrowing respondent court's own
records, the CLAO reproduced the necessary mimeographed copies of the record on
appeal and on February 22, 1977 promptly filed its motion for reconsideration
and to admit the copies of the record on appeal submitted by it therewith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent court denied reconsideration and
reinstatement of the appeal per its resolutions of <st1:date year="1977" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1977</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1977</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the petition at bar which the Court finds to be meritorious
and therefore grants on the strength of controlling jurisprudence that such
failure to timely file the printed/mimeographed copies of the record on appeal
for the convenience of the members of the appellate courts (as the original
record on appeal as filed with and approved by the trial court is duly attached
to the original record of the case) may be excused for justifiable reasons
since the appellate court has the <u>discretion</u> to dismiss or <u>not</u> to
dismiss the appeal but "said discretion must be a sound one, to be
exercised in accordance with the tenets of justice and fair play, having in
mind the circumstances obtaining in each case."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Here, the <span class="SpellE">CLAO's</span> failure to submit
within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period the mimeographed
copies of the record on appeal due to its having lost the records of the case
does not appear to be inexcusable, although it is hereby admonished that it
should certainly adopt greater safeguards and measures to insure the integrity
of its records and the due fulfillment of its tasks in rendering legal
assistance to indigent litigants.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, it would greater serve the ends of justice that the <span class="SpellE">CLAO's</span> fault in this regard be not used to inflict great
injury on petitioner by imposing the capital penalty of dismissal of his
appeal. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>As aptly submitted by the CLAO
on his behalf:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"(T)he issues raised
for resolution in the appeal are important and vital to the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This involves a parcel of residential land
containing a total area of 600 sq. m. more or less which has been occupied by
petitioner for the past 12 years in the concept of a sole and absolute owner
and actual possessor and on which he constructed his residential house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This lot is also being claimed by
(respondent) David <span class="SpellE">Griego</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be grave injustice to petitioner if
he would lose his property without the benefit of a hearing on appeal."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Maqui</u></span><u> vs. Court
of Appeals</u><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></u></span></a>
is fully applicable to the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As the Court held therein in ruling that the slight delay in the
submittal of respondent court's copies of the record on appeal could not
possibly prejudice any substantial rights, ''(A) rigid adherence to the
technical rules of procedure disregards the fundamental aim of procedure to
serve as an aid to justice, not as a means for its frustration, and the
objective of the Rules of Court to afford litigants just, speedy and
inexpensive determination of their controversy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, excusable imperfections of form and technicalities of procedure or
lapses in the literal or rigid observance of a procedural rule or
non-jurisdictional deadline provided therein should be overlooked and brushed
aside as trivial and indecisive in the interest of fair play and justice when
public policy is not involved, no prejudice has been caused the adverse party
and the court has not been deprived of its authority or jurisdiction."</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, respondent appellate court's resolutions
dismissing petitioner's appeal are set aside and the case is remanded to it for
further proceedings and disposition of the appeal on its merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without costs.</p>
