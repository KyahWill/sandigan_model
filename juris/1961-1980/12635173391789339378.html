				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from an order of dismissal of a petition for annulment of
a judgment and/or review of a decree of registration of two cadastral lots
alleged­ly procured through fraud.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 13 July 1957, the herein respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> <span class="SpellE">Orellana</span>, filed his
answer in Cadastral Case No. <span class="GramE">IL-N-2, L. R. C. Record No.</span>
N-211 for Lots Nos. 1664 and 1665, with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span>, claiming ownership thereof and praying that the said
lots be adjudged and decreed in his favor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The herein petitioners-appellants, <span class="SpellE">Timoteo</span> <span class="SpellE">Rublico</span> and Juliana <span class="SpellE">Madrazo</span>, did
not file any answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After an order of
general default was entered, the court commissioned its clerk of court to
receive the evidence of claimants for non-contested lots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lots 1664 and 1665 were non-contested
(Exhibits "G"), so the clerk of court received the evidence for the
sole claimant, herein respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> <span class="SpellE">Orellana</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 20 November 1964, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> approved the
report and recommendation of the clerk of court and rendered judgment
adjudicating Lots 1664 and 1665 in favor of respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
<span class="SpellE">Orellana</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 19 July 1965, petitioners-appellants filed with the said
cadastral court a petition to annul the judgment and/or review the decree of
registration, alleging ownership of the lots adjudicated to the respondent;
that respondent, "by means of fraud, made the court to believe that he is
the owner" and that said judgment "was secured . . . . . . . . <span class="GramE">by</span> means of fraud" (Record on Appeal, pages 3-4).</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Orellana</span> filed a motion to
dismiss the petition and the court, on 23 September 1965, sustained the motion,
holding that petitioners-appellants had no personality to file their petition
because they did not file an answer and were declared in default and that they
should have first secured the lifting of the order of general default, with
respect to themselves, before they filed their petition for review.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners-appellants interposed the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent portion of Section 38 provides, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>". . . . . . . . Such decree shall not be opened by reason of
the absence, infancy, or other disability of any person affected thereby, nor
by any proceeding in any court for reversing judgments or decrees:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>subject, however, to the right of any person
deprived of land or of any estate or interest therein by decree of registra­tion
obtained by fraud to file in the competent Court of First Instance a petition
for review with­in one year after entry of the decree provided no innocent
purchaser for value has acquired an interest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>. . . . . . . .”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It will be noted that the essential requisites or elements for
the allowance of the reopening or review of a decree are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) that the peti­tioner has a real or
dominical right; (b) that he has been deprived thereof; (c) through fraud; (d)
that the petition is filed within one year from the issuance of the decree; and
(e) that the property has not as yet been transferred to an innocent purchaser
(Ponce, The <span class="SpellE">Phils</span>. Torrens System, page 208).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will also be noted from the provision that
"any person" may file the petition, provided the other requisites are
present; and that the provision does not require that the petitioner be an
original claimant who had filed an answer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">And reasonably so, because fraud might inter­vene
precisely to prevent a person from filing an answer.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, a party deprived of an estate in land
was accorded relief where the fraud con­sisted in deliberate failure to notify
the party entitled to notice (<span class="SpellE">Salva</span> vs. Salvador, 18
Phil. 193), or in inducing him not to oppose an application (Reyes vs. City of
Manila, 38 Phil. 350), or in misrepresentation to the true owner by an
applicant of the identity of the lot, causing the true owner to withdraw his
opposition (<span class="SpellE">Marquiala</span>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Ybañez</span>,
et al., 92 Phil. 911).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these
rulings, it follows that a petitioner for review under Section 38 of Act 496,
as amended, need not be an original claimant in a cadastral proceeding and need
not secure the lifting of the order of general default with respect to <span class="GramE">himself</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The aim of
the law in giving aggrieved parties, victimized by registration pro­ceedings of
their estate in land by means of fraud, the opportunity to review the decree
would be defeated if such parties would be limited to those who had filed their
opposition to the petition for registration or to first require them to procure
the lifting of the order of general default before they could file a petition
for review.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing considerations notwithstanding, <span class="GramE">We</span>
are of the opinion that the order of dismissal is substantially correct, for
the reason that the petition for review failed to state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action, as also contended by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
in their motion to dismiss in the court below (Record on Appeal, pages 8 -
9).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition for review merely
alleges that respondent "by means of fraud made this Honorable Court
believe that he is the owner of said lots".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not a sufficient allegation, for it
is a mere conclusion of law, and does not aver <u>facts</u> showing in what
acts the alleged fraud consisted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Certainly, to make the court believe that the respondent (claimant in
the cadastral case) was the owner of the lot concerned is not fraud; at the
most, the court might have committed an error in believing the claimant to be
the owner, but that would not justify a review of the decree of adjudication
and registration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Review of the decree
demands a showing of <u>actual</u> (not constructive) fraud (Government vs. <span class="SpellE">Tombis</span> <span class="SpellE">Triño</span>, 50 Phil. 717),
i.e., actual malice, and there is nothing in the petition to show it.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of dismissal appealed from is
affirmed, without prejudice to the subsequent amendment of the petition
according to Rule 16, section 3, within 15 days from finality of this
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs
against the appellants.</span></p>
