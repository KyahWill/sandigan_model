				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF WANG I FU TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. WANG I FU, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR AND APPELLEE.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>REGALA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal taken by a Chinese named Wang I Fu, from the decision of 
the Court of First Instance of Manila, in Civil Case No. 32003, denying his 
petition for naturalization.&nbsp;
<p>It appears that petitioner was born on February 15, 1918 in Chingkang, China. 
On May 14, 1934, he came to the Philippines where he has continuously resided 
since then. He is married to Maria Sun, also a Chinese, and out of said marriage 
were born five children, namely: Maria Teresita, George, Eduardo, Gladys and 
Maria Nancy. Petitioner is engaged in the glassware business from which he 
derives an average annual income of P8,000.00. He speaks and writes English and 
Tagalog. He has enrolled his minor children of school age in private schools in 
Manila—his two sons at the Huang Chi School and his three daughters at the 
Immaculate Conception Anglo-Chinese Academy.</p>
<p>The lower court has found that petitioner is not opposed to organized 
government and that there is no evidence that he is associated with any group of 
persons who uphold the doctrines opposed to organized government; neither is he 
in favor of using violence for the success of one's ideals; he is not a 
polygamist nor a believer in the practice thereof; he has not been convicted of 
any crime involving moral turpitude; neither is he suffering from any mental 
alienation or incurable contagious disease. </p>
<p>Despite petitioner's possession of the above qualifications, the court, 
however, denied his petition on the following grounds: (1) Petitioner has been 
using <i>aliases</i> and two of his children have different surnames from those 
of the other three; (2) he was educated in the Anglo-Chinese School where he had 
no Filipino classmates and he has always been residing in neighborhoods 
inhabited by Chinese; (3) He has no love for his mother in China as shown by the 
fact that he never sent her money and that he did not know whether or not she is 
still alive; (4) He is a member of the Philippine-Chinese Glassware Merchants 
Association which is composed entirely of Chinese. Said association has passed a 
resolution against the Filipino First Policy, to which resolution he did not 
object; (5) Among the seven employees of petitioner only two are Filipinos; and 
(6) It has not been sufficiently shown that his witnesses have such a close 
contact with petitioner as to be able to testify to become a citizen.</p>
<p>The petitioner has appealed.</p>
<p>A review of the Record convinces Us that petitioner does not deserve to be 
admitted to Philippine citizenship. </p>
<p>The evidence really, shows that petitioner has been using some 
<i>aliases</i>. In his landing certificate, immigrant certificate of residence 
and alien certificate of registration, petitioner's name appear as Wang I Fu. 
However, in his marriage contract, he gave his name as George Wang I Fu, while 
in the birth certificates of his children he used the <i>alias</i> George Ong. 
Aside from George Wang and George Ong, petitioner also uses the <i>alias</i> Ong 
Hay Kuan. The use of said <i>aliases</i> is not explained and there is no 
showing that it has been authorized as required by the Alias Law (Commonwealth 
Act No. 142). Being violative of the law, we think this act of petitioner is not 
beyond reproach and is, therefore, a ground for denying his application for 
naturalization. (See Koa Gui vs. Republic, G. R. No. L-17317, July 31, 1962; Lim 
Bun vs. Republic 111 Phil., 677; and Ng Liam Keng vs. Republic, 111 Phil., 
854.)</p>
<p>It also appears from petitioner's evidence that in the birth certificates and 
certificates of registration of his daughters Maria Teresita and Maria Nancy, 
their surname is Ong, but in petitioner's testimony he mentions Wang as the 
surname of these two children. As correctly observed by the trial court, this 
using of different names is not in accordance with customs and traditions of the 
Filipino people.</p>
<p>As to petitioner's not having serious concern over his mother's whereabouts 
or existence, the lower court made the following observation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Petitioner also testified that he went to Hongkong in 1954, but he did not 
see his mother because she was residing in Chingkang, China, which was under the 
communist regime then and up to the present; but admitted that there was a 
regular postal system between the Philippines and Red China and he was writing 
to his mother since 1947 and 1948. He further claimed that although he went to 
Hongkong in 1954 he did not send his mother any money in spite of his claim that 
he owns a business in the Philippines worth P150,000.00. When pressed for an 
explanation for his seemingly strange attitude toward his mother, petitioner 
explained that he did not send money to his mother because he believes that his 
brother will take care of his mother.</p>
<p>"During the latter part of his testimony, petitioner sought to give an 
additional explanation for his failure to send money to his mother by stating 
that he did not know whether she is still alive or not. This statement was 
contradicted by his earlier testimony when he testified that one week before he 
went to Hongkong he wrote a letter to his mother notifying her that he was going 
to Hongkong. The foregoing, in the mind of the Court, shows that petitioner has 
no love for his mother."</p></blockquote>
<p>Apparently, petitioner had not seen his mother since 1934 when he came to 
live in this country, yet he made no efforts to inquire about her. If he should 
have the concern that a Filipino has for his mother, he should have, at least, 
corresponded with his brothers in China about their mother's well-being. Again, 
petitioner's attitude in this regard does not speak well of his claim to have 
embraced the customs, traditions, and ideals of the Filipino people.</p>
<p>Petitioner's membership in the Philippine Chinese Glassware Merchants 
Association, and his acquiescence to the resolution against the Filipino First 
Policy, indicate that he prefers to associate with his co-Chinese and his 
sympathy is with them and not with the Filipinos.</p>
<p>Even in the selection of his employees, petitioner has shown himself to be 
partial in favor of Chinese citizens, because, as pointed out above, one of the 
seven employees in his business, only the driver and cargador are Filipinos, and 
the responsible positions are held by Chinese.</p>
<p>Another observation that bespeaks of petitioner's indifference to the 
Filipinos is that all of his children are studying in Chinese schools, namely, 
the Immaculate Conception Anglo-Chinese Academy and the Huang Chi School. The 
names of these schools convey the impression that they are not for Filipinos and 
where there is no mingling among Chinese with Filipino children. We have already 
observed in previous cases (Garchitorena vs. Republic, 111 Phil., 607; Hao Su 
Siong <em>alias</em> Ramon Cuenco vs. Republic, G. R. No. L-13045, July 30, 
1962) that this circumstance affects the sincerity of petitioner's intention to 
become a Filipino citizen. As properly stated in a previous case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * *. One of the essential requisites for naturalization is the actual 
desire and overt acts on the part of the applicant for naturalization to mingle 
and associate with Filipinos. The purpose of this policy is to permit gradual 
assimilation of naturalized citizens. It would be violative of this policy to 
admit aliens who evince a desire to preserve their identity as aliens. (Ong 
Ching Guan vs. Republic 111 Phil., 433.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Lastly, We feel that the evidence adduced is not sufficient to show that 
petitioner is morally irreproachable. The law requires proper and irreproachable 
conduct during the applicant's <em>entire period</em> of residence in the 
Philippines. Since the only witnesses presented by petitioner—Alfredo Peñalosa 
and Jose Bernabe—came to know the petitioner only in 1943 and 1945, 
respectively, they are not in a position to testify as to applicant's conduct 
from the time he arrived in the Philippines in May 1934. It should take more 
than uncorroborated assertions of petitioner himself to establish this vital 
fact. (Chua Pun vs. Republic, 113 Phil., 628.)</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the decision dismissing Wang I Fu's petition for 
naturalization is hereby affirmed. Costs against the petitioner-appellant.</p> <em>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L., 
Paredes, Dizon, </em>and <em>Makalintal, JJ.,</em> concur.</div>
