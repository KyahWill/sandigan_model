				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from the order of the Court of First Instance of Manila
dismissing its Civil Case No. 47567, referred to this Court by the Court of
Appeals for the reason that only questions of law are invoked.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case commenced with the filing by <span class="SpellE">Anatolio</span>
Valencia in the Manila Municipal Court of a claim against the Manila Yacht Club
for compensation and medical expenses, under Article 1711 of the Civil Code, on
the allegation that the plaintiff had been in the employ of defendant as a
laborer for 11 years, receiving an average earning of P220.00 a month; that as
such laborer he worked from 4 o'clock in the afternoon to 12 o'clock midnight,
getting wet by sea spray or rain even when tired or perspiring; that prior to 7
April 1960 he sustained an injury while in the performance of his occupation;<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
that thereafter, he spat blood, his constitution and resistance were weakened,
and on 7 April 1960 he was found suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1960" day="12" month="4">12
 April 1960</st1:date>, he was disabled to go to work, and the claim for
disability compensation was filed on <st1:date year="1961" day="25" month="1">25
 January 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Claimant's
prayer against the Club<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
was for disability com­pensation amounting to P1,760.00 as of 12 December 1960
and there­after in the sum of P220.00 a month, until he is pronounced
physically fit to return to his usual work, and for payment of his doctor and
medical expenses, costs of litigation, and attorney’s fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Instead of filing an answer, respondent Manila Yacht Club moved
to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction and cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was contended that, as both claimant and
respondent were members of the Social Security System, the demand for
compensation properly should be brought before the latter, as in fact claimant
had already done so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finding that
claimant indeed had filed a claim with the Social Security System and had
received benefits <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, the Municipal Court
granted respondent's motion and ordered the dismissal of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appealed to the Court of First Instance of
Manila (Civil Case No. 47567), the decision of the Muni­cipal Court was
affirmed on the same ground; hence, claimant interposed the present proceeding.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the facts of the relationship between the parties, the
nature of claimant's work, and the compensability of his illness either
admitted or assumed, the controversy left to be determined in this case is the
effect of claimant's receipt of benefits from the Social Security System<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
for the illness which was likewise the basis of his demand for compensation
from the employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the
issue here is whether claimant's acceptance from the Social Security System of
sickness and disability benefits, which are available to him as a member of the
System, precludes further collection from the employer of compensation allowed
under the law for the same sickness or injury.</p>

<p class="BODY">We rule for the claimant employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In several cases decided by this Court, the
employee's right to demand compensation from the employer, notwithstanding
previous receipt of benefits under the Social Security law, was already upheld.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
For by their nature and purpose, the sickness or disability benefits to which a
member of the System may be entitled under the Social Security law<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
are not the same as the compensation that may be claimed against the employer
under the Workmen's Compensation Act or the Civil Code, so that payment to the
member employee of social security benefits would not wipe out or extinguish
the employer's liability for the injury or illness contracted by his employee
in the course of or during the employment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It must be realized that, under the Workmen's Compensation Act (or the
Civil Code, in a proper case), the employer is required to compensate the
employee for the sickness or injury arising in the course of the employment
because the industry is supposed to be responsible <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>;
whereas, under the Social Security Act, payment is being made because the
hazard specifically covered by the membership, and for which the employee had
put up his own money, had taken place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As this Court had said:</p>

<blockquote>“- - - - - To deny payment of social security benefits because the
death or injury or confinement is compensable under the Workmen's Compensation
Act would be to deprive the employees members of the System of the statutory
benefits bought and paid for by them, since they contribute their money to the
general common fund out of which benefits are paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the benefits provided for in
the Workmen's Compensation Act accrues to the employees concerned due to the
hazards involved in their employment and is made a burden on the employment
itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, social security
benefits are paid to the System's members, by reason of their membership
therein for which they contribute their money to a general common fund.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- - - - -.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It may be added that whereas social security bene­fits are
intended to provide insurance or protection against the hazards or risks for
which they are established, e.g., disability, sickness, old age or death,
irrespective of whether they arose from or in the course of the employment or
not, the compensation receivable under the Workmen's Compensation law is in the
nature of indemnity for the injury or damage suffered by the employee or his
dependents on account of the employment."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appealed order of the lower court being contrary to the cited
rulings of this Court, the present case ordinarily should be remanded to the
court of origin for further proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's demand for compensation is predicated on the
employer's liability for the sickness of, or injury to, his employee imposed by
Article 1711 of the Civil Code, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 1711.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Owners of
enterprises and other employers are obliged to pay compensation for the death
of or injuries to their laborers, workmen, me­chanics or other employees, even
though the event may have been purely accidental or entirely due to a
fortuitous cause, if the death or personal injury arose out of and in the
course of the employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The em­ployer
is also liable for compensation if the em­ployee contracts any illness or
disease caused by such employment or as the result of the nature of the
employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the mishap was due to the
employee's own notorious negligence, or volun­tary act, or drunkenness, the
employer shall not be liable for compensation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the employee's lack of due care contributed to his death or in­jury,
the compensation shall be equitably reduced."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find the <span class="SpellE">abovequoted</span> provision to be
applicable and controlling in this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The matter of the amount of compensation and allowable medical expenses
should be properly determined by the Municipal Court after the parties are
heard accordingly.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of dismissal appealed from is hereby
set aside, and claimant-appellant is declared entitled to compensation for his
sickness acquired during and/or in the course of his employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case is remanded to the court of origin
for determina­tion, after due hearing, of the amount of compensation and
allowable medical expenses payable by the respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
to claimant-appellant, and, upon adequate basis being shown, the claims for
other expenses and attorneys' fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the time elapsed, and the consequent hardships upon
the employee, the court of origin is instructed to give preference to this
case, and to hear and determine the laborer's claims with maximum promptness
and dispatch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against respondent
Manila Yacht Club.</p>
