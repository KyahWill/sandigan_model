				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Court of First Instance of Bukidnon in its decision of August
22, 1969 convicted Ernesto Sarip and Manuel Raop (Raup) of robbery with triple
homicide and sentenced each of them to death and to indemnify the heirs of the
deceased Ciriaco Mision, Pamposa Mision and Amparo Mision in the sum of P30,000
(Criminal Case No. 1591).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They did not
appeal from that decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their death
sentences are now under man­datory review (Sec. 9, Rule 122, <span class="GramE">Rules</span>
of Court).</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court also convicted Raop of robbery in band and
illegal possession of firearms in Criminal Cases Nos. 1609 and 1611,
respectively, and sentenced him to imprisonment penalties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Raop did not appeal from the two sentences. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Hence, the records of Criminal Cases Nos. 1609
and 1611 were impro­perly elevated to this Court <span class="GramE">which</span>
has not acquired any appellate jurisdiction over the two cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The offenses charged in the two cases did not
arise out of the same occurrence, and were not committed on the same occasion,
as the robbery with triple homicide.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ernesto Sarip pleaded guilty to the charge of robbery in band in <u>Criminal
Case No. 1609</u> (wherein Raop was his co-accused).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That offense was committed on <st1:date year="1966" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the lower court's partial decision of <st1:date year="1968" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1968</st1:date>, Ernesto was
sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of two years, four months and one day of <u>prision
correccional</u> to eight years and one day of <u>prision mayor</u> and to
indemnify Alfredo Mataya in the sum of P180.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He did not appeal from that decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Criminal Case No. 1591</u>, the case now under review, five
persons were involved, namely, Raop, Ernesto Sarip, Condalla Sarip, Dumato
Mabpan (Madpan) and Macadatar Tayao Mabpan.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Macadatar was not arrested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
four were tried and after trial, Condalla Sarip and Dumato Mabpan were
acquitted in the lower court's order of <st1:date year="1969" day="15" month="7">July
 15, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The acquittal was
based in part on the affidavit of Ernesto Sarip, dated August 10, 1967, wherein
he swore that Dumato had no participation in the robbery and that he (Ernesto)
and Raop forced Condalla "at the point of a gun" to take part in the
robbery (Exh. 5).</p>

<p class="BODY">In said <u>Criminal Case No. 1591</u>, Ernesto Sarip was
arraigned on <st1:date year="1968" day="29" month="3">March 29, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was assisted by his counsel, Manuel Valdez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first, he pleaded not guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few minutes later, Ernesto told his lawyer
that he wanted to plead guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
lawyer manifested to the court that Ernesto wanted to change his plea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial judge, addressing Ernesto, asked
him whether it was true that he wanted to plead guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He replied in the affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, it was made of record that he had pleaded
guilty with the assistance of his lawyer.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court did not then and there pronounce the judgment of
conviction on Ernesto Sarip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It heard
the evidence of the prosecution and the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ernesto was present through­out the trial and
was identified by the prosecution witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was represented by a counsel <u>de</u> <u>oficio</u> who
cross-examined the prosecution witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He did not present any evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Maybe, he realized the futility of presenting any defense because
the prosecution offered in evidence his confession (Exh. J) <span class="GramE">dated</span>
<st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="8">August 1, 1966</st1:date> which was
taken down by a Constabulary sergeant and was sworn to before a special deputy
clerk of court who, like the sergeant, was cross-examined by Ernesto's counsel
when he testified on the circumstances under which the oath was administered to
Ernesto.</p>

<p class="BODY">In that confession, Ernesto stated that Datu Damiano Madpan, the
barrio captain of Malipayon (brother of Dumato Madpan), convinced him and Raop
to rob and liquidate a certain family in Malipayon (referring to, but not
naming, the Mision family) and that Damiano gave him two American rifles and a <u>paltik</u>
to accomplish that diabolical mission.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ernesto revealed in his confession that upon arriving at the
place to be robbed, Makadatar Madpan and Dumato Madpan took the chickens and
carabao under the house while he and Raop stood guard at the stairs and that
Makadatar and Dumato assaulted the occupants of the house and Dumato took their
personal be­longings and the sewing machine.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That version does not dovetail in all details with the story told by the
prosecution witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the decisive
fact is that Ernesto in his confession admitted that he participated in the
robbery and that he was a co-conspirator of Raop and Makadatar.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is now feebly contended by Ernesto's counsel <u>de</u> <u>oficio</u>
that Ernesto did not understand the full implication and import of his plea of
guilty because his counsel and the trial court did not explain to him the
consequences of his plea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No serious
consideration can be accorded to that contention because Ernesto Sarip in
pleading guilty simply ratified his extrajudicial confes­sion which was
corroborated by indubitable evidence of the <u>corpus</u> <u>delicti</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The due execution and voluntariness of that
confession have not been assailed.</p>

<p class="BODY">As already stated, the death sentence was imposed on Ernesto
Sarip in the lower court's decision of <st1:date year="1969" day="22" month="8">August
 22, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment of
conviction was based on the testimonies of two eyewitnesses, Ernesto's
confession and plea of guilty, the con­fession of Condalla Sarip and Raop's
statement (Exh. G).</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution's evidence shows that at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">eleven o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="4">Saturday, April 30, 1966</st1:date>, Ernesto Sarip,
Manuel Raop, Condalla Sarip (Ernesto's first cousin) and Makadatar Tayao Mabpan
(Madpan) were in the vicinity of the house of the spouses Ciriaco Mision and
Pamposa Mision located at Barrio Malipayon, Pangantucan, <span class="GramE">Bukidnon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ernesto Sarip, Makadatar and Raop had
firearms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They made known their presence
by means of gunshots.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ernesto Sarip and Makadatar, who was wearing a turban, went under
the house and took the chickens which they gave to Raop and Condalla
Sarip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cackling of the chickens
awakened Diosdado Mision, 12, son of Ciriaco, and Loreto Palanog, 26, a farm
helper, who were upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Through the
bamboo slats of the floor, they peeped and saw what the intruders were doing
under the house.</p>

<p class="BODY">The intruders wanted to get also the carabao which was inside the
corral under the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Makadatar asked
Ciriaco in a loud voice to open the corral but the latter kept silent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Makadatar, who was armed with a gun and a
bolo, and Ernesto Sarip destroyed the corral, took the carabao and gave it to
Raop and Condalla who brought it to the plowed field nearby.</p>

<p class="BODY">Makadatar and Ernesto Sarip (tall and short, respectively)
returned to the house and asked Ciriaco to give them rice and money but the
latter replied that he did not have any.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Angered by Ciriaco's refusal to comply with their demand, Makadatar and
Ernesto fired several shots directed at the inmates of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ciriaco, who was lying on the floor, was not
hit but his wife, Pamposa, and daughter, Amparo, were wounded.</p>

<p class="BODY">Makadatar went up the stairs, cut the string which tied the door,
pushed the shutter, and, on seeing Ciriaco lying on the floor face down, hacked
him to death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ernesto Sarip, armed with
a rifle, followed Makadatar and went up the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Makadatar and Ernesto Sarip took clothes and
a sewing machine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The carabao was later
released by the robbers.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the intruders had left, two inmates of the house were found
dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ciriaco, 37, suffered an incised
wound, eleven by three inches, across his back, two stab wounds also in the
back and a lacerated wound on the chin.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His wife, Pamsosa, 35, sustained an entrance gunshot wound in the right
infra-clavicular region.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bullet
penetrated her right lung and exited on her back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Amparo Mision, a daughter of the said spouses
(who was older than Diosdado), sustained a mortal wound in the back and died in
the hospital.</p>

<p class="BODY">The participation of Ernesto Sarip and Raop in the robbery was
confirmed by Condalla Sarip, a 22-year old farmer, who also made a confession,
with exculpatory allegations, which was sworn to before the municipal judge on <st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="8">August 1, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Condalla declared that in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1966</st1:date> he encountered Ernesto Sarip, Raop
and Makadatar in Barrio Macatol.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
were armed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They forced him to join them
in robbing Mision's house in Barrio Malipayon several kilometers away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Condalla was <span class="GramE">Ernesto' s</span>
friend.</p>

<p class="BODY">The group drank the liquor called "Kulafu" before pro­ceeding
via a trail to Mision's house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Condalla
said that on arriving near Mision's house, he was stationed by Ernesto Sarip
near the banana, plants where he (Condalla) received the chickens and carabao
taken by Ernesto, Raop and Makadatar.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While Raop guarded Condalla, Ernesto and Makadatar took clothes and the
sewing machine from the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later,
they released the carabao because it impeded their flight from the scene of the
crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">Diosdado Mision testified that before <st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1966</st1:date>, he saw Ernesto Sarip at Barrio
Malipayon with Muslim com­panions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Loreto Palanog had also seen Sarip in the cockpit prior to the
incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Diosdado and Loreto knew
Ernesto before the robbery was committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, defendant Raop, 25, in his sworn statement
taken on <st1:date year="1966" day="6" month="6">June 6, 1966</st1:date> by a
Constabulary corporal and in his testimony, admitted his participation in the
robbery but he averred that he acted under duress exercised by his friend,
Ernesto Sarip.</p>

<p class="BODY">Raop testified that at six o'clock in the morning of April 30,
1966, his friend, Ernesto Sarip, went to his house at Barrio Kalilangan and
requested him to accompany Ernesto to the house of the latter's aunt located at
Barrio Lampanosan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first Raop refused
but when Sarip allegedly threatened him by pointing his rifle at Raop, Raop
consented to go with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ernesto gave
him a homemade gun called "paliuntod".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They arrived at Lampanosan at <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">four o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ernesto then told him that they were going to
Barrio Malipayon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the way, they met
Condalla Sarip.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ernesto asked Condalla to accompany them to Barrio
Malipayon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Condalla refused but Ernesto
poked his gun at him and he agreed to go along with them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At Barrio Kitalo, they met Makadatar Tayao
(Mabpan) who joined them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The four of
them arrived at Barrio Malipayon at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">eleven
 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening.</p>

<p class="BODY">They proceeded to Mision's house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ernesto asked Mision to open the door of his house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mision refused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ernesto asked him to come down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mision likewise refused because he was
scared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon Ernesto's order, Makadatar
took Mision's chickens and carabao under the house.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ernesto allegedly reproached Raop for doing nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, Raop got hold of the carabao, took it to
the place near the banana plants, and stayed there with Condalla.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Raop allegedly advised Ernesto and Makadatar
not to kill any person inside Mision's house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ernesto did not heed Raop's advice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After Ernesto and Makadatar entered the house, Raop and Condalla, who
carried the chickens, left the place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Raop let loose the carabao.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the distance, they heard gunshots being fired inside Mision's house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, Ernesto and Makadatar over­took Raop
and Condalla.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ernesto allegedly warned
Raop that he would be killed if he squealed to the authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel <u>de</u> <u>oficio</u>, who filed through his assistant
a hardly legible typewritten brief (a practice which should not be encouraged),
contends that the trial court erred in holding that Ernesto Sarip was
responsible for the deaths of the three victims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That contention cannot be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ernesto was the mastermind and was a
co-conspirator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Knowing that he was the
one primarily liable for the robbery with triple homi­cide, which the trial
court described as "most atrocious and cold-blooded", he interposed a
plea of guilty or <u>nolo contendere</u> and did not bother to prove any
attenuating circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to Raop, it is clear that his version of the robbery
with homicide does not exculpate him at all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His coun­sel <u>de oficio</u> argues that Raop acted against his
will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That con­tention is belied by
Raop's admission that he and Ernesto are close friends (89 tsn <st1:date year="1969" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1969</st1:date>; No. 4, Exh. J)<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The</span> two were
residents of Barrio Kalilangan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Raop did
not prove that he acted under the compulsion of an irresistible force or under
the impulse of an uncontrollable fear of an equal or greater in­jury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His pretension that he was threatened with a
gun by his friend, Ernesto, is not credible because he himself (Raop) was armed
with a rifle (Exh. E).</p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel's third contention, that the crime of robbery and
homicide should be treated separately and that only Makadatar Tayao (Mabpan),
who is at large, should be held liable for the killings, is likewise bereft of
merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence proves that Ernesto Sarip and Makadatar fired at the
inmates of the house before the clothes and the sewing machine were taken by
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Makadatar hacked Ciriaco Mision
before the robbery was consummated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
evident that the killings were perpetrated on the occasion of the robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since Makadatar, Ernesto Sarip and Raop were
conspirators, Raop is equally liable for the assaults committed by Makadatar
and Ernesto.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are satisfied that the guilt of Ernesto Sarip and Raop has
been established beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Abuse of superiority, dwelling and nocturnity attended the commission of
the robbery with triple homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even
if the mitigating circum­stance of plea of guilty is appreciated in Sarip's
favor, the death penalty should still be imposed upon him (Arts. 63 and 294[1],
Revised Penal Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court failed to include in the indemnity the value of
the stolen articles which it found to be P1<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The indemnity for the three killings should be
raised from P30<span class="GramE">,000</span> to P36,000.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in Criminal Case No. 1591, the death penalty
imposed by the trial court on Ernesto Sarip and Manuel Raop (Raup) is affirmed
and they are ordered to pay solidarily to the heirs of the Mision spouses the
sum of P1<span class="GramE">,000</span> as the value of the articles taken
during the robbery and P36,000 to the heirs of the three victims or P12,000 for
each set of heirs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs
