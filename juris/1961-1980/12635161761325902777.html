				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">This is a petition for
mandamus against the </span>Commissioner <span style="">of
Public Service and the Associate Commissioners of </span>Public Service, <span style="">as well as for the recovery of damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It appears that, on </span><st1:date month="6" day="19" year="1959"><span style="">June 19,
 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">, Republic Act
No. 2290, granting Consuelo S. <span class="SpellE">Calalang</span> a franchise
to construct, operate and maintain an ice plant and cold storage in <span class="SpellE">Hagonoy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, subject to
certain conditions, was approved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, on </span><st1:date month="8" day="17" year="1959"><span style="">August 17, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Calalang</span>
filed with the Public Service Com­mission - hereinafter referred to as PSC - an
application </span>docketed <span style="">as PSC Case
No. 126911, for the corresponding certificate of public convenience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prior thereto, or on July 17, 1959, <span class="SpellE">Auro</span> <span class="SpellE">Tanjangco</span>, as <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> of the estate of her deceased husband</span>
<span class="SpellE"><span style="">Gervacio</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Tanjangco</span>,
operator of an old ice plant in the same </span>town <span style="">of <span class="SpellE">Hagonoy</span>, had filed with the Commission an
application, docketed</span> <span style="">as PSC
Case No. 126537, for increase in the capacity of said ol</span>d <span style="">ice plant, from ten (10) to forty (40) tons
daily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Calalang</span>
objected to this petition for increase and prayed that the two cases – Nos.
126537 and 126911 - be jointly heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
an order dated </span><st1:date month="9" day="10" year="1959"><span style="">September 10, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">, PSC Associate Commissioner <span class="SpellE">As­pillera</span> overruled Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Calalang's</span>
opposition to said petition and denied the motion for a joint hearing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Her motion for the
reconsideration of said order having, </span>likewise, been denied by
Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Aspillera</span>, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Calalang</span>
instituted in this Court Cause L-16068, against the Intestate Estate of <span class="SpellE">Gervacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tanjangco</span> and
Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Aspillera</span>, for a writ of certiorari,
upon the ground that said Commissioner had gravely abused his discretion and
exceeded his jurisdiction in overruling said opposition and in denying the
motion for a joint trial, as well as the motion for reconsideration, without
submitting the latter to the Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the posting of the bond required <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, we issued an order restrain­ing Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Aspillera</span> from promulgating any decision in Case No.
126537, until further orders from this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This order, however, came too late, for on <st1:date month="9" day="28" year="1959">September 28, 1959</st1:date>, Com­missioner <span class="SpellE">Aspillera</span>
had rendered his decision in said case au­thorizing Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Tanjangco</span>
to increase the capacity of her ice plant from ten (10) to thirty (30) tons
daily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, on <st1:date month="11" day="21" year="1959">November 21, 1959</st1:date>, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Calalang</span> filed with this Court a supplemental petition
praying for another injunctive order, to restrain the execution of said
decision until the final disposition of<span style="">
</span>case L-16068.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the filing of
an additional bond by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Calalang</span>, the writ of
preliminary injunction prayed for in he supplemental petition therein was
issued on <st1:date year="1959" day="3" month="12">Decembers 3, 1959</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, or on <st1:date month="9" day="26" year="1960">September
 26, 1960</st1:date>, her application in Case No. 126911 was denied by the
Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pending resolution of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Calalang's</span> motion for reconsideration of the decision
therein rendered, or on November 29, 1960, this Court rendered judgment in
L-16068 reversing the order of the Commission in Case No. 126537 dated
September 10, 1959; setting aside the hearing held and the judgment rendered in
that case; declaring <span style="">that </span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Calalang's</span> opposition to the petition therein should be
admitted; and ordering the Commission to jointly try cases Nos. 126537 and
126911 and to thereafter render a new judgment in accordance with the law and
the evidence, as well as making permanent the writ of preliminary injunction
issued on December 3, 1959.</p>

<p class="BODY">Relying upon our aforementioned decision in L-16068, <span style="">Mrs. </span><span class="SpellE">Calalang</span>
subsequently filed in Case No. 126911 a supplemental motion for reconsideration
of the decision therein rendered on <st1:date month="9" day="26" year="1960">September
 26, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due hearing
and the filing of memoranda be the parties therein, said motion was submitted
for resolution on <st1:date month="8" day="15" year="1963">August 15, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission having taken no action on said
motion for reconsideration, despite her petitions of December 7, 1963 and April
7, 1964, urging the resolution thereof, on May 24, 1965, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Calalang</span> commenced the present action against the
Commissioner of Public Service and the Assistant Commissioners of Public
Service to compel them to act on her aforementioned motion for reconsideration
and supplemental motion for reconsideration of the decision in Case No. 126911,
as well as to recover the sum of P100,000.00 as damages allegedly suffered by
her from 1962 to the present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Twenty
(20) days later, or on <st1:date month="6" day="14" year="1965">June 14, 1965</st1:date>,
the Commission issued an order setting aside its decision in Case No. 126911
and setting said case and Case No. 126537 for joint trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence, the herein petition for
mandamus has become moot.</p>

<p class="BODY">This notwithstanding, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Calalang</span>
presses her claim for damages allegedly incurred on account of the undue delay
in the resolution of her motion for reconsideration and supplemental motion for
reconsideration in Case No. 126911.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted, however, that her claim for damages is
incidental to the petition for mandamus, without which we would have no
original jurisdiction to entertain said claim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is thus <span class="GramE">debatable,</span> to say the least, whether
or not we can pass upon said claim, <span style="">onc</span>e
the principal action for mandamus has become moot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, there is, as yet, no means by
which to ascertain the amount of the damages allegedly sustained by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Calalang</span>, assuming that respondents may be held liable <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, on which we need not and do not express any
opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, unless and until a
final judgment has been rendered fixing the conditions under which Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Calalang</span> may operate the ice plant and cold storage covered
by her franchise, and, particularly, the capacity thereof, it is legally
impossible to determine amount of said damages.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition herein is hereby dismissed,
without special pronouncement as to costs.</p>
