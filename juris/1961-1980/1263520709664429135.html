(Case No. 176-J) and one Modesto <span class="SpellE">Kalalang</span> (Case No.
175-J) against the Hon. Jose F. Fernandez, Judge of the Court of First In­stance
of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental, Branch V, the first, for
alleged inefficiency, <span class="SpellE">incompetency</span>, physical

<blockquote>"Modesto <span class="SpellE">Kalalang</span> alleges in his
complaint that on May 7, 1970, at about 8:30 A.M., he was ordered ar­rested by
the respondent Judge for having taken his picture while he was entering his <span class="SpellE">sala</span>; that he was detained at respondent's chamber for some
30 minutes after which he begged of respondent to allow him to go to the
comfort room; that emerging from the comfort room, he went out to confer with
his lawyer but when he returned, respondent's <span class="SpellE">sala</span> was
already closed; that four days later he was subpoenaed to appear and explain
why he should not be punished for contempt; that when he appeared he was
admonished and reprimanded.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In answer, respondent admits the allegations of the complaint
as substantially correct except the averment on detention, alleging that
petitioner was called to the chamber to explain his actuation and was advised
to telephone the mayor who ordered him to take his pictures and to call his
counsel to assist him <span style="">in giving </span>his
explana<span style="">tion in open court, and that he
was reprimanded after pleading guilty and begging for forgiveness.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

respondent judge starts morning <span style="">session
late </span>and ends it early; that he seldom <span class="GramE">hold</span>

the hear­ing of Civil Case No. 9059, the re­spondent Judge failed to protect
Atty. Jules <span class="SpellE">Rabago</span> from scurrilous and in­sulting
language of a Chinese witness; and that he even held said attorney in contempt
of court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Under Specification No. 3, peti­tioner alleges that the
respondent Judge heard a petition for preliminary attachment before the amended
com­plaint could be served upon the defend­ants in Civil Case No. 6689; that he
ordered the garnishment of the property of a third-party; that he issued an <span style="font-size: 12pt;">order </span>different from
what he ver­bally assured defendant's counsel; that he issued an order of execu­tion
pending appeal which might be stayed upon the filing of a P<span style="">50,000.00 </span><span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span>
bond, knowing <span style="">fully that provincial </span>branches
of surety companies for such sum need­ed prior approval of the Manila of­fices;
that he personally instruct­ed the office of the clerk of court to expedite
issuance of <span style="">the writ of </span>execution;
<span style="">that he </span>ordered the mana­ger of
a surety company to execute <span style="">a </span>certificate
of solvency to be at­tached to the bond; that he issued a supplemental order

his em­ployees to offer for sale his perso­nal effects.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"In answer to
Specification No. 1, </span>respondent Judge denies the im­putation of late
start and early termination of morning sessions, admitting but <span style="">attributing </span>to some law­yers some
instances though; admits few sessions <span style="">in </span>the afternoon due to reluctance of some
lawyers to at­tend; admits some instances of daily service <span style="">of less than five hours when </span>physically
indisposed but ready at a nearby residence for any and all exigencies; and
admits physical weak­ness but asserts mental alertness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent alleges that the affida­vits
attached to the complaint for support are unreliable, because the affiant Romeo
<span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> is <span style="">a relative </span>of complainant Romeo <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> and the first was the counsel of the latter in
eight cases which were dismissed for lack of evidence, and that af­fiant Jules <span class="SpellE">Rabago</span> is a poor loser <span style="">and apparently sick mentally.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

which he served </span><span style="">for six hours,
while the mandamus petition arising from Civil Case No<i>. </i>9064 was dismissed

case.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In answer to Specification No. 3, respondent refrains from
discus­sing the subject thereof because the same is on appeal in the Court <span style="">of Appeals under CA-G.R. No. 36005-R, and
therefore is <u>sub</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>judice</u></span>, but he
observes the appalling ignorance of the lawyer therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He denies the imputation that he ever offered
for sale his personal effects to liti­gants.<span style="">&nbsp;

interested in."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the same report, Justice Enriquez analyzed the evidence

<blockquote>"Only petitioner Modesto <span class="SpellE">Kalalang</span>
testified in support of his complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He merely reiterated the recitals of his complaint and his affidavit
annexed thereto.</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.3in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-weight: normal;">"<u>Re:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Adm.
Case No. 176-J</u>.</span><u><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<blockquote>"In support of the complaint of Mayor Romeo G. <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span>, he present­ed Messrs. Romeo G. <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>,
Jules <span class="SpellE">Rabago</span>, Felipe <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>,
<span class="GramE">Luz</span> <span class="SpellE">Datu</span> <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>
in addition to his testimony.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Affirming the recitals of his affidavit, Atty. Romeo <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> dec­lared that respondent required the presence of
lawyers as early as 8:30 only to arrive late and then terminated the morning
sessions as early as 11:00 A.M.; that his inter­preter often asked attorneys to
post­pone their hearings because the respondent Judge was not feeling well;
that at times the respondent Judge was attacked by paroxysms of cough­ing
thereby forcing him to suspend the session for some time; that he had the habit
of making it appear in his orders that the trial had to be postponed for lack
of material time although such was not the real rea­son; and that at times
after this witness was through with his hear­ings in other <span class="SpellE">salas</span>,
he noticed that respondent Judge had not started his hearings.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Atty. Jules <span class="SpellE">Rabago</span> likewise af­firmed
the recitals in his affidavit declaring that he received insulting answers from
a Chinese witness in Civil Case No. 9059; that instead of protection, he got
from the respond­ent Judge an order to be jailed by the bailiff; that when he
inquired why, respondent closeted himself in his chamber; that he saw the
respond­ent Judge the next day who suggested that the penalty for contempt
would be set aside, if he should apologize; that he turned down the suggestion
believing he did nothing wrong; that the respondent subsequently disregard­ed
his order; and that the respondent is sickly and comes to court late and leaves
early.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Atty. Luz <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>, likewise affirm­ing
the recitals of her affidavit, de­clared that respondent Judge heard the
petition for preliminary attach­ment in Civil Case No. 6689 before the amended
complaint could be served upon defendants; that he caused to be garnished
properties of third persons; that the interpreter advised her to settle the
case amicably because they would surely lose the same; that the same interpreter
then offered to sell the car and air-conditioner of respondent for P23,800.00
which she and <span style="">her husband refused to
buy; that they lost the case thereafter as forewarned; that respondent </span><span style="">is­sued </span><span style="">an order for immediate exe­cution, although he had previously assured
her co-counsel that the motion for execution would be de­nied; that </span><span style="">at </span><span style="">the hearing thereon, respondent was even arguing in fa­vor of the
motion for execution pending appeal; that she filed a motion for
reconsideration of the order for immediate execution, but the respondent Judge
rendered it moot with the issuance of a supplemental order allowing the
defendants to file a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond; that contrary
to usual prac­tice, respondent caused prompt personal service of the decision
and orders. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Mr. Felipe <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> was not presented as a witness, since he would
merely corroborate his wife's testimony.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

Mayor of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Ba­colod</span></st1:place></st1:city>
declared that respondent's interpreter tried to intercede for his superior in
settling these administrative cases, but that he refused; and that in
presenting this case, he was motivated by a desire to have judicial cases
speedily disposed of.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The respondent Judge submitted the cases without testimonial
evi­dence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He however submitted a writ­ten
memorandum with documentary evidence annexed thereto."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It is to be noted that respondent did not
<span style="">present any </span>oral
evidence and submitted the case for resolution upon the submission of a
memorandum with <span style="">annexes, con­</span>sisting of certain certifications and copies of mo­tions
and orders.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have gone over the evidence thus <span style="">submitted by </span>the parties to Justice
Enriquez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">We are </span>satisfied that, on the whole, the observations and
conclusions made and arrived <span style="">at </span>by the investigator <span style="">in his report </span>are amply supported by the
evidence in the record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So also is the
investigator's recommendation that re­spondent <span class="GramE">be</span>
exonerated from all the charges against him in these cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the charge of oppression by complainant <span class="SpellE">Kalalang</span>,
We find that the respondent was not without reason to summon said complainant
and require him to explain why he was taking pictures of respondent, without
his consent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even representatives of the
mass media are not entirely free to take photographs in the premises of the
court, without at least <span class="SpellE">priorly</span> advis­ing the presiding
judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Actually, respondent did not call
complainant to account necessarily because of the picture-taking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More accurately, what impelled the summons
for <span style="">a </span>contempt hearing was the
seeming ruse which was practiced by complainant of pretending he would go to
the comfort room only to disappear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
appears that what respondent actually wanted was for complainant to call the
Mayor, who, incidentally, is the complainant in the other case, so that the
matter of the instructions allegedly given by said Mayor to complainant to
photograph the respondent may be threshed out in a formal hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, with the apology given by
complainant to respondent on <st1:date year="1970" day="12" month="5">May 12,
 1970</st1:date>, which, according to complainant satisfied respondent, the
matter was considered closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all,
from a reading of complainant's own testimony, <span class="GramE">We</span> find
that the alleged detention of the complainant in respondent's chamber for about
thirty minutes is unfounded, for what actually happened was that re­spondent
merely gave instructions for the complainant to wait therein and not to leave
as other matters had to be attended to by respondent <span style="">in </span>the meanwhile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, he also told his bailiff that
complainant should not leave without his (the respondent's) per­mission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, We do not <span style="">see </span>how any administra­tive sanction can be imposed upon
respondent for such an incident, which the parties themselves considered closed
on May 12, 1970 and made the subject of <span style="">a
</span>com­plaint only on July 10, 1970, the same day Mayor <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span>
filed his own complaint, which parenthetical­ly, appears to have been prepared
since April 17, 1970 and sworn to on May 26, 1970 yet.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the charges of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span>,
other than the one about the alleged physical and mental incapacity of
respondent to perform the duties of his position, which will be taken up lastly
in this opinion, <span class="GramE">We</span> approve the findings and
conclusions of Justice Enriquez on the matter, which are contained in his
report as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
incident leading to the issuance of contempt order against Atty. Jules <span class="SpellE">Rabago</span> has its pros and cons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The quoted portions of the transcript of the
proceedings show some insulting answers from a Chi­nese witness which
admittedly <span style="">so </span>incensed Atty. <span class="SpellE">Rabago</span> that he ap­proached the witness with an accus­ing finger
warning that something untoward would have happened had the incident occurred
outside the courtroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent
Judge failed to <span style="">admonish </span>the
witness, striking his gavel when Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ra­bago</span>
reacted sharply thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If respondent
Judge, who is a <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>, understood the insulting
remarks spoken in the <span class="SpellE">Hinigayon</span> dialect, his
intervention against Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ra­bago</span> would be ill-timed
and biased, not justified under Rule 132, Sec­tion 19, of the Rules of Court,
calling for the protection of a witness under certain circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears though that the reaction of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Rabago</span> upon the answer of the witness as well as of respond­ent
Judge against Atty. <span class="SpellE">Rabago</span> who was approaching the
witness with an accusing finger followed each other in split seconds before the
insult­ing remarks of the witness could be translated to English.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The issuance of the contempt order against Atty. <span class="SpellE">Rabago</span> might not have been motivated by downright malice or
ill will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admittedly spoke loud
because of his hoarse voice in his desire to be heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Judge evidently construed the
high pitch as disrespectful and contemptuous, but that was not all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order was likewise premised upon his having
allegedly left the trial without the court's permission before the trial could
be adjourned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the
whole thing appears not <span class="GramE">so</span> serious as pictured,
because Atty. <span class="SpellE">Rabago</span> did not actual­ly go to jail.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"If there is anything condemn­able in the incident, it was
when the respondent Judge shouted at the bailiff to jail Atty. <span class="SpellE">Rabago</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He thus
exhibited unrestrained e­motion which might be attributed to an uncontrollable
temper cha­racteristic of some nervous ail­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record of the proceed­ing does not
reflect how loud or contemptuously Atty. <span class="SpellE">Rabago</span>
spoke.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the substance of his state­ment
which incensed the respon­dent Judge to order his <span class="GramE">incarcera­tion,</span>
seems to bear the humility of a pleader, it could have been said in a manner
characteristic of a lawyer who was just insulted by a witness, if not resentful
for alleged lost cases decided by the respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the re­spondent Judge left the courtroom
for his chamber aided by his bail­iff shows how strongly he was dis­turbed by
the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this does not show the
impotency of his anger, it manifests to some extent an attempt to check it,
however late it might be.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Except for some personal in­terest imputed to
the respondent Judge in favor of a Chinese nation­al in Civil Case No. 6689,
which should have been at least person­ally denied by him were it not the
truth, the facts complained of by Atty. Luz <span class="SpellE">Datu</span> <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> refer to ut­terances or representations made by
respondent's bailiff, interpreter and deputy clerk and the adverse order for
immediate execution de­spite the assurance given Atty. <span class="SpellE">La­lisan</span>
by respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The charges being
penal in nature, the undersigned is not inclined to draw adverse inferences
from the imputations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At least, the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <u><span style="">inter</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>alios</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>acta</u></span> rule would be a </span>deterrent against taking
such actuation of the employees as reflect<span style="">ing
adversely </span>against respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is true that Judges must like <span class="SpellE">Ceasar's</span> wife be beyond
suspicion, <span style="">so to speak, but such
suspicion </span>must be engendered by the Judge's own acts, not by the words
of others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant should <span style="">have </span>brought the matter up to the
Judge for confirmation and only thru his reaction may he be judged.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"A neutralizing factor is the <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span>
insinuation and allega­tion that complaining witnesses and attorneys are
relatives of losers in cases decided adversely by respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No reason has been offered for taking such
serious accusation in silence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has
not been met even with <span style="">a </span>denial <span style="">in </span>petitioner's memorandum which was
filed in reply to that of re­spondent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With respect to the procedural complaints made against the
respon­dent in connection with Civil Case No. 6689, suffice it to mention that
no prejudice was alleged to have been suffered from his hear­ing the petition
for preliminary attachment before the amended com­plaint could be served upon
the de­fendants, which prior service was not shown to be extremely necessary;
that the garnishment or attachment of properties of third persons was not the
fault of the attaching or garnishing sheriff and that the re­medy under Rule
57, Section 14, of the Rules of Court, was available to such third persons;
that the of­fer to sell respondent's car and air-conditioner made by third-par­ties
who were not shown to have been commissioned by respondent to sell them
particularly to litigants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the
appealed judgment not actually executed, because Atty. <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>
filed a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond, we see nothing therein for
which the respondent may be dismissed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The acts imputed to the respon­dent Judge could hardly
constitute the grounds alleged for respondent's dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are not of such mag­nitude and gravity
as would establish any of the statutory grounds for dis­missal of a Judge of
First Instance - serious misconduct and inefficiency as construed in the cases
of In re Impeachment of <span class="SpellE">Horilleno</span> (43 Phil. 212), <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> et al. (92 Phil.
456), <span class="SpellE">Ochate</span> et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Deling</span>
et al. (105 Phil. 389).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His reversed
judgments are attributable to errors of judgment rather than wrongful in­tention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Determination of cases on the merits without
the record of said cases <span style="">is risky.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The mere reversal of decisions by
appellate courts <span style="">is in­</span>sufficient
and unjust basis for a conclusion of ignorance of the law of the trial judge,
especially when those affirmed are not considered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No Judge would feel safe if reversal of his
judgment would constitute sure index of his ignorance of the law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Coming now to the alleged physical and mental in­capacity of
respondent, it must be emphasized that, al­though the respondent did not
testify before Justice Enriquez, the record suggests that <span style="">he </span>was present in some parts of the
investigation and the investigator actually had the opportunity to <span style="">observe his physical </span>condition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, to have further assurance of
the exact <span style="">physical and </span>mental
condition of the respondent, the Court agreed that the writer of this opinion
personally <span style="">see </span>the respondent
in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
<span style="">as, any­</span><span style="">way, </span>he was going there for other
purposes.</p>

<p class="BODY">All relevant things considered, the Court feels that, considering
that respondent has intimated to this writer his determination to retire as
soon as these <span style="">cases are </span>decided
by this Court and <span style="">inasmuch </span>as
under Section 2 of Republic Act No. 910, as amended by Republic Acts 2614 and
5095, on the retirement of mem­bers of the judiciary, it <span style="">is </span>the Secretary of Justice who is
called upon to certify to the permanent physi­cal disability of a judge of the
Court of First In­stance, for purposes of immediate retirement <span style="">with the </span>benefits provided therein,
there is no imperative neces­sity for this Court to make any express and
specific ruling on the alleged <span style="">physical
and </span>mental incapacity of respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Undoubtedly, and this is admitted expressly in his own memorandum
in his defense, respondent is suffering from a physical ailment that impairs
his mobility to such an extent that he cannot walk alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot al­so be denied that his disease,
which is basically of the nerves, has to a great extent affected his mental
dispo­sition and temperament and even his power of speech.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no question that further effort on
his part to discharge the heavy burdens and responsibilities of a judicial
magistrate will only aggravate his condition and correspondingly reduce his
remaining capacity for the work required of his position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is not proper on the one hand, that
a judge, as a public servant who has been rendering public service continuously
for almost three decades and a half without any serious derogatory record,
should be just unceremoniously cast aside simply because he has outlived his
usefulness, on the other, it is but fair to the public interest that the smooth
and efficient administration of justice should not in any degree be knowingly
allowed to be impaired by the physi­cal ailment and consequent handicaps of an
incumbent magistrate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Public policy
demands that the outcome of judicial proceedings should reflect maximum
efficiency and, as much as possible, excellence of performance on the part of
those who man the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Naturally,
these cannot be expected from one who suffers an incurable malady so obviously affecting
the functioning of the nerves as to impair his powers of locomotion and speech
and to cause frequent paroxysms of coughing and what is worse, shortness of
temper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The propensity of a judge to
lose patience without much provocation does not lend to the equanimity and
judiciousness that should be the constant marks of a dispenser of justice.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">What is obviously happening to the
respondent is that after such a long service to the government, one-half
thereof in the judiciary, and being only fifty-eight years old, he feels that
he should be allowed to render more service to the people, even as he knows the
handicaps that afflict him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be <span style="">sure, </span>such an atti­tude should be
appreciated rather than condemned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No­thing
in the record suggests that respondent <span style="">is
insist</span>ing to continue on the job for any improper motive or
purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is </span>simply that he honestly <span style="">believes he is </span>still equal to the task assigned to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We can <span style="">see,
</span>however, that he is, to put it mildly, already very tired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is evident that over thirty-four years of
continuous work has told heavily on his health.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As <span class="GramE">We</span> see it, only a long deserved rest can
save him, and the earlier he gets it, the better.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent should realize that by taking
early advantage of the opportunity to rest and to still regain part of his
former self, he will at the same time be rendering a valuable contribution to
the administration of just­ice to which he has been devoted for so long and
which he must be most interested to promote because then his court will again
be able to function as well as it should under someone better physically fit
for the tremendous and arduous job therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, without necessarily finding and holding that
respondent is already permanently disabled to perform the duties of a judge, it
is Our con­sidered opinion that in his present physical and men­tal condition,
the respondent may well be entitled to his just rewards for his long and
unblemished service to the government and that he would promote in a big way
the best interests of the administration of just­ice, if he sought the benefits
of retirement with the proper administrative authorities soonest.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF ALL THESE CONSIDERATIONS,</b> these two
administrative complaints are hereby dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Let a copy of this decision be furnished the Secretary of Justice.</p>
