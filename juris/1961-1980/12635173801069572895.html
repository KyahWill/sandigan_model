				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> &amp; Sons, Inc. (<span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>, for short) seeks a review of the Auditor General's
refusal to entertain <span class="SpellE">Puyat's</span> claim for alleged unpaid
rentals against the Sugar Quota Administration (SQA).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Auditor General predicated <span style="">his </span>ruling
upon the ground that he had already previously decided the question and that his
decision had become final.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of this case are:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1961</st1:date>,
a lease contract was executed between <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> as <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> and SQA as lessee.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subject matter thereof was the third floor of Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> building at <span class="SpellE">EscoIta</span>, corner
<st1:address><st1:street>David Street</st1:street>, <st1:city>Manila</st1:city></st1:address>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lease was to run for one year beginning <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The monthly rental, payable in advance within
the first 10 days of each calendar month, was P4, 650.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1962</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> formally notified SQA that it did not intend to
renew the contract of lease expiring on <st1:date year="1962" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1962</st1:date> and that SQA should turn over the
premises to <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> upon expiration of the lease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="28" month="11">November
 28, 1962</st1:date>, <span style="">SQA </span>advised
<span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> by letter that it "is vacating the
premises officially as of <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time> on <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="11">Friday, November 30, 1962</st1:date>." SQA
there requested that <span class="SpellE">Puyat's</span> representative be around
the pre­mises when SQA moves out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1962</st1:date>, one <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> Jose, allegedly a representative of <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>, received possession of the leased premises from SQA
"in good condition".</p>

<p class="BODY">But on December 5, 1962, <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>, through
counsel, wrote SQA stating that the latter's request for "the payment of
rentals up to November 30, 1962 only" was denied and demand­ing that
rental up to December 15, 1962, the expiry date of the lease, be paid.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 18, 1962, <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> wrote the
Auditor of<span style=""> </span>SQA, Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Costes</span>, requesting him "to cause immediate settle<span style="">ment" of its claim for unpaid rental for
the period December 1-15, 1962 in the amount of P2, 325.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> relies on the
term </span>of the lease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The SQA
Auditor in turn forwarded, by 1st <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>, <span class="SpellE">Puyat's</span> letter to the Acting Administrator of SQA <span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the 2nd <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>
of <st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="12">December 27, 1962</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">SQA's</span> Acting Administrator returned to <span class="SpellE"><span style="">SQA's</span></span><span style=""> </span>Auditor <span class="SpellE">Puyat's</span> letter together with a copy of <span class="SpellE">SQA's</span>
letter to the Auditor General of the same date and the memorandum of the SQA
Legal Officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its letter to the
Auditor General, SQA explained that no provision in the contract there was that
SQA could not vacate the premises within the one year period; that SQA expected
that it would occupy the leased premises for as long as it needed the same;
that SQA had to leave the <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> building on November
30, 1962 because it could only transfer to <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> Maria
Building at <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> Avenue, <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, with the condition that SQA transfer
immediately; and that the premises were accepted in good condition by <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By 3rd <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> of <st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="2">February
 4, 1963</st1:date>, the SQA Auditor forwarded <span class="SpellE">Puyat's</span>
claim to the Auditor General.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1963</st1:date>,
Deputy Auditor General Jesus <span class="SpellE">Iriarte</span>, by 4th <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> to the SQA Auditor, ruled "that the Sugar
Quota Administration is not liable to pay rental for the unexpired portion of
the within lease contract corresponding to the period from <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="12">December 1 to 15, 1962</st1:date>."</p>

<p class="BODY">Notice of this decision by the Deputy Auditor General <span style="">was </span>received by <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>,
through counsel, on <st1:date year="1963" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="6">June 8, 1963</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>, this time represented by new counsel, wrote
the Auditor General asking for payment of its claim against SQA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> there conceded
that SQA vacated the premises "fifteen (15) days before the expiry date of
the lease contract" but questioned for the first time the authority of the
<span style="">person who received the premises from
SQA on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="12"><span style="">December 1, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On July 12, 1963, the Deputy Auditor General, acting on <span class="SpellE">Puyat's</span> letter of June 8, 1963, ruled that his office
"has already rendered a decision on the said claim under its 4th <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> dated March 7, 1963" which was received by
<span class="SpellE">Puyat's</span> counsel on March 26, 1963; that since <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> did not appeal from the said decision within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period of 30 days from notice under
Commonwealth Act 327, the same had already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>;
and that, accordingly, <span class="SpellE">Puyat's</span> claim could no longer
be entertained.</p>

<p class="BODY">Reconsideration having been denied, <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>
registered the present petition for review.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be well to start
with the statement that the Auditor General is a constitutional officer<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
called upon "to examine, audit, and settle all accounts pertaining to the
revenues and receipts from whatever source, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> and audit, in accord­ance with law and administrative
regulations, all expenditures of funds or property pertaining to x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the Government or the
provinces or municipalities thereof."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Pursuant to Section 534 of the Revised Administrative Code, as amended by
Republic Act 2266, the Auditor General is the ex-officio auditor of all
corporations, owned or controlled by the Philippine Government as well as all
other self-governing boards, commissions, or agencies of the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>SQA is an agency of the Philippine
Government.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>
file a claim upon which the disputed Auditor General's decision was rendered?
To be recalled is that as early as <st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="12">December
 18, 1962</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> wrote SQA Auditor
Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Costes</span> asking for immediate settlement of
its claim against SQA for unpaid rental for the period from "<st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="12">December 1-15, 1962</st1:date>" amounting
to P2<span class="GramE">,325</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> there contended that the "contract [of lease]
states clearly that the lease is for one (1) year and that therefore the
rentals for the premises must be up to the expiry date of the contract of
lease." A controversy was thus generated between <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>
and SQA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because having surrendered the
premises on December 1, it was <span class="SpellE">SQA's</span> contention that
there was no rental payment due for the period <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="12">December 1-15, 1962</st1:date> in the amount of P2<span class="GramE">,325</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By law, that controversy had to be decided by
the Auditor General.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first problem that crops up is whether the <st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="12">Decem­ber 18, 1962</st1:date> letter of <span class="SpellE">Puyat's</span> counsel to the SQA Auditor is a claim properly
filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Auditor of SQA is a
representative of the Auditor General,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
<u>not</u> an employee of SQA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
nature of his office indeed prevents him from being an SQA employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, he is under the supervision and
control of, and receives orders and instructions from, the Auditor General.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Stated the other way, the SQA Auditor is but an officer of the General Auditing
Office, a subordinate of the Auditor General.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> filed his claim with the SQA
Auditor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">SQA's</span>
Auditor is a representative of the Auditor General in SQA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the claim filed by <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> was a claim filed with the Auditor General.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Correctly did the SQA
Auditor refer the <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> claim to <span class="GramE">SQA.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only is this proper; the law authorizes
him to do so.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>With <span class="SpellE">SQA's</span>
comment, the matter was then submitted by <span class="SpellE">SQA's</span>
Auditor to the Auditor General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
question of fact was involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
undisputed facts are there: The contract calls for the termination of the lease
on <st1:date year="1962" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>, the lessee,
notified SQA that the contract would not be renewed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>SQA in turn wrote <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>
that it would vacate the premises on <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="11">November
 30, 1962</st1:date> and that someone be sent by <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>
to receive the premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On December 1,
SQA turned over the premises to one <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> Jose,
who purportedly was <span class="SpellE">Puyat's</span> representative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is upon these facts that the Auditor
General ruled out <span class="SpellE">Puyat's</span> rental claim for <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="12">December 1-15, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>
says that the 4th <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> of the Deputy Auditor
General of <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1963</st1:date> is
not a decision but a mere opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
sufficient answer to this contention is that an <span class="SpellE">indorse­ment</span>
of the Auditor General deciding a controversy is a decision.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
There is the controversy: <span class="SpellE">Puyat's</span> claim for unpaid
rentals and opposition thereto by SQA.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is the Auditor General em­powered by law to resolve that
claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, the Auditor General did
decide that SQA "is not liable to pay" such rental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That a <span style="">decision
has been reached is emphasized by the last paragraph of the 4th <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>, thus: "The date claimant receives notice
of this <u>decision</u> should be made of record." All the elements of a
judgment are there: the controversy, the authority to decide, and the
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, a judgment is the
law's final word pronounced by a competent authority in a controversy submitted
to it.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its proper sequence,
the next problem to be resolved is whether or not the Auditor General's
decision of <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1963</st1:date>
has become final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notice of this
decision was received by counsel for <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> on the
26th of March.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>, on <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="6">June 8,
 1963</st1:date>, wrote the Auditor General presenting its claim for the same
rentals subject of the Auditor General's decision of <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That came too late.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
constitutional precept, "[w]hen the aggrieved party is a private person or
entity, an appeal from the decision of the Auditor General may be taken
directly to a court of record in the manner provided by law."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
It is in implementation of this constitutional authority that Section 2,
Commonwealth Act 327, did provide that such aggrieved private person may take
an appeal in writing to the Supreme Court of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
"within thirty days from receipt of the decision." Complementary
thereto is Section 1, Rule 44, of the Rules of Court which directs that an
appeal from a final decision of the General Auditing Office shall be taken
within thirty (30) days from notice of such decision.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Since
no appeal from the decision of the Auditor General has been taken by <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> within the 30-day period from </span></span><st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="3"><span class="GramE"><span style="">March 7, 1963</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="">, that decision has become final.</span></span><span style=""> <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Denial of a second claim certainly does not

<p class="NUM">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>
cries lack of due process - denial of opportunity to be heard.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We look back at <span class="SpellE">Puyat's</span> claim of </span><st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="12"><span style="">December 18, 1962</span></st1:date><span style=""> filed with the Auditor of SQA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find that such claim was predicated upon
undisputed facts, namely, although the premises were vacated by SQA on December
1, the lease contract calls for a term which was to expire on December 15.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> </span>then
averred that it was the contract that must have to be followed; and that,
therefore, it is entitled to rentals from December 1 to December 15 in the sum
of P2<span class="GramE">,325</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
pure question of law was thus raised.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> claim filed by <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> with the Auditor of SQA on <st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="12">December 18, 1962</st1:date>, no intimation was ever made

the premises on <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1962</st1:date>,
was without authority to receive the same from SQA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first time that assertion was ever made
that this man was "a person devoid of any authority to represent" <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> was on <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="6"><u>June
 8</u>, <u>1963</u></st1:date>, when the new attorneys of <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>
wrote the Auditor General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time,
the Auditor General's decision of <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="3">March
 7, 1963</st1:date> had become final.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because, <span class="SpellE">Puyat's</span> former counsel did not appeal
within the 30-day period which expired on <st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="4"><u>April</u> <u>25</u>, <u>1963</u></st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">No factual issue as to the authority of <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span>
Jose may thus be belatedly asserted to enable <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>
to claim right to a hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>First</u>,
because that question was never raised <u><span style="">prior</span></u><span style=""> </span>to the decision; and <u>second</u>, <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> has had <u><span style="">opportunity</span></u><span style=""> </span>to raise the same within the 30-day
