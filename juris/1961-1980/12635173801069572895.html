				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> &amp; Sons, Inc. (<span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>, for short) seeks a review of the Auditor General's
refusal to entertain <span class="SpellE">Puyat's</span> claim for alleged unpaid
rentals against the Sugar Quota Administration (SQA).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Auditor General predicated <span style="">his </span>ruling
upon the ground that he had already previously decided the question and that his
decision had become final.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of this case are:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1961</st1:date>,
a lease contract was executed between <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> as <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> and SQA as lessee.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subject matter thereof was the third floor of Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> building at <span class="SpellE">EscoIta</span>, corner
<st1:address><st1:street>David Street</st1:street>, <st1:city>Manila</st1:city></st1:address>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lease was to run for one year beginning <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The monthly rental, payable in advance within
the first 10 days of each calendar month, was P4, 650.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1962</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> formally notified SQA that it did not intend to
renew the contract of lease expiring on <st1:date year="1962" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1962</st1:date> and that SQA should turn over the
premises to <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> upon expiration of the lease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="28" month="11">November
 28, 1962</st1:date>, <span style="">SQA </span>advised
<span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> by letter that it "is vacating the
premises officially as of <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time> on <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="11">Friday, November 30, 1962</st1:date>." SQA
there requested that <span class="SpellE">Puyat's</span> representative be around
the pre足mises when SQA moves out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1962</st1:date>, one <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> Jose, allegedly a representative of <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>, received possession of the leased premises from SQA
"in good condition".</p>

<p class="BODY">But on December 5, 1962, <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>, through
counsel, wrote SQA stating that the latter's request for "the payment of
rentals up to November 30, 1962 only" was denied and demand足ing that
rental up to December 15, 1962, the expiry date of the lease, be paid.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 18, 1962, <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> wrote the
Auditor of<span style=""> </span>SQA, Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Costes</span>, requesting him "to cause immediate settle<span style="">ment" of its claim for unpaid rental for
the period December 1-15, 1962 in the amount of P2, 325.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> relies on the
term </span>of the lease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The SQA
Auditor in turn forwarded, by 1st <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>, <span class="SpellE">Puyat's</span> letter to the Acting Administrator of SQA <span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the 2nd <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>
of <st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="12">December 27, 1962</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">SQA's</span> Acting Administrator returned to <span class="SpellE"><span style="">SQA's</span></span><span style=""> </span>Auditor <span class="SpellE">Puyat's</span> letter together with a copy of <span class="SpellE">SQA's</span>
letter to the Auditor General of the same date and the memorandum of the SQA
Legal Officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its letter to the
Auditor General, SQA explained that no provision in the contract there was that
SQA could not vacate the premises within the one year period; that SQA expected
that it would occupy the leased premises for as long as it needed the same;
that SQA had to leave the <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> building on November
30, 1962 because it could only transfer to <span class="SpellE">Do単a</span> Maria
Building at <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> Avenue, <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, with the condition that SQA transfer
immediately; and that the premises were accepted in good condition by <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By 3rd <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> of <st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="2">February
 4, 1963</st1:date>, the SQA Auditor forwarded <span class="SpellE">Puyat's</span>
claim to the Auditor General.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1963</st1:date>,
Deputy Auditor General Jesus <span class="SpellE">Iriarte</span>, by 4th <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> to the SQA Auditor, ruled "that the Sugar
Quota Administration is not liable to pay rental for the unexpired portion of
the within lease contract corresponding to the period from <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="12">December 1 to 15, 1962</st1:date>."</p>

<p class="BODY">Notice of this decision by the Deputy Auditor General <span style="">was </span>received by <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>,
through counsel, on <st1:date year="1963" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="6">June 8, 1963</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>, this time represented by new counsel, wrote
the Auditor General asking for payment of its claim against SQA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> there conceded
that SQA vacated the premises "fifteen (15) days before the expiry date of
the lease contract" but questioned for the first time the authority of the
<span style="">person who received the premises from
SQA on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="12"><span style="">December 1, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On July 12, 1963, the Deputy Auditor General, acting on <span class="SpellE">Puyat's</span> letter of June 8, 1963, ruled that his office
"has already rendered a decision on the said claim under its 4th <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> dated March 7, 1963" which was received by
<span class="SpellE">Puyat's</span> counsel on March 26, 1963; that since <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> did not appeal from the said decision within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period of 30 days from notice under
Commonwealth Act 327, the same had already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>;
and that, accordingly, <span class="SpellE">Puyat's</span> claim could no longer
be entertained.</p>

<p class="BODY">Reconsideration having been denied, <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>
registered the present petition for review.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be well to start
with the statement that the Auditor General is a constitutional officer<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
called upon "to examine, audit, and settle all accounts pertaining to the
revenues and receipts from whatever source, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> and audit, in accord足ance with law and administrative
regulations, all expenditures of funds or property pertaining to x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the Government or the
provinces or municipalities thereof."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Pursuant to Section 534 of the Revised Administrative Code, as amended by
Republic Act 2266, the Auditor General is the ex-officio auditor of all
corporations, owned or controlled by the Philippine Government as well as all
other self-governing boards, commissions, or agencies of the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>SQA is an agency of the Philippine
Government.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>
file a claim upon which the disputed Auditor General's decision was rendered?
To be recalled is that as early as <st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="12">December
 18, 1962</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> wrote SQA Auditor
Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Costes</span> asking for immediate settlement of
its claim against SQA for unpaid rental for the period from "<st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="12">December 1-15, 1962</st1:date>" amounting
to P2<span class="GramE">,325</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> there contended that the "contract [of lease]
states clearly that the lease is for one (1) year and that therefore the
rentals for the premises must be up to the expiry date of the contract of
lease." A controversy was thus generated between <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>
and SQA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because having surrendered the
premises on December 1, it was <span class="SpellE">SQA's</span> contention that
there was no rental payment due for the period <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="12">December 1-15, 1962</st1:date> in the amount of P2<span class="GramE">,325</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By law, that controversy had to be decided by
the Auditor General.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first problem that crops up is whether the <st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="12">Decem足ber 18, 1962</st1:date> letter of <span class="SpellE">Puyat's</span> counsel to the SQA Auditor is a claim properly
filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Auditor of SQA is a
representative of the Auditor General,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
<u>not</u> an employee of SQA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
nature of his office indeed prevents him from being an SQA employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, he is under the supervision and
control of, and receives orders and instructions from, the Auditor General.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Stated the other way, the SQA Auditor is but an officer of the General Auditing
Office, a subordinate of the Auditor General.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> filed his claim with the SQA
Auditor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">SQA's</span>
Auditor is a representative of the Auditor General in SQA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the claim filed by <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> was a claim filed with the Auditor General.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Correctly did the SQA
Auditor refer the <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> claim to <span class="GramE">SQA.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only is this proper; the law authorizes
him to do so.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>With <span class="SpellE">SQA's</span>
comment, the matter was then submitted by <span class="SpellE">SQA's</span>
Auditor to the Auditor General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
question of fact was involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
undisputed facts are there: The contract calls for the termination of the lease
on <st1:date year="1962" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>, the lessee,
notified SQA that the contract would not be renewed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>SQA in turn wrote <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>
that it would vacate the premises on <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="11">November
 30, 1962</st1:date> and that someone be sent by <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>
to receive the premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On December 1,
SQA turned over the premises to one <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> Jose,
who purportedly was <span class="SpellE">Puyat's</span> representative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is upon these facts that the Auditor
General ruled out <span class="SpellE">Puyat's</span> rental claim for <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="12">December 1-15, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>
says that the 4th <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> of the Deputy Auditor
General of <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1963</st1:date> is
not a decision but a mere opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
sufficient answer to this contention is that an <span class="SpellE">indorse足ment</span>
of the Auditor General deciding a controversy is a decision.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
There is the controversy: <span class="SpellE">Puyat's</span> claim for unpaid
rentals and opposition thereto by SQA.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is the Auditor General em足powered by law to resolve that
claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, the Auditor General did
decide that SQA "is not liable to pay" such rental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That a <span style="">decision
has been reached is emphasized by the last paragraph of the 4th <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>, thus: "The date claimant receives notice
of this <u>decision</u> should be made of record." All the elements of a
judgment are there: the controversy, the authority to decide, and the
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, a judgment is the
law's final word pronounced by a competent authority in a controversy submitted
to it.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its proper sequence,
the next problem to be resolved is whether or not the Auditor General's
decision of <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1963</st1:date>
has become final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notice of this
decision was received by counsel for <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> on the
26th of March.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>, on <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="6">June 8,
 1963</st1:date>, wrote the Auditor General presenting its claim for the same
rentals subject of the Auditor General's decision of <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That came too late.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
constitutional precept, "[w]hen the aggrieved party is a private person or
entity, an appeal from the decision of the Auditor General may be taken
directly to a court of record in the manner provided by law."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
It is in implementation of this constitutional authority that Section 2,
Commonwealth Act 327, did provide that such aggrieved private person may take
an appeal in writing to the Supreme Court of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
"within thirty days from receipt of the decision." Complementary
thereto is Section 1, Rule 44, of the Rules of Court which directs that an
appeal from a final decision of the General Auditing Office shall be taken
within thirty (30) days from notice of such decision.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Since
no appeal from the decision of the Auditor General has been taken by <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> within the 30-day period from </span></span><st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="3"><span class="GramE"><span style="">March 7, 1963</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="">, that decision has become final.</span></span><span style=""> <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Denial of a second claim certainly does not

<p class="NUM">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We look back at <span class="SpellE">Puyat's</span> claim of </span><st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="12"><span style="">December 18, 1962</span></st1:date><span style=""> filed with the Auditor of SQA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find that such claim was predicated upon
undisputed facts, namely, although the premises were vacated by SQA on December
1, the lease contract calls for a term which was to expire on December 15.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> </span>then
averred that it was the contract that must have to be followed; and that,
therefore, it is entitled to rentals from December 1 to December 15 in the sum
of P2<span class="GramE">,325</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
pure question of law was thus raised.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> claim filed by <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> with the Auditor of SQA on <st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="12">December 18, 1962</st1:date>, no intimation was ever made

the premises on <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1962</st1:date>,
was without authority to receive the same from SQA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first time that assertion was ever made
that this man was "a person devoid of any authority to represent" <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> was on <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="6"><u>June
 8</u>, <u>1963</u></st1:date>, when the new attorneys of <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>
wrote the Auditor General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time,
the Auditor General's decision of <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="3">March
 7, 1963</st1:date> had become final.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because, <span class="SpellE">Puyat's</span> former counsel did not appeal
within the 30-day period which expired on <st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="4"><u>April</u> <u>25</u>, <u>1963</u></st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">No factual issue as to the authority of <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span>
Jose may thus be belatedly asserted to enable <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>
