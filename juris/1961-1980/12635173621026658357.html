HON. FELINO D. ABALOS, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE, BRANCH II, 16TH
JUDICIAL DISTRICT, AND MOHAMMAD USSAM DAMBONG, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a special civil action for certiorari and mandamus with
preliminary mandatory injunction, to annul an order of Honorable <span class="SpellE">Felino</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Abalos</span>, as Judge of the
Court of First In­stance of <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>, directing that the
testimony of a rebuttal witness for the prosecution in Criminal Case No. 3158
of said Court be stricken from the records.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Soon after the filing of the petition herein, <span class="GramE">We</span>
issued a temporary restraining order directing that the continuation of the
trial of said case be suspended until fur­ther orders.</p>

<p class="BODY">On or about March 9, 1966, an information was filed with said
court, presided over by respondent Judge, accusing Mo­hammad <span class="SpellE">Ussam</span> <span class="SpellE">Dambong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Jikiri</span> <span class="SpellE">Dambong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Amiril</span> <span class="SpellE">Habissi</span> and Ahmad <span class="SpellE">Intoman</span>, of the crime of double murder upon <span class="SpellE">Abdulhadi</span> <span class="SpellE">Maoludani</span> and <span class="SpellE">Maoludani</span> <span class="SpellE">Habissi</span>, with multiple
frustrated murder upon the persons of <span class="SpellE">Sarahani</span> <span class="SpellE">Maoludani</span>, <span class="SpellE">Marajuko</span> <span class="SpellE">Maoludani</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abdulrajik</span> <span class="SpellE">Maoludani</span>, allegedly committed <span style="">on </span>February 6, 1961, in <span class="SpellE">Guimba</span> <span class="SpellE">Asin</span>, municipality of <span class="SpellE">Panamao</span>,
pro­vince of <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the case was called for trial, the prosecution introduced evidence
tending to show that defendant Mohammad <span class="SpellE">Ussam</span> <span class="SpellE">Dambong</span> had, on February 6, 1961, gone to the place
aforementioned, accompanied by his co-defendants, and then fired at and killed <span class="SpellE">Maoludani</span> <span class="SpellE">Habissi</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abdulhadi</span> <span class="SpellE">Maoludani</span>, as well as
shot and wounded the other persons named in the information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the reception of said evidence for the
prosecution, the de­fense proceeded with the presentation of its own evidence,
in the course of which, defendant Mohammad <span class="SpellE">Ussam</span> <span class="SpellE">Dambong</span> testified that the casualties and the injuries
adverted to above were due to shots fired, not by him, but by <span class="SpellE">Abdulkadil</span> <span class="SpellE">Habbisi</span>, because, as a
police sergeant in the performance of his duty, he (Mohammad <span class="SpellE">Ussam</span> <span class="SpellE">Dambong</span>) had merely fired
into the air, to stop a fight between two (2) groups of persons, to one of
which the victims belonged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense
having, thereafter, completed the intro­duction of its evidence, on April 24,
1968, the prosecution called <span class="SpellE">Madjid</span> <span class="SpellE">Andi</span> as rebuttal witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the preliminary questions propounded to him, the defense
objected to further questions, upon the ground that <span class="SpellE">Madjid</span>
<span class="SpellE">Andi</span> appeared to have witnessed the occurrence and
that his testimony should have been introduced when the prosecution presented
its evidence in chief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge
sus­tained the objection, but, later, reconsidered his resolution, as the
prosecution explained that it had discovered <span class="SpellE">Madjid</span> <span class="SpellE">Andi</span> sometime after the introduction of its evidence in<b> </b>chief
and that the testimony of said witness would merely rebut that of defendant
Mohammad <span class="SpellE">Ussam</span> <span class="SpellE">Dambong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, the prosecution resumed the
examination of <span class="SpellE">Madjid</span> <span class="SpellE">Andi</span>,
who said<b> </b>that he was present when the shooting involved in the case took
place, that <span class="SpellE">Maoludani</span> <span class="SpellE">Habissi</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Abdulhadi</span> <span class="SpellE">Maoludani</span>
were shot by defendant Mohammad <span class="SpellE">Ussam</span> <span class="SpellE">Dambong</span>, not by <span class="SpellE">Abdul­kadil</span> <span class="SpellE">Habbisi</span>, and that the latter was not even at the scene of
the occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution then
asked <span class="SpellE">Madjid</span> <span class="SpellE">Andi</span> whe­ther
Mohammad <span class="SpellE">Ussam</span> <span class="SpellE">Dambong</span> was
in the courtroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense objected
to this question as improper for rebuttal, and one that should have been asked
during the presentation by the<b> </b>prosecution of its evidence in
chief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge sus­tained the
objection and ordered the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Madjid</span> <span class="SpellE">Andi</span> stricken from the record, as improper for rebuttal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecutor having announced that <span class="SpellE">Madjid</span>
<span class="SpellE">Andi</span> would be its last witness and that he
(prosecutor) would appeal from the resolution of the court as soon as copy
thereof had been furnished him, respondent Judge incorporated his aforemen­tioned
resolution in an order, dated May 2, 1968, directing that the testimony of said
witness be "discarded from the re­cords on the ground that the testimony
are answers to questions not proper in rebuttal" and stating that "from
the observation of the Court, the witness in rebuttal should have been
presented as a witness in the presentation of the evidence in chief of the
prosecutor", and declaring that the case would be deemed sub­mitted for
decision on May 15, 1968, unless the parties sought permission to file
memoranda on or before said date.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this original action for certiorari and mandamus, with
preliminary mandatory injunction, filed by the prosecution against said
respondent Judge and Mohammad <span class="SpellE">Ussam</span> <span class="SpellE">Dambong</span>, for the purpose stated at the beginning of this
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">In </span>his answer to the petition herein, respondent Judge reiterated
the views expressed by him during the trial, as well as in the reso­lution and
the order complained of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
Mohammad <span class="SpellE">Ussam</span> <span class="SpellE">Dambong</span>
filed an answer defending the position taken by respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such position is utterly untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Referring particularly to the question whether or not re­spondent
Judge erred in ordering the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Madjid</span> <span class="SpellE">Andi</span> stricken from the records, We note that the
information alleges that defendant Mohammad <span class="SpellE">Ussam</span> <span class="SpellE">Dambong</span> had fired at and killed <span class="SpellE">Maoludani</span>
<span class="SpellE">Habissi</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abdulhadi</span> <span class="SpellE">Maoludani</span>, as well as wounded several other specified
persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Naturally, the evidence for the
prosecution tended to prove that Mohammad <u>had committed</u> these acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, Mohammad was entitled to
establish <u>the contrary</u> - that he did not kill or wound said
persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He, however, <u>went further</u>,
to which he was entitled, by testifying that <u>it was <span class="SpellE">Abdulkadil</span>
<span class="SpellE">Habbisi</span></u> who killed and wounded the persons
above-mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was a <u>new</u>
matter, not covered directly by the evidence for the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that, if, as tes­tified to by its
witnesses, it was Mohammad <span class="SpellE">Ussam</span> <span class="SpellE">Dambong</span>
who caused the deaths and the injuries already adverted to, it would follow
that <span class="SpellE">Abdulkadil</span> <span class="SpellE">Habbisi</span> was
not the author thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution
was entitled, however, <u>as a matter of strict legal right</u>, to introduce
positive evidence to this effect, instead of relying upon a mere inference from
its evidence in chief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it was
to the interest of the trial court, in the discharge of its duty to find the
truth, to receive said rebuttal evidence <span style="">for
</span>the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, a
failure to introduce it <span style="">on<b> </b></span>rebuttal
could have been regarded as a sign of weakness in the evidence for the
prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, too, it would have <span style="">been<b> </b></span>ridiculous for the
prosecution, during the presentation of its evidence in chief, to try to prove
that the crimes charged in the information had <u>not</u> been committed by <span class="SpellE">Abdulkadil</span> <span class="SpellE">Habbisi</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the circumstances, it is obvious that, in directing that
the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Madjid</span> <span class="SpellE">Andi</span>
be stricken from the record and not allowing said witness to identify the
person who commit­ted the crime aforementioned, respondent Judge had committed
a grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Trial courts have ample discretion to determine whether or not
the parties should be allowed to introduce evidence in rebuttal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, its resolutions on these matters
are inter­locutory in nature and will not generally be reviewed, except on
appeal taken from a decision rendered on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judicial discretion, however, is not
unlimited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be exercised
reasonably, with a view to promoting the ends of justice, one of which is to
ascertain the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, whenever
discretion is vested, it must be understood to be a sound one, inasmuch as the
interest of justice, equity and fair play cannot be advanced otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is particularly true with respect to
rules of procedure, especially those governing the admission or exclu­sion of
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of general
practice, it is deemed best to resolve doubts in favor of the admission of the
contested evidence, without prejudice to such action as the court may deem fit
to take in deciding the case on the merits.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
This practice has added importance as regards the evidence for the prosecution
in criminal cases, for, once the accused has been <span class="GramE">acquitted,</span>
there is no means to secure a review by appeal, no matter how erroneous the
action of the lower court may have been.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, <span class="GramE">We</span> have been constrained to suspend the
proceedings in the criminal action involved in the case at bar, to forestall a
possible miscarriage of justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">In issuing a writ of certiorari against a trial Judge who had
rejected, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, certain rebuttal
evidence for the prosecution in a criminal case, We had occasion to point out,
in People<b> </b>v. <span class="SpellE">Montejo</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>,
that:</p>

<blockquote>"Upon a review of the record, we are fully satisfied that the
lower court had, not only erred, but, also, committed a grave abuse of
discretion in issuing the resolutions complained of, in reject­ing the
aforementioned direct and rebuttal evidence<span style=""> </span>for the prosecution, and in not permitting the same to propound
the questions already adverted to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
obvious to us that said direct and rebuttal evidence, as well as the
aforementioned questions, <span class="GramE">are</span> relevant to the issues
involved in Criminal Case No. 672.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although it is not possible to de­termine with precision, at this stage
of the proceed­ings, how far said exhibits may affect the outcome of that case,
it is elemental that all parties therein are entitled to a reasonable
opportunity to establish their respective pretense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection it should be noted that,
in the light of the allegations of the amended information in said case and of
the records before us, the issue of the guilt or inno­cence of the accused
therein is bound to hinge heavily upon the veracity of the opposing witnesses
and the weight attached to their respective testimo­ny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the parties should be allowed <span class="GramE">a certain</span> latitude in the presentation of their evidence,
lest they may be so hampered that the ends of justice may eventually be
defeated or appear to be defeated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The danger
of leading to such result must be avoid­ed, particularly in cases of the
nature, importance and significance of the one under consideration."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We, likewise, called attention to the following view, ex­pressed
in <span class="SpellE">Prats</span> <span style="">&amp;
</span>Co. v. Phoenix Insurance Co.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a> as <span class="GramE">far</span> back as <st1:date year="1929" day="21" month="2">February
 21, 1929</st1:date>:</p>

<blockquote>"In the course of long experience we have observed that
justice is most effectively and expe­ditiously administered in the courts where
trivial objections to the admission of proof are received with least
favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The practice of excluding
evidence on doubtful objections to its materiality or technical objections to
the form of the questions should be avoided.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In a case of any intricacy it is impossible for a judge of first
instance, in the early stages of the development of the proof, to know with any
certainty whether testimony is rele­vant or not; and where there is no
indication of bad faith on the part of the attorney offering the evidence, the
court may as a rule safely accept the testimony upon the statement of the attorney
that the proof offered will be connected later.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, it must be remembered that in the heat of the battle over
which he presides a judge of first instance may possibly fall into error in
judging the relevancy of proof where a fair and logical connection is in fact
shown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When such a mistake is made and
the proof is erroneously ruled out, the Sup­reme Court, upon appeal, often
finds itself em­barrassed and possibly unable to correct the ef­fects of the
error without returning the case for a new trial - a step which this court is
always very loath to take.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other
hand, the admis­sion of proof in a court of first instance, even if the
question as to its form, materiality, or rele­vancy is doubtful, can never
result in much harm to either litigant, because the trial judge is supposed to
know the law; and it is its duty, upon final con­sideration of the case, to
distinguish the relevant and material from the irrelevant and immaterial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this course is followed and the cause is
prose­cuted to the Supreme Court upon appeal, this court then has all the
material before it necessary to make a correct judgment."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">and</span> commented
that:</p>

<blockquote>"There is greater reason to adhere to such policy in criminal
cases where questions arise as to admissibility of evidence for the
prosecution, for the unjustified exclusion of evidence may lead to the
erroneous acquittal of the accused or the dismissal of the charges, from which
the People can no longer appeal."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">as</span> We granted a
similar writ, in People v. Yatco<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a>, against
ano­ther trial court that had ordered the exclusion of an extra-judicial
confession sought to be introduced as part of the evidence for the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order complained of is hereby annulled, and
respondent Judge, accordingly, directed to receive the afore­mentioned
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Madjid</span> <span class="SpellE">Andi</span>,
as well as to allow him to identify the person who caused the deaths and the
injuries involved in the criminal case already adverted to, with the costs of
this instance against respondent Mohammad <span class="SpellE">Ussam</span> <span class="SpellE">Dambong</span>.</p>
