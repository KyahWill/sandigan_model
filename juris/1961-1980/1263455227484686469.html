of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span> finding them, along with <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de Leon, Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Mamuri</span>, <span style="">guilty of </span><span style="">the crime of robbery with homicide and sentencing them to the penalty

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It
appears that on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="26" month="4"><span style="">April 26, </span><span style="">1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, Chua <span class="SpellE">Nai</span><span style=""> Su, was accosted and shot inside a </span>pick-up
truck <span style="">belonging to the Insular-<span class="SpellE">Yebana</span> </span>Tobacco Corporation, shortly <span style="">after the said </span>vehicle <span style="">had left the C</span>ompany<span style=""> warehouse</span> a<span style="">nd crossed </span>the gate of <span style="">its
</span>compound at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Palattao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Apparently</span>
terrified, the driver of <span style="">the pick-up
truck immediately </span>got off the vehicle, ran <span style="">back to the warehouse, </span>and escaped from the <span style="">place un­harmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chinaman Chua <span class="SpellE">Nai</span></span></span>
Su, <span style="">then <span style="">critically wounded, tried </span>to follow his driver; but unlike the
latter, he did not make good his escape - he fell dead </span><span style="">a short</span><span style=""> <span style="">distance from the guard</span>
<span style="">house of </span>the company near <span style="">the gate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And soon afterwards, </span>the perpetrators </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the crime</span><span style=""> <span style="">were seen hurriedly </span>leaving
the place, using in their <span style="">flight the
very same </span>pick-up truck previously ridden </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">Chua <span class="SpellE">Nai</span> Su and his driver.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon some unexpected <span style="">turn </span></span><span style="">of </span><span style="">events, <span style="">the details of which We shall herein discuss
later as We review the evidence, accused </span><span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>

Philippine</span> <span style="">Constabulary at his
place of residence in <span class="SpellE">Minanga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, </span></span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the morning of April 27, 1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">brought to the </span><span style="">PC </span><span style="">headquarters at <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span> at about </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="12"><span style="">noon</span></st1:time><span style=""> time </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the same </span><span style="">day <span style="">where he was questioned </span>about the
incident <span style="">that led to the death of Chua <span class="SpellE">Nai</span> Su.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
statement</span> he <span style="">gave then to </span>the
<span style="">investigating </span>officers led to
the subsequent arrest <span style="">of accused Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> </span>and Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Tattoc</span>
<span style="">in Solano, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>

</span>then admitted <span style="">their respective
participation in the </span>incident that brought <span style="">about the death of Chua <span class="SpellE">Nai</span> Su </span>on April
26, 1960; and <span style="">on the </span></span><span style="">strength </span><span style="">of the extra-judicial confessions they
executed, an Information </span><span style="">for <span style="">Robbery with Homicide was filed against </span></span><span style="">them </span><span style="">on the same day, including accused </span><span style="">Ben </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Paredes</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">and Manuel <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Mamuri</span></span><span style=""> whom </span></span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Concepcion</span></span><span style="">, </span><span style="">de </span><span style="">Leon and <span class="SpellE">Tattoc</span> <span style="">had implicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was </span>docketed <span style="">as Criminal </span>Case No. <span style="">2702.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On

accused </span></span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Protasio</span></span><span style=""> Santos,
Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span>, for the same crime of
Robbery with Homicide of which the other above-named </span><span style="">accused</span><span style=""> had been previously charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was docketed as Criminal Case No. 2718
of the same court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When both Criminal
Cases Nos. 2702 and 2718 were later called for hearing on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="23" month="6"><span style="">June 23,
 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Provincial
Fiscal filed an Amended Information for the purpose of consolidating the two
cases for the reason that the charge in both <span class="SpellE">informations</span>
was identical.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Amended Information </span><span style="">was admitted by the
trial court which allowed the consolidation of the </span><span style="">said </span><span style="">cases to be henceforth known as Criminal Case
No. 2702.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the prosecution </span><span style="">moved </span><span style="">for the discharge of accused Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Tottoc</span> in order to utilize him as state witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition was granted by the court on the
same day, June 23, 1960. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">All the </span><span style="">accused, except
Manuel <span class="SpellE">Mamuri</span> who was then still at large</span><span style="">, </span><span style="">entered pleas of "not guilty" when

later gave himself up to the authorities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Governor Jose <span class="SpellE">Espino</span> of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span> delivered the person of this accused to
Governor <span class="SpellE">Melanio</span> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Singson</span></span><span style=""> of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, who, </span><span style="">on the </span><span style="">same date, </span><span style="">July 14, 1960, turned over the custody of
Manuel <span class="SpellE">Mamuri</span> to the Philippine Constabulary Command
at <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He</span><span style="">, </span><span style="">likewise, pleaded "not guilty" to
the charge when he was</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">later arraigned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On
September 14, 1960, the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>
filed another information charging <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span></span><span style="">
with the same crime of Robbery with Homicide.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was docketed</span><span style=""> as Criminal Case No. 2773.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span></span><span style="">
was </span><span style="">arraigned
on September 22, 1960, where­upon, said accused also entered a plea of
"not guilty".<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Upon </span><span style="">petition of the prosecution and without
objection on the part</span><span style=""> of </span><span style="">counsel for accused
<span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>, Criminal
Cases </span><span style="">Nos. </span><span style="">2702 and 2773 were
tried jointly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same occasion,
counsel for accused </span><span style="">Ruben </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Concep­cion</span></span><span style=""> made manifest
before the court the </span><span style="">desire </span><span style="">of his client </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">withdraw his
previous plea of "not guilty".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said accused then pleaded guilty to the charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was allowed to present evidence to prove
the mitigating cir­cumstances of voluntary surrender and intoxication he
invoked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the afternoon of the same
day, he was accordingly sentenced.<span style="">&nbsp;

gave notice of his appeal, but withdrew the same on <span style="">De</span>cember <span style="">7, </span>1961; and <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de Leon did not
appeal from the decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our own examination of the record revealed the fol­lowing account
of the circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime of which herein
appellants now stand convicted.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="17" month="4">April 17, 1960</st1:date>,
accused Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, a native of Solano, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>, went to the town
of <st1:city><st1:place>San­tiago</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>,
for some personal business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He met there
accused <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de Leon of <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, a good friend he had known since 1957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> broached
out the <span style="">idea that </span>they could <span style="">make </span><span style="">money </span>for themselves by effecting the
hold-up of a wealthy Chinaman, a leaf to­bacco dealer in his hometown of <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ruben did
not readily give assent to <span class="SpellE">Conrado's</span> idea; so, the
former was given <span style="">time </span>by the
latter to think it over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be­fore they
parted, however, <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de Leon suggested that Ruben
<span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> should bring some companions to help them
carry out the hold-up should he finally agree to the aforesaid
proposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not take him long<span style=""> <span class="SpellE">tho</span> to make up <span style="">his mi</span>nd after his return to Solano, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>, for a few days
later, Ruben <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Concepcion</span></span><span style=""> decided to look for his friends in <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span>, taking </span>along with him accused Manuel <span class="SpellE">Mamuri</span> and Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Tottoc</span>, his
cohorts from Solano.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1960</st1:date>,
accused Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, Ma­nuel <span class="SpellE">Mamuri</span>
and Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Tottoc</span> boarded a Rural Transit bus in
Solana, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>,
bound for <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isa­bela</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bus they took made a stop at the town of <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>,
and the trio had their lunch there; there­after, they boarded the <span style="">same </span>bus again and proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
alighted at the <span class="SpellE">Minanga-Minallo</span> junction on the
national highway to the town proper of <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For reasons not clear in the record, the trio
from Solano saw at the junction, waiting<span style="">
in</span> <span style="">a </span>parked
rig, the accused <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de Leon who, upon seeing
them, welcomed the newcom<span style="">ers </span>and brought them along with him to his place of <span style="">re­</span>sidence
in the Barrio of <span class="SpellE">Minanga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> did not
receive his visitors in his own house however; he left them on the side of the
road and brought home some bread he was then carrying; and thereafter, the four
of them hiked to the <span class="SpellE"><u>centro</u></span> of <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span>, arriving at the house of accused Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> near the municipal building at about 6:30 o'clock
in the evening of that day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de Leon in­troduced the trio from Solano to Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> saying "here are the guys".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this, Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>
answered "let us talk later on".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He immediately had the table set first for supper - his dwelling house
being <span style="">a small
res­</span>taurant <span style="">in </span>which <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de Leon, Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Mamuri</span>,
Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Tottoc</span> and the accommodating host ate to­gether.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, Ben <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Paredes</span></span><span style=""> told his</span><span style=""> guests </span><span style="">that they should rest </span>for the night in
the municipal building near­by <span style="">to </span>which
he accompanied <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de Leon and the trio from
Solano after eating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The policeman on
duty allowed the group to sleep in one of the rooms on the second floor of the
municipal building, Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> who had brought them
along, being a former Sergeant of Police of <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once <span style="">upstairs, Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>, </span><span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de Leon and Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
had a conference about their plan to rob the rich Chinaman while Manuel <span class="SpellE">Mamuri</span> and Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Tottoc</span> were
lying on the <span style="">mat
</span>on the floor nearby listen­ing to them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They finally agreed to go to <span style="">Barrio <span class="SpellE">Pala<span style="">­ttao</span></span></span>
on the following morning to view and <span style="">familiarize themselves with the location </span><span style="">of the warehouse of the </span><span style="">In</span>sular-<span class="SpellE">Yebana</span>
Tobacco Corporation where the wealthy toba­cco <span style="">leaf </span>dealer, Chinaman Chua <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Nai</span></span><span style=""> </span>Su, held
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>
returned to his house nearby that evening while the trio from Solano, together
with <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de Leon, stayed and slept overnight <span style="">in </span>the <span style="">municipal </span><span style="">building.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Very early the following

brought back the trio from Solano to the house of Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>
where they had their breakfast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as

before in the munici­pal building, Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>, <span class="SpellE">Corrado</span> de Leon, Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concep­<span style="">cion</span></span></span><span style=""> and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Mamuri</span>
left for <span class="SpellE">Palattao</span> immediately after eating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before reaching </span><span style="">the place of </span><span style="">the warehouse of the Insular-<span class="SpellE">Yebana</span> Tobacco
Corporation, however, the foursome made a short stop at a "<span class="SpellE">kiosko</span>" near the junc­tion of the national highway and
an old road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ruben <span class="SpellE">Con­cepcion</span>
and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Mamuri</span> were left there for <span style="">a </span>while by Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de Leon </span><span style="">who </span><span style="">passed </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">the house of accused <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> some thirty meters away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">When
they returned, they had with them </span><span style="">an old man, <span class="SpellE">Pas­cual</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Ben
</span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Paredes</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">introduced
Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> and Manuel </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Mamuri</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">to
the old man </span><span style="">at the "<span class="SpellE">kiosko</span>", refer­ring to them <span style="">as </span></span><span style="">the
"persons </span><span style="">called</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">by </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Conrado</span></span><span style=""> de Leon".<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The old man was pleased to <span style="">see </span>the "<span class="SpellE">hatchetmen</span>"
brought by <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de Leon to liquidate the Chinaman
whom accused <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>
referred to as a "boastful and arro­gant" man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> then promised to give them <span style="">a </span>reward of P500.00 provided they
would kill the China­man, and if they could not rob any amount from him, they
would receive P1,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Scarcely after
the old man had given the aforesaid inducement, the Chinaman Chua <span class="SpellE">Nai</span> Su passed by in the pick-up of the Insular-<span class="SpellE">Yebana</span> Tobacco Corporation, heading towards the place where
the company warehouse was located; so the group hurriedly went to the house of
the old man where other matters relative to the robbery were taken up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> reiterated his promise to make good his
commitment to the group.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the old
man left ahead for the town, leaving word that they shall meet again in the
Office of the Justice of the Peace.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> hitched <span style="">a </span>ride
from an overloaded passenger bus that passed by the place, telling his
companions to follow him to the appointed place of the ware horse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de Leon,
Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Mamuri</span>
hiked on the national highway until they reached the gate of the compound of
the Insular-<span class="SpellE">Yebana</span> Tobacco Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Mamuri</span> viewed the place from under the
shade of a big acacia tree out­side the fence of the company, while Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> walked to and fro on the national highway passing
twice in front of the compound of the warehouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After sometime, the group returned to <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span> in the restaurant of Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>.</p>

found Chief <span style="">of Police <span class="SpellE">Protasio</span> </span>Santos waiting for them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter informed them that the Justice of

Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>

</span><span class="SpellE">Protasio</span> Santos gave his nickel-plated

and Aurelio <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Tottoc</span></span><span style=""> </span>to the back of the house, where he
gave the black revolver of Ben <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Paredes</span></span><span style=""> </span>to

</span><span class="SpellE">Tottoc</span> for them to use in the hold-up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Then
Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, Manuel </span><span class="SpellE">Mamuri</span>
and <span style="">Aurelio </span><span class="SpellE">Tottoc</span>
boarded a bus to <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Palattao</span></span><span style=""> </span>which they reach­ed before <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They alighted in front of the big acacia <span style="">tree about 20 meters </span>from the gate of the ware<span style="">house </span><span style="">which they had viewed earlier that same
morning and </span>waited for the Chinaman <span style="">Chua <span class="SpellE">Nai</span> </span>Su to <span style="">come </span>out of the warehouse where he had his office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As expected, the trio from Solano <span style="">saw </span>Chua <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Nai</span></span><span style=""> </span>Su board the company pick-up which was then parked in front of
the warehouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon the vehicle moved <span style="">backwards </span>and out of the <span style="">gate </span>of the fence, turning towards the
south on the road to <span class="SpellE">C<span style="">auayan</span></span><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">I<span style="">sabela</span></span></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this precise time, Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> rushed forward and caught up with the vehicle at
a point about four meters from the gate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He stepped on the running board on the right side of the pick-up;
simultaneously, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Mamuri</span> dashed towards the left
side of the vehicle, while Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Tottoc</span> posted
himself behind the rear of the <span style="">pick-up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
then poked his revolver on the Chinaman <span style="">inside
the pick-up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Chua </span></span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Nai</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">Su tried to parry off the gun held by Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, but the latter fired at him twice in
succession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently </span>terrified,
the driver of the pick-up got off the vehicle on the left side and ran towards
the warehouse; he es­caped unharmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
<span style="">Chinaman tried </span>to follow suit by
moving to the left door of the pick-up where the driver got off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>,
however, also moved over to other side of the vehicle ad met Chua <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Nai</span></span><span style=""> Su </span>there after firing one shot in the
air.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chinaman pushed Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> aside and ran towards the gate, but the latter
fired another shot at the running Chua <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Nai</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">Su
</span>who full dead before teaching the company guardhouse near the gate of
the compound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then and there, Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> ordered Manuel <span class="SpellE">Mamuri</span>
to take the wheel of the pick-­up which the latter drove <span style="">away </span>towards
<span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ilagan</span></span><span style=""> </span>with Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>,
occupying the <span style="">seat </span>formerly had
by the China­man, and Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Tottoc</span> seated just
behind Manuel <span class="SpellE">Mamuri</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon reaching <span style="">a </span>small
concrete bridge within the terri­torial jurisdiction of <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span>,
Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> or­dered Manuel <span class="SpellE">Mamuri</span>
to swerve the pick-up to the right into a nearby ravine with bushes, and the
vehicle came to <span style="">a </span>halt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Forthwith the trio ransacked the seat of the
pick-up and found the portfolio of the Chinaman which they took away with them
passing thru the fields.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At a place
where there was a thick growth of cogon grass, they counted the money inside
the portfolio and found that it contained P400.00 in different denomina­tions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
took the money and told Manuel <span class="SpellE">Mamuri</span> and <span style="">Aurelio </span><span class="SpellE">Tottoc</span> to go ahead to the house of Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>
where he met them later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had to <span style="">pass </span>by <span style="">a </span>river to wash out the stains of blood
on his clothes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>
was not in his house when the trio came, so Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>,
Manuel <span class="SpellE">Mamuri</span> and Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Tottoc</span>
had to tarry <span style="">a
</span>while and wait for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
already <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 p.m.</st1:time> when Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> and <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de Leon
showed up, followed by the Chief of Police <span class="SpellE">Protasio</span>
Santos still <span style="">a
</span>little <span style="">later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The latter immediately ordered the <span style="">trio </span>to
change their clothes which Ruben, Manuel and <span style="">Aurelio followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Tottoc</span>
placed the nickel-plated gun he carried </span><span style="">on the floor under a pillow which, Ruben <span class="SpellE">Con­cepcion</span>
</span>picked and returned to Chief of Police <span class="SpellE">Protasio</span>
<span style="">Santos.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, on </span>the other hand, <span style="">returned the black
revolver he used in shooting the Chinaman to Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
brought out </span>the P400.00 they found inside the portfolio of Chua <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Nai</span></span><span style=""> Su </span>and gave
P200.00 to Ben <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Paredes</span></span><span style=""> who gave P50.00 to <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
de Leon as his share </span>in the booty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Protasio</span></span><span style=""> Santos refused to get the remaining </span><span style="">amount of the P200.00 when Ben <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Paredes</span></span><span style=""> offered it </span>to him, saying "I am go­<span style="">ing to investigate if that was really the amount they </span></span>got."

also reported the incident to the PC Com­mand at <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span>,
<span style="">same </span>province,
and Capt. <span class="SpellE">Fonacier</span> and Capt. <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>
appeared at the scene of the crime that same afternoon and conducted their own
investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were followed still <span style="">later </span>on by Capt. <span class="SpellE">Achanzar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These PC officers were informed by the
employees of the Insular-<span class="SpellE">Yebana</span> Tobacco Corporation
that the triggerman wore <span style="">a </span>slight brown checkered polo shirt with long sleeves, upon
which information, Captains <span class="SpellE">Fonacier</span> and <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span> left the place to look for the robbers-killers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly, thereafter, Chief of Police <span class="SpellE">Protasio</span> Santos also left the place, taking along with him
to the municipal building, <span class="SpellE">Hermenegildo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabucan</span>, the driver of the pick-­up ridden by the victim at
the time of the robbery, and a carpenter of the company, Andrea Domingo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day, the body of the victim, Chua
<span class="SpellE"><span style="">Nai</span></span><span style=""> </span>Su, was autopsied at the very scene
of the crime by the Assistant Provin­cial Health Officer of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He found in the body of the Chinaman <span style="">a </span>gunshot
wound about one centimeter in dia­meter, directed downward from the point of
entry about three inches from thee right nipple, fracturing the 8th rib and
damaging the liver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The slug was
recovered bet­ween the skin and the soft tissue at the left back near the angle
of the left <span style="">costal </span>arch where a
dark swollen area was noted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another
gunshot wound was found to have penetrated the right forearm of the victim
through and through.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctor
testified that the cause of death was internal hemorrhage due to the
involvement of some vital organs of the body.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the scene of the crime, Captain <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>
went to <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span> to look for the robbers, with only

shirt which he figured answered the description given by employees of the
Insular-<span class="SpellE">Yebana</span> Tobacco Corpo­ration; and with the
suspicion that he might be the triggerman, he picked him up for
questioning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Hilario</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tomines</span> denied any knowledge about the robbery when
he was brought and questioned by Capt. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Manalo</span></span><span style=""> </span>in the house of Ernesto Yap in <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He recounted, however, that he saw a man who
rode on the <span style="">same </span>bus that he
took from <span class="SpellE">Reina</span> Mercedes to <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span>
in the afternoon of April 25, 1960, wearing a checkered polo shirt similar i<span style="">n appearance to the one he was wea</span><span style="">r</span><span style="">ing;

the<span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Minanga-Minallo</span>
junction on the national highway in <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span> where
he also alighted; that he saw this man and his companions talked for sometime
with <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de Leon, after which he saw them leave
the place together going to <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span>; and that he
saw the same man early in the morning of April 26, 1960, walking on the road
going to <span class="SpellE">Palattao</span> with Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With this new information as a lead, Capt. <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span> left the place to report the matter to Capt. <span class="SpellE">Achanzar</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Santos (Chief of Police) interrogating <span class="SpellE">Cabucan</span>, the
driver of the pick-up where the Chinaman was shot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon seeing the PC Captain, Andres Domingo,
the other man picked up by the Chief of Police at the scene of the crime for
questioning, approached him (Captain <span class="SpellE">Achanzar</span>) and
complained that Chief of Police <span class="SpellE">Protasio</span> Santos had
been trying to force them into admitting that the killing of Chua <span class="SpellE">Nai</span> Su was an inside job; and that Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>
had shrugged his shoulders advising them to admit the fact that they were the
authors of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>S</span><span style="">o much </span><span style="">s</span><span style="">o,

Santos, he noticed that Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> had
surreptitiously left the investigation room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He immediately followed Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> down the
municipal building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But just then, Capt.
<span class="SpellE">Manalo</span> appeared and informed Capt. <span class="SpellE">Achanzar</span> about the information given by <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span>

<span class="SpellE">Cabucan</span> and Andres Domingo that if they could not
admit their involvement in the commission of the crime, he would release them
and be amenable if they could state in their affidavits that they did not
recognize the perpetrators of the crime and could not identify them even if
they should see them again; </span><span style="">and
that they did not hear any gun reports.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To this, the two employees of the Insular-<span class="SpellE">Yebana</span>

about a week before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Capt. <span class="SpellE">Achanzar</span>, however, decided to stay for about 20 mi­nutes
hoeing that <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de Leon might return to the house
that evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Capt. <span class="SpellE">Achanzar</span>
was not mistaken in his expectation, for shortly thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de Leon showed up with a bag in each hand, one made
of <span class="SpellE">buri</span> and the other made of canvas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the answers given by <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
de Leon to the questions propounded by Capt. <span class="SpellE">Achanzar</span>
then and there, the latter suspected that the wife had lied to him with a
desire to mislead the authorities <span style="">as </span>to
the where­abouts of her husband; so, Capt. <span class="SpellE">Achanzar</span>
decided to search the bags <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de Leon had then
which yielded men's <span class="SpellE">clothings</span>, one of which was <span style="">a </span>checkered light brown polo shirt
with long sleeves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as the appearance
of the polo short coincided with the description of the one worn by the person
seen with <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de Leon in the afternoon of April
25, 1960, as described by <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Hilario</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Tomines</span> </span>and <span style="">also
</span>with the color of the shirt worn by the triggerman at the time of the
robbery as described by eyewitnesses to the killing of <span style="">the </span>Chinaman, Capt. <span class="SpellE">Achanzar</span> took <span style="">special in­</span>terest in the said polo
shirt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">His suspicion </span>was <span style="">further </span>aroused by the fact that as
against the <span style="">claim </span>of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Conrado</span></span><span style=""> de Leon that the <span class="SpellE">clothings</span>
in the canvas bag belonged to him, Sgt. Bruno who <span style="">was </span>then with Capt. <span class="SpellE">Achanzar</span> found out
that the shirts and pants were of different sizes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These circumstances prompted Capt. <span class="SpellE">Achanzar</span> to seize the check­ered polo shirt with long
sleeves with the promise to re­turn the same later, and for which he caused <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de Leon to sign a receipt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the seized </span>polo shirt in the following morning of <st1:date year="1960" day="27" month="4"><span style="">April 27, </span>1960</st1:date>,
the captain <span style="">discovered </span>that the

11:00 o'clock; and that he never left his restaurant also in the afternoon of

after taking<span style=""> </span>him to </span><span style="">a place</span><span style=""> between <span style="">the buildings</span> at the PC barracks.<span style="">&nbsp;

a battery box which they connected to his ears</span> and<span style=""> his <span style="">private
parts; that they </span>gave his additional maltreatment by pouring water into

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For his defense, accused <span class="SpellE"><u>Protasio</u></span> <u>Santos</u> adduced evi­dence and tried </span><span style="">to prove that in </span><span style="">the morning </span><span style="">of April </span><span style="">26, </span><span style="">1960, he was in his
office </span><span style="">in
the municipal building of </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Naguilian</span></span><span style="">; that between </span><span style="">the hours of </span>8:00

Ramirez who had allegedly threatened the wife of Juan <span class="SpellE">Bumanlag</span>;

that day; that he never </span><span style="">met with accused Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>
that morning; that upon receipt of </span><span style="">the news </span><span style="">about the robbery-killing in <span class="SpellE">Palattao</span>, he took along Pat</span><span style="">rolman <span class="SpellE">Cauilan</span> and </span><span style="">repaired to the

after </span></span><span style="">conducting his own investigation of the case in the pre</span><span style="">mises of </span><span style="">the Insular-<span class="SpellE">Yebana</span>
Tobacco Corporation, </span>he <span style="">brought </span>the
d<span style="">river </span><span style="">of the Chinaman, <span class="SpellE">Hermenegildo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cabucan</span> </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">carpenter

of the Insular-<span class="SpellE">Yebana</span> Tobacco Corpora­tion whose
statements were taken that same afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He recalled that in the afternoon of April 27, 1960, he received
information that the pick-up belonging to the said </span><span style="">company which was allegedly used by the
robbers in their flight from the place of the robbery had been found near a
bridge in one of the outer barrios of the town, upon which information he
immediately went to the place indi­cated to investigate; and that he rendered
thereafter a "spot report" of his findings to the PC Command in <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claimed
further that on May 15, 1960, Capt. <span class="SpellE">Achanzar</span> had gone
to his house and induced him, either to surrender the revolver that </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">used in the
commission of the crime or to get any other firearm and put it near the
vicinity of the house of accused Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> so that
it will be </span><span style="">used as evidence against the latter.<span style="">&nbsp;

proposition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> in the same morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admitted <span class="SpellE">tho</span>
that he had been investigated several times by the PC officers in connection
with the robbery, first by Sgt. Santos and later by Capt. <span class="SpellE">Achanzar</span>;
but these investigations according to him, amounted to nothing because he
really knew nothing about the killing of Chua <span class="SpellE">Nai</span>
Su.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified that when CIS Agent <span class="SpellE">Aslarona</span> picked him up still later on, said offi</span><span style="">cial even took him
in his jeep all along the road from </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Palattao</span></span><span style=""> to San Mariano and stopped at various sheds on the way, conducting an
"off and on" investigation of him, be­fore he was finally brought to
the Office of the Provincial Warden at <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He alleged further that it was while he </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">in the said office
that the CIS agent ordered him to sit down on a chair, after which he called
for Ruben <span class="SpellE">Con­cepcion</span> and instructed the latter to
point at him; that it was at that precise moment that another PC soldier took
their pictures (Exhibits X, X-1, X-2 and X-3); and that it was also on that
occasion that he saw Agent <span class="SpellE">Aslarona</span> draw a prepared
document from his portfolio which he later asked Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
to sign.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From our own examination
of the evidence of record as above set forth, We find that the perpetration of
the crime at bar is beyond dispute.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Persuasive are the plea of guilty of accused Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>,
by accused Manuel <span class="SpellE">Ma­muri's</span> subsequent withdrawal of
his appeal, and by the implied admission of guilt of accused <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de Leon who did not appeal from the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only question, there­fore, for this Court
to determine is whether or not herein appellants Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Protasio</span> Santos and <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> had any hand in the commission of the crime
of which they now stand convicted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellants
contend that the court below had fallen in­to error in giving credence to the
testimonies of witnesses for the prosecution; specifically, they assail the
reliance placed by the trial court upon the declarations of state </span><span style="">witness Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Tottoc</span>
and accused Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> who testified for the
prosecution after his plea of guilty to the charge, claiming, that these
witnesses, being original parties to the crime, are "polluted
sources" of evidence; and their testimonies should have been subject to
grave suspicion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We
do not find any merit in this claim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There should be no disagreement that the testimony of an accomplice

a bus with accused Ma­nuel <span class="SpellE">Mamuri</span> in Santiago, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, bound for the town of <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span>,
said province; that upon reaching <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span>, they
alighted at the <span class="SpellE">Minanga-Minallo</span> junction to meet ac­cused
<span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de Leon; and that after greeting each other,
accused Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> inquired from de Leon where
they could have the guns to be used in the robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These de­clarations were substantially

de Leon, "Could we get this?", which question</span><span style=""> of Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">accompanied by the

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Concepcion</span></span><span style=""> and <span class="SpellE">Tottoc</span>

also overheard <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>
make<span style=""> </span>assurance "that he
would comply with his promise" before they left for the house of <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> near the said <span class="SpellE">kiosko</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to
Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> reiterated his promise to give them the reward
should they be able to rob and kill the Chinaman, after which he changed his
clothes and told them that he would go ahead to the town and meet them <span style="">later </span>in the
office of the Just­ice of the Peace.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This testimony of Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> was corroborated
by witness <span style="">Alberto
Ibarra </span>who testified that in the morning of April 26, 1960, on his <span style="">way </span>to the house of <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> on some
personal business, he met Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> in the
vicinity; <span style="">that
the latter asked </span>him then where he was going, and upon his answer that
he wanted to <span style="">see </span><span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>, Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> remarked that he had <span style="">been </span>there for quite a long time but had not seen the old man;
that he decided to go into the house despite the in­formation given by Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>, and contrary to the insi­nuation given by the
latter, <span style="">he </span>found
<span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> on the
ground floor of the house conversing with <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de
Leon, Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Mamuri</span>;
that he did not stay long with them and left as soon as <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
<span class="SpellE">Barto­lome</span> informed him that he could not as yet
return <span style="">the </span>gaso­line he had
borrowed; and that from there he <span style="">passed </span>by the store under the same house to
buy cigarettes, where he heard <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> advise <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span style="">de Leon </span>to
finish his coffee and proceed to the warehouse of the Chinaman with the
assurance that "the P500.00 <span style="">he had promised shall be ready anytime".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said meeting in <span class="SpellE">Palattao</span>
was also confirmed by the testimony of accused Manuel <span class="SpellE">Mamuri</span>
who declared that he went to <span class="SpellE">Palattao</span> with Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> </span>and "another man" that morning
of <st1:date year="1960" day="26" month="4"><span style="">April 26, </span>1960</st1:date>, and <span style="">there Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> talked with <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> for about twenty minutes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Ruben
<span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> testified that </span>from <span style="">the house </span>of
<span class="SpellE">Pas­cual</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>, <span style="">they went to the </span>place
where the warehouse of <span style="">the Insular-<span class="SpellE">Yebana</span> Tobacco Corporation is </span>situated
in <span class="SpellE">Palattao</span> for the purpose of familiarizing
themselves with <span style="">the compound and determine the various points at which each </span>of
them would post himself <span style="">during </span>the robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
testi­<span style="">mony on
this point was corroborated by witness <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> <span class="SpellE">Tomines</span> </span>who declared that he saw Ben <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Paredes</span></span><span style=""> </span>with Ruben <span class="SpellE">Con<span style="">cepcion</span></span><span style=""> and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Mamuri</span>
near the <span class="SpellE">kiosko</span> in <span class="SpellE">Palattao</span>
in </span><span style="">the morning of April </span><span style="">26, 1960, walking </span><span style="">towards the direction </span>of the Insular-<span class="SpellE">Yebana</span> Tobacco Corporation; that as the <span style="">pass</span>enger bus he was riding then
passed by the said <span class="SpellE">kiosko</span>, Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>
managed to get a ride on the running board of the overloaded bus; and that as
the bus left, Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> told <span style="">his </span>companions
"to follow him".</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
testified further that immediately after their survey of the premises of the
warehouse in <span class="SpellE">Pala­ttao</span>, they all returned to <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span> to the house of Ben <span class="SpellE">Pa<span style="">redes</span></span></span><span style="">; </span><span style="">that they found there Chief of Police <span class="SpellE">Protasio</span> Santos who informed them that the Justice of the
Peace was calling for them; </span><span style="">that
</span><span style="">they followed the Chief of
Police to the mu­</span><span style="">nicipal </span><span style="">building where
they met with Justice of the </span><span style="">Peace Domingo </span><span style="">Garcia, Mayor <span class="SpellE">Serafin</span> Garcia and the old man </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pascual</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>; that these </span><span style="">officials, including Chief of Police <span class="SpellE">Protasio</span>
Santos, gave them further inducement to commit the </span>robbery with their
promise that they would have the land occupied by the warehouse of the Chinaman
and divide the proceeds among themselves after they shall have robbed and
killed the <span style="">said
</span>Chinaman; and that they all promised them immunity with the assurance
that nothing shall be done to them, for any way, they should be the very
officials who <span style="">should
investigate </span>the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">is </span>partly
corroborated <span style="">by
the </span>testimony of accused Manuel <span class="SpellE">Mamuri</span> who, in
spite of his attempt to exculpate himself from any liability for the crime
during the trial, admitted that upon their return to the <span class="SpellE"><u>centro</u></span>
of <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span> from <span class="SpellE">Palattao</span>,
Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> went to the municipal building; that
shortly after Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> had gone up the
building, he also noticed the arrival of the Mayor and the Justice of the
Peace; and that Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> stayed inside the
municipal building for about half an hour.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Tottoc</span> and Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> were
unanimous in their testimonies that the guns used in the robbery </span><span style="">were </span><span style="">supplied by <span class="SpellE">Protasio</span>
Santos and Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> in the house of the latter
shortly before they returned to <span class="SpellE">Palattao</span> that </span><span style="">same </span><span style="">morning </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">effect the hold-up of
Chinaman Chua <span class="SpellE">Nai</span> Su; that the same weapons were
returned to them immediately </span>upon their return to the house of Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> after the commission of the robbery; that half of
the P400.00 they found inside the portfolio of the victim went to Ben <span class="SpellE">Pare­des</span> and <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de Leon,
however, Chief of Police <span class="SpellE">Prota­sio</span> Santos refusing to
receive his share thereof because <span style="">he
would not believe that the sum</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">of
P400.00 was</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">the only amount they got</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">from the hold-up, and for which reason he
told Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> to hold the share pertaining to them
first until he shall have conducted his own investigation of the case; and that
</span><span style="">it was </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Protasio</span></span><span style=""> Santos who advised them to change their clothes before their flight to
<span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span> that same afternoon, advising them to return
to <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span> some other day or the reward of P500.00
promise by <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bartolome</span></span><span style="">, with the assurance that he would "take
care" of its collection.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Both Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Tottoc</span> and Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> were
also agreed in their declarations before the court that they left the house of
Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> in <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span>
bound for <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span> at about</span> 3:00 o'clock in the
afternoon of that day, April 26, 1960, along <span style="">with Manuel <span class="SpellE">Mamuri</span>, <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
de Leon and Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>; and that they ate together
in a restaurant upon reaching </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ilagan</span></span><span style="">, </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Isabela</span></span><span style=""> where they parted ways, their group taking a
bus bound for their hometown of Solano, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Viscaya</span>, while Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> and <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de Leon returned to <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was partly corroborated by the testimony
of accused Manuel <span class="SpellE">Mamuri</span> who admitted that Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Tottoc</span> and he
fled from <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span> in the afternoon of the day they
committed the robbery-hold-up of Chinaman Chua <span class="SpellE">Nai</span>
Su, accompanied by <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de Leon and "another </span>person"
who boarded the same bus with them up to <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span> where
they separated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All these affirmations
in court, in<span style="">deed, </span>constitute a
great avalanche of evidence against herein appellants, and militate against
their claim that the testimonies of state witness Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Tottoc</span>
and accused Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> who pleaded guilty to
the charge are incredible, simply because they took part in the commission of
the robbery in question.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellants <span class="SpellE">Protasio</span> Santos and <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>, however, would try to make capital of the
circumstance that they were charged in court for the same offense imputed to
the other </span><span style="">accused much later than the rest, pointing out, that </span><span style="">while </span><span style="">the Information against <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
</span><span style="">de Loon, Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Tottoc</span>, Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Mamuri</span> was
filed on April 29, 1960, the separate <span class="SpellE">Informations</span>
against them (<span class="SpellE">Protasio</span> Santos and <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>) for the same offense were filed only on
June 9 and September 14, 1960, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, they claim that the impu­tation of the crime against them was but
an attempt on the part of accused Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> to
drag them into the quagmire he </span><span style="">was
</span><span style="">already in, after the failure of
the lat­ter to extort money from them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We are not impressed with this argument either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants <span class="SpellE">Protasio</span>
Santos and <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>
had tried hard </span><span style="">to prove </span><span style="">during the trial
that accused Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> had tried to extort
money from them but did not succeed in their attempt for, on the contrary, the
evidence tends to show that they were the ones who tried </span><span style="">their best </span><span style="">to be good to the </span><span style="">said accused, </span>giving rice and
provisions to his family even after Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
had changed his plea from "not <span style="">guilty"
</span>to <span style="">"guilty", apparently,
in</span> their hope that he would somehow try to <span class="SpellE">exhonerate</span>
them from any liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And above all,
the evidence is clear that they were not in­cluded in the original Information
for the simple rea­<span style="">son that </span>when
the same was filed on <st1:date year="1960" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1960</st1:date>,
the prosecution did not as yet have the necessary evidence against them to
warrant their inclusion in the <span style="">said </span>Infor­mation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But said appellants point
out the fact that when ac­</span>cused <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de
Leon, Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> and Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Tottoc</span> <span style="">executed
their </span>extra-judicial confessions on the same date, April <span style="">29, 1960 (three days after </span>the
commission of <span style="">the robbery), said
accused made </span>no mention whatsoever of <span style="">their participation in the perpetration of the robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A­gain, We have to declare that this is not
entirely <span style="">correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span></span><span style="">For </span><span style="">it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">significant to note </span>that
in the extra-judicial confession (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. M) executed by
accused <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de Leon <span style="">on the said date, it was already revealed that the guns to be used in
the robbery would be borrowed from herein appellant <span class="SpellE">Protasio</span>
Santos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be </span>that as it may,
however, the <span style="">fact still remains that </span>during
the continuation of <span style="">the pre­liminary
investigation </span>of the case <span style="">by the
Assistant Pro­</span>vincial Fiscal on May 12, 1960, accused Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, without being asked, decided <span style="">to m</span><span style="">ake a clean </span>breast of it all and
revealed the participation of Chief of Police <span class="SpellE">Pro­tasio</span>
Santos and "an old man" in the perpetration of the robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statement he gave then (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. L), became the <span style="">basis
of the separate Information filed against him on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="9" month="6">June 9, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As against appellant <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>, he was not included in the two <span class="SpellE">Informations</span> already mentioned <span style="">because </span>it <span style="">was </span>only
after the surrender of accused Manuel <span class="SpellE">Mamuri</span> on <st1:date year="1960" day="14" month="7">July 14, 1960</st1:date>, that the said accused
described the role played by herein appellant <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> in his <span style="">extra-</span>judicial confession (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. DD)
which he reaffirm­ed <span style="">later </span><span style="">in </span>another statement (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span style="">JJ) he
executed on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="18" month="7"><span style="">July 18, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, before another </span>investigator sent
over to <span style="">the place by higher
authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To top it all, when the </span>said
investigator brought herein appellant <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Barto­lome</span> to the office of the Provincial Warden in <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span> on <st1:date year="1960" day="28" month="7">July 28,
 1960</st1:date>, for <span class="SpellE">confrontration</span> with <span style="">accused Ruben <span class="SpellE">Con­cepcion</span>,
the latter readily pointed to him as the "old </span>man" referred to
by him in his previous statement (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. L) <span style="">he executed on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="12" month="5"><span style="">May 12, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">; and even as the investigator </span>took
down another statement (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span style="">FF) </span>of Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> on that occasion
wherein the said accused narrated all the participation of herein appellant <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pascual</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> in his very
presence, the latter did not say anything.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This circumstances explained further </span><span style="">the reason why the Infor­</span><span style="">mation against herein appellant <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> was filed much
later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Tottoc</span> and Ruben </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Concepcion</span></span><span style=""> explained during the trial why no mention
abou</span><span style="">t</span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Protasio</span> Santos
and <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>
appears in their extra-judicial confessions - one explaining that he did not</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">mention
the name of <span class="SpellE">Protasio</span> Santos because </span><span style="">he </span><span style="">was not asked by the investigator about it, and the other expressing surprise
why nothing appears in his statement about their participation in spite of the
fact that </span><span style="">he </span><span style="">allegedly mention</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">them
during the said investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
expla­nations </span><span style="">may </span><span style="">not sound convincing
enough, but after </span><span style="">examin</span><span style="">ing their
straightforward declarations in court about the participation of <span class="SpellE">Protasio</span> Santos and <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> in the perpetration of the robbery, We are more
than convinced in the </span><span style="">credibility of their assertions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, it may </span><span style="">reasonably
be presumed that said accused deliberately concealed the part played by said
appellants in the robbery; and the reason behind such attempt is not difficult
to ex­plain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">From </span><span style="">the facts and circumstances proven at the trial, We may conclude that <span class="SpellE">Tottoc</span> and <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> had done so
under the belief that even after their arrest, the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span> and the other municipal officials of the town who
had previously promised them immunity, would come to their aid, and <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> who had
promised monetary reward would make good his commitment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They must have realized later, however, after
the case against them was filed in the Court of First Instance of the province,
that the protection and reward promised by herein appellants were not
forthcoming, that is why they soon made up their minds to reveal everything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> pleads further
that he had been denied his constitutional right to confront and cross-examine
the witnesses against him during the pro­ceeding in the court below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He anchors </span><span style="">his claim </span><span style="">upon the circumstance that three witnesses for the prosecution tes­tified
long before his arrest and subsequent indictment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no merit in this claim, however, for
after examin­ing the testimonies of the witnesses referred to, We found nothing
in their declarations which touched upon his par­ticipation in the robbery; and
while it is true that he was convicted by the trial court, the said conviction
was based upon facts established by other evidence of record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to say, in this connection, that
the great weight of the evidence tends to show that he was in fact a prime
mover in the commission of the robbery with homicide, for it had been
conclusively proven that he had the great­est motive for its commission which
must have been engend­ered by the resentment he harbored against the Chinaman
who filed against him and his son, the two criminal com­plaints (for grave
coercion and malicious mischief) then pending trial in the Justice of the Peace
Court of <span class="SpellE">Nagui­lian</span> at the time of the </span><span style="">robbery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Conspiracy among the
accused in this case, including herein appellants, has been proven conclusively
by </span><span style="">the
evidence </span><span style="">of record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The guilt of Ruben <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Con­rado</span> de Leon and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Mamuri</span>
appears indubitable; and </span><span style="">the fact that they effected the </span><span style="">hold-up and killing of Chinaman Chua <span class="SpellE">Nai</span> Su in pursuance of that conspiracy, has been shown and
demonstrated by the evidence beyond per adventure of doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, therefore, of n</span><span style="">o </span><span style="">moment that herein appellants did not participate </span>in <span style="">the actual </span>com<span style="">mission </span>of the robbery, <span style="">for
once </span>conspiracy is shown, the act of one is the act of all.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Having arrived </span><span style="">at the foregoing</span><span style=""> conclusions, We do not find it necessary to
discuss the individual merits of the alibis proffered by herein
appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bearing in mind the inherent
weakness of alibi as a defense,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and considering, too, the existence of the
extra-judicial con­fessions of the other accused, which on their faces and </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">corroborated by other evidence bespeak the true sequence of events, as
a circumstance in passing upon the credibi­lity of the witnesses for the
prosecution, </span><span style="">We </span><span style="">find no co­gent reason to disturb the finding
of </span><span style="">the
lower court that herein appellants are </span><span style="">guilty of the crime of which they now </span><span style="">stand convicted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It
</span><span style="">has been shown </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">appellant <span class="SpellE">Protasio</span>
Santos is </span><span style="">a public officer, but </span>it does not appear that he had taken
advantage of his official functions in the commission of the robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evident else shows that there was an
offer of a reward by appellant <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>, and a promise by appellant Santos, but the
evidence is not con­clusive that herein appellant Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>
had participated in the commission of the robbery by reason of such <span style="">reward or promise,
it appearing that even before the other </span><span style="">acc</span><span style="">used </span>met with <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> and the other municipal officials of the
town who made the promise, the other ac­<span style="">cused were already decided in </span>the commission
of <span style="">the rob­bery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No doubt, </span>the reward and the promise
aforementioned <span style="">must have given </span>the other accused, including appellant Ben <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>, further inducement in the commission of the rob­<span style="">bery, however, in </span>our
opinion, for <span style="">this
aggravating cir­cumstance to be considered against </span>the person induced,
the said inducement must be the primary consideration in the commission of a
crime or felony.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
