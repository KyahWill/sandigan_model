<blockquote>"On June 23, 1964 Robert O. Phillips and Sons Inc., and Robert
O. Phillips himself and his wife, entered into an agreement with the Perez <span class="SpellE">Rubios</span> deferring payment of the April 30, 1964 installment
already overdue to August 31, 1964 under the following conditions:</blockquote>

<p class="3Q">(a) The deferred installment would bear an interest of eight (8%)
per cent per annum from April 30, 1964 although partial payments on the
principal and on the interest due may be paid <u>during the period</u> granted,
in such amounts and at such times as funds as available to Robert O. Phillips
&amp; Sons, Inc.;</p>

<p class="3Q">(b) Should Robert O. Phillips &amp; Sons, Inc. fail to pay the
particular install­ment now due on <st1:date month="8" day="31" year="1964">August
 31, 1964</st1:date> or any of the subsequent installments on the exact date
due, the whole obligation would be­come immediately demandable without notice;</p>

<p class="3Q">(c) In consideration of this extension granted to Robert O.
Phillips &amp; Sons, Inc., Robert O. Phillips himself and his wife, Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Ysmael</span> Phillips, jointly and severally guaranteed all the
installments and other obligations of Robert O. Phillips and Sons, Inc., under
the original contract of sale dated <st1:date month="4" day="13" year="1963">April
 13, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<blockquote>"In the meantime, Robert O. Phillips, in his behalf and in
that of his wife and Robert O. Phillips and Sons Inc., entered into
negotiations for the sale of their shares of stock in Hacienda Benito Inc. to
Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yuchengco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon being informed of this, the Perez <span class="SpellE">Rubios</span>,
through their attorney in fact, Joaquin Ramirez, reminded the Phillips spouses
and the Phillips corporation in writing of their obligations under the contract
of sale of April 13, 1963 and reminded them in particular that the shares
subject matter thereof were still subject to the payment of the unpaid balance
of the sale price.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They gave a similar
notice to Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yuchengco</span>, but expressed no
objection to the sale provided the obligations in their favor were satisfied.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On March 26, 1965, the Phillips (individuals and
corporation), through their attorney, Juan T. David, sent a letter to the Perez
<span class="SpellE">Rubios</span> telling them, in substance, that the only
obstacle to the consummation of the Phillips <span class="SpellE">Yuchengco</span>
sale of the shares of stock of Hacienda Benito Inc. was their letter of
November 24, 1964 and warned that unless the same was withdrawn by March 29,
they would seek redress elsewhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
March 27, 1965, the Perez <span class="SpellE">Rubios</span>, for their part,
wrote the Phillips that due to the latter's inability to comply with the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> conditions, the negotiations going on between them
were cancelled, and should the full amount due to them remained unpaid by noon
of March 31, 1965, they would file action in court in the afternoon
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1965</st1:date>, stealing a march on
the Perez <span class="SpellE">Rubios</span>, the Phillips (individuals and
corporation) filed Civil Case No. 8632 mentioned heretofore where they
obtained, ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span>, <span class="GramE">a</span>
preliminary injunction to this effect:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'IT IS HEREBY ORDERED by the undersigned Judge of the Court of
First Instance that, until further orders, you, all your attorneys,
representatives, agents, and any other person assisting you, REFRAIN from
interfering with the transaction between the plaintiff corporation with Alfonso
T. <span class="SpellE">Yuchengco</span> on the sale of the shares of stock of
Hacienda Benito, Inc., and from enforcing whatever amount he may claim to be
due to them from the plaintiffs under the Agreements (Annexes ‘A’ ‘A-1,’ and
‘A-2’) mentioned in the complaint.'</p>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date month="4" day="8" year="1965">April 8, 1965</st1:date>
the Perez <span class="SpellE">Rubios</span> filed a motion to dissolve the above
reproduced writ of preliminary injunction, which the respondent judge denied on
<st1:date month="5" day="6" year="1964">May 6, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even before the motion aforesaid could be
acted upon, they also filed their answer to the complaint with a counterclaim
of P4<span class="GramE">,500,000.00</span> representing the unpaid balance of
the sale price of their shares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because
of this the Perez <span class="SpellE">Rubios</span> were charged with contempt.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The original petition for certiorari filed in this case is
based principally on the allegation that, in taking cognizance of Civil Case
No. 8632 and in issuing the writ of preliminary injunction ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> mentioned heretofore, the res­pondent court committed
a grave abuse of discretion and, as a consequence, the petition prayed that the
respondent judge be restrained from in any way proceeding with the case, and to
restrain the respondent Phillips from proceeding with the sale of the shares of
stock of Hacienda Benito,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inc. or any of
its assets to Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yuchengco</span> or to any other
person, or from performing any act which will diminish the value of said shares
of stock or deplete the assets of the company."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On September 28, 1965, petitioner filed a motion for the
admission of the supplemental petition thereto attached, the main purpose of
which was to include the Manufacturer's Bank and Trust Company - hereinafter
referred to as the Bank - and Victoria Valley Development Corporation - hereinafter
referred to as VVDC - as additional parties respondent and to allege against
them the cause of action to be referred to hereinafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before <span class="GramE">We</span> could act

correct minor errors in his previous pleading and to eliminate <span class="SpellE">Leonides</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Virata</span> from the list
of officers of the respondent Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
our resolution of <st1:date month="1" day="31" year="1966">January 31, 1966</st1:date>,
this <u>amended</u> supplemental petition was admitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February 18 of the same year, petitioner
filed in the record a copy of a notice of <span class="SpellE">lis</span> <span class="SpellE">pendens</span> he had filed with the Register of Deeds of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Rizal</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
affecting the real properties titled in the name of the respondent Bank and
whose attachment he sought, among other remedies, in his amended supplemental
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently or more
specifically on February 1, 1966, petitioner filed a <u>second</u> <u>amended</u>
supplemental petition to <span class="SpellE">implead</span> Hacienda Benito,
Inc. - hereinafter referred to as Hacienda - as an additional party respondent
and praying for relief as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that:</blockquote>

Valley Development Corporation <span class="GramE">be</span> ordered to return

Benito, Inc., or against the proceeds of their sale in the ordinary course of
business and of the other corporations who were defendants in Civil Case No.

<blockquote>Petitioner likewise prays that:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1. He <span class="GramE">be</span> declared to have had a vendor's
lien over the shares of stock he sold to respondents Phillips on installment
and which up to now remain unpaid;</blockquote>

P4,250,000 due for sale of the shares of Hacienda Benito, Inc., to respondents

<blockquote>"Petitioner likewise prays for such other relief as may be
just and equitable in the premises."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="3" day="7" year="1966">March 7, 1966</st1:date>,
VVDC filed its answer to the amended supplemental petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">For their part, on <st1:date month="3" day="22" year="1966">March
 22, 1966</st1:date>, the respondent judge and his co-respondents, the Phillips
spouses and Robert O. Phillips and Sons, Inc., filed a motion to dismiss the
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 3, <span class="GramE">We</span> issued a resolution
admitting the <u>second</u> <u>amended</u> supplemental petition and requiring
the respondents to file their answer thereto within ten days from notice, and
denying the motion to dismiss above-mentioned.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="6" day="23" year="1966">June 23, 1966</st1:date>
the Bank filed its answer to the <u>second</u> <u>amended</u> supplemental
petition, as did the respondent judge and his co-respondents Robert O. Phillips
and Sons, Inc. and Hacienda on June 28 of the same year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the respondent VVDC appears not to have
filed an answer to the <u>second</u> <u>amended</u> supplemental petition, its
previous answer must be deemed reproduced as its answer to the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">For its part, the petitioner on <st1:date month="6" day="30" year="1966">June 30, 1966</st1:date> filed his answer to the counterclaim
interposed by the respondents Phillips and Sons, Inc. and Hacienda.</p>

<p class="BODY">As originally commenced, the objective of the present action for
certiorari was simple enough:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the
annulment of (a) the writ of preliminary injunction issued ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> by the respondent judge on April 1, 1965 in Civil
Case No. 8632 entitled "Robert O. Phillips and Sons, Inc. et al. vs.
Miguel Perez Rubio", and of his (b) order of May 6 of the same year
denying petitioner's motion to dissolve said writ.</p>

<p class="BODY">As already stated, the contested writ ordered peti­tioner, his attorneys,
representatives, agents and any other person assisting him, to refrain from (1)
interfering with the transaction between the plaintiffs in the case, on the one
hand, and Alfonso T. <span class="SpellE">Yuchengco</span>, on the other, in con­nection
with the sale of the <u>shares</u> of stock of Hacienda and from (2) enforcing
(collecting) whatever amount said petitioner claimed was due to him from said
plaintiffs under the agreements mentioned in the complaint as Annexes A, A-1
and A-2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the filing of the original
petition in this case and on motion of petitioner, We, in turn, issued on July
26, 1965 a writ of preliminary injunction restraining all the respondents named
in the original petition firstly, from taking further proceedings in Civil Case
No. 8632; secondly, from proceeding with the sale of the <u>shares</u> of
Hacienda or any of its <u>assets</u> to Alfonso T. <span class="SpellE">Yuchengco</span>
or to any other person, and thirdly, from performing any act which will either
diminish the value of said shares of stock or deplete the assets of Hacienda <span class="SpellE">subjectmatter</span> of the aforesaid Civil Case No. 8632.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is obvious that what the plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 8632
considered as interference, on the part of the therein defendant (petitioner
herein) with the nego­tiations or transaction at that time being carried on
between said plaintiffs, on the one hand, and Alfonso T. <span class="SpellE">Yuchengco</span>,
on the other, regarding the sale of the <u>shares</u> of stock of Hacienda was
said defendant's intention to enforce his right to collect from Robert O.
Phillips and Sons, Inc. and its guarantors, the Phillips spouses, the unpaid
balance - P4,250,000.00 - due to him from the latter of the purchase price of
their shares in Hacienda mentioned at the beginning hereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, when said defendant
filed his answer in Civil Case No. 8632 interposing therein a counterclaim for
the collection of said unpaid balance, the plaintiffs therein charged him with
having violated the terms of the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the
respondent judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proceedings in
connection with this charge, however, were held in abeyance by reason of the
writ of preliminary injunction <span class="GramE">We</span> issued in the
present case.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful consideration of the material facts and the law
applicable to them, We are of the opinion and so hold, that the writ of preliminary
injunction issued' ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> by the respondent judge
was unjust and improvident Without hearing the party concerned, and without any
legal justification, it restrained a creditor (Perez Rubio) from enforcing his <span class="SpellE">undenied</span> right to collect from his debtor and the latter's
guarantors the sum of P4,250,000.00 representing the unpaid balance of the
purchase price of his shares in Hacienda.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is a fact that the debtor Corporation (Robert O. Phillips and Sons,
Inc.) and its guarantors, the Phillips spouses, do not deny the in­debtedness,
and yet, notwithstanding its extraordinary amount, they attempted to sell all
the shares of stock of Hacienda without making any reasonable provision for the
payment thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For them to prevent
their creditor from enforcing his right to collect, and for the Court to enjoin
said creditor from enforcing that right in any law­ful manner is, in any
language, rank injustice.</p>

<p class="BODY">But other more complicated issues cropped up into this case
through the filing of the supplemental petitions mentioned heretofore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Summarized, the last of them alleges
substantially the following facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">That after the respondent judge had denied petitioner's motion to
dissolve the writ of preliminary injunction issued in Civil Case 8632, and
sensing that the latter would take up the matter to Us for review, on June 3,
1965 the Articles of Incorporation of the respondent VVDC were drawn up, and
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission the following day, with the
following as Incorporators:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dee K. <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span>, Alfonso T. <span class="SpellE">Yuchengco</span>, <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span>, George F. Lee and
Antonio de <span class="SpellE">las</span> Alas, who also composed the Board of
Directors together with <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span>, Romeo <span class="SpellE">Villonco</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leonides</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Virata</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span> Padilla, <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span> being
besides the Executive Vice-President and General Manager of the Bank, <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span> Padilla a Director thereof, Antonio de <span class="SpellE">las</span> Alas, President and Member of the Board, and <span class="SpellE">Villonco</span>, Treasurer and Senior Vice-President; that on June
10, 1965 the Bank filed a complaint dated May 31, 1965 against (1) Hacienda,
(2) Compound Investment Corporation, (3) <span class="SpellE">Corregidor</span>
Development Corporation, (4) Robert O. Phillips and Sons, (5) Crescent
Corporation and (6) Francisco D. Santana to foreclose the real estate mortgage
constituted on the properties of Hacienda to secure not only its own
obligations but also those of other corporations and business enterprises of
Robert O. Phillips, which by then had reached the total amount of more than
P7,000,000.00 (Civil Case No. 8766 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>); that instead of filing an answer to the complaint,
the defendants in said case entered into a compromise agreement dated June 17,
1967 whereby:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) Hacienda agreed to
convey and assign its properties covered by the mortgage and to assign all
receivables due to it from the buyers of lots in its subdivision, to the Bank
in payment not only of its own mortgage debt but also of the other defendants;
(b) Hacienda was subrogated to all the rights and interest of the Bank under
the deeds of mortgage being foreclosed in respect of its co-defendants; (c)
Hacienda waived its right to redeem its properties thereby transferred or sold
to the Bank; that on June 21, 1965, the Phillips - individuals and corporation
- received notice of our reso­lution of June 15, 1965 giving due course to the
original petition filed in this case and requiring the petitioner therein to
put up the bond required for the issuance of the writ of preliminary
injunction; that this notwith­standing, on June 30, 1965, obviously in line
with the compromise agreement of June 17 of the same year but be­fore its
approval by the Court in the foreclosure pro­ceeding, Hacienda, through Robert
O. Phillips, executed a deed of absolute sale of its properties in favor of the
Bank in payment of the amounts due from <u>all</u> the defendants; that on
August 9, 1965 the deed of sale Was registered in the office of the.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
the consideration appearing thereon being the total sum of P7,485,492.98
representing the mortgage debts of all the defendants, plus costs and
attorney's fees; that since July 1965 the newly organized VVDC had in fact been
managing the Victoria Valley Subdivision which com­prises the properties of
Hacienda, payment of receivables from the purchasers of lots being made directly
to it or to the Bank; that the aforesaid purchase price of the pro­perties of
Hacienda was grossly inadequate as shown by the fact that Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yuchengco</span> himself, an incorporator and board member of the
VVDC, had offered previously the total sum of P12,507,899.24 for 1007% of the
shares of Hacienda; that the deed of sale also deprived Hacienda of its right
to redeem the mortgaged properties; that the foreclosure proceedings, the
compromise agreement and the sale mentioned heretofore were a scheme to circumvent
and avoid the legal effects of the writ of preliminary injunction issued by Us
in the present case and would, in effect, render valueless all the shares of
Hacienda; that all the aforesaid foreclosure suit, compromise agreement and
sale were calcu­lated to produce the same result which could have been
accomplished by Phillips &amp; Sons, Inc. selling all the <u>shares</u> of
Hacienda to <span class="SpellE">Yuchengco</span> and his group; that these
proceedings and transactions amounting to a virtual disposal of all the assets
of the Phillips spouses and of Robert O. Phillips and Sons, Inc. were in fraud
of peti­tioner, their creditor, who would then have penniless debtors from whom
he could not collect the unpaid balance of P4,250,000.00 due to him; that
considering the fact that a good number of the members of the Board of the Bank
were also members of the Board of VVDC, these corporations must be deemed to
have had knowledge of the scheme just described and of the action taken by some
of the members of their respective Board in furtherance thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the foregoing, petitioner prayed for the following
remedies:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that he be declared to
have a vendor's lien over the shares of stock he sold to respondent Phillips
&amp; Sons, Inc. upon which is still due the sum of P4<span class="GramE">,250,000.00</span>;
that he be permitted to sue and collect the aforesaid outstanding balance; that
the Bank and/or the VVDC be ordered to return to Hacienda the properties it or
they bought from the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">And after making proper additional allegations, petitioner
likewise prayed for the issuance of a writ of attachment against the properties
of the respondents Phillips, including those of Hacienda, or against the
proceeds of the sale of the latter and of the other corporations-defendants in
Civil Case No. 8766, for an amount equivalent to petitioner's claim; that all
the respondents and additional parties - Alfonso T. <span class="SpellE">Yuchengco</span>,
Antonio de <span class="SpellE">las</span> Alas, <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span>
Padilla, <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span> and
Romeo <span class="SpellE">Villonco</span> - be cited for contempt, and that
pending the issuance of said preliminary attachment, Hacienda be restrained
from disposing of its properties or assets in any way, save in the ordinary
course of its business of selling the lots of its subdivision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The answer to the second amended supplemental petition filed by
the respondent judge, Robert O. Phillips and Sons, Inc. and Hacienda admits
some of the material averments of the latter and specifically denies the
others, particularly the charge that Hacienda was utilized by its
co-respondents to carry out a transaction to circumvent and avoid the claim of
the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support of said
denials or by way of affirmative defenses it further alleges:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the obligations for which the properties
of Hacienda stood as collaterals in favor of the Bank were incurred much
earlier than the sale of the 49% shares of stock in Hacienda owned by
petitioner and his wife; that Civil Case No. 8766 of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> instituted to foreclose the
questioned mortgage was filed by the Bank solely to protect and enforce its
rights in view of the nonpayment of the mortgage debt by the mortgagors, and
did not form part of any scheme to prejudice or defraud petitioner; that the
compromise agreement entered into between the parties in said case and the
subsequent sale made in accordance therewith were not unlawful nor were they
intended to defraud petitioner; that the purchase price of P7,000,000.00 was
not inadequate, considering the fact that the sum of more than P12,000,000.00
for all the shares of stock of Hacienda offered by <span class="SpellE">Yuchengco</span>
was not only for the purchase of the seventy-eight hectares sold to the Bank
but included other fifty-seven hectares owned by Hacienda; that the sale
aforementioned did not render the shares of stock of Hacienda valueless because
the latter still had sufficient properties left to answer for the obligation of
Phillips and Sons, Inc. to petitioner; that petitioner can not question the
validity of the foreclosure proceedings, the compromise agreement and the sale
mentioned heretofore because his claim was lodged against the respondents
Phillips - individuals and corporation - and not against Hacienda; and finally,
that the issues raised by petitioner in the second amended supplemental
petition concerning the validity of said proceedings and transactions should
have been ventilated either in the aforesaid foreclosure proceedings or in
Civil Case No. 8632, both of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Further, the answer avers that the preliminary mandatory
injunction prayed for in the second amended supplemental petition was not
proper nor authorized by the premises <span class="SpellE">setforth</span>
therein, nor was there any ground for the issuance of a writ of preliminary
attachment against the properties of the respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, by way of compulsory counterclaim, the answering
respondents aver that as a result of petitioner's bad faith in instituting the
present unfounded action, they had suffered damages in the sum of P500<span class="GramE">,000</span> by way of attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">For its part, VVDC, after making admissions and specific denials
in its answer, particularly denied that it was <u>hastily</u> incorporated, the
truth being that it was organized in the ordinary course of business for the
purposes <span class="SpellE">setforth</span> in its Articles of Incorporation,
in line with which, among other things, it negotiated to acquire and develop
the properties of Hacienda for a good, valuable and adequate consideration;
denied that the properties of Hacienda had already been transferred to it
through the Bank, the truth being that it had only agreed to receive payment of
receivables from the purchasers of lots of Hacienda, in trust for the Bank,
pending completion of negotiations for the purchase of said properties by it -
a transaction which has been held in abeyance because of the injunction issued
in the present case; that in choosing to negotiate the purchase of the
properties of Hacienda instead of its shares, it was guided purely by a
business judgment and not by any intention to prejudice petitioner in
connivance with Hacienda and other parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">By way of affirmative defenses, VVDC further alleged that, in so
far as it is concerned, there is no principal action to support petitioner's
prayer for a writ of pre­liminary mandatory injunction; that it has not
acquired nor is it in possession of any real property of Hacienda which it can
be ordered to return; that not being a party in Civil Case No. 8632, it is not
proper to include it as respondent in this case; finally, that the amended
supplemental petition states no cause of action against it.</p>

<p class="BODY">For its part the Bank in its answer to the second amended
supplemental petition also made admissions and specific denials of the material
averments of the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Its
extensive allegations, however, may be summarized as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the Bank was not aware of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of Civil Case No. 8632 nor of the present
proceedings and the issuance by this Court of a writ of preliminary injunction
when it filed the foreclosure proceedings questioned by petitioner; that the
Bank could not have intended to deprive petitioner of any guaranty for his
claim against the Phillips for the simple reason that the mortgages in its
favor over the properties of Hacienda were superior and preferred over the
unsecured claim of petitioner against said parties; that the foreclosure
proceedings aforementioned were not commenced to defraud or prejudice
petitioner but to protect the Bank's rights and interest and to recover long
overdue mortgage credits from the therein defendants in the total sum of more
than P7,000,000.00; that, as the properties foreclosed consist only of seventy-eight
out of one-hundred thirty-five hectares of land titled in the name of Hacienda,
the foreclosure proceedings, the compromise agreement and the deed of sale
executed in connection therewith could not have been intended to transfer <u>all</u>
the properties of Hacienda to the Bank or to the <span class="SpellE">Yuchengco</span>
group, nor to render the shares of Hacienda completely valueless; that there
has been no transfer of the properties of Hacienda between Phillips to VVDC,
through the Bank, the truth being that the latter is still the registered owner
of the seventy-eight hectares foreclosed and ceded to it by Hacienda; that
while the Bank has received an offer from VVDC for the purchase of said
properties, the negotiations have not been perfected, much less consummated, averring
further that such negotiations were not intended to circumvent the writ of
preliminary injunction issued by Us.</p>

<p class="BODY">By way of special and affirmative defenses, the Bank further
alleges the following:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. A petition for <u>certiorari</u> (G. R. No. L-24581) cannot
properly include <u>additional</u> parties which were not parties in the
original case (CFI, No. 8632), where the respondent judge is complained of
having acted with abuse of discretion;</p>

<p class="NUM">2. Said petition for <u>certiorari</u> cannot be altered or
enlarged as to allege <u>facts</u> which are disputed and <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
as false or misleading as to require the <u>reception of evidence</u>, which
should be done in the trial court;</p>

<p class="NUM">3. Such a petition for <u>certiorari</u> cannot legally include a
prayer to <u>return</u> property which was mortgaged to the MBTC, foreclosed in
another case No. 8766, and was assigned to the MBTC in payment of its mortgage,
when said mortgage creditor was not a party to the original case (CFI No.
8632);</p>

<p class="NUM">4. A prayer for <u>contempt</u> against the Directors of the MBTC,
who were not parties to the original <span class="GramE">case</span> cannot be
properly joined in the petition for <u>certiorari</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">By way of counterclaim, the Bank likewise alleges having suffered
actual damages and was further entitled to compensatory damages, and prays for
the corresponding judgment <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> against
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner in due time filed its own answer to the counterclaims
interposed against him by the VVDC and the Bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear from the facts alleged in the second amended
supplemental petition that the burden of peti­tioner's case - aside from the
annulment of the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the respondent judge
on April 1, 1961 (Annex I of the original petition, p. 57 of the record) - is
that all the material events that transpired after the filing of his original
petition show that the Bank, Robert O. Phillips and Sons, Inc., the Phillips
spouses and VVDC, conspired amongst themselves to put the properties of
Hacienda and the assets of the latter's guarantors - the Phillips spouses -,
beyond his reach and thus make it impossible for him to collect the sum of
P4,250,000 still unpaid on the purchase price of his shares in Hacienda sold to
the Phillips corporation; that they sought to accomplish this by having the
Bank foreclose the mortgage constituted on the properties of Hacienda and
acquire them at the foreclosure sale; that, in fact Hacienda, through Robert O.
Phillips, has already conveyed its properties to said Bank; that after
acquiring them, the Bank would transfer them all to the hurriedly organized
VVDC, who would then become their owner and from whom it would be at least
difficult to enforce the vendor's lien thereon claimed by petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged conspirators, of course, deny the conspiracy and aver
that the mortgage in favor of the Bank existed long before the sale of
petitioner's shares to the Phillips corporation; that at the time the Bank
commenced the judicial foreclosure proceedings, more than P7,000,000.00 were
due to it from Hacienda and the other corporations defendants who were either
owned or controlled by the Phillips spouses; that the foreclosure proceedings
were instituted in good faith exclusively to protect or enforce the rights of
the Bank; that as a result of the aforesaid foreclosure proceedings the
mortgaged properties were lawfully acquired by it; that while thereafter there
had been negotiations for the acquisition of said properties by VVDC, the same
were held in abeyance by reason of the writ of preliminary injunction issued in
this case; that there could have been no attempt to make futile the enforcement
of petitioner's right to collect the amount due to him from the Phillips
corporation and the Phillips spouses because after the sale of the one-hundred
thirty-five hectares to the Bank by Ha­cienda, the latter still had somewhere
around fifty-eight hectares of land.</p>

<p class="BODY">The above conflicting allegations of the parties inevitably give
rise to questions of fact which are not within our power to decide in the
present action for Certiorari, not only because the latter involves exclusively
questions of jurisdiction but also because such questions of fact must be
subjected to an ordinary trial where both parties may enjoy the right to
present evidence in support of their respective contentions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon mere allegations made in the pleadings
before Us and the documents attached thereto, We have no authority to decide,
for instance, whether or not there was conspiracy amongst the respondents; in
the affirmative, whether or not that conspiracy was for the purpose of
defrauding petitioner; whether or not the latter has a vendor's lien on the
properties already conveyed by Hacienda to the Bank, enforceable against and
superior to the rights acquired thereon by the latter, and whether or not the
foreclosure proceedings in question were tainted with fraud.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, it is undeniable that the situation created
by the acts admittedly done by the respondents in connection firstly, with the
proposed sale of the shares of stock of Hacienda to Alfonso T. <span class="SpellE">Yuchengco</span> and his group, and secondly, with the conveyance
of the properties of Hacienda to the Bank and the contemplated conveyance
thereof to VVDC, placed petitioner's right and ability to collect the sum of
P4,250,000.00 still due to him from the Phillips cor­poration and its guarantors,
the Phillips spouses, in clear jeopardy, and it is our considered opinion in
this regard that petitioner is entitled, both in law and equity, to a measure
of protection - compatible with fairness towards the respondents - while in the
process of taking whatever steps may be necessary for the enforcement and
protection of his rights.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> judgment is hereby rendered as follows:</p>

<p class="NUM">(1) In connection with the writ of preliminary injunction issued
by the respondent judge in Civil Case 8632 on <st1:date year="1965" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1965</st1:date> mentioned heretofore, the same is hereby
declared null and void and is, consequently, set aside, with the result that
the writ of preliminary in­junction issued by <span class="GramE">Us</span> in
this case enjoining its enforcement is hereby made final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order of the respondent judge of May 6,
1965 denying petitioner's motion to set aside the aforesaid writ of preliminary
injunction of April 1 of the same year is hereby reversed;</p>

<p class="NUM">(2) The writ of certiorari prayed for by petitioner is hereby
denied in so far as it seeks to annul the judicial proceedings had in Civil
Case 8766 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
instituted by the Bank against Hacienda and other parties for the foreclosure
of the mortgage con­stituted in its favor upon the properties of Hacienda;
without prejudice, however, to the right of petitioner to seek such relief and
any other relief that he might be lawfully entitled to against the herein
respondents, singly or collectively, in the aforesaid Civil Case 8766 of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> or in a separate
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, it is our
judgment that the writ of preliminary injunction issued in this case shall
remain subsisting and binding for a period of thirty days from the date of
finality of this decision, upon the expiration of which period the same shall
be deemed automatically lifted or dissolved, irrespective of whether petitioner
had or had not taken steps required for the enforcement and protection of his
rights as already indicated;</p>

<p class="NUM">(3) All petitions actually pending in this case for contempt
against the Bank, the other respondents and other parties charged in the proper
<span class="GramE">petition,</span> are hereby deemed denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly and for obvious reasons,
petitioner's prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary mandatory
injunction against the Bank, requiring the latter to turn over to him the
possession of the properties of Hacienda subject of the foreclosure pro­ceedings
mentioned above, as well as the petition for the issuance of a writ of
preliminary attachment against the properties of the respondents herein, are
likewise denied;</p>

<p class="NUM">(4) All counterclaims interposed in this case against petitioner
are likewise dismissed, without prejudice to the right of the claimants to
litigate them in Civil Case No. 8632 still pending in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, or in any other appropriate
separate action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, deciding Hacienda's repeated motions for clarification
and/or authority to allow it to pay <span class="GramE">its</span> just and
legitimate obligations, We refer said party to the terms of the writ of
preliminary injunction issued in this case, and to our resolution of <st1:date year="1966" day="21" month="1">January 21, 1966</st1:date> where, among other
things, We said:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> However, the injunction issued in this case is directed
exclusively to the parties herein and, in connection with the assets of said
hacienda, they are the only ones enjoined from performing any act which will
either diminish the value of said shares of stock or deplete the assets of said
hacienda."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Neither the writ nor the above-quoted
portion of our resolution restrains Hacienda from carrying on its or­dinary
business and meeting its legitimate and reasonable expenses and obligations.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Without costs.</span></p>
