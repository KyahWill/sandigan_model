				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> Sued in the Manila court of first instance for the recovery of P391.59 plus costs, the above defendants moved to dismiss on the ground of lack of jurisdiction by reason of the amount involved - it did not exceed P2,000.00 - (sec. 44 (c) Republic Act 296).<br><br>Opposing the motion, the plaintiff maintained the court's jurisdiction, arguing that the subject matter of the action related to admiralty and maritime commerce.&nbsp; The Hon. Magno Gatmaitan, judge upheld defendants' contention and dismissed the case.&nbsp; Hence this appeal.<br><br>Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company complained of the above defendants as the operators of the arrastre service in the Port of Manila.&nbsp; It alleged in substance, that a certain U.S. corporation shipped at New York for Manila, three cartons of medicines consigned to Pfizer Laboratories (Phil.) Inc.; that such shipment was covered by a bill of lading and was insured with herein plaintiff insurance company; that the cartons were unloaded at the Port of Manila in good order and delivered the same, the damages and shortages amounting to P391.59 to the consignee.<br><br>This appeal has no merit.&nbsp; The matter involved no admiralty jurisdiction, as we have held in our opinion of November 29, 1960, deciding the cases of Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co. vs. Manila Port Service, G.R.&nbsp; Nos. L-15618 and 16116 and Insurance Company of North America vs. Manila Port Service, G.R. No. L-16000.&nbsp; We reaffirmed this opinion in Delgado Brothers Inc. vs. Home Insurance Co., G.R. No. L-16567, March 27, 1961.<br><br>Consequently, the appealed order is hereby affirmed, with costs against appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Pabilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, Paredes</i> and <i>Dizon, JJ.</i>, concur. </div>
