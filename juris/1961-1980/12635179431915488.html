Plate Waste <span class="SpellE">Waste</span>" arrived in Manila on board
the <u>S.S. President Wilson</u>, was discharged without damage, and delivered
in good order to the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This cargo was never delivered to the
consignee, the <span class="SpellE">Cortan</span> Manufacturing Company, nor to
its successor, the plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Gloren</span>, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cargo was admittedly lost while in the
possession of the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment of the Court of First Instance
of Manila rendered on <st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="9">September 30,
 1966</st1:date>, on suit by the <span class="SpellE">Gloren</span>, Inc.
sentenced the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to pay <span style="">to </span>the plaintiff <span style="">P3,570 which </span>sum <span style="">represents the value of the </span>lost <span style="">merchandise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The sole issue posed <span style="">is </span>one
of law - non-suability of the State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
pronouncements in <u>Mobil Philippines Exploration, </u><u><span style="">vs. Customs </span><span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Service and Bureau of Customs</u><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
which were <span style="">subsequently affirmed and
re-affirmed in no less than thirty cases, are controlling in the case at
bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We quote from <u>Mobil</u>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The fact that a non-corporate government entity performs a
function proprietary in nature does not necessarily result <span style="">in its </span>being suitable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If said non-governmental function is
undertaken as an incident to its governmental function, there is no waiver
thereby of the sovereign immunity from suit extended to such government entity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Bureau of Customs, to repeat, is part of the Department
of Finance (Sec. 81, Rev. Adm. Code), with no personality of its own apart from
that of the national government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its
primary function is governmental, that of assessing and collecting lawful revenues
from imported articles and all other tariff and customs duties, fees, charges,
fines and penalties (Sec. 602, R.A. 1937).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To this function, <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service is a
necessary incident.</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Clearly, therefore, although said <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
function may be deemed proprietary, it is a necessary incident of the primary
and governmental function of the Bureau of Customs, so that engaging in the
same does not necessarily render said Bureau liable to suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For otherwise, it could not perform its governmental
function without necessarily exposing itself to suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sovereign immunity, granted as to the end,
should not be denied as to the necessary means to that end.</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It must be remembered that statutory provisions waiving State
immunity from suit are strictly construed and that waiver of immunity, being in
derogation of sovereignty, will not be lightly inferred. ... From the provision
authorizing the Bureau of Customs to lease <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operations to private parties, We see no authority to sue the said Bureau in
the instances where it undertakes to conduct said operation itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Bureau of Customs, acting as part of the
machinery of the national government in the operation of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service, pursuant to express legislaÂ­tive mandate
and as a necessary incident of its prime governmental function, is immune from
suit, there being no statute to the contrary."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The remedy of the plaintiff may be found in the provisions Act
3083 and Commonwealth Act 327 which (a) permit the presentation of money
claims, such as the one here sued on by the plaintiff, to the Auditor General
for adjudication, (b) set forth the requisites to be fulfilled, and (c) outline
the procedure to be followed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> <span style="">is </span>reversed, and the complaint is
hereby dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to
costs.</p>
