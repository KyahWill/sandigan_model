				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Original action for <i>certiorari</i> filed by Loreto <span class="SpellE">Seares</span> on November 23, 1971 to set aside the minute
resolution of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC for brevity), dated October
26, 1971, denying his petition for the cancellation of the certificates of
candidacy of respondents <span class="SpellE">Carmelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Barbero</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> <span class="SpellE">Balbin</span> under
Section 31 of the Election Code Of 1971, and also the minute resolution dated
November 10, 1971, denying his motion for reconsideration, in Electoral Case
No. C-126.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents <span class="SpellE">Carmelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Barbera</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> <span class="SpellE">Balbin</span>, both
residents of the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Bangued</span>, Province of
<span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, were candidates for the offices of Governor and
Vice-Governor, respectively, for the elections of November 8, 1971, their
certificates of candidacy having been given due course by the COMELEC on
September 13, 1971.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time, respondent
<span class="SpellE">Barbero</span> was the incumbent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Congressman Of <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>
and had still two(2) years of his term to serve as such Congressman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was also a member and President of the
Liberal Party in <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 25, 1971, or forty-six (46) days after the legal deadline
for the filing of certificate of candidacy which was September 9, 1971 and only
fourteen (14) days before Election Day, November 8, 1971, petitioner Loreto
Scares, representing himself as a qualified voter in, and as a delegate to the
Constitutional Convention from, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, with residence
and postal address at <span class="SpellE">Bangued</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>,
filed a petition with the COMELEC (Electoral Case No. C-126) for the
cancellation of the certificates of candidacy, under Section 31 of the Election
Code of 1971, of respondents <span class="SpellE">Carmelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Barbera</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> <span class="SpellE">Balbin</span>, alleging, among others, that said respondents <span class="SpellE">Barbero</span> and <span class="SpellE">Balbin</span> have no <i style="">bona fide</i> intention to run for the
offices of Governor and Vice-Governor of <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, for
the reason that on the occasion of a political meeting held on September 26,
1971 where respondents <span class="SpellE">Barbero</span> and <span class="SpellE">Balbin</span> were proclaimed as the Liberal Party candidates for
Governor and Vice-Governor, and in some political meetings held by them
thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Barbero</span> had stated that if he and <span class="SpellE">Balbin</span> were elected, he will not qualify as Governor so as
to allow <span class="SpellE">Balbin</span> to take the post of Governor, while
he will continue as Congressman of <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, hence, a
violation of Section 31 of the Election Code of 1971; that <span class="SpellE">Barbero's</span>
speech was tape recorded and part of the speech referred to was delivered in
English and <span class="SpellE">Ilocano</span>;<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
that the full text of <span class="SpellE">Barbero's</span> speech as tape
recorded by Station DZPA of <span class="SpellE">Abra</span> Community
Broadcasting Corporation, <span class="SpellE">Bangued</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, is kept by said broadcasting station; and that this
tape recorded speech was also <span class="SpellE">rebroadcasted</span> on
October 3, 1971 upon the request of said respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner then prayed that the certificates
of candidacy of respondents <span class="SpellE">Barbero</span> and <span class="SpellE">Balbin</span> be not given due course and, instead; they be
ordered cancelled and expunged from the records.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1971" day="26" month="10">October 26, 1971</st1:date>,
respondent COMELEC issued a minute resolution denying, for lack of merit,
petitionerâ€™s petition for the cancellation of the certificates of candidacy of
respondents <span class="SpellE">Carmelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Barbero</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> <span class="SpellE">Balbin</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1971" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1971</st1:date>,
petitioner moved for the reconsideration of said minute resolution, supported
by his memorandum dated <st1:date year="1971" day="2" month="11">November 2,
 1971</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 10, 1971, or two (2) days after Election Day,
November 8, 1971, respondent COMELEC issued another minute resolution denying,
for lack of Merit, petitioner's motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, petitioner filed on November 23, 1971 the present petition
for <i>certiorari</i> contending, among others, that respondent COMELEC has
decided a question of substance not heretofore determined by this Court, and
has decided this question not in accord with the Election Code of 1971 because
what the COMELEC should have done was to refuse giving due course to the
certificates of candidacy of respondents <span class="SpellE">Barbero</span> and <span class="SpellE">Balbin</span> by applying Section 31 of said Code; and that
respondent COMELEC has gravely abused its discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner then prayed that the aforesaid
minute resolutions of the COMELEC dated October 26, 1971 and November 10, 1971,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
as well as the certificates of candidacy of respondents <span class="SpellE">Barbero</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Balbin</span>, be declared null and void; and that said
respondents be disqualified from assuming the office of Governor and
Vice-Governor, respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meanwhile, or on <st1:date year="1971" day="1" month="12">December
 1, 1971</st1:date>, respondents <span class="SpellE">Barbero</span> and <span class="SpellE">Balbin</span> were proclaimed, by the Provincial Board of
Canvassers of <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, as the Governor-elect and
Vice-Governor-elect, respectively, in the election of <st1:date year="1971" day="8" month="11">November 8, 1971</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
they having garnered overwhelming votes as against their respective opponents.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
During the fifteen-day period after the proclamation, no voter contested the
election of either <span class="SpellE">Barbero</span> or <span class="SpellE">Balbin</span>,
on the ground of ineligibility, cases of which have to be decided within thirty
(30) days.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In due time, respondents COMELEC, <span class="SpellE">Barbero</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Balbin</span> filed their respective comments, answers
and memoranda to the instant petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They contend, among others, that the
provision of said Section 31 of the Election Code of 1971 refers only to those
cases where the certificate of candidacy has been filed to cause confusion
among the voters by the similarity of the names of the registered candidates or
by other circumstances which demonstrate that the candidate has no <i>bona fide
</i>intention to run for the office and thus by such artifice prevent a
faithful determination of the true will of the electorate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, said Section 31 refers only to <i>nuisance
candidates</i> of which category respondents <span class="SpellE">Barbero</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Balbin</span> do not appertain.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its answer, respondent COMELEC contended that the instant case
has become moot considering that respondents <span class="SpellE">Barbero</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Balbin</span> have already been proclaimed on December
1, 1971 as Governor-elect and Vice-Governor-elect of <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>,
respectively, and it is a general principle of law that proclamation of the
winning candidates by the Board of Canvassers made in the regular performance
of duty makes the election of these officials a consummated act,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
and that, since this is a case of disqualification in office, petitioner should
have filed a case of <i>quo</i> <span class="SpellE"><i>warranto</i></span><i> </i>before
the Court of First Instance, and not before the COMELEC.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Prescinding</span>, however, from the
foregoing, and considering that respondent <span class="SpellE">Carmelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Barbero</span> failed to take his oath as Governor within the
period provided by law, thereby forfeiting his right to the position,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
and, as a consequence, respondent <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> <span class="SpellE">Balbin</span> succeeded respondent <span class="SpellE">Barbero</span>
as Governor of <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
pursuant to Section 17 of said Code,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
without the former having been removed or replaced; and considering further,
that the four-year term of office of those elected and proclaimed in the
election of November 8, 1971, particularly the offices of Governor and
Vice-Governor has already expired, We find the present petition as moot and
academic.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition for <i>certiorari</i> is hereby DISMISSED,
without any pronouncement as to costs.</p>
