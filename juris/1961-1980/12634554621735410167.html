VS. JOSE SOTOMAYOR, RESPONDENT.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition filed by the Laguna <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span>
Bus Co. for the review of the decision of the Public Service Commission in PSC
Case No. 63-2723 granting respondent Jose <span class="SpellE">Sotomayor</span> a
certificate of public convenience to operate three (3) jitneys (PUJ) for
passengers and freight on the line <span class="SpellE">Pagbilao</span> (<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>) --- <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> City.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner alleges that the decision under review is void because
it was rendered by only one commissioner who considered it as an
"uncontested" case when, in fact, peti­tioner had timely filed its opposition
to <span class="SpellE">Sotomayor's</span> appli­cation, on the ground that it
was entitled to protection and preference for being a prior and established
operator on the line applied for; that such being the case, the petition should
have been heard and decided by a division of the Commission, as provided for in
Section 3 of Republic Act No. 2677 as <span class="GramE">amended</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that respondent's application for a certificate of
public convenience to operate a jitney service (PUJ) for passengers and freight
on the <span class="SpellE">Pagbilao-Lucena</span> line was really opposed by
petitioner who claimed that, as a prior operator on the affected line, it
should be given a first opportunity to provide whatever additional service was
needed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, it also appears
that two other established operators on the same line - <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Glorioso</span> and <span class="SpellE">Florentina</span> de <span class="SpellE">Pala</span> - filed written oppositions to respondent's
application.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, however, all said <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
filed their own separate applications to operate additional units on the line
in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering all these
applications - in­cluding <span class="SpellE">Sotomayor's</span> - as
"uncontested" cases, the hearing officer, Associate Commissioner Alex
F. de Guzman, rendered favorable separate decisions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lone issue now, therefore, is whether the appli­cation of
respondent was an "uncontested" case.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is obvious that petitioner's contention is mainly based on a
technicality.</p>

<p class="BODY">The financial capacity of <span class="SpellE">Sotomayor</span> and
the existence of public necessity for the proposed jitney service involved in
the latter's application are not disputed by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the existence of such public
necessity is proven by its own application for a new service on the same line,
and was established by its evidence in connection with its own application
mentioned heretofore (PSC Case No. 63-4091).</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, it is likewise clear that neither petitioner
nor the other two established operators on the same line, namely, <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Glorioso</span> and Florentina
de <span class="SpellE">Pala</span>, showed interest in increasing their units in
service on the line aforesaid only after <span class="SpellE">Sotomayor</span>
had filed his appli­cation, <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of the fact that
they must have, been aware of the existence of public need for such additional
service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This does not speak of their
interest in giving adequate service to the public affected thereby.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, in its own application (PSC Case No. 63-4091), petitioner
originally proposed eight additional units but later reduced them to four,
these four units to come from its own reserve units authorized in the order of
the Commis­sion in PSC Case No. 63-395.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This can only show that peti­tioner did not wish or was not in a
position to fully cover and satisfy the needs of the affected riding public.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS</b>, We hereby affirm
the decision of the Public Service Commission appealed from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With costs.</span></p>
