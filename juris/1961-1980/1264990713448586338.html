<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is a claim for compensation 
for illness, the compensability of which is not in question in <span class="GramE">this proceedings</span>. The issue, which <span class="GramE">We</span> are called upon to determine is "the basis of computation 
of the average weekly pay of petitioner," which is determinative of whether he 
is covered under the applicable laws. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner Federico <span class="SpellE">Catapang</span> had been employed by respondent <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> Milling Company since 1934 up to 1941, outbreak of 
the war. In 1946, he rejoined the company and was assigned as "Issuer of 
Foodstuffs<span class="GramE">,”</span> until his hospitalization for pulmonary 
tuberculosis on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="23" month="6"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 23, 
1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. In 
1939 and up to the outbreak of the war, he was subjected to an annual physical 
and X-ray examinations, in all of which he was found negative of the disease. In 
1947, after returning to work, after X-ray examinations, he was found negative 
of pulmonary tuberculosis. In the succeeding year, however, (1948), acting on 
his complaint of hard breathing, with back and chest pains and loss of appetite, 
the company physician caused an X-ray examination and, for the first time, he 
was found to be suffering from minimal pulmonary tuberculosis. In spite of this 
finding, petitioner was made to continue working as Issuer of Foodstuffs, which 
entailed lifting and carrying of sacks of rice, groceries, and other items of 
foodstuffs, stockpiling and disposing of them to employees of the respondent 
<span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> Milling. In his work, as issuer of 
foodstuffs, petitioner usually worked early and retired late. The place, having 
been more often crowded than not, he was always wet with perspiration. With the 
finding of minimal pulmonary tuberculosis, petitioner was administered with 
anti-tuberculosis treatment, at intermittent intervals. The intermittent 
treatments might not have done any good for him, for on </span><st1:date year="1951" day="23" month="6"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 23, 
1951</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, he 
was confined at the company hospital and he was found to be suffering from "far 
advanced pulmonary tuberculosis." <span class="GramE">Although the illness was not 
yet arrested.</span> <span class="GramE">because</span> further treatment was 
still required, petitioner was released from the hospital on </span><st1:date year="1951" day="15" month="9"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 15, 
1951</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. On 
</span><st1:date year="1951" day="30" month="9"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 30, 
1951</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, he 
was found medically unfit for work by the company physician who thereby 
recommended him for discharge from the service. A gratuity pay of P1<span class="GramE">,700.00</span> was given to petitioner. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Hearing Officer of the WCC 
finding that the was caused and/or aggravated by the nature of his an award of 
compensation of P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, the maximum allowed by law, 
was rendered in favor of petitioner. The respondent was also ordered to provide 
petition with such medical, surgical and hospital services, as the nature of the 
illness might require, until the same was arrested and to pay P160.00 as 
attorney's fees. On appeal of the above decision, the WCC, speaking thru 
Commissioner Perez and concurred in by Commissioner Sanchez, reversed the same, 
not on factual basis <span class="GramE">but</span> purely on the contention that 
petitioner was not within the coverage of the law then in force, since 
petitioner was receiving at the time more than P42.00 a week. Pertinent portions 
of the decision of the WCC En Banc, read as follows: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"* * * Accordingly, the instant 
case should be governed by the law in force on June 23, 1951, when the claimant 
was incapacitated for tabor due to said ailment. The law then in force was Act 
3428, as amended by Commonwealth Act No. 210, Section 39 (b) of which reads as 
follows: “ <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">" 
'Laborer’</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> is 
used at a synonym of 'employee' and means every person who has entered the 
employment of, or works under a service or apprenticeship contracted for as 
employer. <i>It does not include a person whose employment is purely casual and 
in not for the purposes of the occupation or business of the employer, or whose 
remuneration paid by the employer, exclusive of overtime pay is in excess of 
forty-two pesos a week</i> * * *<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It was only on </span><st1:date year="1952" day="20" month="6"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 20, 
1952</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
upon the enactment of Republic No. 772 when the provision on the salary limit 
was eliminated the Act. Section 39 (b) of Act 3428, as amended by said Republic 
Act 772 now reads as follows: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"* * *. It does not include a 
person whose employment is purely casual and is not for the purposes of the 
occupation or business of the employer. * * *'.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Here, it appears from the record 
that the claimant was earning P200.00 a month of P46.15 a week at the time <i>he 
severed connection from the employment on </i></span><st1:date year="1951" day="30" month="9"><i><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 30, 
1951</span></i></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
* * *). Consequently, his average weekly wage being in excess of forty-two pesos 
provided for in the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> provisions of the 
prevailing law, the claimant in this case has no cause of action against the 
respondent. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">“Much as we want to help the 
claimant in this particular case, but we cannot do otherwise except to follow 
the old law, inasmuch he amendatory provisions of Republic Act No. 772 cannot be 
made to apply retroactively (* * *). Thus, * * *, in the case of <span class="SpellE">Wack</span> <span class="SpellE">Wack</span> Golf &amp; Country Club, 
Inc. vs. Workmen's Compensation Commission, et al., 101 Phil. 566, ruled: 'The 
elimination of such exclusion from the statute on June 20, 1952 can not render 
compensable facts or events which were not compensable when they 
happened.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Wherefore, the decision under 
review should be, as it is hereby, reversed and respondent absolved from 
compensation liability." <o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">From the above decision, Chairman 
N. <span class="SpellE">Baens</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario, 
dissented, explaining that the P200.00 which petitioner was receiving <i>only 
from </i></span><st1:date year="1951" day="1" month="6"><i><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 1, 
1951</span></i></st1:date><i><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, should not be the basis for 
computing his average weekly pay</span></i><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. Chairman <span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario claimed that there is a divergence as to the 
claimant's wages. Even respondent <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> Milling, 
in its report (WCC Form No. 3 and Supplementary Report) both dated January 22, 
1960, placed claimant's monthly salary as P140.00, and his weekly wage at 
P32.22; that it was only when respondent <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> 
Milling filed its opposition to petitioner's motion for reconsideration that it 
claimed that he (petitioner) was receiving P200.00 a month; <i>that immediately 
prior to June 1, 1951, he was receiving P170.00 monthly pay and it was only on 
June 1, 1951, that the company raised his salary to P200.00</i>. Chairman <span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario affirmed the findings of the Hearing Officer that 
it was the nature of the work of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Catapang</span> 
which caused and/or aggravated his illness, and advocated for the reversal of 
the decision of the majority, with some modifications, including the increase in 
the award of attorney's fees from P150.00 to P225.00. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After the WCC en bane denied the 
motion for reconsideration, petitioner elevated the matter to this Court. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As has been stated at the outset, 
there is no dispute regarding the compensability of the illness. There is also 
no <span class="GramE">question, that</span> at the time of the supposed 
occurrence of the illness, there was such salary limit of not more than P42.00 a 
week. Nevertheless, we find that under t peculiar circumstances of the case, the 
application of salary limit should be denied. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">No denial was interposed by the 
respondent <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> Milling to the fact that it came 
to know that petitioner was suffering from minimal pulmonary tuberculosis since 
1948, when its company physician caused an X-ray examination to be conducted and 
subsequently administered anti-tuberculosis treatments on intermittent scale, 
upon the petitioner. Three (3) years thereafter (1951) petitioner was still 
performing the same work, which, as found by the hearing officer and concurred 
in by the Commission en banc, was the cause and/or aggravated the illness. It 
was not refuted also, that it was only on </span><st1:date year="1951" day="1" month="6"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 1, 
1951</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
that, the company increased the monthly pay of petitioner from P170.00 to 
P200.00, and that part of the latter amount was applied to his hospital 
expenses, from the time of his confinement in the hospital on </span><st1:date year="1951" day="23" month="6"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 23, 
1951</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On the dominant issue thus 
presented, Chairman <span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario made the following 
observations and conclusions: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"* * *. Inasmuch as the exact 
amount earned during the 12 week period immediately preceding the date of his 
illness does not appear in the records, we can only rely on the statement of the 
claimant that before </span><st1:date year="1951" day="1" month="6"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 1, 
1951</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> he 
was earning P170.00 a month. Using this amount as basis of computation and 
covering the 12-week period from </span><st1:date year="1951" day="31" month="3"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 31, 
1951</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> to 
</span><st1:date year="1951" day="22" month="6"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 22, 
1951</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> (for 
he was confined on </span><st1:date year="1951" day="23" month="6"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 23, 
1951</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">) we 
find his average weekly wage was P39.23 (P180.00 a month x 12 <span class="GramE">weeks</span> ÷ P52 weeks). <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The wage earned during the 12 weeks next preceding 
the date of disability is used as basis in the computation of weekly 
compensation because the (measure of loss to the family due to the accident or 
illness is dependent on such wages</span></em>. He is therefore entitled to 
compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Law before it was amended by 
Republic Act No, 772." <o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Which we deem 
tenable and logical and more in keeping with the spirit and purpose of the law 
and in consonance with the policy that the interpretation of compensation laws 
should feasibly be in favor of the worker.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> And the conclusion cannot be 
otherwise, for it is an <span class="SpellE">unrefuted</span> fact <span class="GramE">that l2 weeks</span> immediately preceding </span><st1:date year="1951" day="23" month="6"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 23, 
1951</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
petitioner was receiving only P170.00 a month. The law provides: 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"See. 19. Computation of Wages. 
The average weekly wages shall be computed hi such manner that it shall be the 
best computation that can be made of the weekly earnings of the laborer, during 
the twelve weeks nest preceding his injury: * * 
*.”<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Although the injury (illness in 
the present case) was contracted very much earlier, the computation should start 
back from the date of disability of petitioner which took place on 
</span><st1:date year="1951" day="23" month="6"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 23, 
1951</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
when he was hospitalized for "advanced pulmonary tuberculosis and completely 
disabled for work." Petitioner was so disabled that although he was released 
from the hospital on </span><st1:date year="1951" day="15" month="9"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 15, 
1951</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, not 
at all cured, the company physician recommended, on </span><st1:date year="1951" day="30" month="9"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 30, 
1951</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
that he should be, as he was, in effect, dismissed and given gratuity, from 
which <span class="GramE">We</span> should infer that the basis of computation of 
petitioner's wages is </span><st1:date year="1951" day="23" month="6"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 23, 
1951</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
Twelve (12) weeks back from said date, was March 31, 1951, long before and 
during which, until June 1,1951, his monthly salary was P170.00 and the average 
of which (for 12 weeks) was P39.23, very much less than P42.00 a week, the 
limitation fixed by law (supra). <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Even granting, for the purposes 
of argument, that the basis of computation is </span><st1:date year="1951" day="30" month="9"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 30, 
1951</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
still the same result is obtained, because in the so-called increased salary of 
P200.00, the hospital expenses were included. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellees</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> cited the case of <span class="SpellE">Nasco</span> vs. De </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Leon</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, et al., G.

1957</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, to bolster their 
theory.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> We 
have examined the case, and the ruling therein was predicated upon an entirely 
different set of facts. After a careful perusal of the record of the case, would 
seem that the increase and discharge of petition were so timed to coincide with 
the ultimate pattern to make him fall under the category of employees not 
covered by the law then in force, due to salary limit. Such an act can be 
interpreted as a subtle way of defeating petitioner's right to compensation, in 
the guise of generosity and benevolence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">IN VIEW OF THE 
FOREGOING</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
decision sought to be reviewed is hereby reversed, and another entered declaring 
that petitioner is entitled to compensation, the amount of which is to be 
computed by the Workmen's Compensation Commission, in accordance with our 
findings. Respondent <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> Milling Company should 
pay. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
