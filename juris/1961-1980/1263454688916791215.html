				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The present appeal stemmed from a judgment of the Court of
Industrial Relations (CIR), dismissing, after trial on the merits, petitioners'
suit for unfair labor practice with reinstatement and back wages.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case started with a complaint, as amended,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
filed by <span class="SpellE">CIR's</span> prosecutor in behalf of herein
petitioners Vicente <span class="SpellE">Marfil</span>, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Alinsod</span>,
and <span class="SpellE">Glicerio</span> <span class="SpellE">Artes</span>,
alleging that they were dismissed by respondent company [<span class="SpellE">Marfil</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Alinsod</span> on June 30, 1958 and <span class="SpellE">Artes</span>
on December 28, 1958] because they refused to heed its advice and warning to
disaffiliate from petitioner union upon promises of salary increases and
promotions, or face dismissal; that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Alinsod</span>,
as a dis­patcher, was paid only P4 a day because of his militant union
activities, while newly appointed dispatchers were given higher pay for being
non-union members; and that respondent company refused to reinstate them
notwithstanding demands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition
categorized the foregoing actuations as unfair labor practices prescribed by
Section 4 (a), sub­sections 1, 2, and 4 of Republic Act 875, otherwise known as
the Industrial Peace Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It winds up
with the prayer that respondent company be ordered to cease and desist from
further committing the acts complained of and to reinstate them with back
wages.</p>

<p class="BODY">Traversing the averments of the complaint, respondent denied the
unfair labor practice charges, claimed just causes for the dis­missal of all
the individual petitioners, and as to <span class="SpellE">Artes</span>, the
added circumstance of absence of employer-employee relationship.</p>

<p class="BODY">Certain facts are not in dispute.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Individual petitioners are all members of the Laguna Transportation
Employees Union, their co-petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The union was registered and its Certificate of Registration No. 2091-IP
was issued on April 3, 1957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
certification election was held in April, 1958 at <span class="SpellE">Biñan</span>,
Laguna to ascertain whether or not the union deserved to be the exclusive
bargaining agency for respondent's workers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The votes cast - 94 to 37 - overwhelmingly repudiated the union.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' evidence is typified by the testimony of petitioner
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Marfil</span> which, so petitioners themselves state
in their brief, “is representative of the testimonies of the other two
petitioners, all the three corroborating each other.”<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Here is <span class="SpellE">Marfil's</span> version:</p>

<p class="BODY">The union, as aforesaid, was registered on April 3, 1957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent company was formally informed of
the existence of that union by registered mail.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> Mercado, the company's assistant
manager, dismissed him because of his membership in the union; his campaigning <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>; his refusal to disaffiliate even with the promise
of increase in salary; and his efforts to reorganize the union after the
certification election in April, 1958 <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of the
warning given by two officers of respondent company that “something” would
happen to him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent company's evidence, upon the other hand, is sum­marized
as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Vicente <span class="SpellE">Marfil</span> was employed
as bus inspector assigned to the <span class="SpellE">Alabang-Parañaque</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> line<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
and “sometimes when an inspector was sick, he was assigned at the <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> line.”<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
His duty it was to sign bus tickets.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Also, he was to submit inspection reports every day, a duty which, at
times, he failed to perform.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His working
time started at four o'clock in the morning.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With his gambling activities which kept him up to two o'clock or
two-thirty in the morning, it was no surprise to find him sometimes reporting
for work late and drowsy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instances
there were when he checked in for work one to four hours late.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He had been caught sleeping while on duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These acts having been reported to respondent
by its other bus inspectors, <span class="SpellE">Marfil</span> was investigated,
was found really delinquent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Pedro <span class="SpellE">Alinsod</span> first worked
as a driver with respondent corporation's predecessor, then doing business
under the name “Laguna Transportation Company”, a partnership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On December 19, 1955 while driving a truck of
said partnership, a hold-up occurred, on which occasion he was shot and wounded
by highway robbers, by reason of which he was hospitalized and unable to work
for about five months, He claimed for, and was paid, workmen's compensation
benefits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But his injuries disabled him
from resuming his job as driver.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pleading for work, respondent company hired him in 1956 as an assistant
dis­patcher at the rate of P4 a day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was separated from service because he was always out of his place of work.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Glicerio</span> <span class="SpellE">Artes</span> is quite different.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In or before 1955, his job was that of a bus driver of the defunct
partnership “Laguna Transportation Company”.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When said partnership was incor­porated in 1956 into “Laguna
Transportation Co., Inc.”, <span class="SpellE">Artes</span> was not
rehired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this, because he was too
old to be a driver - he was already 63 years old at the time he testified at
the hearing of this case on March 4, 1960.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Contrary to his claim that respondent took him in as dispatcher, he has
not been reemployed by said company “in any capacity”.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, he has not been seen in the company
premises since the latter's incorporation in 1956.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the conflicting evidence, a choice was forced upon CIR.</p>

<p class="BODY">Came the decision. CIR Associate Judge <span class="SpellE">Amando</span>
C. <span class="SpellE">Bugayong</span>, on December 11, 1963, gave judicial
approval to respondent company's stand, directed the dismissal of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">A move to reconsider was thwarted by CIR <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
upon a 3-2 vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The majority of CIR
judges adopted the statement of Judge <span class="SpellE">Bugayong</span> that
“the inevitable conclusion” is that “<u>the</u> <u>preponderance</u> <u>of</u> <u>evidence</u>
tends to establish that the separation of herein complainants was for just
cause and not due to union affiliation or activity.”</p>

<p class="BODY">To show the disconnection of individual petitioners' dismissal
and their union activities, the CIR decision appealed from made the following
observations:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(a)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">Individual petitioners have
previously filed with the CIR three separate suits to recover alleged unpaid
salaries, overtime pay, and separation pay against respondent company and four
of its incorporators.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The filing of these suits, despite their dismissal on jurisdictional grounds,
CIR says, “militates against the theory relied upon by herein complainants that
their alleged dismissal or separation from employment had been due to their
union affiliation or activities.”</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(b)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">The fact that other unionists more
prominent than herein individual petitioners, like union president Domingo <span class="SpellE">Antenor</span> or union board member Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Fortuno</span>,
are still in the service of the re­spondent company negates petitioners' claim
that they were dismissed for their union activities.</span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(c)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">Petitioner union's defeat in the
certification election held in April, 1958, despite petitioners' “very active”
campaign, made the respondent company lose any and all motive to interfere with
individual petitioners' right to self-organization.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">And now, to the issues herein involved.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. Adverting to the conflicting versions, we find no difficulty in
saying that there is substantial evidence in the record - testimony of
witnesses - to support the judgment below.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Marfil</span>, the evidence
was that there were times when he failed to submit his inspection reports; that
because he indulged in gambling up to early morning hours, sometimes he
reported for work late and drowsy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
had been caught sleeping while on duty.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Alinsod</span> fared no
better.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record bears out the fact
that he was always out of his place of work.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is evidence of lack of cooperation, lack of interest in his job.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dismissal on grounds ranging from absenteeism, inefficiency,
laziness, to disobedience has been sanctioned by this Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Habitual drunkenness, giving free admissions in a theatre, negligence, and
gossiping on duty are also valid causes for dismissal.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
And so are stubborn behavior, discourtesy and uncooperative service, chasing
employees with a piece of wood, sleeping while on duty, and immo­rality.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
The case of petitioners <span class="SpellE">Marfil</span> and <span class="SpellE">Alinsod</span> easily comes within the broad sweep of the
foregoing cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Artes</span> was too old to
continue as a driver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This certainly was
reason potent enough for respondent company which was then newly incorporated
to refuse further his services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A common
carrier cannot be compelled to maintain in its employ a driver who is
physically unfit to perform his duties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such a driver is truly a great risk.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The life and limb of bus passengers should not be <span class="SpellE">intrusted</span>
to the hands of an old man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In truth,
respondent's act of eliminating <span class="SpellE">Artes</span> from the
service is but in obedience to the legal mandate that “[a] common carrier is
bound to carry the passengers safely as far as human care and foresight can
provide, using the utmost diligence of very cautious persons, with a due regard
for all the circumstances.”<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, when CIR found that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Artes</span>
was never rehired “in any capacity” after respondent's incorporation, it
brushed aside <span class="SpellE">Artes</span>' claim that he was a traffic
dispatcher from 1956 to 1958.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dis­missal
from such position is his present plaint. Other than the fact that <span class="SpellE">CIR's</span> finding here is firm upon substantial evidence, <span class="SpellE">Artes</span>' testi­mony on this point actually borders on
incredulity, absent any explanation in the record why respondent company should
give him that rare privilege to report as “traffic dispatcher” from once to a
maximum of four times a week only, as he testified below.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Not having been rehired, there is thus no employer-employee relationship to
speak of. Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Artes</span> cannot be said to have
been dismissed from an employment which never existed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is certainly fatal to his unfair labor
practice suit.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2. Of course, petitioners, in disputing the findings below, submit
that their evidence is “more than preponderant” to carry the day for them.</p>

<p class="BODY">But in this review we are not supposed to be guided by the rule
of preponderance of evidence; we are not to pass upon the weight of evidence.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
For, a doctrine that has earned respect thru reiteration is that the “[f]<span class="SpellE">indings</span> on the weight of evidence by the Court of
Industrial Relations are conclusive,”<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
even in the presence of conflicting evidence.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Our function is thus narrowed down to an inquiry as to whether the findings of
fact are supported by substantial evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If they are, then <span class="SpellE">CIR's</span> judgment must be
affirmed.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Since - by substantial evidence - valid causes for dismissal
exist, then no unfair labor practice may be tagged upon respondent company.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">For the reasons given, the judgment under review is
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against petitioners.</p>
