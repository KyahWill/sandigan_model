				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J. B. L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for review of a resolution of the Court of Appeals (Case
No. 02780-Cr.) denying a motion for reconsideration and new trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Charged and tried in the Court of First Instance of Manila with
the crimes of bribery and falsification of a private document, Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pulido</span> y <span class="SpellE">Fojas</span> was convicted of
the first offense charged and acquitted of the second.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was sentenced to not less than 3 months
and 11 days of <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span><u> mayor</u> and not
more than 1 year, 8 months and 21 days of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">correccional</span></u>, plus a fine of Ten Thousand Pesos
(P10,000.00) with subsidiary imprisonment, and 8 years and 1 day of temporary
special disqualification.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon his appeal, through a special division, the Court of Appeals
affirmed the judgment of the court <u>a quo</u> by a vote of 4 (Justices <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>, Lucero, <span class="SpellE">Ca単izares</span> and
Martin) to I (Justice <span class="SpellE">Gatmaitan</span>) on 28 February
1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After his petition for certiorari
was rejected by the Supreme Court (G. R. No. L-27490), appellant <span class="SpellE">Pulido</span> petitioned the Court of Appeals for a new trial on
alleged newly discovered evidence (a) that the special division of five of the
Court of Appeals, which affirmed his conviction, was illegally constituted,
because Justices Lucero and <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> of the Majority
were disqualified to sit, and (b) that one Frisco <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>,
after the decision of the Court of Appeals, had written to appellant <span class="SpellE">Pulido</span> revealing that it was he (<span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>)
who really received the bribe money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petition for new trial was re足jected by the special division, this time with
Justices <span class="SpellE">Gatmaitan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ca単izares</span>
dissenting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Pulido</span> resorted to this Court for the second time,
insisting that he should be declared entitled to a new trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit in the argument that Justice Lucero of the Court
of Appeals was disqualified to sit in the case because his son, Antonio Lucero,
Jr., appeared for accused <span class="SpellE">Evelio</span> <span class="SpellE">Geroche</span>
at the preliminary investigation of the case for falsification, and Attorney
Jose C. <span class="SpellE">Zulueta</span>, a first cousin of the Justice's
wife, had appeared as counsel also for <span class="SpellE">Geroche</span> in the
bribery case; for herein appellant <span class="SpellE">Pulido</span> was anyway
acquitted in the case for falsification, and the case against <span class="SpellE">Geroche</span> was dismissed when he became a prosecution witness
at the start of the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently,
all intervention and interest of the attorneys above named ceased when their
client was discharged, and thereafter, it became immaterial to them or to
Justice Lucero whether or not <span class="SpellE">Geroche's</span> testimony
should be believed by the trial court or not, since the acquittal of <span class="SpellE">Geroche</span> was already irreversible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appearance of Attorneys Lucero, Jr. and <span class="SpellE">Zulueta</span>, therefore, could not induce bias in Justice Lucero
when he, on appeal, voted for <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of <span class="SpellE">Pulido's</span> conviction and sentence by the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Equally worthless is the argument that Appellate Justice <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> should be disqualified because, as Chief of the
Legal Staff of the Office of the President, he sat in the administrative
investigation of appellant for his peculation while employed in the Central
Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As head of the Legal Staff, Justice
<span class="SpellE">Esguerra's</span> opinion was irrelevant to the criminal
case, which was prosecuted by the City Fiscal of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justice <span class="SpellE">Esguerra's</span>
opinion on the case would have been advisory to the President, at most, and, as
this Court has ruled in the Emergency Powers Cases (Rodriguez vs. Insular
Treasurer, 45 Official Gazette, 4457), such advisory opinion constitutes no
ground for judicial disqualification.</p>

<blockquote>"Furthermore, the fact that Justice
Padilla, while Secretary of Justice had advised the President on the question
of emergency powers, does not disqualify him to act in these cases for he
cannot be considered as having acted previously in these actions as counsel for
any of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The President is not
here a party" (Case cited).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">By his insistence on the applicability of the second paragraph of
section I of Revised Rule 137, to the effect that -</p>

<blockquote>"A judge may, in the exercise of his
sound discretion, disqualify himself from sitting in a case, for just and valid
reasons other than those mentioned above"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">appellant <span class="SpellE">Pulido</span>
in effect admits that there exist none of the legal grounds for
disqualification described in the first paragraph of said Rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the Justices affected could voluntarily
refrain from participating in the case had they felt that there were just and
valid reasons for such action, their refusal to yield to appellant's
solicitations is evidence that there were no such reasons, and their discretion
in the matter is fully entitled to respect.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are aware that if it should appear that appellant's case was
not given a fair and impartial review due to bias or prejudice, even if there
be no ground for, disqualification, this Court can, and will order a new trial
in the interest of justice.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
But appellant has made no attempt to show any such prejudice or bias, and what
is more, the <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of appellant's conviction was
concurred in by two other justices of the Court of Appeals (Martin and <span class="SpellE">Ca単izares</span>) against whom nothing is alleged, and that
concurrence is proof that Justices <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> and
Lucero were not swayed by prejudice; otherwise, the other justices would have
joined in the dissent of Justice <span class="SpellE">Gatmaitan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in fact, <span class="SpellE">Pulido's</span>
original appeal from the decision was rejected by this Court (L -27490).</p>

<p class="BODY">Granting that appellant herein had no knowledge of the justices
composing the special division before the decision was rendered, and could not
make his challenges prior to that occasion, the stubborn fact remains that no
reason is shown why Justices Lucero and <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>
should be disqualified and their views set aside.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can this Court regard the letter of Frisco <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> as constituting adequate ground for new trial,
even if the writer thereof, after asking appellant <span class="SpellE">Pulido</span>
for the favor of securing employment for one of his children, avows that it was
he (<span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>) who actually received the bribe money
from prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Geroche</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For as stated in the brief of the Solicitor
General (pages 24-25),</p>

<blockquote>"It is obvious that the <u>weight</u> of the proffered newly
discovered evidence is practically <span class="SpellE"><u>niI</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It comes from a polluted source.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, such evidence can only be
categorized as impeaching in nature or corroborative to that of the accused
petitioner, hence, it will not, constitute ground for new trial (4 Moran op.
cit. p. 298).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said Frisco <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> was asking the accused-petitioner for a favor --
the employment of his children and in such situation his propensity to
prevaricate is strong considering the desire to ingratiate himself to the
accused-petitioner in order to merit the favor he was asking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so, the alleged newly discovered letter
comes from one who has no compunction of admitting that he was the one who
received and pocketed the bribe money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
other word's, he was so willing to be the <u>scapegoat</u> -- for the <u>favor</u>
of securing employment for his children.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But it is not explained why State witness <span class="SpellE">Geroche</span>
will ever give such substantial amount of P10,000.00 to a total stranger to
him, whose connection with or influence among officials of the Central Bank is
not even shown. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Considering that the proffered
newly discovered evidence or the testimony of its writer, Frisco <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>, even if admitted and considered by the Court,
is <u>valueless</u>, it cannot prevail over positive evidence, with much
corroboration of the prosecution's witnesses and jibing documentary evidence
(See decision, CA-G.R No. 02780-Cr, p. 16, supra).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the same cannot discredit the testimony
of State witness <span class="SpellE">Evelio</span> <span class="SpellE">Geroche</span>
who declared that he gave the bribe money of P10,000.00 to the accused
petitioner Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pulido</span> personally (p. 19, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Dec. 19, 1959)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of the Court of Appeals denying
Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pulido's</span> motion for new trial is affirmed,
with costs against said appellant.</p>
