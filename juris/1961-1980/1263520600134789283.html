				<BR><STRONG>VILLAMOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Where a written complaint for rape, subscribed under oath by the
offended party before the Fiscal, is filed with the court of competent
jurisdiction after the Fiscal had conducted the required preliminary
investigation, and a certification to that effect appears below the complaint,
is it still necessary for the Fiscal, after finding a <u>prima facie</u> case
against the respondents, to file with the court of first instance an
information in addition to the offended party's sworn complaint?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the question <span class="GramE">We</span>
are called upon to resolve in this original action of <i>certiorari</i> filed
by Assistant Provincial Fiscal Emmanuel R. Real of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>
in the name of the <u>People</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1970</st1:date>,
one Lea <span class="SpellE">Cipoon</span> filed with the Office of the
Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> a complaint for rape
against three persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> office conducted a preliminary investigation
thereon and found a <u>prima facie</u> case against the respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The investigating fiscal then procured and
caused to be filed with the court of first instance a sworn complaint for rape
subscribed by the offended party before the said fiscal, containing a list of
prosecution witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Below the
complaint was a certification by the fiscal to the effect that he had conducted
a preliminary investigation and that there was reasonable ground to believe
that the crime charged in the complaint had been committed and that the accused
were probably guilty thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was
also a recommendation for bail.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case was docketed as Criminal Case No. 101 of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> and assigned to Branch III
presided over by respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Zurbano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1970" day="28" month="9">September
 28, 1970</st1:date>, respondent Judge issued an order directing the fiscal to
file <span class="GramE">an information</span> within two days from receipt of
the order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fiscal moved for <span class="GramE">a reconsideration</span>, but in an order dated <st1:date year="1970" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1970</st1:date>, the motion was
denied and the record of the case was ordered returned to the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> office so that the latter could file the
"necessary information." <span class="GramE">Hence, the present
petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">We find the petition meritorious in view of the fol­lowing
considerations:</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The filing with the
proper court of a complaint or <span class="GramE">an information</span> is
sufficient to commence a criminal action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In <span class="SpellE">Astero</span> vs. Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> City, L-26741, <st1:date year="1969" day="31" month="7"><span class="GramE">July</span> 31, 1969</st1:date> (28 SCRA 1078), We
said:</p>

<blockquote>"The premise to the effect that a public crime, such as that
of corruption of minors 'is not one of those which may be prosecuted x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> upon the complaint of the
offended party,' is manifestly erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, Section 1 of Rule 110 of the Rules of Court, explicitly provides
that '(a<span class="GramE">)<span class="SpellE">ll</span></span> criminal actions
must be commenced either by <u>complaint</u> or information x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In the said case <span class="GramE">We</span>
quoted the following from our decision in <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Narvas</span>, 14 Phil., 410:</p>

<blockquote>"Under the provisions of those sections a criminal action or
prosecution may be instituted in the courts specified therein in <u>either one</u>
of two ways.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place it may
be commenced by <u>any</u> person presenting to a court or to a magistrate the <u>complaint</u>
above defined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such complaint is the
process which begins the action and <u>gives the court or magistrate
jurisdiction</u> of the person of the defendant and the subject-matter of the
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Where such complaint has been
presented no other or fur­ther pleading on the part of the government is
necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution proceeds upon
the complaint alone</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the second
place the action may be commenced by the <span class="SpellE">promotor</span> fiscal
by presenting to the court and filing with the clerk thereof the information defined
and set forth in the section above quoted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In that case such information is the process which institutes the action
and the prosecution proceeds upon it as the people's pleading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>It is the duty of the fiscal to prosecute
the action, whether commenced by complaint or information</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This enables him to prevent malicious or
unfounded prosecutions by private persons."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The sections referred to above are
Sections 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the former Code of Criminal Procedure, which are si­milar
to Sections 1, 2 and 3, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Court, to wit:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SECTION 1.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Commencement of criminal
action</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- All criminal
actions must be commenced either by complaint or information in the name of the
People of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
against all persons who appear to be responsible <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 2.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Complaint defined</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Complaint is a sworn written statement
charging a person with an offense, subscribed by the offended par­ty, any peace
officer or other employee of the government or governmental institution in
charge of the enforcement or execution of the law vio­lated.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 3.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Information defined</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- <span class="GramE">An information</span> is
an accusation in writing charging a person with an offense subscribed by the
fiscal and filed with the court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is true, as contended by respondent Judge, that a complaint need
not be filed with the court, unlike an in­formation which is required by
Section 3 of Rule 110 to be "filed with the court" (<u>Cf</u>. <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> vs. De la Rosa, 78 Phil., 829); but nothing in
Section 2 of said rule bars the filing of a complaint with the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, in certain cases, as will be seen
from <span class="GramE">Our</span> discussion below, the filing of the complaint
with the court is considered the operative act that confers jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crime of rape being
one which is required by Article 344 of the Revised Penal Code and by Section
4, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Court, to be prosecuted "upon a
complaint filed by the offended party x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>," the filing with the court of first instance of a
sworn complaint charging such offense is sufficient to initiate criminal
prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="GramE">We</span>
said in <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Narvas</span>, <u>supra</u>, "the action can not be
prosecuted upon the information of the fiscal." <u>A fortiori</u>, to
require the fiscal to file an information would be to call for the doing of an
act which the law and the rule themselves consider unnecessary, su­perfluous
and ineffectual.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge leans on Section 2 of Republic Act No. 732 to
buttress his position that even if the crime charged in the complaint which is
lodged with the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> office is a semi-public
offense, <span class="GramE">an information</span> should still be filed with the
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Incidentally, the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> section must be deemed amended by Republic Act
No. 5180 (An Act Prescribing a Uniform System of Investi­gation by Provincial
and City Fiscals and their Assistants, and by State Attorneys or their
Assistants), which took ef­fect on September 8, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The particular provision re­lied upon by
respondent Judge is, however, retained sub­stantially in Section 1 of Republic
Act No. 5180, which in part provides that "no information for an offense
recognizable by the Court of First Instance shall be filed by the provincial
fiscal or city fiscal x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>,
without first giving the accused a chance to be heard in a preliminary investigation
conducted by him x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."
Respondent Judge ar­gues that under this provision the fiscal is in duty bound
to file <span class="GramE">an information</span> with the court of first
instance after finding a <u>prima facie</u> case against the respondents in a
preliminary investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find the
argument unmeritorious, because the provision in question in no way precludes
the filing of a complaint directly with the court after a preliminary investigation
thereon has been conducted by the fiscal or by the state attorney.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that a complaint for rape sufficient in form was filed
with the proper court by the injured party thru the investigating fiscal after
the latter had found a <u>prima facie</u> case against the respondents in a
preliminary investigation, We see no reason why the filing of said complaint,
unaccompanied by an information, would not be sufficient to start the criminal
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, no law or rule
prevents the fiscal from filing <span class="GramE">an information</span> for
rape if he elects to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
since the filing of a complaint for rape or for any of the other offenses enu­merated
in Article 344 of the Revised Penal Code, by the person or persons mentioned
therein, is jurisdictional (Cf. People vs. Santos, et al., 101 Phil., 798), the
filing thereof is sufficient to initiate a valid prosecution, and no information
need be filed any longer by the fiscal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case the fiscal chose not to file <span class="GramE">an information</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
We certainly do not begrudge him his right to exercise his option in this
manner, the thought comes to Us that much delay could have been avoid­ed, nay,
the interest of a speedy administration of justice would have been greatly <span class="SpellE">subserved</span>, had the fiscal simply complied with respondent
Judge's order instead of taking the matter to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the case is before <span class="GramE">Us</span>
anyway, We are left with no alternative but to assess its merits, and,
perforce, grant the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the writ of <i>certiorari</i> prayed for is
granted, and the orders complained of are accordingly set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
