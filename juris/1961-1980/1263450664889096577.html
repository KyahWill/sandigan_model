				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by certiorari, taken by the Philippine Air Lines, Inc. –
hereinafter referred to as the PAL – from an order of the Court of Industrial
Relations – hereinafter referred to as the CIR – the dispositive part of which
reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Philippine Air Lines is here­by ordered to pay
the four claimants, Messrs. Fortunato Biangco, Hernando Guevarra, Bernardino
Abarrientos and Onofre Griño the Christmas bonus due them for the year 1950 to
1958; to credit in favor of Fortunato Biangco and Hernando Guevarra 140 days
each, sick leave which the two may use or enjoy according to existing company
rules and regulations regarding this privilege, and to al­low the four
claimants the enjoyment of their earned and accumulated free trip passes both
here and abroad subject to the above-mentioned plan the company may adopt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order to effect early payment of the
Christmas bonus, the Chief Examiner of the Court or his duly authorized
representatives is hereby directed to examine pertinent records of the company,
to com­pute and determine the Christmas bonus due each of the four claimants
and to submit a report thereof immediately upon completion of the same."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It appears that on May 4, 1950, PAL dismissed its above named
four (4) employees, who are members of the Philippine Air Lines Em­ployees
Association – hereinafter referred to as PALEA – and that on July 13, 1954, the
CIR <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> passed a resolution, in Case No. 465-V thereof,
directing the reinstatement of said employees "to their former or
equivalent positions in the company, with back wages from the date of their
dismissal to the date of their reinstatement, and without pre­judice to their
seniority or other rights and privileges." This resolution was affirmed by
the Supreme Court, in G.R. No. L-8197, on October 31, 1958.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 14, 1959, said employees were reinstated, and
subsequently their back wages, computed at the rate of their compensation at
the time of the aforementioned dismissal, less the wages and salaries earned by
them elsewhere during the lay-off period, were paid to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The employees objected to this deduction and
the CIR sustained them, in a Resolution dated May 22, 1960, which was reversed
by the Supreme Court, on July 26, 1960, in G.R. No. L-15544.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon later, or on No­vember 10, 1960, the
PALEA moved for the execution of the CIR resolu­tion of July 13, 1954, as
regards the "other rights and privileges" there­in mentioned,
referring, more specifically to:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
Christmas bonus from 1950 to 1958; (2) accumulated sick leave; (3)
transportation allowance during the lay-off period; and (4) accumulated free
trip passes, both domestic and international.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By an order dated October 8, 1962, the CIR granted this motion, except
as regards the sick leave of Onofre Griño and Bernardino Abarrientos, and the
transportation allowance, which were denied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">PAL maintains that the CIR, has erred in acting as it did,
because:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the aforementioned
privileges were not specifically mentioned in the CIR resolution of July 13,
1954; (2) the order of the CIR dated October 8, 1962, had, allegedly, the
effect of amending said resolution; and (3) the clause therein "without
prejudice to their seniority or other rights and pri­vileges" should be
construed prospectively, not retroactively.</p>

<p class="BODY">Insofar as the Christmas bonus, the accumulated sick leave
privileges and the transportation allowance during the lay-off period, the
PAL’s contention is clearly devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The aforementioned clause must be considered in the light of the entire
context of the resolution of July 13, 1954 and of its dispositive part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In ordering therein the
"reinstatement" of said employees with "<u>back wages from the
date of their dismissal to the date, of their reinstatement, and without
prejudice to their seniority or other rights and privileges"</u>, it is
obvious that the resolution intended to restore the employees to their status
immediately prior to their dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, it directed, not only their reinstatement, but, also, the
payment of their <u>back</u> wages during the period of their lay-off – thus
referring necessarily to a period of time preceding their reinstatement – and
the retention of "their seniority or other rights and
privileges".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rights and privileges
at what time?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, not after their
reinstatement, but at the time of their aforementioned dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the reinstatement was with
back wages for the lay-off period, <u>coupled with</u> the "seniority or
other rights and privileges", at­tached to the status of the employees
when they were dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To put it
differently, the CIR treated said employees as if they had not been absent from
work and had been uninterruptedly working during the lay-off period.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in Republic Steel Corporation vs. NLRB (114 F. 2d. 820), it
was held that, under a decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals and Order of the
National Labor Relations Board directing the employ­er to reinstate the
striking employees <u>without prejudice to their sen­iority or other rights or
privileges</u>, it was the intention of the Board and Court to provide that,
upon reinstatement the employees were to be treated in matters involving
seniority and continuity of employment as <u>though they had not been absent
from work</u>, and hence the reinstated employees were entitled to the benefits
of the employer's vacation plan for the year in which they were reinstated and
subsequent years upon the basis of continuity of service computed<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>as though they had been actually at work
during the entire period from the date of strike to the date of reinstatement</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a consequence, the employees involved in the case at bar are
entitled to the Christmas bonus that PAL had given to all of its employees
during said period, for said bonus, having been paid regularly, has be­come
part of the compensation of the employees.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Said employees are, likewise, entitled to transportation allowance and the
corresponding sick leave privileges.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These sick leave privileges are subject, however, to the following
qualifications, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the
accumulated sick leave cannot exceed 140 days, pursuant to the collective
bargaining agreement between the PAL and the PALEA, effective in 1959; and (2)
that, pur­suant to the same agreement, which denies sick leave privileges to re­tired
employees, Onofre Griño and Bernardino Abarrientos, who have retired, are not
entitled to said privileges.</p>

<p class="BODY">The PAL's appeal as regards the free trip passes, is, however,
well taken, for the employees had <u>no</u> absolute right thereto, even if
they had actually rendered services during the lay-off period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The free trip passes were given, neither
automatically, nor indiscriminate­ly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The employees had to apply therefor and their applications were subject
to PAL's approval.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, except as to the free trip passes for the lay­off
period, which should not be deemed included in the "rights and
privileges" awarded in the resolution of July 13, 1954, and subject to the
qualification that the accumulated sick leave privileges cannot exceed 140
days, the appealed resolution of October 8, 1962, is hereby af­firmed in all
other respects, without special pronouncement as to costs.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>
