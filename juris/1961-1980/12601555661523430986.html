				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In a petition for <i>quo warranto</i> brought by Juan Sanchez, a defeated 
candidate for the office of councilor in the municipality of Bocaue, Bulacan, 
against Oscar del Rosario, a winning candidate for the same position, the Court 
of First Instance of said province rendered judgment unseating respondent from 
said elective office on the ground of the latter's ineligibility. Hence, this 
appeal.
<p>It remains uncontested that appellant Oscar del Rosario was, on the date of 
his election, only 21 years, 3 months and 7 days old, having been born on 3 
August 1938. He was thus disqualified to run for an elective municipal office 
under Section 2174 of the Revised Administrative Code (People <i>vs</i>. Yanza, 
107 Phil., 888; Feliciano <i>vs</i>. Aquino, G. R. No. L-10201, September 23, 
1957), which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Qualifications of Elective Municipal Officer</i>.—An elective municipal 
officer must, at the time of the election, be a qualified voter of his 
municipality and must have been a resident therein at least one year; he must be 
loyal to the Republic of the Philippines, and <i>not less than twenty-three</i> 
years of age. He must also be able to read and write intelligently either 
Spanish, English or the local dialect." (Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Appellant, however, insists (1) that petitioner having already known 
respondent's age disqualification before the elections and having then failed to 
question the latter's candidacy, is estopped from instituting these proceedings 
for <i>quo warranto</i>; (2) that petitioner has no legal personality to bring 
this suit, since he would not. anyway be entitled to the office sought to be 
vacated by respondent; (3) that the petition filed by one Maximo Ortega with the 
Commission on Elections to annul the certificates of candidacy of Nacionalista 
Party candidates (among whom is herein appellant) is <i>res judicata</i> in the 
instant litigation; and (4) that the age requirement prescribed by the aforesaid 
Section 2174 of the Revised Administrative Code becomes directory merely after 
the elections.</p>
<p>We find these contentions unmeritorious.</p>
<p>Estoppel is untenable; indeed, this Court has already made the observation 
that the right to an elective municipal office can be contested, under existing 
legislation, only after proclamation, and that there is no authorized 
proceedings upon which an ineligible candidate could be barred from running for 
office (see Castañeda <i>vs</i>. Yap, 91 Phil., 819; 48 Off. Gaz., No. 8, 3364; 
Cesar <i>vs</i>. Garrido, 53 Phil., 97). Petitioner merely followed the steps 
outlined under Section 173 of the Revised Election Code, thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Procedure against an ineligible person</i>.—When a person who is not 
eligible is elected to a provincial or municipal office, his right to the office 
may be contested by any registered candidate for the same office before the 
Court of First Instance of the province, within one week after the proclamation 
of his election, by filing a petition for <i>quo warranto</i>. The case shall be 
conducted in accordance with the usual procedure andl shall be decided within 
thirty days from the filing of the complaint. A copy of the decision shall be 
furnished the Commission on Elections."</p></blockquote>
<p>Respondent argues that petitioner could have questioned the former's 
candidacy in the Commission on Elections long before the elections were held; 
but, as will later be explained, it is doubtful whether said body could have 
granted any relief at all. Finally, the matter in litigation is one affecting 
public interest, so that estoppel, if at all, should be applied very sparingly 
and only on serious grounds.</p>
<p>That petitioner would not be entitled to the elective office even if 
respondent is ordered to vacate the same is likewise an invalid objection 
against the institution of this suit, for, otherwise, Section 173 of the Revised 
Election Code would clearly be rendered nugatory. Under said law, the 
contestant's right to the office involved is not contemplated, and thus this 
Court has repeatedly ruled that respondent's declaration of ineligibility does 
not entitle the petitioner to said office (Luison <i>vs</i>. Garcia, 103 Phil., 
453; Llamoso <i>vs</i>. Ferrer, 84 Phil., 489; 47 Off. Gaz., No. 2, 727; Calano 
<i>vs</i>. Cruz, 94 Phil., 230; 50 Off. Gaz., 610). Yet, in said rulings, the 
petitioners have never been considered to be without any legal personality to 
file the necessary <i>quo warranto</i> proceedings. We need not conjecture into 
the philosophy of the law; suffice it to say that the legislature expressed its 
intentions very plainly.</p>
<p>Why appellant's third contention that the petition filed by one Maximo Ortega 
with the Commission on Elections questioning the certificates of candidacy of 
all Nacionalista Party candidates for municipal offices in Bocaue is <i>res 
judicata</i> is not sustainable was amply explained by the lower court in these 
words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Neither can the decision of the Commission on Elections bo considered as a 
bar to the present petition, for, it appears that the petition filed with the 
Commission on Elections was general in character, and referred to all the 
candidates in the last elections for municipal offices in Bocaue, Eulacan, for 
reasons other than that of the ineligibility by reason of non-age. An action may 
bar another action if the requisites prescribed by the Rules are present; 
namely: (1) That the parties ire identical: and, (2) That the action refers to 
the same subject-maUer, These requisites are not present in this 
case."</p></blockquote>
<p>We may add, however, that the duty of the Commission on Elections to give due 
course to certificates of candidacy, filed in due form, is ministerial in 
character (see Abcede <i>vs</i>. Imperial, 103 Phil., 136). Stated in another 
way, while the Commission may look into patent defects in the certificates, 
nevertheless, it may not go into matters not appearing on their face. The 
Question of eligibility or ineligibilty of a candidate for non-age is thus 
beyond the usual and proper cognizance of said body<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span>, and could not have consequently been 
litigated therein.</p>
<p>Averring that <i>vox populi suprema est lex</i>, appellant argues that the 
people's choice, expressed in the local elections, should be respected and that, 
accordingly, the age qualification should be construed merely directory as to 
him. This same question was raised and considered quite extensively by us in the 
case of Feliciano <i>vs</i>. Aquino, <i>supra</i>; and while this Court was 
divided on whether the age requirement prescribed by the election law is exacted 
of the candidate at the time of the elections or only upon assumption of office, 
here, however, it appears that said qualification was not satisfied in either 
instance by herein appellant.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the judgment appealed is affirmed, with costs against appellant 
Oscar del Rosario.</p><i>Bengzon, Acting C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, 
Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera,</i> and <i>Dizon, JJ.,</i> concur. <br><br><br>
<hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> Note that under Sec. 32 of the Revised 
Election Code, the candidate need not state in his certificate of candidacy his 
exact age or other qualifications, the statement that he is eligible for office 
being sufficient.</div>
