				<BR><BR><div align=""><div align="justify"><br><p>This is a petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction principally 
assailing an order of the Court of Agrarian Relations denying a motion to stay 
execution of its judgment dispossessing the tenant until he is indemnified for 
alleged expenses and improvements.</p>
<p>As leasehold tenant, petitioner, Leon del Rosario, occupied a parcel of land 
owned by respondent Tomas Imperio, situated in Cabocbocan, Rizal, Nueva Ecija. 
Said land became the subject matter of litigation between said parties before 
the Court of Agrarian Relations, Fourth regional district, in CAR Cases Nos. 
2652-NE '61 and 2909-NE '62. And on July 12, 1963, a decision was rendered 
therein, the dispositive portion running as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered: (l) ordering the ejectment of Leon 
del Rosarlo from the landholdlng in question subject to Section 43 and Section 
50, paragraph (a), R.A. No. 1199, as amended by R.A. No. 2263, and (2) ordering 
Tomas Imperio to pay Leon del Rosarlo the value of the excess rentals received 
by him for the agricultural years 1961-62 and 1962-63."</p></blockquote>
<p>Said judgment was affirmed <i>in toto</i> by the Courtof Appeals on March 26, 
1965.</p>
<p>Subsequently, on October 26, 1965, Imperio filed with the Court of Agrarian 
Relations a motion for execution of the afore-stated Judgment. Del Rosario 
however opposed it, on the ground that he has a right of retention over the land 
until he is indemnified for expenses and improvements, alleging that in the 
present case he is entitled thereto. Acting thereon, the Court of Agrarian 
Relations, on November 18, 1965, issued an order for the Issuance of a writ of 
execution, stating that the judgment had become final and executory, and that 
Del Rosario's claim for indemnity, if any, should be filed with said court for 
determination, but cannot stop execution of said judgment. Del Rosario filed a 
motion for reconsideration but this was denied by the same court on December 14, 
1965. And on December 16, 1965, the corresponding writ of execution was 
issued.</p>
<p>Petitioner Del Rosario then filed, on December 27, 1965, the present special 
civil action herein.</p>
<p>Respondents, on January 4, 1966, were required by Us to answer the petition; 
and on January 8, 1966, We issued a writ of preliminary injunction 
addressed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"To: Hon. Bienvenido Chingcuangco (reg.-spl.-del.)<br>Judge, Court of 
Agrarian Relations<br>Cabanatuan City<br>The Provincial Sheriff of Nueva Ecija 
(reg.-spl.-del.)<br>Cabanatuan City"</p></blockquote>
<p>stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"NOW, THEREFORE, until further orders from this Court, You, your agents, your 
representatives and/or any person or persons acting in your behalf are hereby 
restrained from implementing the Writ of Execution dated December 16, 1965, in 
CAR Cases Nos. 2652-NE-61 and 2902-NE-62 of the Court of Agrarian Relations of 
Cabanatuan City entitled 'Leon del Rosario, plaintiff versus Tomas Imperio, 
defendant.'"</p></blockquote>
<p>On January 20, 1966, respondents filed their answer Further developments came 
by way of two petitions for contempt: First, a petition filed by respondent 
Imperio dated February 5, 1966, to declare petitioner's counsel in direct 
contempt, on the alleged ground that in his petition herein said lawyer cited a 
fictitious authority. Second, a petition filed by Del Rosario, dated June 20, 
1966, to cite for contempt respondent Imperio, and three non-parties, the Chief 
of Police of the Municipality of Rizal, Nueva Ecija (Eduardo Dumlao), and 
policemen Remigio Baldonado and Romeo Miguel, for having allegedly sought to 
eject Del Rosario from the land in question notwithstanding this Court's 
preliminary injunction. To this a supplementary petition for contempt was filed, 
dated July 25, 1966, alleging further that with the full backing of said 
policemen, Imperio caused the plowing and harrowing of the landholding and 
prevented Del Rosario from reaping the crops therein.</p>
<p>After the respective parties had filed their comments to the petitions for 
contempt, We deferred their resolution until consideration of this case upon the 
merits.</p>
<p>At issue on the merits of this petition for certiorari is the proper 
interpretation or application of Section 43 of Republic Act 1199 (Agricultural 
Tenancy Act) which provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 43.—<i>Rights and Obligations of Tenant-Lessee</i>.—With the creation 
of the tenancy relationship arising out of the contract between the 
landholders-lessor and tenant-lessee, the latter shall have the right to enter 
the premises of the land, and to the adequate and peaceful enjoyment thereof. He 
shall have the right to work the land according to his best judgment, provided 
the manner and method of cultivation and harvest are in accordance with proven 
farm practices. <em>Upon termination of the relationship, he shall be entitled 
to one-half of the value of the improvements made by him, provided they are 
reasonable and adequate to the purposes of the lease</em>." (Italics 
supplied).</p></blockquote>
<p>in relation to Section 1 of Rule 15 of the Rules of the Court of Agrarian 
Relations, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Rule 15.—Writ of Execution "Section 1. Requisites for Issuance of Writ of 
Execution in Case of Final Judgment Ejecting Tenant.—In cases where the 
dispossession is authorized by final judgment no writ of execution shall issue 
unless upon certification of the corresponding Judge that the tenant has been 
fully indemnified of his claim under Section 22 of Republic ilct No. 1199 in 
case of share tenancy or under Section 43 thereof in case of leasehold 
tenancy."</p></blockquote>
<p>It is the position of respondents that Section 43 of Republic Act 1199 merely 
grants the tenant the right to recover one-half of the value of improvements he 
made on the land, without giving him any right of retention over the land until 
he is so reimbursed. As to Section 1 of Rule 15 of the Rules of the Court of 
Agrarian Relations, they contend that the same had been superseded with the 
advent of the Agricultural Land Reform Code (R. A. 3844), effective August 8, 
1963, which replaced the Rules of the Court of Agrarian Relations with the Rules 
of Court (Sec. 115, R.A. 3844). And, they emphasize that there can be no vested 
right on procedure, arguing that petitioner's right under the former Rules of 
the Court of Agrarian Relations cannot be anything more than procedural.</p>
<p>There is no merit to the view that Section 1 of Rule 15 of the Rules of the 
Court of Agrarian Relations is not applicable in this case for having been 
abrogated with the enactment of the Agricultural Land Reform Code. Said Code, it 
is true, provides that the Court of Agrarian Relations shall be governed by the 
Rules of Court. (Sec. 155, R.A. 3844) And neither the Rules of Court then 
obtaining nor the present Rules of Court contain a similar, provision requiring 
payment to the tenant of one-half of the value of his improvements before there 
can be execution of a judgment dispossessing him. Nonetheless, since the Rules 
of Court was applied to the Cburt of Agrarian Relations only on August 8, 1963, 
pursuant to Republic Act 3844 as afore-stated, its effectiveness to pending 
cases as of that time, such as the Instant case, should follow the norm set 
forth in Rule 133 therein: "These rules ... shall govern all cases brought after 
they take effect, and also all further proceedings in cases then pending, except 
to the extent that in the opi- nion of the court their application would not be 
feasi- ble or would work injustice, in which event the former procedure shall 
apply."</p>
<p>Should it turn out that indeed petitioner tenant had made Improvements on the 
landholdlng, - a point not for Us now to decide - then Section 43 of Republic 
Act 1199 clearly givss him the right to one-half of their value, thereby 
Imposing upon the landholder disposses- sing him the correlative duty of paying 
the same. The rule prevailing during the pendency of this case in the Court of 
Agrarian Relations required that this account be settled before any judgment of 
ejectment can be executed. It is therefore not difficult to see that to apply 
the Rules of Court, which do not contain a similar provision, would be unjust to 
the tenant. In this event, the former procedure is to be followed, namely, 
Section 1 of Rule 15 of the Rules of the Court of Agrarian Relations.</p>
<p>Respondent Imperio's argument that petitioner failed to show that 
improvements were in fact made should be addressed to the Court of Agrarian 
Relations. The point is that the tenant's claim for reimbursement under Section 
43 of Republic Act 1199 should first be threshed out, determined and resolved 
"before the tenant can be dispossessed by writ of execution. This recourse is 
but in accordance with the policy of the law to protect the rights of tenants 
upon the principle of social Justice (Sec. 2, Republic Act 1199).</p>
<p>The petition for contempt filed by respondent Imperio charges petitioner's 
counsel of having cited a fictitious case and a non-existent ruling. The record 
bears out that petitioner's counsel alleged in page 5 of the petition for 
certlorari herein, thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Section 1, Rule 15, Rules of the Courts of Agrarian Relations, predicated on 
Section 43 of Republic Act No. 1199, as amended, <i>supra</i>, has been upheld 
to be valid by this Honorable Tribunal so that now no writ of execution can be 
issued unless it is complied with first (Paz Ongsiako, Inc. vs. Celestino Abad, 
et al., O.R. No. L-121447), This ruling, in effect, created and established or 
confirmed the prior substantial right of a tenant to in- demnification before he 
is finally ejected from his holding."</p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioner's counsel obviously had in mind this Court's decision in Paz 
Ongsiako, Inc. vs. Celestino Abad, L-12147, July 30, 1957. Although he cites as 
docket number L-121447 instead of L-12147, the same is plainly but a slight 
typographical mistake not sufficient to place him in contempt, especially 
because the names of the parties were given correctly. As to said counsel's 
interpretation of this Court's decision in said case, or of what the ruling 
therein "in effect" created, established or confirmed, the same are mere 
arguments fully within the bounds of earnest debate, rather than a deception 
urged upon this Court. The first petition for contempt is therefore without 
merit.</p>
<p>The second petition for contempt is against respondent Imperio and three 
others, not parties herein: the Chief of Police of the Municipality of Rizal, 
Nueva Ecija, Eduardo Dumlao; policeman Remlgio Baldonado; and, policeman Romeo 
Miguel. Said petition as well as the supplemental petition thereto, allege that 
respondent Imperio, with the aid of the three law enforcement officers, 
disturbed petitioner in the possession and cultivation of the land, on June 13, 
1966; caused its plowing and harrowing on June 27, 1966; and prevented the 
petitioner from reaping the second rice crop on July 16, 1966, The foregoing 
acts, if true, would be a ground for contempt only if at the time this Court's 
writ of preliminary injunction was issued, respondent court's writ of execution 
had not yet been carried out. From the sheriff's return,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup> however, it would appear that respondent 
Imperio was placed in possession of the land by virtue of the writ of execution 
as of December 18, 1965. This Court's preliminary injunction, restraining 
implementation of the writ of execution, was issued only on January 8, 1966. 
Respondents, therefore, may not be held in contempt. Nonetheless, the premature 
implementation of the writ of execution being illegal, petitioner should be 
restored to peaceful and undisturbed possession of the landholding, until his 
claim for payment of improvements (one-half of their value) is settled by 
respondent court.</p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, respondent court's orders of November 18, 
1965 and December 14, 1965, denying petitioner's motion to stay execution 
pending settlement of his claim for one-half of the value of alleged 
improvements, as well as the writ of execution already issued, are hereby set 
aside; respondents are ordered to restore petitioner to the landholding, and to 
proceed according to Section 1 of Rule 15 of the former Rules of the Court of 
Agrarian Relations, by first determining petitioner's claim for improvements 
under Section 43 of Republic Act 1199, before issuing a writ of execution for 
the said tenant's dispossession. The petitions for contempt are denied for lack 
of merit. No costs.
