Judge Mariano <span class="SpellE">Tugaoen</span> of the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanguita</span>, now of the 5th Municipal Circuit Court of <span class="SpellE">Dauin-Zamboanguita</span>, for ignorance of the law, abuse of
power and authority and partiality in the administration of justice.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It appears that herein
complainant, Rogelio A. <span class="SpellE">Bais</span>, filed before the
Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Dauin</span> a complaint against Fr.
Roman <span class="SpellE">Suelto</span> for grave slander.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent judge, M. <span class="SpellE">Tugaoen</span>,
conducted a preliminary investigation after which he amended <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> the
complaint by making an official pronouncement, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Wherefore, by virtue of the above premises, the Court finds
prima facie evidence that R. <span class="SpellE">Suelto</span> xxx committed the
crime of Slight Slander under Article 358 of the Revised Penal Code."<span style=""> </span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Motions for reconsideration were filed but denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion to disqualify respondent judge from
trying the case in view of his glaringly apparent prejudgment of the case was
also filed and denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="17" month="9">September 17, 1975</st1:date>,
complainant filed a motion to dismiss the criminal case because his witnesses
have signified their intention to desist from testifying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would want also to <span class="SpellE">refile</span>
his case in the Office of the Provincial Fiscal where he thought he could get
true justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following day, <st1:date year="1975" day="18" month="9">September 18, 1975</st1:date>, a trial was held
where respondent judge verbally ordered the denial of the motion to
dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant asked for a written
copy of the order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was denied on
the ground that the order was given openly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Complainant moved for a reconsideration of the order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion for reconsideration was however
denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, the respondent judge
proceeded with the trial on the merits, after allowing the accused, through his
counsel, to enter a plea of "not guilty". <span class="GramE">(pp.
76-77, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="13" month="10">October 13, 1975</st1:date>,
complainant filed motion to file peti­tion for <i>certiorari</i>, injunction
and prohibition and motion to defer trial on hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1975" day="16" month="10">October
 16, 1975</st1:date>, the trial of the case was resumed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During said trial, respondent judge openly
asked the complainant if he will stand by or pursue his motion to dismiss dated
September 16, and complainant answered or replied "<span style="">yes, </span>your Honor" and right then, the motion to dismiss was
granted, lifting the order of denial, thus dismissing the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(pp. 5-6, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The complainant then filed the same complaint with the Office of
the Provincial Fiscal, but said filing was denied by the Provincial Fiscal in a
resolution dated <st1:date year="1976" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1976</st1:date>,
on the ground of double jeopardy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, complainant filed an administrative case against the
respondent judge on the ground that the actuations of the latter were tainted
with the following:</p>

<blockquote>I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Ignorance of the law</u>,
in that the respondent judge, after conducting the preliminary investigation of
the case ordered the arrest of the accused, fixed the bail bond at P50.00 and
amended <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">proprio</span></u>
his complaint by <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> the phrase Grave Slander
and replacing it with Slight Slander, in gross violation of Section 13, Rule
110 and Section 9, Rule 112 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, in ordering the arrest of the
accused respondent judge went beyond Section 9, Rule 112 of the Rules of Court
after considering the accused as having committed a light felony; and by this
act of the respondent judge, he either did not know the law or if he did, he
knowingly violated it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(p. 2, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>II.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Abuse of power and
authority</u>, in that respondent judge denied complainant's Motion for
Reconsideration and the Motion to Disqualify him from trying the case filed
before him, and threatened to summarily hold complainant in contempt of court;
and that the respondent judge, notwithstanding the <span style="">Motion to Dismiss filed with him by the complainant, ordered the trial
of the case based on the charge of Slight Slander as amended by him <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">proprio</span>,</u> and
allowed the lawyers for the accused to enter a "plea of not guilty",
obviously to prejudice his case against Roman <span class="SpellE">Suelto</span>
for the crime of Grave Slander, because afterwards, the respondent judge
dismissed the complaint on the basis of the motion for reconsideration which he
had denied before the counsel for the accused could enter a plea of not
guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(p. 4, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>III. <u>Partiality in the administration of justice</u>, in that
the actuations of the respondent judge in handling the case was tainted with
partiality in the administration of justice by:<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Amending his complaint
<span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">proprio</span></u>
without authority of law, obviously to <span class="SpellE">accomodate</span> the
accused who is a priest after learning that the evidence against him is strong.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Allowing the lawyers
for the accused to enter a 'plea of not guilty' to a charge as amended by him
notwithstanding the fact that a Motion to Dismiss is still pending before him,
apparently to accommodate the accused and prejudice the case knowing fully well
that if it was dismissed before the accused could interpose a 'plea of not
guilty', the case can still be revived in the office of the Fiscal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">Dismissing the case only after the accused
was able to enter a plea of not guilty thru his counsels, mani­festly to bar
complainant from <span class="SpellE">refiling</span> the case in the office of
the Fiscal, as in fact he was barred from reviving it, on the ground that the
principle of double jeopardy had already sit in." (p. 5, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>),<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Asked to comment on the complaint, respondent judge filed his
comment dated <st1:date year="1976" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(pp. 22-28; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent judge averred that all the charges against him "are
closely related with each other and records will disclose that there is no
truth to the complaint of the complainant, further alleging that the letter-complaint
is characterized with inaccuracies and reckless choice of phrases and shot
through with misinterpretations."</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge took exception to the charge that he violated
certain provisions of the Rules of Court which complainant branded as
tantamount to ignorance of the laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
maintained that it is within his power and as duly designated Municipal Judge
to try Criminal Case No. 684 to issue the corresponding warrant of arrest
against the accused therein, Fr. Roman <span class="SpellE">Suelto</span>, which
he did only after conducting the preliminary investigation and finding that a <u>prima
facie</u> case exists that said accused committed the crime of Slight Slander
and not Grave Slander as insisted on by herein complainant; that he also
maintained as within his power to change the designation of the crime from
"Grave Slander" to "Slight Slander" as both crimes fall
under the same provision of Article 358 of the Revised Penal Code and the
allegations in the body of the complaint were left unchanged; that said change
was done for the speedy administration of justice and cited as his authority in
doing so the cases of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Macalinao</span>, et al.,
CA-G.R. No. 52-R (L-247), January 5, 1947 and U.S. vs. Lim San, 17 Phil. 273
where it was held that the "designation of the crimes in the caption of
the information is a conclusion of law on the part of the fiscal and the court
is the only person or institution authorized by law to say what crime has been
committed." He further contends that in the preliminary examination,
replacing the nature of the crime can <span style="">be
done without affecting the substantial rights of the defendant, as from grave
to slight slander where the allegations in the complaint support the lesser
crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is different, he continues,
when the proper offense has not been charged, in which case, the complaint
should be dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To further bolster his
foregoing contention, the respondent judge also averred:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Section 13, Rule 110, of the Revised Rules of Court <span class="GramE">refer</span> to amendment of a complaint or information before the
defendant pleads.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amendment either
in substance or form may be made without leave of court at any time before the
defendant pleads; after he had pleaded, no amendment may be made without leave
of court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This means that the court has
discretion to permit amendment or not.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, such discretion exists only as to amendment on matters of
form.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to matters of
substance, the court has no such discretion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This contemplates a trial on the merits and certainly not on preliminary
examination xxx".<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(p. 25, <span class="SpellE">rollo</span>).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Asked to submit a reply to the comment of
respondent judge if he so desires, the complainant filed his reply dated </span><st1:date year="1976" day="18" month="9"><span class="GramE">September 18, 1976</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">.</span></p>

of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental for investigation, report and
recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hon. <span class="SpellE">Segundino</span> G. Chua, Executive
District Judge of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental, in obedience to
the aforesaid directive of this Court, set on several dates the investigation

appeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Municipal judge
did not show up probably because he had earlier filed a motion for immediate
resolution and/or decision of the case based on the records thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On said date, February 8, the undersigned
investigator suggested to the complainant that for the benefit of all concerned
this case ought to be settled amicably considering that he, the complainant, is
the sub-station commander of <span class="SpellE">Dauin</span>, while the
respondent judge <span style="">is </span>the circuit judge thereat and both officials are by law
supposed to work hand in hand and in close cooperation with each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant manifested that he was open

the former orally moved for the dismissal of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was denied in order to afford the

<p class="BODY">After a careful review and perusal of the entire records of this
administrative complaint, this Court cannot give full concurrence with the
above recommendation of the Investigating Judge to the effect that this case be
dropped and considered closed and terminated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court looks with disfavor at the outright dismissal of this
complaint upon mere affidavit of desistance executed by complainant where on
the basis of the evidence presented and records of the case, herein respondent
should at least be severely warned to be more discreet in the performance of
his judicial function so as to keep inviolate the faith and confidence of the
people in our judicial system.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that herein respondent after conducting a
preliminary investigation in Criminal Case No. 684, <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> and over the objection of the
prosecution changed the designation of the crime charged from Grave Slander to
Slight Slander.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent judge
justified his action by insisting that he is possessed with such power and that
the same was done for the speedy administration of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, however, is not prepared to
sustain this view for Section 13, Rule 110, Rules of Court is clear that the
matter of changing the designation of the appropriate crime in an information
or complaint is vested in the prosecution and not in the trial <span style="">judge, </span>and in the instant case, the
change may be done by the prosecution even without leave of court since the
defendant or accused has not as yet entered his plea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law providing that the information or
complaint maybe amended in substance or form without leave of court any time
before the defendant, pleads lodges a discretionary power in the prosecuting officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Conde</span>
vs. CFI, No. 21236, October 1, 1923, 45 Phil. 173).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, the person authorized to amend the
complaint or information is only the prosecuting officer and not the trial
judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention of the respondent
judge that he had the right to amend the designation of the crime in a
preliminary investigation which is not the trial proper is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of preliminary investigation is
primarily to determine whether there is a reasonable ground to believe that an
offense has been committed and the accused is probably guilty thereof, so that
a warrant of arrest maybe issued and the accused held for trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not within the purview of the
preliminary investigation to give the judge the right to amend, <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> the
designation of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the crime
comes within his jurisdiction, he shall try the case, and only after trial may
he convict for a lesser offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a
case coming within the original jurisdiction, of the Court of First Instance,
he should elevate the case as it is, even if in his opinion, the crime is less
than that charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent judge's act of allowing the accused, through his
counsel, to plead "not guilty" after an oral denial after hearing, of
the complainant's motion to dismiss, and later lifting the order denying the
motion to dismiss in order to dismiss, as he did, the complaint, is not within
the proper bounds of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion to
dismiss was already denied, and with a plea of not guilty thereafter entered,
trial on the merits was in order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
the respondent judge to have asked the complainant before proceeding to trial
whether the latter was standing by or pursuing his already denied motion to dis<span style="">miss, and on having been given an affirmative
answer, respondent judge dismissed the case after the accused had already
pleaded, suspicion is easily aroused that the move taken by him was
deliberately designed to favor the accused against whom the case could no
longer be <span class="SpellE">refiled</span> with the Provincial Fiscal, as was
the motive for complainant's motion to dismiss, because double jeopardy has
already set in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This Court has also noted
from respondent's answer </span>that he issued a warrant of arrest, instead of
a mere summons against the accused in said Criminal Case No. 684, as provided
for in Section 9, Rule 112 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent's justification that a warrant of
arrest was issued by him and not merely a summons was because that was what the
accused priest desired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This explanation
is hardly believable to justify the error he committed, by reason of which, one
of the grounds of the <span class="GramE">complaint, that</span> of ignorance of
the law, may seem not to be entirely wanting in factual basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is for having erred to the prejudice of
the accused priest that respondent judge displayed suspicious partiality in favor
of said accused to make up for his error in issuing <span style="">a </span>warrant of arrest instead of a mere
summons as prescribed by the Rules, against the accused, a judicial norm
obviously reprehensible.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the respondent judge
is hereby fined one-month pay, with a stern warning that a similar act or
omission in the future will be dealt with more severely.</p>
