				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This appeal from a conviction of rape presents the rather novel
feature that while appellants Mariano <span class="SpellE">Tigulo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> Velasquez were named in the information, the
decision made clear that the force employed came solely from the former,
complainant <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> <span class="SpellE">Ubaldo</span>
thus being compelled to submit to his carnal desire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The participation of appellant Velasquez was
limited to removing her panties and holding her feet while the sexual act was
being performed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, as found
by the trial Judge, the extent of his cooperation was such that without his
aid, the crime could not have been committed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The defense put up by appellant <span class="SpellE">Tigulo</span> was one
of denial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He alleged that there was an
existing illicit relationship between him and the complainant and that on the
evening in question no rape was committed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to his version, he went at the time and place of assignation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once there, they started kissing each other,
with her allowing him to caress her on various parts of her body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was, however, no opportunity to engage
in sexual intercourse as her mother appeared on the scene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a very exhaustive decision with a detailed
scrutiny of the evidence submitted by both the prosecution and defense, the
then Judge <span class="SpellE">Placido</span> C. Ramos convicted both accused of
the crime of rape and sentenced each of them to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> as well as to the indemni­fication of the
complainant in the sum of P20,000.00, with accessories provided for by
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the gravity of the
penalty imposed on those found guilty of the offense of rape, this Court took
particular pains in scrutinizing carefully the testimonies offered by the complainant
<span style="">as </span>well as the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is justification for the decision
reached.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rape was committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amount of the indemnification though must
be decreased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To that extent, the
judgment is modified.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> <span class="SpellE">Ubaldo</span>
was on the evening of <st1:date year="1969" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1969</st1:date>
in her house in a rather isolated place in a rural site in <span class="SpellE">Pacac</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Guimba</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
With her were her four children, the oldest of <span style="">whom was seven </span>(7) years old.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Her husband was away, working in the house of the <span style="">then </span>Governor of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Sometime about <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">seven o'clock</st1:time>, she
went downstairs to get firewood for the rice she was cooking.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
She was surprised by the sudden appearance of appellant who immediately covered
her mouth, pointed a gun at her<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
and, by means of force took her to a place, east of her house.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
She resisted but to no avail, as the other appellant Velasquez was also there
to help.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
It was the latter, who held her legs and pulled down <span style="">her panties.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Then <span class="SpellE">Tigulo</span> had carnal intercourse with her.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
She could not shout, as he placed one hand on her mouth and the other pinned
down below her nape.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
In the meanwhile, her mother, Francisca <span class="SpellE">Pagaling</span>,
whose house was adjacent,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
heard her grandchildren crying.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
With a flashlight, she looked for <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
She was thus able to observe <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> being ravished.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
The two accused then fled.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The mother was informed of the act perpetrated on her.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Forthwith, they went to <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Magbitang</span>,
a barrio captain of <span class="SpellE">Pacac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Guimba</span>,
to complain.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
On their way, they were accosted by appellant Velasquez with the threat that
they would be killed should he be implicated.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
That led <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> not to include his name in her
complaint to their barrio captain.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
They also went to the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Guimba</span> where
<span class="SpellE">Erlinda's</span> statement was taken.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Upon advice of the Chief of Police,<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> underwent a physical examination in the
provincial hospital at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> conducted by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Flor</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayao</span> the following day.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
She was issued a medical certificate,<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
which revealed the "presence of old healed lacerations at 1,4,5, 6 and 8
at the face of the clock."<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
According to Dr. <span class="SpellE">Dayao</span>, it was possible that the
lacerations were caused by sexual intercourse.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> <span class="SpellE">Ubaldo</span>
filed a complaint of rape against both accused <span class="SpellE">Tigulo</span>
and Velasquez in the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Guimba</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Based on the above testimony where the conviction of both accused
was predicated, the lower court care­fully took into consideration the defense
offered by appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was its
conclusion, however, as earlier pointed out, that the evidence of record
sufficed for a conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To repeat,
such a finding must be accorded credence although the participation of
appellant Velasquez should be that of an accomplice.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. The contention vigorously pressed by appellant <span class="SpellE">Tigulo</span> is that the testimony offered by complainant failed
to overcome the constitutional presumption of innocence.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant could very well rely on such a constitutional guarantee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Time and again this Court has stressed the
significance of such a safe­guard to the rights of an accused person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a leading case of People v. <span class="SpellE">Dramayo</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
it was made clear:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Only if the
judge below and the appellate tribunal could arrive at a conclusion that the
crime had been committed precisely by the person on trial under such an
exacting test should the sentence be one of conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is thus required that every circumstance
favoring his innocence be duly taken into account.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proof against him must survive the test
of reason; the strongest suspicion must not be permitted to sway judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conscience must be satisfied that on the
defendant could be laid the responsibility for the offense charged; that not
only did he perpetrate the act but that it amounted to a crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is required then is moral
certainty."<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">Such a principle has guided this Court
in several recent decisions.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> From the evidence of record, it is quite
apparent that the lower court did not ignore it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stage of moral certainty was certainly
reached.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, such a defense is un­availing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2. To bolster their argument of the consti­tutional presumption of
innocence not having been overcome, appellants would impugn the findings of
fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel did try his best to make
out a case for a reversal but the attempt was unsuccessful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is understandable why.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The principle well-entrenched in our
jurisprudence is that the conclusion reached by the trial judge which has the
opportunity to observe the witnesses testify as to what did transpire is
entitled to full respect unless of course it could be demonstrated that there
was a failure to judge correctly the significance of a fact or circumstance or
what is worse, that it was ignored.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
first case of such consequence, <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
v. Pico,<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
came from the pen of Justice Moreland, a 1910 decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since then, this Court has been committed to
such a view.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, independently of such a doctrine of long standing, the very defenses
offered by the accused would justify the credence that was paid to the evidence
for the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it were true
that there was really an illicit relationship between complainant and appellant
<span class="SpellE">Tigulo</span>, it defies rational explanation why he needed <span style="">to </span>have a companion that night they
were supposed to have an assignation, the very concept of which, especially
where the other party is a married woman, calls for the utmost secrecy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A third party under such circumstances is
decidedly unwelcome.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if only for
the sake of mutual enjoyment, the exclusion of any other participant is of the
essence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet in this case, appellant Velasquez
was clearly identified by the complainant and her mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is worse, there is evidence of his
threat to kill them if they would reveal his participation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His defense of alibi, inherently weak in
itself, is completely discredited.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Clearly then, appellants have not made out a case for acquittal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, appellants Mariano <span class="SpellE">Tigulo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> Velasquez are convicted of the crime of
rape and each of them sentenced to serve the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Each of the accused is likewise sentenced to indemnify the offended
party in the amount of P12,000.00, as well as to suffer the accessory penalties
imposed by<span style="">&nbsp; </span>law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As thus modified, the judgment stands
affirmed.</p>
