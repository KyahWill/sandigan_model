				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="4">April 4, 1963</st1:date>,
twenty-three <span class="SpellE">farmworkers</span> filed a complaint before the
Court of Agrarian Relations of <span class="SpellE">Ne­gros</span> Occidental
against Angel <span class="SpellE">Locsin</span>, owner of thirty-five hectares
of sugar land in <span class="SpellE">Hinigaran</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental for violation of Section 27(5) of Republic Act 1199<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and Section 3 of Republic Act 602.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Alleged therein, among others, were that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="10">October
 19, 1962</st1:date>, complainants joined the Philippine Association of Free
Labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unions, Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Carutay</span> Chapter; on January 18, 1963, they went on an unfair
labor practice strike; that when they offered to return to work on March 13,
1963, <span class="SpellE">Locsin</span> refused to admit them back; as to their
wages, from the time of their employment, they worked everyday, except on
Sundays and holidays, and were paid P1.50 per day, ex­cept eight of them who
worked only for 150 days a year, and who were paid only a daily wage of P1.20
each.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They asked for reinstatement and
differential pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon denial of his motion to dismiss, respondent <span class="SpellE">Loc­sin</span> answered and hearing was held before a Court of
Agra­rian Relations Commissioner, wherein three of plaintiffs' witnesses
testified.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="28" month="8">August 28, 1965</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Locsin</span> moved to dismiss on the ground that the <st1:street><st1:address>Agrarian
  Court</st1:address></st1:street> had no jurisdiction because there was no
preliminary investigation in accordance with Section 5(b) of Republic Act 875,
otherwise known as the Industrial Peace Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Agrarian Court Judge <span class="SpellE">Severiano</span> de
Leon, while ob­serving that Section 27(5) of Republic Act 1199 refers to
tenants and not to the <span class="SpellE">farmworkers</span> such as the
complainants, nevertheless took cognizance of the case for the reason that the
complaint was for unfair labor practice over which it had jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Section 55 of the Agricultural Tenancy Act
allows the application of existing provisions of law not inconsistent with the
Act, the <st1:street><st1:address>Agrarian Court</st1:address></st1:street>
applied Section 5 of Republic Act 875 under which in a suit for unfair labor
practice before the Court of Industrial Relations, a preliminary investigation
is necessary before a complaint is filed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering the absence of this in the present case as a jurisdictional
defect, the complaint was dismissed by the <st1:street><st1:address>Agrarian
  Court</st1:address></st1:street> on <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="9">September
 5, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Their motion for reconsideration having been denied, complainants
appealed to Us, setting forth as issue the necessity of preliminary
investigation before the Court of Agrarian Relations.</p>

<p class="BODY">To put the issue in proper perspective, let us trace the
procedure in both the Court or Agrarian Relations and the Court of Industrial
Relations as regards the matter un­der consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 29, 1936, Commonwealth Act No. 103 created the Court
of Industrial Relations giving it jurisdiction over the entire Philippines,
"to consider, investigate, decide, and settle all questions, matter,
controversies, or disputes arising, between, and/or affecting employers and
employees or laborers and landlords and tenants or farm laborers, and regulate
the relations between them, subject to the provisions of this Act."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Then, industrial laborers and their employers, tenants, landlords and farm
laborers or agricultural workers were all within the Ju­risdiction of the Court
of Industrial Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to
Section 20 of the Act, the court promulgated on <st1:date year="1945" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1945</st1:date> its Rules of Procedure applicable to all
covered by its jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Rules
did not provide for such preliminary investigation prior to the filing of the
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Years after, on <st1:date year="1953" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1953</st1:date>, Republic Act 875 - the
Industrial Peace Act - took effect, which dealt with the relationship between
employer and employee and dis­putes arising therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Act requires among others that a
preliminary investigation be held after the charge for unfair labor practice is
filed as preparatory to the filing of the formal complaint.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Then on <st1:date year="1954" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1954</st1:date>,
came Republic Act 1199, more popularly known as the Agri­cultural Tenancy Act
governing the relations between land­lord and tenant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The jurisdiction as to landlords and tenants
was still in the Court of Industrial Relations until Republic Act 1267 became
effective on June 14, 1955, creating the Court of Agrarian Relations with
"original and exclusive Jurisdiction over the entire Philippines, to
consider, investigate, decide, and settle all questions, matters, controversies
or disputes involving all those re­lationships established by law which
determine the varying rights of persons in the cultivation and use of
agricultural land where one of the parties works the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <st1:street><st1:address>Agrarian Court</st1:address></st1:street>
was given the authority to adopt its rules of procedure<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
and in accordance therewith, the court promulgated<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
its own rules of procedure where nothing was said on the necessity of
preliminary investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the law stood then when the complaint the pre­sent case was
filed on <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1963</st1:date>,
the procedure con­tained in Section 5 of Republic Act 875 could not be ap­plied
to agricultural laborers, since Republic Act 875 was not then applicable to
them.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
The point whether agricul­tural laborers are <u>now</u> covered by Republic Act
875 by vir­tue of the Agricultural Land Reform Code is not being decided here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, in any case, the present suit was filed
before the Agricultural Land Reform Code took effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">The procedure applicable to cases involving agricul­tural
laborers prior to the creation of the Court of Agrarian Relations, was the
Rules of the Court of Industrial Relations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the Court of Agrarian Relations was created on <st1:date year="1955" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1955</st1:date> until the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the Agricul­tural Land Reform Code on <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1963</st1:date>, the procedure for said
cases was that provided for in the Rules of the Court of Agrarian
Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, as stated, was the
procedure applicable when the present suit was filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, finally, since <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1963</st1:date> to the present, the proce­dure
governing agricultural laborers' cases is the Rules of Court by virtue of Sec.
155 of the Agricultural Land Reform Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither the Rules of the Court of Agrarian Relations nor the Rules of
Court require the preliminary investigation in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">The violation of the Minimum Wage law not being one of the
enumerated instances of unfair labor practices, in the second cause of action
wage differential - there is, in any event, no need of preliminary
investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the contention that the Agrarian Court has no
jurisdiction over violations of the Minimum Wage Law, suffice it to say that
Sections 1 and 7 of Republic Act 1267 created the Court of Agrarian Relations
for the enforcement of <u>all</u> laws and regulations governing the relation
of capital and labor on all agricultural lands un­der <u>any</u> system of
cultivation, with exclusive jurisdiction over the entire Philippines to
consider, decide and settle all, questions, matters, controversies or disputes
involving all those relationships established by law.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The question of whether reinstatement or differen­tial pay may be
ordered is a matter that should be deter­mined upon the merits or at least on
consideration of the main case, and not in the resolution of this incident of
the case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the questioned order of dismissal is here­by
reversed and set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This case is
hereby ordered remanded to the Eleventh Regional District of the Court of
Agrarian Relations for further proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No costs.</p>
