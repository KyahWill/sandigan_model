with the qualify</span></span><span style="">ing

<p class="BODY">After trial, the court found all the accused guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the crime of rob­bery in band with homicide without,
however, making a finding on any of the aggravating circumstances <span style="">al</span>leged in the information, instead it
took into consideration the lack of instruction and education in mitigation of
their criminal liability, and sentenced each to a penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, to pay P6,000.00 to the heirs of the
victim, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the
proportionate costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pending their appeal in this Court, <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Condemena</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ricarido</span> causing
and <span class="SpellE">Casamero</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Patiño</span></span><span style=""> </span>withdrew their appeal which was granted in <span style="">a </span>resolution
of the Court of <st1:date year="1964" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the record now stands, only <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Aniel</span> remained as the
appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution has established that on <st1:date year="1962" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1962</st1:date>, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon, <span class="SpellE">Barcelisa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lamoste</span> was sitting by the side of the cradle of her
child facing her husband <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Lamoste</span>
who was on the yard of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their
el­dest daughter, Esmeralda <span class="SpellE">Lamoste</span>, 14 years old at
that time, was at the door of their house together with her younger brothers

<p class="BODY">Suddenly, four men arrived <span style="">at their house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Of these
four, <span class="SpellE">Barcelisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Lamoste</span>
recognized <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Condemena</span>
who had been living in <span class="SpellE">Mambajao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Villaba</span>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>, for quite a long time
as their neighbor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Barcelisa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lamoste</span> did not know the names of the companions of <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Conemena</span>, but she
recognized them by their faces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
witness stand, <span class="SpellE">Barcelisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Lamoste</span>
pointed and identified <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Condemena</span>
to be one of the four men who were in their house on <st1:date year="1962" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1962</st1:date>, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon, the date and approximate time
of the <span style="">commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the words of the trial Judge, "<span class="SpellE">Barcelisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Lamoste</span> also <span class="SpellE">unhesitantly</span> and <span class="SpellE">unmistakenly</span>, </span>in
open court, pointed to the three companions of <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Condemena</span> on that fateful day and time
above-mentioned <span class="GramE">who</span> turned out to bear the names of <span class="SpellE">Ricarido</span> Causing @ <span class="SpellE">Garido</span>, <span class="SpellE">Casamero</span> <span class="SpellE">Patiño</span> and <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Aniel</span>." <span class="GramE">(p. 2, Dec.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">She further testified
that <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Aniel</span> and <span class="SpellE">Casamero</span> <span class="SpellE">Patiño</span> were armed with
guns, and <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Condemena</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Ricarido</span> Causing were armed with bolos when these
four men arrived in their house on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="6" month="10"><span style="">October 6, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, at about </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="18"><span style="">6 o'clock</span></st1:time><span style=""> in the afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That upon their arrival, <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aniel</span> rushed towards her and pointed the gun, about
one foot long, at her face, telling her the following words:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Do not shout.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you shout, I will kill you." <span class="SpellE">Barce<span style="">lisa</span></span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Lamoste</span></span><span style="">, out of
fear, did not in fact shout.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Aniel</span> was thus pointing
the gun at her, the three other men went directly towards where her husband
was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two of them, <span class="SpellE">Casamero</span>
<span class="SpellE">Patiño</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ricarido</span>
Causing, each held the hands of her husband and when resistance from <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Lamoste</span> was already
impossible, <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Condemena</span>,
with the </span><span style="">use </span><span style="">of his bolo, stabbed
her husband on the right side of the breast.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon being hit with the bolo-stab, she heard her husband said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Dong, why did you stab me when I did
not commit any wrong?" After <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Lamoste</span> was stabbed, <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Condemena</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ricarido</span> Causing </span><span style="">and </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cas</span><span style="">amero</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Patiño</span> </span><span style="">dragged her husband towards the kitchen of
the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Condemena</span> stayed outside while <span class="SpellE">Casamero</span>
<span class="SpellE">Patiño</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ricarido</span> Causing
went up the house through the kitchen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Esmeralda <span class="SpellE">Lamoste</span>, who was at the door of the house together with her
young brothers and sisters, saw <span class="SpellE">Ricarido</span> Causing stab
her father with </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">bolo on </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">right breast below the nipple.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Casamero</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Patiño</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ricarido</span> Causing approached <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aniel</span>, </span><span style="">at
the time still pointing </span><span style="">his gun </span><span style="">towards her mother, and demanded </span><span style="">from <span class="SpellE">Barcelisa</span> their money.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her mother, out of fear, pointed to <span class="SpellE">Ricarido</span>
Causing their trunk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ricarido</span>
Causing opened the trunk and took </span><span style="">the
amount of P200.00 from it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Barcelisa</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Lamoste</span> explained
that the money was the proceeds of the <span style="">sale
</span>of </span><span style="">their <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> on October </span><span style="">5, 1962, the day previous to the
incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After taking the money, the
four men, <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Condemena</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Ricarido</span> Causing, <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aniel</span> and <span class="SpellE">Casamero</span> <span class="SpellE">Patiño</span> fled towards the same direction where they had come
from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After they were gone, <span class="SpellE">Barcelisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Lamoste</span> shouted for
help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Crispin <span class="SpellE">Bactol</span>
was the first person who responded to the call for help.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Crispin
<span class="SpellE">Bactol</span> testified that at about 6 o'clock in the
afternoon on October </span><span style="">6, 1962, </span><span style="">he saw </span><span style="">four men going to the house of <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Lamoste</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He recognized </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pelagio</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Condemena</span> to be one of the <span class="GramE">group</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later on, he heard a woman's voice from the
house of <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Lamoste</span>
calling </span><span style="">for help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On his </span><span style="">arrival at the house </span><span style="">of <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Lamoste</span> in answer to the call for help, he saw <span class="SpellE">Fermina</span> <span class="SpellE">Lamoste</span> dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked <span class="SpellE">Barcelisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Lamoste</span> who were the persons who killed her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Barcelisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Lamoste</span> answered that of the four men, she only knew <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Condemena</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Jose P. Burgos, municipal
judge of <span class="SpellE">Villaba</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>,

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant
<span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Aniel</span>, in
exculpation, inter</span><span style="">posed the
defense of alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He presented Benjamin </span><span style="">(<span class="SpellE">Benigno</span>) </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Corpin</span></span><span style="">, a 73-year
old man, who testified that on October 6, 1962, he was in the market fair of <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Muertigue</span> in <span class="SpellE">Wague</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, <span class="GramE">selling</span>
salted fish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His companion on that date
was <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Aniel</span> whom he
</span><span style="">hired
to help him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two of them left <span class="SpellE">Considra</span> (or <span class="SpellE">Consuegra</span>), </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Leyte</span></span><span style="">, at 7:00 o'clock </span><span style="">in the</span><span style=""> <span style="">morning
and returned home to </span></span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Considra</span></span><span style=""> from </span><span style="">the market fair at
5:00 o'clock in the </span><span style="">afternoon of
the same day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They arrived together in
his house at <span class="SpellE">Considra</span> where the two of them took
their meals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then after that, <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Aniel</span> went to his
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Aniel's</span>
house </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">only about 10 to 15 meters away from his
home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Felix <span class="SpellE">Arañez</span>,
Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Villaba</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>,
also testified for the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
testified that on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="7" month="10"><span style="">October 7, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, a day after the robbery and the killing
occurred, he went to the house of <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Lamoste</span> in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mambajao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Villaba</span>, </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Leyte</span></span></span></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
purpose was to investigate the incident which was reported to him by the Barrio
Lieutenant of <span class="SpellE">Cagnocot</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During his in</span>vestigation, <span class="SpellE">Barcelisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Lamoste</span>, wife of the
deceased, informed him that at about 6:00 o'clock in the afternoon of October
6, 1962, there were unidentified persons who went up their house while she was
holding her baby in the cradle; that <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Lamoste</span> was outside the house and when he was bought up the
house, he was already stabbed; that one of them pointed his gun at her; that
she was not able to identify the robbers, not even one, because it <span style="">was </span>already dark; that <span class="SpellE">Barcelisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Lamoste</span> pointed to the
two sons of Segundo Mesa <span style="">as </span>the
persons she suspected to be responsible for the robbery because on the day of
the incident, these two went to their house to buy corn and they promised to
come back the following afternoon; that he investigated the two sons of Segundo
Mesa but he had to release them for lack of evidence; that when he further
asked <span class="SpellE">Barcelisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Lamoste</span>
whether there were other persons who were responsible for the commission of the
crime aside from the two sons of Mesa, she said that she and <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Condemena</span> had a
misunderstanding a week before the crime was committed; that when he found out
later on that this <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Condemena</span>
did not go inside the house, he abandoned the investigation of <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Condemena</span> because he had
received information that before the commission of the crime, <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Condemena</span> had already
abandoned his house in <span class="SpellE">Mambajao</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of these facts, the question before the Court hinges
on whether or not appellant <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Aniel</span> has been sufficiently identified as one of the four
men who participated in the commission of the crime charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense argued that the identification in open court made by <span class="SpellE">Barcelisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Lamoste</span> and her
daughter, Esmeralda <span class="SpellE">Lamoste</span>, should not have been
considered by the trial court as a "positive identification" which
could sustain the conviction of <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Aniel</span> for the crime charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is contended that the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Barcelisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Lamoste</span> that <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Aniel</span> was the person
who pointed the gun at her, while his three other companions killed her husband
and, thereafter, robbed <span style="">their house, was </span><span style="">more than
sufficiently contradicted, </span>rebutted and destroyed by the testimony of
Felix <span class="SpellE">Arañaz</span>, the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Villaba</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, who investigated
the crime the day following the commission of the offense; that the court
should have given credence to the testimony of Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Corpin</span>
with whom <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Aniel</span>
was together on October 6, 1962, from 7:00 o'clock in the morning up to 5:00
o'clock in the <span style="">afternoon, selling
salted fish in the market fair of <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Muertigue</span> in <span class="SpellE">Wague</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, at the time the robbery and killing of <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Lamoste</span> took place; that
while it may be true that this witness was not able to recall the other dates
when he hired <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Aniel</span>
to carry salted fish to <span class="SpellE">Wague</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>,
aside from October 6, 1962, Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Corpin</span> had given
the reason why he particularly remember the hiring of <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aniel</span> on that day, because on that same day, he was
reminded by his son-in-law who for the first time went fishing in <span class="SpellE">Gotosan</span>, and this being the first time his son-in-law
fished in <span class="SpellE">Gotosan</span>, it is not strange that that date
made a deep impression in his memory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court, however, did not believe the testimony of
Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Corpin</span> because he was not able to account
the <span class="SpellE">whereabout</span> of <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aniel</span> after 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon of October
6, 1962, the time they returned home to <span class="SpellE">Considra</span> from
<span class="SpellE">Wague</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the trial court, <span class="SpellE">Corpin</span> was sure that they arrived in <span class="SpellE">Consuegra</span>
(or <span class="SpellE">Considra</span>), <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, at
5:00 o'clock in the afternoon of October 6, 1962, be­cause Juan <span class="SpellE">Delanta</span> told them that it was exactly 5:00 o'clock in the
afternoon when asked by Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Corpin</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On cross-examination, however, <span class="SpellE">Corpin</span> admitted that he treated <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aniel</span> as his son, because <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span>
