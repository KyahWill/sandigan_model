in its CTA Case No. 717, entitled "Armando L. <span class="SpellE">Abad</span>, 
doing business under the trade name of Republic Alcohol Distillery, petitioner, 
vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, respondent".
<p>Briefly, the facts, as gathered from the records of this case and as 
stipulated by the parties, are:</p>
<p>Armando L. <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> is engaged in business as a 
distiller and operates two (2) alcohol distilleries, a bonded warehouse and 
bonded denaturing warehouse. During the period from January, 1955 to August, 
1958, inclusive, he used the total sum of 836,483 proof liters of rectified or 
ethyl <span class="GramE">alcohol<span class="style3"><sup>[</sup></span></span><span class="style3"><sup>1]</sup>,</span> 
without paying the specific tax thereon, in the conversion into, and for the 
production of, specially denatured alcohol. He produced said specially denatured 
alcohol, in and from his bonded denaturing warehouse, in accordance with four 
formulas, acquired by different grantees and duly approved by the Commissioner 
of Internal Revenue, and sold the same to said grantees, who, in turn, used said 
specially denatured alcohol as raw material in the manufacture of various 
non-beverage industrial products, such as varnish, pre-mixed rice, solid alcohol 
fuel, detergents, emulsifiers, industrial solvents, shellac, wood dye, thinner, 
cleansing mixtures, embalming mixtures, barbershop disinfectants like <span class="SpellE">Tonix</span> and <span class="SpellE">bayrum</span>. These products 
contain more than 50% ethyl alcohol by volume, excluding water.</p>
<p>During the same period of January, 1955 to August, 1958, <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> also produced and sold completely denatured alcohol of 
not less than 180 degrees proof (ninety per cent absolute alcohol) for which he 
paid the 7% sales tax on the gross sales; but in the computation of the sales 
tax, he deducted the cost of ethyl alcohol purchased from suppliers and used in 
the manufacture of said completely denatured alcohol, although the distillers 
and sellers of said ethyl alcohol did not pay any specific tax nor did they 
declare their sales for purposes of the sales tax imposed by Section 186 of the 
Tax Code.</p>
<p>On <st1:date year="1958" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1958</st1:date>, 
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue wrote a letter to <span class="SpellE">Abad</span>, assessing and demanding the following: (a) <span class="GramE">As</span> specific tax on the rectified or ethyl alcohol used in the 
production of specially denatured alcohol, computed as follows:</p>

<p>(c) P300.00 as compromise penalty for the loss of his books of accounts and 
records.</p>
<p>In due time, after receipt of the above stated assessment and demand letter, 
<span class="SpellE">Abad</span> contested it; and the case was elevated to the 
Appellate Division of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. After due hearing therein, 
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, in a letter dated October 27, 1959, 
reiterated his previous assessment; hence, <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> filed 
his petition for review in the Court of Tax Appeals, disputing the validity of 
the assessment.</p>
<p>After the filing of the usual answer by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 
the parties submitted the case for decision on a stipulation of facts.</p>
<p>On the basis of this stipulation, the Tax Court rendered its decision, dated 
January 4, 1963, ruling that it having been admitted that the 836,483 proof 
liters of specially denatured alcohol<span class="style3"><sup>[2]</sup></span> 
consist of 50% ethyl alcohol by volume, excluding water, distilled spirits 
compose its chief ingredient; hence, it is subject to specific tax pursuant to 
Section 127, in relation to Section 133, both of the Tax Code; that it also 
having been admitted that said specially denatured alcohol was used as raw 
materials in the manufacture of other products by the different grantees thereof 
and not used in the operation of industries, it is not exempt from specific tax 
under Section 128 of the same Code; and that it having been admitted further 
that <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> himself sold and removed said alcohol, he 
should be held liable for said specific tax, and not the grantees or buyers 
thereof. The same decision, however, held petitioner <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> not liable for deficiency sales tax and surcharge, 
ruling that when ethyl alcohol is sold for use in the production of completely 
denatured alcohol it ceases to be liable for the specific tax imposed by Section 
133 of the Tax Code, and, not being included among the articles taxable under 
sections 184 and 185 of the same Code, the sales of said ethyl alcohol become 
subject to sales tax under section 186; hence, for purposes of computing the 
sales tax due on the sales of completely denatured alcohol pursuant to same 
section 186, the total cost of said ethyl alcohol is deductible from the gross 
selling price thereof, regardless of whether the specific or sales taxes thereon 
had previously been paid or not. Said decision also held <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> not liable for the P300.00 compromise penalty for the 
loss of his books of accounts and records, it having been admitted by respondent 
Commissioner that the same can not be imposed without the consent of the 
taxpayer, and <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> did not give his consent 
thereto.</p>
<p>Petitioner Armando L. <span class="SpellE">Abad</span>, not satisfied with that 
portion of the decision of the Tax Court holding him liable for specific tax on 
the specially denatured alcohol, interposed his appeal to this Court, which was 
docketed as G. R. No. L-20834; while respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue 
filed his separate appeal (which was docketed as G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-20903) against that part of the decision holding <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> not liable for deficiency tax and surcharge.</span></p>
<p>We will first consider <span class="SpellE">Abad's</span> appeal (G. R. No. 
<span class="GramE">L-20834).</span> In this connection, it is unnecessary to 
decide whether or not <span class="GramE">specially</span> denatured alcohol is 
subject to specific tax, an issue which is immaterial and irrelevant to the 
controversy.</p>
<p>The reason is that the specific tax was assessed on the 836,483 proof liters 
of rectified or ethyl alcohol used in the production or manufacture of specially 
denatured alcohol and not on the specially denatured alcohol itself. This is 
evident from respondent Commissioner's letter dated <st1:date year="1958" day="22" month="12">December 22, 1958</st1:date>, and subsequent letter dated 
<st1:date year="1959" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1959</st1:date>, as 
pointed out in the appealed decision (C.T.A. record, p. 173). The pertinent 
portion of each letter is quoted below, for ready reference: </p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"It was also found that you failed to pay the specific tax due on the 
rectified alcohol used in denaturing before removal from your distillery 
premises, in violation of section 124, in relation to sections 127 and 128, all 
of the National Internal Revenue Code." (C.T.A. record, p. 6; BIR record, pp. 
1-2, Annex A, <span class="SpellE">Abad's</span> petition for review) (Emphasis 
supplied)</p>
<p>"It may be stated by way of explanation that the specific tax was assessed on 
the distilled spirits which were used in the production of denatured alcohol in 
the Republic Alcohol Distillery denaturing plant at 270 F. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, Grace Park, <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." 
(Annex "C", <span class="SpellE">Abad's</span> petition for review; CTA record, p. 
58; BIR record, p. 108; underlining supplied for emphasis)</p></blockquote>
<p>Hence, the real issue involved herein is whether or not the 836,483 proof 
liters of rectified or ethyl alcohol used in the production or manufacture of 
specially denatured alcohol is subject to specific tax, and to what extent 
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> is liable for the payment of such 
tax.</p>
<p>During the period of time covered by the assessment of specific tax on the 
rectified or ethyl alcohol in question, i.e., from January, 1955 to August, 
1958, the provisions of the Tax Code governing specific taxes on rectified or 
ethyl alcohol are Sections 124, 127 and 133 of said Tax Code, as amended, to

<p>From Section 133 of the Tax Code, it cannot be disputed that rectified or 
ethyl alcohol falls within the definition or enumeration of the term "distilled 
spirits", and is taxable as such. But during the period that transpired between 
the enactment of Republic Act No. 592 (effective January 1, 1951) and the 
enactment of Republic Act No. 1608 (in force from August 23, 1956 onward) the 
specific tax did not attach to the alcohol upon its coming into existence; 
hence, this Court has ruled that a producer of ethyl alcohol specially denatured 
and sold to <span class="SpellE">permittees</span> of the Collector of Internal 
Revenue is not liable for the tax, but that said tax is to be paid by the 
producer of the taxable finished product (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. 
Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span> Don Pedro, L-14015, May 31, 1960; La 
<span class="SpellE">Tondeña</span>, Inc. vs. Collector of Internal Revenue, G. R. 
L-14336, April 30, 1964). In the La <span class="SpellE">Tondeña</span> case, this 
Court expressly ruled that:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p><span class="GramE">"<em>Judgment</em>.</span> - This appellant is liable; but 
we agree that its liability attached not upon its manufactured ethyl alcohol but 
upon its medicinal product - the rubbing alcohol.</p>
<p>"Accordingly, in the instant case, above petitioner (La <span class="SpellE">Tondeña</span>) shall pay only the specific tax corresponding to 
the quantity of rubbing alcohol it marketed or only on 35,298 proof <span class="GramE">liters.</span> Needless to add, the appellant is not responsible for 
taxes on the alcohol it sold to <span class="SpellE">permittees</span> of the 
Internal Revenue Office." (Emphasis supplied)</p></blockquote>
<p>The Tax Court sought to differentiate the case of Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span> Don Pedro from that of herein petitioner <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> by pointing out that, in the former, the specially 
denatured alcohol "was removed by the buyers, while in the present case, the 
removal was made by the petitioner himself" . We find this alleged difference to 
be unsubstantial, because the parties expressly stipulated that <span class="SpellE">Abad's</span> alcohol was manufactured and denatured "for the uses 
applied for by the grantees thereof, and duly approved by the respondent 
commissioner" (<span class="SpellE">Stip</span>. p. 4). Since the alcohol was 
produced and denatured for the particular use of the grantees or <span class="SpellE">permittees</span> to whom it was sold, and conformably to their 
requirements, the removal of the alcohol was done by <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> only as an agent of the buyers for whom the alcohol was 
destined from the start. Removal by <span class="SpellE">Abad</span>, therefore, 
was in law removal by the buyers, and the Central Don Pedro and the La <span class="SpellE">Tondeña</span> rulings by this Court are fully applicable.</p>
<p>During the period from January, 1955 to August 22, 1956, when Republic Act 
1608 became effective, the record discloses that <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> 
used for <span class="SpellE">denaturation</span> and sale the following 
quantities of rectified or ethyl alcohol, computed as follows:</p>

distilled spirits, such as rectified or ethyl alcohol, produced or manufactured

<p>And it being undisputed that said rectified or ethyl alcohol is distilled 
spirits if within the meaning of Section 133 of the Tax Code <span class="style3"><sup>[4<span class="GramE">]<span style="vertical-align: baseline;"> 
,</span></span></sup></span>and that by Republic Act No. 1608 the specific tax 
attaches to this substance as soon as it is in existence as such; then 
petitioner Armando L. <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> should be required to pay 
the above computed tax of P111,116.00 assessed on the 179,750 proof liters of 
rectified or ethyl alcohol produced by him from August 23, 1956 to August of 
1958.</p>
<p>However, appellant <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> claims exemption from 
specific tax on the theory that the mixing of denatured alcohol with other 
materials, resulting into rubbing alcohol, varnish, <span class="SpellE">bayrum</span>, lacquer, etc., constitutes use in arts in 
industries, that is, frees the alcohol from Tax under Section 128 of the Tax 
Code:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"SEC. 128 - <em>Exemption in favor of domestic denatured alcohol</em>. - 
Domestic alcohol of not less than one hundred eighty degrees proof (ninety <span class="SpellE">percentum</span> absolute alcohol) may, when denatured, be 
withdrawn from a registered distillery or bonded warehouse without the 
prepayment of the specific tax prescribed in section 133, for the purpose of 
being used for fuel, or light, or for use generally in the arts, industries, 
hospitals sanitaria, and clinics or for research or experimental purposes, or 
for the official use of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines or its 
instrumentalities or political subdivisions. (As amended by Republic Act No. 
1608, approved August 23, 1956)"</p></blockquote>
<p>We agree with the Tax Court that this claim of appellant is untenable. Under 
the facts, as stipulated, what is used or is marketed for use in arts and 
industries is not the denatured alcohol (as required by Section 128), since it 
loses its identity upon mixture or combination with other materials; what comes 
into use is the resultant product, which is different from the denatured alcohol 
itself.</p>
<p>The argument that a narrow interpretation of the exemption has favored 
imported isopropyl alcohol is a consideration that should be addressed to the 
Legislature and not to the courts that are not authorized to view laws from the 
standpoint of their results. It is well settled that tax exemptions, as 
exceptions to the general rule, are not favored, and can not be presumed nor 
created by implication (Collector vs. Manila Jockey Club, 98 Phil. 670, 676; 
Song <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span> Chocolate Factory vs. Central Bank, 54 Off. 
<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Gaz</span></span><span class="GramE">. 
615).</span></p>
<p>Lastly, the claim that the tax on distilled spirits is collectible only on 
spirits fit for consumption has been also rejected by our decision in La <span class="SpellE">Tondeña</span> vs. Collector of Internal Revenue, G.R. No. L-14336, 
<st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1964</st1:date>.</p>
<p>Coming now to the appeal of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (G. R. 
L-20903): the only issue therein posed is whether or not the cost of ethyl 
alcohol purchased from other distilleries and used in the manufacture of 
completely denatured alcohol by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> is 
deductible from the gross selling price of said completely denatured alcohol in 
computing the 7% sales tax imposed by Section 186 of the National Internal 
Revenue Code. In deciding this point, the lower court opined that it was so 
deductible.</p>
<p>Respondent Commissioner assails the conclusion of the lower court, contending 
that under Section 164 of the Tax Code the purpose of the requirement of posting 
a bond before ethyl alcohol is withdrawn or removed for denaturing for use as 
fuel, light, and other purposes enumerated in Section 128 of the same Code is to 
free the distiller or producer thereof from paying any internal revenue tax, 
whether specific tax or percentage sales tax; that the sale of said ethyl 
alcohol is not subject to sales tax under Section 186 nor under Section 189 of 
the same Code, it not being one of the articles taxable under the latter 
section; and this coupled with the admitted fact that the distiller or producer 
of said ethyl alcohol did not declare their sales, nor paid the sales tax 
thereon (citing the Tan Chiu case), petitioner <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> is 
precluded from deducting the cost of said ethyl alcohol from the gross selling 
price of the completely denatured alcohol, for purposes of computing the 7% 
sales tax imposed by Section 186 of the Tax Code.</p>
<p>If the completely denatured alcohol is free from specific tax, yet the ethyl 
alcohol from which it is made, though not listed as subject to sales tax under 
Sections 184, 185 and 185-A of the Tax Code, becomes subject to sales tax under 
the first part of Section 186, and its cost is deductible in the computation of 
the sales tax under the last part or proviso of the same section. It will be 
noted that the terms of Section 186 (first portion) are sufficiently broad to 
cover sales of such ethyl alcohol: </p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p><span class="GramE">"SEC. 186.</span> <em>Percentage tax on sales of other 
articles </em>- There shall be levied, assessed and collected once only on every 
original sale, barter, exchange, and similar transaction either for nominal or 
valuable considerations, intended to transfer ownership of, or title to, the 
articles not enumerated in sections one hundred and eighty-four and one hundred 
and eighty-five a tax equivalent to seven per centum of the gross selling price 
or gross value in money of the articles so sold, bartered, exchanged, or 
transferred, such tax to be paid by the manufacturer or producer: Provided, That 
where the articles subject to tax under this section are manufactured out of 
materials likewise subject to tax under this section and one hundred and 
eighty-nine the total cost of such materials, as duly established, shall be 
deductible from the gross selling price or gross value in money of such 
manufactured articles." (<span class="GramE">first</span> paragraph, National 
Internal Revenue Code, as amended)</p></blockquote>
<p>The Tax Court, therefore, correctly held that the sales of said ethyl alcohol 
to <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> are subject to sales tax under the first part 
of Section 186, already quoted; wherefore, the cost thereof is deductible from 
<span class="SpellE">Abad's</span> gross selling price of the completely denatured 
alcohol made from it, for purposes of computing the 7% sales tax due on the 
latter.</p>
<p>The same result obtains when it is considered that, under Section 188(a) of 
the Tax Code, transactions in commodities subject to taxes under Title IV of the 
Code (specific taxes) are to be excluded in computing the sales tax under 
Sections 184 to 186. Since the alcohol was purchased by <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> before it was denatured, it was then subject to 
specific tax, and its cost should be deducted from the computation of the sales 
tax due on the sale of the denatured alcohol.</p>
<p>The fact that <span class="SpellE">Abad's</span> suppliers of ethyl alcohol did 
not pay sales tax thereon is no reason for burdening <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> with said tax.</p>
<p>The Commissioner's contention that the bond required under Section 164 is 
answerable for all kinds of internal revenue taxes is too far-fetched and not 
tenable because the evident purpose of said bond is to make it answerable only 
for specific taxes in the event that the producer of the denatured alcohol will 
not use the distilled spirits for the purpose or the uses described in Section 
128 (light, fuel, etc.), when it is allowed to be withdrawn under bond. </p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p><span class="GramE">"SEC. 128.</span> <em>Exemption in favor of domestic

be transferred under bond under conditions prescribed in the regulations of the 
Department of Finance. (As amended by Republic Act No. 1608, approved Aug. 23, 
1956)"</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="GramE">The Tan Chiu case, G. R. No.</span> L-15008, January 28, 
1961, relied upon by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is not applicable to 
the case at bar, the ruling in that case being that the cost of the raw 
materials was not allowed to be deducted from the gross selling price of the 
finished product, not because there was non-payment of the sales tax, but 
because the raw materials there were expressly exempted from taxes as used by 
new and necessary industries (Rep. Act No. 901), and no sales tax was naturally 
expected to be paid thereon.</p>
