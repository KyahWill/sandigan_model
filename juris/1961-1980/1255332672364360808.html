				<H3>ROMAN TOLEDO, ET AL., PETITIONERS AND APPELLANTS, VS. COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS (8TH REGIONAL DISTRICT) BACOLOD CITY, ET AL., RESPONDENTS AND APPELLEES. <BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for review under section 13 of Republic
  Act No. 1267, as amended by Republic Act No. 1409, of.
  a judgment rendered on 27 May 1959 by the Court of
  Agrarian Relations 8th Regional District, Bacolod City,
  in CAR cases Nos. 148, 172, 178, 220, 289, 293, 294,
  295 and 296.
<p> In CAR cases Nos. 289, 293, 294, 295 and 296 the
    respondents were declared in default for failure to answer
    within the reglementary period and the petitioners allowed
    to submit their evidence before a commissioner of the
    court. The other cases enumerated above were jointly
    tried.</p>
<p> It appears that on 8 August 1956 Jose Rongo brought
  an action against Bernardino Erillana for ejectment and
  recovery of the plaintiff's share in the produce of Lot3
  Nos. 743 and 748 of the cadastral survey of Pontevedra
  situated in the municipality of La Castollana, Negros Occidental, in the crop year 1956-1957 (CAR case No. 148).
  Rongo alleged that defendant Erillana was his tenant or
  share cropper (about three hectares of Lot No. 743 where
  defendant planted rice and about a hectare of Lot No. 748
  where he planted corn on the sharing ratio of 3/5 for
  the tenant and 2/5 for the landholder of the net produce)
  and that in 1956-1957 the defendant unlawfully refused
  to deliver the share of the plaintiff in the crop of corn;
  and for that reason he prayed that the defendant because 
  he had refuse to recognize the plaintiff as owner of the
  land be ejected therefrom and required to render a liquidation of the corn crop, to deliver the plaintiff's share
    in the rice to be harvested the following November 1956. In his answer the defendant denied being a share cropper
    of the plaintiff and alleged that he was tenant of Roman
    Toledo and the other heirs of Silvestra Lubrico.</p>
<p>On 3 November 1956 a group composed of Loreto Perez,
  Bernardino Erillana, Daniel Mercurio, Gervasio Hilario
  and Margarita Hilario appeared as plaintiffs in a petition
  docketed as CAR case No. 172 against Roman Toledo
  and Jose Rongo for the delivery of their shares as tenants
  of Roman Toledo in Lot No. 743. The petition was signed
  by all the plaintiffs except Daniel Mercurio. In an affidavit (Annex B; p. 91, record of CAR case No. 172)
  respondent Roman Toledo admitted the existence of
  tenancy relation on Lot No. 743 between him and the
  plaintiffs. However, respondent Jose Rongo denied such
  tenancy relation, objected to the petition and prayed for
  its dismissal, and alleged that in May 1955 Roman Toledo.
  and Gcrvasio Hilario forcibly entered upon a part of Lot
  No. 743 (about four hectares) and for that reason an
  action of forcible entry was brought against them, and		
		    
						
				    
		
		    that during that time the action was pending Roman
  Toledo, Gervasio Hilario, Loreto Perez, Margarita Hilario
  and many others forcibly entered upon and occupied
  additional part of Lot No. 743, thereby dispossessing the
  tenants of Jose Rongo and Perpetuo Fuerto who are the
  registered owners and in possession thereof. Hence, he
  further prayed that the plaintiffs or petitioners be ordered to vacate the parts of the lot unlawfully entered
  upon and occupied by them.  </p>
<p>On 17 November 1956 Daniel Mercurio filed a complaint
  against Roman Toledo and Jose Rongo for the delivery
  to him (Mercurio) of his share of 70% of the palay
  produced as tenant of Felix P. Amante in a part of Lot
  No. 743 (CAR Case No. 178). Felix P. Amante appeared
  as an intervenor and asked for delivery of his share as
  landholder of petitioner Daniel Morcurio. Respondent
  Roman Toledo objected to the claim of the intervenor
  alleging that the petitioner was his tenant and not intervenor's.</p>
<p>On 3 January 1957 CAR case No. 220 was filed by Gervasio Hilario,
Margarita Hilario, Agaton Francisco, Jovito Aguilar, Valentin Galida,
Basilio de las Marias, Lorenzo Tuario, Aquilino Caballero, Felipe
Ibañez, Nicolas
Pisca, Bernardino Erillana, Loreto Perez, Alfredo Perez and Alfredo
Manalo against Roman Toledo for the delivery to them as tenants of
respondent Roman Toledo in Lot No. 743 of their shares in the harvest
during the crop year 1956-1957. In his answer Roman Toledo admitted tne
tenancy relation between him and the plaintiffs and offered no
objection to their prayer; whereas Felix P. Amante, Daniel Mercurio,
Tereso Teologo, Eugenio Medina, Alejandro Quiatchon, Ceferino
Quiatchon, Avelino Jeruta and Carlos Ocido appeared as intervenors and
objected to the petition, alleging that Daniel Mercurio was the tenant
of Felix Amante and other intervenors, of Jose Rongo in Lot No. 743. </p>
<p>From 13 to 16 March 1957 cases for reinstatement
    Were filed and docketed in the same court as follows: </p>
<p>CAR Case No. 289 filed by Avelino Jeruta as petitioner
        against Loreto Perez, Porfirio Regalado, Nicolas Pisca,
        Lucio Balar and Roman Toledo as respondents; </p>
<p>CAR Case No. 293 filed by Alejandro Quiatchon as
      petitioner against Bernardino Erillana, Salvador Cuevas,
      Valentin Galida, Arturo Dulana, Alfredo Manalo, Agaton
      Francisco and Reman Toledo as respondents; </p>
<p>CAR Case No. 294 filed by Ceferino Quiatchon as petitioner against Felipe Ibañez, Emilio Osorio and Roman
    Toledo as respondents;    </p>
<p>CAR Case No. 295 filed by Tereso Teologo as petitioner
    against Porfirio Regalado and Roman Toledo as respondents; and    </p>
<p>CAR Case No. 296 filed by Eugenio Medina as petitioner
    against Porfirio Regalado and Roman Toledo as respondents.    </p>
<p>All the petitioners in these last enumerated cases alleged,
    that they were tenants of Jose Rongo in Lot No. 743
    but were dispossessed by the respondents. As stated
    at the beginning of this opinion, having failed to answer
    within the reglementary period the respondents were
    declared in default and the petitioners allowed to present
    their evidence.    </p>
<p>In CAR Case Nos. 148, 172, 178 and 220, counsel for
    all the parties agreed during the trial that the evidence
    taken in one case will be deemed taken for all other cases.
    After trial the Court of Agrarian Relations, 8th Regional District, Bacolod City, rendered judgment the
    dispositive part of which is, as follows:    </p>

</blockquote><p>SO ORDERED. <br></p>
<p>Hence, this appeal.    </p>
<p>On 19 February 1960 by resolution of this Court the
    petitioners were allowed to litigate as paupers and the
    appeal given due course.  </p>
<p>The petitioners in their appeal assign twelve errors!
  allegedly committed by the respondent Court of Agrarian
  Relations, to wit:  </p>
<p></p><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>The respondent Court erred in assuming jurisdiction over former civil case (8806) and declaring boldly that on October 20;
  1936, Silvestra Lubrico and her husband Gregorio Armenio sold all
  their 9 parcels of land aforementioned to Jose Rongo and Perpetuo
  Puerto and making conclusion therein that the balance unpaid
  amounting to P28,000 was made subsequently, thereby making a
  new decision over the ownership of the parcels of land in question,		
		    
				
				    
		
		    specially that this matter is <span style="font-style: italic;">sub judice</span> in Civil Case No. 3801,
  now pending before the Court of Appeals, (Pp. 7-10, Decision)<p></p>
<p> </p></li><li>The respondent court (CAR) erred in declaring that civil
  case No. 8806 was dismissed by the Court of First Instance of
  Negros Occidental on February 14, 1947, when said incident is
  now one of the subjects in Civil Case No. 3801, pending before
  the Court of Appeals, and in not holding that the case is <span style="font-style: italic;">sub
  judice,</span> and that the respondent Court has no jurisdiction to pass
  judgment on the legality or finality of the decision of the ordinary
  court over the titles of the land including Lot No. 743, from where
  the palay in question has been raised, (p. 15, Decision).<p></p>
<p> </p></li><li>The respondent Court (CAR) erred in holding that Roman
  Toledo and Aquilino Caballero in May, 1955, occupied and took
  possession of a portion of four (4) hectares of Lot No. 743, in
  knowingly open contradiction of the complaint for forcible entry
  Case No. 3564 (Exh. 1—Toledo) filed by respondents Jose Kongo
    and Perpetuo Puerto, while same respondent Court admitted that
    said forcible entry case was dismissed by the Court of First
    Instance on July 3, 1959 (Exh. 2—Toledo, pp. 15-16, Decision). <p></p>
<p></p></li><li>The respondent Court erred in not holding that Roman Toledo
    and Aquilino Caballero are in possession of the whole Lot No.
    743 in question, for purposes of the tenancy law and in not holding
    that the tenants of Roman Toledo and Aquilino Caballero, co-petitioners herein, are the tenants of the Lot No. 743 in question
    and that this situation must be maintained in status quo until
    the issues of possession and of ownership in forcible entry case
    No. 3564 and civil case No. 3801, respectively, shall have been
    determined by the appellate court.<p></p>
<p></p></li><li> The respondent Court erred in holding that sections 7 and
    21 of R. A. No. 1409 work against petitioners, Roman Toledo
    and Aquilino Caballero, including their tenants, when in fact these
    sections work in favor of said petitioners and should be valid
    grounds in not entertaining the claim of Joce Rongo and Porpetuo
    Puerto (pp. 30-31, Decision).<p></p>
<p> </p></li><li>The respondent Court erred in holding that the pendency
    of forcible entry Case No. 3564, involving the possession of Lot
    No. 743, does not preclude any claim of adverse possession of
    Jose Rongo and Perpetuo Puerto, and in not dismissing their
    respective complaints and interventions for want of jurisdiction.    <p></p>
<p></p></li><li>The respondent Court erred in not recognizing Roman
    Toledo and Aquilino Caballero, as the landlords and the co-petitioners
    herein as their tenants in Lot No. 743, and in not dismissing the		
		    
				
				    
		
		    
claims of Jose Rongo and Perpetuo Puerto and the latters pretended
    tenants therein.<p></p>
<p> </p></li><li>The Court erred in allowing the admission of the intervention of Jose Rongo, Felix P. Amante, in Case No. 220 and in
    not dismissing Cases Nos. 289, 293, 294, 295 and 296 for want
    of jurisdiction.    <p></p>
<p></p></li><li>The respondent Court erred in partly awarding some produce
      of the palay to Jose Kongo, Perpetuo Puerto and Felix P. Amante
      and their pretended tenants (petitioners in CAR Cases Nos. 148,
      178, 289, 293, 294, 295 and 296) and partly to Roman Toledo and
      Aquilino Caballero and the latter tenants, when the evidence,
      discloses that the latter are and have been in possession of the
      land in question (Lot No. 743) even assuming only, from 1955,
      when the forcible entry case was filed. <p></p>
<p></p></li><li>The respondent Court erred in not giving all the palay
    raised in Lot No. 743 from all the harvest since 1956 and until
    now to Roman Toledo, Aquilino Caballero and their tenants, co-petitioners in CAR Cases Nos. 172, 178 and 220.    <p></p>
<p></p></li><li>The respondent Court erred in not declaring that it had no
    jurisdiction in entertaining the intervention filed by Jose Rongo,
    Perpetuo Puerto, Felix P. Amante and their pretended tenants 
    CAR Case No. 220, (and) as weli as in allowing the admission
    of CAR Cases Nos. 289, 293, 294, 295 and 296; in denying the
    motions for dismissal filed by Roman Toledo, Aquilino Caballero
    and their tenants, and in declaring the petitioners in these cases
    in default in spite of non-receipt of any order relative to their
    motion for reconsideration.<p></p>
<p> </p></li><li>The Court erred in not declaring that the evidence adduced
    during the hearing indicates that herein appellants have proven
    their case with preponderance in their favor.    <p></p></li></ol></blockquote>
<p>Aware of its limited jurisdiction, the respondent court
    did not pass upon the matter of ownership of title to
    the land in litigation. All it did was to determine the
    legal possession of the land in controversy and ascertain
    who was the landholder. And in so doing, it could take into account the fact that respondents Jose Rongo and
    Perpetuo Puerto are the registered owners of Lot No. 743,
    as evidenced by transfer certificate of title No. RT-8334		
		    
				
							    
		
			    
		
		     (31039) issued in their names (Exhibit A-Rongo), in
    lieu of original certificate of title No. 30617 issued in
    the name of Silvestra Lubrico (Exhibit B-Rongo), their
    predecesspr-in-interest.    </p>
<p>The respondent Court of Agrarian Relations is by law
    vested with the "original and exclusive jurisdiction to
    consider, investigate, decide and settle all questions,
    matters, controversies or disputes involving all those
    relationships established by law * * *" which, of course,
    include dispossession of the tenanted agricultural land
    committed by third parties. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="STYLE2 STYLE1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> Hence, as all these cases
    are about tenancy the respondent court is the only court
    that can take cognizance of them, regardless of the fact
    that there is an action of forcible entry brought involving
    controversy on possession of the land subject of the
    action.</p>
<p> The respondent court committed no reversible error
    in allowing the intervention of certain parties and ordering the dismissal of the other cases, it appearing
    that the intervenors have an interest in the subject-matter
    of the litigation and that the claims dismissed by the
    respondent court were untenable. By allowing parties to
    intervene, multiplicity of suits are avoided.</p>
<p> The other errors assigned by the appellants raise questions of
facts. The review by this Court of such questions "shall be limited to
* * * findings of fact when the decision is not supported by
substantial evidence." <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="STYLE2 STYLE1"><sup>[2]</sup></span> Such is not
    the review asked by the appellants.    </p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, without
      pronouncement as to costs.	    </p>
