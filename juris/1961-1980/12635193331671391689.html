				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">By the instant petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>
with pre­liminary injunction, the petitioner National Investment and Develop­ment
Corporation (hereinafter referred to as the NIDC) impugns three orders issued by
the respondent Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> in
civil case Q-8407, namely, (1) an order dated May 28, 1968 dismissing the
appeal of the NIDC from that court's order dated March 31, 1967 which directed
the cancellation of the annotation, on several certificates of title involved
in the said case, of the assignment of mortgage rights made by the Philippine
Commer­cial and Industrial Bank (hereinafter referred to as the PCIB), a
defendant in the said civil case, in favor of the NIDC, the respondent Judge
stating that since the NIDC had not been properly substituted for PCIB and the
latter had failed to perfect an appeal from the order of March 31, 1967,
therefore, the appeal which was taken by the NIDC was ineffective, and moreover
filed out of time; (2) an order dated November 9, 1968 directing the NIDC to
sur­render to the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City
the certificates of title over parcels of land involved in the said civil case
which the lower court, in a judgment rendered therein which had already become
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, ordered <span class="SpellE">reconveyed</span>
to the herein private respondents (the spouses <span class="SpellE">Basilisa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Roque</span> and Francisco Bautista, <span class="SpellE">Leonila</span>
Sanchez and Benjamin N. Bonus, Aurora Sanchez and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>, Carmelita Sanchez and Francisco Ignacio, <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> Sanchez, Leonardo Sanchez and <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> Village Subdivision), plaintiffs in the case below,
subject, however, to the mortgage executed in favor of the PCIB by the
defendant therein, <span class="SpellE">Araceli</span> W. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
de del Rosario; and (3) an order dated January 27, 1969 declaring as cancelled
and null and void the cer­tificates of title involved in the mentioned civil
case which were then held by the NIDC, for failure of the latter to comply with
the respondent Judge's order of November 9, 1968 requiring the NIDC to surrender
the said title certificates to the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The essential facts are undisputed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in July, 1963 the private respondents herein sold
several lots registered in their names to <span class="SpellE">Araceli</span> W. <span class="SpellE">vda</span>. de del Rosario who, after securing registration of the
said lots in her name, mortgaged them to the PCIB.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Del Rosario failed to com­plete payment of
the purchase price agreed upon, for which reason, on <st1:date year="1964" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1964</st1:date>, the herein private
respondents filed a complaint against her and the PCIB for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
to them of the said lots or rescission of the contracts of sale exe­cuted
thereon and the cancellation of the mortgages held by the PCIB.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1965</st1:date>
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> rendered summary judgment directing the
rescission of the contracts of sale adverted to above and the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of the lots in dispute covered by <span class="SpellE">TCTs</span> 70809, 70813, 70814 and 76401 to 76472.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rescission of the purchase contracts on
the lots was, however, declared to be without prejudice to the rights of the
PCIB thereon which was adjudged as a mortgagee in good faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court reserved for a separate
hearing the parties' respective claims for damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">This decision of the trial court was appealed to this Court by
del Rosario in L-24873.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal was,
however, dismissed on <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="9">September 23,
 1966</st1:date> because it was taken out of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No appeal was interposed by the private
respondents herein with respect to the portion of the lower court's decision in
favor of the PCIB.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1965</st1:date>
the PCIB foreclosed its mortgage on the lots covered by <span class="SpellE">TCTs</span>
70809, 70813 and 70814.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the auction
sale, it appeared as the highest bidder; on <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1965</st1:date> the certificate of sale issued in its
favor was duly registered.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1966</st1:date>
the PCIB assigned its mortgage rights over the lots covered by <span class="SpellE">TCTs</span> 70809, 70813, 70814 and 76401 to 76472 to the NIDC, as
well as its rights as highest bidder for the lots covered by the first three
titles mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This assignment was
duly inscribed and annotated at the back of the certificates of title concerned
on <st1:date year="1966" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1966</st1:date>
the private respondents filed with the trial court, in the same civil case
Q-8407, a motion to cancel the encumbrance held by the NIDC appearing at the
back of <span class="SpellE">TCTs</span> 76401 to 76472 and 70809.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The private respondents alleged in their
motion that del Rosario had negotiated a loan with the NIDC by virtue of which
the latter assumed the payment of, and did pay, del Rosario's mortgage
indebtedness to the PCIB.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this
reason, and for the further reason that there was no <span class="SpellE">privity</span>
of contract between them and del Rosario and the PCIB concerning the said
indebtedness, the private respondents maintained that the mortgage lien of the
PCIB over the lots sub­ject of their motion was thereby discharged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They further argued that the mortgage lien
has been extinguished because when it as­sumed payment of the indebtedness of
del Rosario to the PCIB, the NIDC was aware of the respondents' claim over the
lots in question which was annotated at the back of the certificates of title
in dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lastly, the respondents
contended that their claim is superior to that of the NIDC under the provisions
of articles 2242 (2) and 2243 of the new Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respond­ents served a copy of this motion
on the NIDC.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="19" month="11">November 19, 1966</st1:date>,
at the hearing on the above motion, the NIDC, through counsel, having been
notified thereof, entered its appearance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The respondent Judge at the said hearing gave the NIDC opportunity to
file its written opposition to the motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 20, 1966 the NIDC filed its written opposi­tion,
claiming that it merely stepped into the shoes of the PCIB as an assignee and
that the private respondents must respect its rights as such assignee in the
same manner that they would respect the rights of the PCIB the adjudication
regarding which, it was alleged, had already long become final when they were
acquired by the NIDC, citing article 1625 of the new Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1967</st1:date>
the private respondents filed a rejoinder on the above opposition, furnishing
the NIDC a copy of the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1967</st1:date>
the respondent Judge issued an order granting the private respondents' motion
to cancel the encum­brance of the NIDC from the certificates of title in
dispute, reasoning as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"... There is no question that the deed of assignment in
question is valid between the defendant Bank and the National Investment &amp;
Development Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this court,
however, is not inclined to sustain <span class="SpellE">incumbrancer's</span>
view; first, it should have submitted the deed of assignment for approval of
the Court knowing that the sub­ject-matter of the said deed of assignment is in
<span class="SpellE"><u>custodia</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">legis</span></u>,
and so that the consent of all the parties plaintiffs could be taken; second,
the payment of the mortgage debt of defendant Del Rosario by the National
Investment &amp; Development Corporation to the PCI Bank extin­guished the
plaintiff's obligation to respect the mortgage lien of the PCI Bank; and third,
the NIDC could ask for reimbursement of its ex­penses and the amount it has
paid to the PCI Bank from defendant Del Rosario.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it is more on equity and justice as
well as in law that the <span class="SpellE">incumbrancer</span> should not
enforce its rights against the plaintiffs who, in the first place, were not
benefited by the mort­gage debt incurred by defendant Del Rosario."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">A copy of this order was, however, not
furnished the NIDC, although the PCIB was served a copy thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1967</st1:date>
the respondent Judge issued another order directing the NIDC to surrender the
certificates of title in dispute to the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City in order that its order of <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1967</st1:date> could be implemented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The NIDC filed a motion for reconsideration
on the ground that the issuance of the order was premature for it had not yet
received a copy of the court's order of <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="3">March
 31, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The private
respondents opposed the said motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1967</st1:date>
the NIDC received a copy of the respondent court's order dated <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The NIDC then filed, on October 16, 1967, Or
27 days from its receipt of the said order, a motion for reconsideration
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1968" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1968</st1:date> the NIDC received another order from the
respondent court dated <st1:date year="1967" day="29" month="12">December 29,
 1967</st1:date> denying its motion for reconsideration "for lack of
merit."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="9" month="1">January 9, 1968</st1:date>
the NIDC filed with the court below a notice of appeal on "purely
questions of law" from the order of <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1967</st1:date> and an appeal bond; on <st1:date year="1968" day="11" month="1">January 11, 1968</st1:date> it filed its record on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 7, 1968 the private respondents filed with the lower
court a motion to dismiss the appeal of the NIDC stating (a) that the appeal
was filed out of time since the PCIB did not appeal from the appealed order and
the NIDC had not been pro­perly substituted for the PCIB as a party in the case
(citing section 20, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court and <span class="SpellE">Oria</span>
<span class="SpellE">Hermanos</span> vs. Gutierrez <span class="SpellE">Hermanos</span>,
52 Phil. 156 (1928) and <span class="SpellE">Feltalino</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Sanz</span>, 44 Phil. (1923)); and (b) that the appeal is
frivolous and dilatory because the trial court's decision ordering <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> to the private respondents of the lots in
dispute by del Rosario had long become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The NIDC opposed this motion, contending that
it had acquired the necessary personality in civil case Q-8407 by virtue of the
respondents' and the lower court's recognition thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="28" month="5">May 28, 1968</st1:date>
the respondent Judge issued an order dismissing the appeal interposed by the
NIDC for reasons substan­tially identical to those adduced by the private
respondents in their motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="3" month="7">July 3, 1968</st1:date>
the NIDC filed a motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of its
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was denied on <st1:date year="1968" day="18" month="12">Decem­ber 18, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on September 12, 1968, the NIDC received a copy of a
petition of the private respondents to declare <span class="SpellE">TCTs</span>
70809, 70813, 70814 and 76401 to 76472 null and void for failure of the NIDC to
surrender the certificates of title in question to the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City "in order that the deeds of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> executed by the Clerk of Court and orders of
this Honorable Court may be given due course for registration..."</p>

<p class="BODY">The NIDC opposed this petition, alleging that to grant it will
amount to enforcement of the lower court's order of <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1967</st1:date> which had not yet become final and
<span class="SpellE">executory</span> as the NIDC had appealed within the
prescribed period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was also pointed
out by the NIDC that its motion for reconsideration of the order dismissing its
appeal had not as yet been resolved.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="9" month="11">November 9, 1968</st1:date>
the respondent Judge issued another title order requiring the NIDC to surrender
the certificates of title in dispute to the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City within five days, otherwise the said
certificates would be declared null and void.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The NIDC filed a motion for reconsideration of this order on the ground
that its motion for reconsideration of the order dismissing its appeal had not
up to that time been resolved.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 27, 1969 the NIDC received a copy of a "Mani­festation"
dated January 21, 1969 wherein the private respondents prayed for the
cancellation of the mentioned certificates of title on the ground that the NIDC
had already received a copy of the order of the respondent Judge dated December
18, 1968 denying the motion for reconsideration of the NIDC dated November 19,
1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It turned out, however (as
explained by the NIDC in one of its pleadings filed with this Court), that
while the NIDC did receive on January 13, 1969 the said order dated December
18, 1968, the same was overlooked because the copy of the said order sent by
the respondent Judge was stapled beneath two other orders also dated December
18, 1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of these orders which was
stapled on top of the others, was in connection with another case (civil case
10636) involving the same parties herein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to the NIDC, it was thought that the papers stapled beneath
were mere copies of the order in the said civil case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The third order, similarly dated, was an
order denying the <span class="SpellE">NIDC's</span> motion for reconsideration
of the respondent Judge's order dismissing its appeal from the order of March
31, 1967.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 30, 1969 the counsel of the NIDC went to the lower
court to inquire if it had already acted upon the said
"Manifestation"; and there and then he was served a copy of an order
dated January 27, 1969, declaring <span class="SpellE">TCTs</span> 70809, 70813,
70814 and 76401 to 76472 null and void and cancelled.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The submission of the
parties for resolution by this Court involves mainly the question of whether
the petitioner has legal personality to appeal the order <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
dated March 31, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the answer be
in the affirmative, then the order of the respondent Judge dismissing the
appeal and all his subsequent orders adverse to the petitioner will not avail
the private respondents any.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not think, however, that this is the real issue that should
first be resolved in order to bundle properly the contending claims of the
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of basic crucial importance, in
our opinion, is an inquiry into, and resolution of, whether, in the first
place, the lower court had jurisdiction to entertain the motion of the private
respondents that led to the issuance of the order of <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Obviously, it will not be necessary to resolve the question posited by
the parties if, from the facts which the instant petition opened for inquiry by
this Court, it will be determined that the lower court was devoid of jurisdiction
to take cognizance of the mentioned motion of the private res­pondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a painstaking study of the matter, we reach the view and we
so hold that the respondent Judge's assumption of juris­diction over the
private respondents' motion that led to the order of March 31, 1967 dismissing
the appeal of the NIDC, is completely devoid of legal authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
in civil case Q-8407, on the matter of the recog­nition of the mortgage rights
of the PCIB over the lots in question, had already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> when the said bank assigned its rights to the
NIDC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had, in fact, foreclosed its
mortgage rights over some of the lots and had purchased them at an auction sale
before it executed the deed of assignment to the NIDC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such being the case, the lower court no
longer had jurisdiction in the said case to resolve, by a mere motion therein,
issues having to do with the disposition made by the PCIB of its rights over
the lots in question, which rights were then no longer in litigation as they
had been adjudged with finality.</p>

<p class="BODY">An independent action, or any other appropriate remedy, securing
to all the real parties in interest the processes and due opportunities
afforded by the Rules of Court will be of the essence if the private
respondents, as the judicially declared owners of the lots in question by final
judgment prior to the present con­troversy, believe that they have a right of
action to cause the extinguishment by judicial fiat of the mortgage constituted
over those lots on account of the assignment by the mortgagee and/or purchaser
at public auction of its rights to the parcels in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">The necessity for such an independent action or other appropriate
remedy becomes more patent, as a matter of due process, when it is considered
that the NIDC, as assignee after a final adjudication of the rights of the PCIB
over the said lots, will be the real party to be affected directly by any
action which the private respondents will commence whose object is to render
inutile the legal efficacy of the <span class="SpellE">PCIB's</span> assign­ment
of its rights thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such an
action, the NIDC will clearly be an indispensable party, which it will be the
duty of the private respondents to include as a party in the case, otherwise,
it will not be bound by any adjudication which will adversely affect its rights
over the lots in dispute.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would appear, however, from the facts admitted by the parties,
that a valid assignment, binding upon the private respondents, has been made by
the PCIB to the NIDC of its mortgage rights as well as its rights as purchaser
of the lots in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There does not
appear to be anything in our statutes or juris­prudence which prohibits a
creditor without the consent of the debtor from making an assignment of his
credit and the rights accessory thereto; and, certainly, an assignment of
credit and its accessory rights does not at all obliterate the obligation of
the debtor to pay, but merely puts the assignee in the place of his
assignor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, article 1634 of the
new Civil Code definitely recognizes the likelihood that credits and other
incorporeal rights in litigation may be assigned <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span>, and, in such event, provides that the
debtor may extinguish his obligation by making appropriate reimbursement to the
assignee.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
In other words, an assignment of credit <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span>, contrary to the respondent Judge's
opinion of March 31, 1967, under which it was construed that the mortgage
rights and rights as purchaser of the PCIB over the lots in question were still
in <span class="SpellE"><u>custodia</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>legis</u></span>
at the time of their assignment to the NIDC, does not extinguish the credit or
accessory rights assigned, but simply changes the bag into which the debtor
must empty his money in payment.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the order of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
dated March 31, 1967, and its subsequent orders dated May 28, 1968, November 9,
1968 and January 27, 1969, and all rela­ted orders are hereby declared null and
void and without legal effect, for having been issued without
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The preliminary injunction
issued by this Court on March 11, 1970 is hereby made permanent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to costs.</p>
