				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for review of the decision of the Workmen's Compensation
Commission in WC Case No. RPO-A-6471 promulgated on October 2, 1975.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 27, 1957, respondent-claimant Ruben Napisa
(hereinafter referred to as claimant) was employed by the petitioner as the
manager of its refrigeration, air conditioning and service department with a
monthly salary of P2,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
acting as such, claimant suffered cerebral thrombosis on August 10, 1973.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was followed by a cerebral stroke on
October 1, 1973 which necessitated his confinement at the Marian Hospital from
November 3 to November 9, 1973 and at the Medical Center, Manila from November
9 to November 23, 1973 when he decided to continue his treatment at home until
December 3, 1973.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the latter date he
was again confined at the Medical Center, Manila for further treatment as his
ailment worsened with the paralyzation of the right side of his body.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 15, 1974, claimant filed his claim for compensation
benefits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner controverted the claim
alleging that claimant's illness did not arise out of his employment nor was
the same aggravated by the nature of his work.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 14, 1974, an award was entered by the Chief of Unit,
Rizal Provincial Office, Department of Labor, the dispositive portion of which
reads:</p>

<blockquote>AWARD, therefore, is hereby rendered and the respondent is
directed:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To pay the claimant, thru this Office, the sum
of four thousand two hundred ninety-two pesos and <span style="">40/100 (P4,292.40) </span>representing the compensation which has accrued
to date and beginning February 14, <span style="">1974,
</span>a weekly compensation of <span style="">P219.32
</span>until his disability for labor ceases but not exceeding six thousand
pesos (P6,000.00), including the lump sum payment.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To </span>extend
or continue extending to claimant such necessary medical services and supplies
as the nature of his illness and the process of his recovery may require and
that which will promote his early restoration to the maximum level of his
physical capacity and should respondent fail on this regard claimant may secure
such medical services and supplies at respondent's expense; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To pay to the Workmen's Com­pensation Fund,
likewise thru this Office, the sum of P43.00 as partial administrative fee,
pursuant to Section <span style="">55 </span>of the
Act. Bill No. <span style="">W-2055074 </span>(RPO) is
attached."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Upon motion for reconsideration by the
claimant, the Chief of Unit issued an order on March 7, 1974 raising the
reimbursement for medical expenses to P37, 713.25 out of the<span style=""> </span>claim of P44,004.29.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner moved for a reconsideration of
said order of March 7, 1974 but the motion was denied by the order of May 3,
1974.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same order granted the motion
of the claimant filed on February 19, 1974 seeking to implead as
party-respondent the Philippine British Assurance Co., Inc. and/or Ker &amp;
Co., Ltd., as the insurer of petitioner's compensation liability and
accordingly held the latter and the petitioner jointly and severally liable to
the claimant.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 10, 1974, upon payment of the sum of P15,000.00, the
claimant assisted by his counsel, executed a "Full Satis­faction of
Insurance Carrier's Liability on the Order of This Office dated May 3,
1974." This was, however, declared as null and void by the order of the
Chief of Unit dated July 8, 1974.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, the records of the case were elevated to the Workmen's
Compensation Commission for review and the same were referred to the Evaluation
Division for evaluation of the fair and reasonable value of the medical
expenses incurred by the claimant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the meantime, on September 9, 1974, the claimant and his wife executed a
"Deed of Release and Quitclaim" upon receipt of payment from the
petitioner the sum of P21,000.00 exclusive of the P15,000.00 earlier paid by
the insurance carrier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On Sept­ember 18,
1974, both the petitioner and the claimant filed with the respondent
Commission, an "Amicable Settlement" wherein it was prayed that this
case be dismissed in view of the full and complete satisfaction of the claim
for com­pensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was not,
however, acted upon by the res­pondent Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 2, 1975, the respondent Commission rendered its
decision, the dispositive portion of which, reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, subject to the modi­fication hereinabove
indicated, the award dated February 14, 1974 as amended, should be as it is
hereby AFFIRMED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents Williams
Equipment Co., Ltd. and the Philippine British Assurance Co., Inc. and/or Ker
&amp; Co., Ltd. are ordered to pay, jointly and severally:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claimant, thru this Commis­sion, the
amount of SIX THOU­SAND <span style="">(P6,</span>000.00)
PESOS as compensation plus the amount of TWENTY ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED
TWENTY SEVEN PESOS and 30/100 (P21,327.30) as reimburse­ment of medical
expenses or a total of TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN and
30/100 (P27,327.30) from which shall be deducted the amount of FIFTEEN THOUSAND
(P15,000) PESOS thereby leaving a balance of TWELVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED
TWENTY SEVEN PESOS and 30/100 (P12,327.30);</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To claimant's counsel, Mr. Bien­venido R.
Raton, the amount of SIX HUNDRED (P600.00) PESOS as attorney's fee pursuant to
Sec­tion 31 of the Act;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the Workmen's Compensation Fund the amount
of SIXTY SIX (P66.00) PESOS as administrative cost including the P5.00 fee for
this review pursuant to Section 55 of the Act; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent shall further provide the claimant
with such services, appliances and supplies as the nature of his disability and
the process of his recovery may require; and that which will promote his early
restoration to the maxi­mum level of his physical capacity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Petitioner now seeks a review of the said
decision on the ground that the same was rendered without jurisdiction and is
therefore, null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
contended that since the parties herein had already entered into an amicable
settlement, the claim for compensation is already extinguished for there was no
more basis for the respondent Commission to render the decision in question.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is undisputed that
after having been impleaded as party-respondent, the Philippine British
Assurance Co., Inc., and/or Ker &amp; Co., Ltd., as insurer of petitioner's
compensation liability, paid to the claimant the amount of P15,000.00 on June
10, 1974 which the latter acknowledged as full satisfaction of the insurance
carrier's liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, on
September 9, 1974, claimant received from the petitioner the sum of P21,000.00
for which the former executed a "Deed of Release and Quitclaim." As a
result thereof, the parties submitted an amicable settlement to the respondent
Commission wherein it was prayed that this case be dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Claimant has thus received from the
petitioner and the insurance carrier, the total amount of P36,000.00 for his
claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its decision, the respondent
Commission awarded to the claimant P6,000.00 as </span>com<span style="">pensation plus the amount of P21,327.30 as
reimbursement for medical expenses or a total of P27,327.30 from which </span>was
deducted the P15,000.00 paid by the petitioner's insurance carrier, leaving a
balance of P12,327.30.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find this to
be erroneous as the respondent Commission failed to credit the amount of P21,000.00
paid by the petitioner to the claimant on September 9, 1974.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is true that the respondent
Commission could not have acted upon the amicable settle­ment submitted by the
parties in accordance with Section 29 of the Workmen's Compensation Act<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
because the same failed to mention the terms of the settlement, never­theless,
on October 23, 1975, the petitioner filed a mani­festation alleging that the
amicable settlement submitted was the result of the payment by the petitioner
to the claimant of the sum of P21,000.00 for which the latter executed a
"Deed of Release and Quitclaim" and a certification that said amount
is exclusive of the P15,000.00 paid by the insurance carrier and that by virtue
thereof, it has already satisfied the judgment of the respondent
Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attached to the said
manifestation were the documents adverted to.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In effect, said manifestation was a submission for approval of the
agreement (amicable settlement) concerning compensation and the respondent
Commission should not have ignored the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the circumstances, petitioner should be credited with the payment
to the claimant of the sum of P21,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Adding to the said amount the P15,000.00 paid by the insurance carrier,
the claimant has received a total of P36,000.00 for his claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its decision, the respondent Commission
has awarded to the claimant the aggregate sum of P27,327.30 (P6,000.00 for
compensation and P21,327.30 for reimbursement of medical expenses).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Deducting the award of P27,327.30 from the
P36,000.00 received by the claimant from the peti­tioner as compensation
benefits there is a difference of P8,672.70 which is the excess of what is due
the claimant under the decision of the respondent Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Section 29 of the Workmen's
Compensation Act, in order that an agreement concerning compensation may be
valid, two conditions must be complied:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) the amount agreed upon must be at least equal to that provided by
the Act; and (b) the agree­ment must be approved by the Workmen's Compensation
Com­missioner or his duly authorized representative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The settle­ment of compensation cases is
further provided for under Letter of Instruction No. 190 dated June 3, 1974<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and under Department Order No. 3, series of 1974 of the Department of Labor.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Since the total amount received by the claimant from the petitioner (including
that paid by the latter's in­surance carrier) in settlement of his claim is not
only equal but even more than what is provided under the Workmen's Compensation
Act, there is no valid reason for the respondent Commission not to act and give
its stamp of approval to the amicable settlement submitted by the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the decision of the respondent Commission is
hereby affirmed with the qualification that the award for compensation in the
amount of P6,000.00 and the reimbursement for medical expenses in the sum of
P21,327.30 have been fully satisfied by the petitioner.</p>
