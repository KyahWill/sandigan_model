				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Republic Act 1553, approved on <st1:date year="1956" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1956</st1:date>, authorized the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Lemi</span> to construct,
maintain and operate radio broadcasting and television stations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1960" day="8" month="6">June
 8, 1960</st1:date> the Radio Control Office of the Department of Public Works
and Communications issued to him license 5931 to construct, maintain and
operate radio station DZQR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This license
was effective for one year, that is, from <st1:date year="1960" day="24" month="5">May 24, 1960</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1961" day="23" month="5">May
 23, 1961</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="12" month="4">April 12, 1961</st1:date>
<span class="SpellE">Lemi</span> applied for renewal of the license to cover the
period from <st1:date year="1961" day="24" month="5">May 24, 1961</st1:date> to
<st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="5">May 23, 1962</st1:date>, and paid the
corresponding renewal license fee of P50.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Radio Control Office took no action on this renewal
application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1962</st1:date> he again applied for renewal of the
license, to cover the period from <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="5">May
 24, 1962</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="5">May 23, 1963</st1:date>,
and again paid the correspond­ing renewal license fee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again the Radio Control Office took no action
thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He continued operating the
radio station without any interference whatsoever from the office of the Public
Works Secretary, and the Radio Control Office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a matter of fact, a letter dated <st1:date year="1962" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1962</st1:date> of the chief of the latter office
requested the licensee "to feature the many newly recorded Philippine
Christmas songs."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the morning of January 11, 1963, while the radio station DZQR
was broadcasting, Alfredo M. Cargo, an agent of the Public Works Secretary, and
<span class="SpellE">Heraclio</span> San Juan, a radio regulation inspector of
the Radio Control Office, accompanied by agents of the Presidential Anti-Graft
Committee (PAGCOM), armed with a search warrant issued by the Court of First
Instance of Manila, searched the radio station and thereafter seized and
carried away a radio transmitter which was being used at the time, on the
pretext that it "was without any name plate or serial number and is
entirely dif­ferent from the authorized transmitter," in gross violation
of the Radio Control Law.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 19, 1963 <span class="SpellE">Lemi</span> instituted the
present original petition for mandamus with preliminary injunction, against
Public Works Secretary <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span> Valencia, Chief
Roberto San Andres of the Radio Control Office, Alfredo M. Cargo, <span class="SpellE">Heraclio</span> San Juan, Chairman <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cajator</span> of the PAGCOM and the latter's agents,
praying that this Court (1) issue a preliminary mandatory injunction directing
the respondents to return immediately the radio transmitter to him, and, after
due hearing on the merits, to make the writ permanent; and (2) order the
respondents to issue without delay the renewal license applied for by him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner averred that the summary and unwarranted seizure
of the transmitter "was a wanton and deliberate disregard" of the
pertinent provisions of the Radio Control Law and the regulations promulgated <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> providing for "due formal hearing before a
seizure or closure;" that the search warrant was pro­cured "by means
of misrepresentation and deceit" on the part of the respondents' agents,
who made it appear "that a criminal charge or some sort of charge had been
previously filed against the petitioner when x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> no such charge is known to petitioner up to this
time;" that the transmitter "was never illegally used as it was
(used) with full knowledge and approval and consent of the respondents
themselves;" that the said transmitter was not capable of transmitting
messages abroad; that being "attached to the radio station permanently as
an <u>indispensable</u> structure thereof without which broadcast could not
have been possible," the trans­mitter is "real property" and
"not subject of seizure warrant;" that the seizure thereof was
"actually inspired by vindictiveness and ill-will arising from the
criticisms aired by a paying commentator x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> R.T. <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span>, in his daily radio
program, 'So the People May Know', of the abuses of the Chief of the Radio Control
Office and the present administration x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> further aggravated by the refusal of petitioner to accede
to the repeated requests of respondent Roberto San Andres to refrain from
testifying in the administrative charges x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> which x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
R. T. <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> previously filed against respondent Roberto San Andres,
and to bar the said commentator from the air;" and that the continued
deprivation of the use of the transmitter during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the petition would work great injustice and irreparable damage and injury to
him because he would then be prevented from fulfilling his contractual
commitments with his numerous clientele.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner further averred that sometime after Novem­ber 3,
1961, after he had filed the first application for renewal of the radio station
license, <span class="SpellE">Eliodoro</span> L. Jose, chief radio inspector of the
Radio Control Office, inspected the station and found the equipment and
installations therein "in order and in compliance with the pertinent
requirements of radio regulations, [and] recommended the issuance of a radio
station license;" and that <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> such
recommendation, the respondents Public Works Secretary and Chief of the Radio
Control Office, "with the evident purpose of prejudicing the operations of
the herein petitioner, unlawfully neglected the performance of their duties by
maliciously withholding the license for station DZQR already paid by the
petitioner, although the law specifically enjoins issuance thereof as a ministerial
duty after petitioner had complied with the requirements of the law and
regulations."</p>

<p class="BODY">We gave due course to the petition and ordered the respon­dents
to submit their answer and show cause why a writ of preli­minary mandatory
injunction should not be issued.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their answer to the petition, the respondents claimed that the
radio transmitter was seized "by virtue of a valid search warrant after it
was clearly established x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
that the transmit­ter x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
was illegally constructed and installed without any previous permit;" that
the seized transmitter "is powerful enough to transmit messages
abroad;" that no misrepresentation was committed in securing the search
warrant as "a criminal charge has already been filed against the
petitioner with the Office of the City Fiscal for violation of Radio Station
and Communications Law, docketed as I.S. No. 1689 and scheduled for hearing x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> on Jan­uary 31, 1963; and
that the transmitter is subject to seizure as it is movable property."</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents further averred that although license 5931
expired on May 23, 1961, the renewal application was filed only on May 15,
1962, in violation of section 2 of Act 3846, as amended which provides that
applications for renewal of radio licenses should be filed at least two months
before the expiry dates of the licenses sought to be renewed; that mere payment
of the corresponding renewal license fee does not in itself constitute a
renewal of the radio station license; that the renewal license was withheld
because the petitioner was using a transmitter "without any nameplate or
serial number," different from the one authorized by the Radio Control
Office which initially was an "UNELMANCO-BCT 500 S/N RCD-0503" and
later authorized to be substituted by a "COLLINS T.M. 400 S/N
RCD-0637;" that the use of the unauthorized transmitter is in gross
violation of section 1-A of Act 3846, as amended; that the issuance of a
license to operate a radio station involves the exercise of judgment and
discretion; and that the only specific legal duty of the respondent Public
Works Secretary is to hold a hearing in case he disapproves a license, pursuant
to section 3(1) of Act 3846, as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents further maintained that the petitioner not having
exhausted other available remedies in the ordinary course of law, namely, (1) a
court action to quash the search warrant, and (2) an appeal to the respondent
Secretary, the petition is prematurely filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's rejoinder recited that when he filed the first
application for renewal on April 12, 1961, the period fixed in license 5931
(May 23, 1961) had not yet expired; that it has been a long established and
existing practice that once the renewal license fee is accepted, the acceptance
is equivalent to a permit to conti­nue operating during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the issuance of the renewal license until the disapproval of the application
for renewal, which may take effect only after due notice and hearing; that if
the transmitter "has no visible name plate, it was because the same was
repainted to conform with good engineering practice, it being a secondhand
surplus equipment;" that the search warrant is null and void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span>, the
respondents having admitted "the absence of any formal information against
the petitioner before the filing of an application for a search warrant with
the Court of First Instance of Manila;"<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
that the respondents' "refusal to renew x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> license for an unreasonable length of time is equivalent
to a dis­approval of the application itself and/ or revocation of the old license
without due notice and hearing," in violation of section 3(1), <u>supra</u>,
and section 17 of Department Order 11, series of 1950; that a petition for
mandamus can be availed of even without exhausting available administrative
remedies; and that in matters of this nature, this Court has concurrent
jurisdiction with courts of first instance, pursuant to section 5 of Rule 67 of
the new Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on the manifestation filed by the petitioner on <st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="2">Feb­ruary 20, 1963</st1:date>, we issued a
resolution on the following February 28, commanding the respondents to return
the radio transmitter, upon the filing of a bond of P1,000.</p>

<p class="BODY">Is the petitioner entitled to the <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>
prayed for?</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 3 of Rule 65 of the new Rules of Court authorizes the
issuance of a writ of mandamus when "any x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> person unlawfully neglects the performance of an act
which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust,
or station, or unlawfully excludes another from the use and enjoyment of a
right or office to which such other is entitled, and there is no plain, speedy
and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law." It is essential,
therefore, for a writ of mandamus to issue, that the plaintiff has a legal
right to the thing demanded and that it is the imperative duty of the defendant
to perform the act required.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The legal right of the plaintiff to the thing demanded must be well-defined,
clear and certain.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The corresponding duty of the defendant to perform the required act must also
be clear and specific.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Mandamus will not issue in doubtful cases, as it simply commands the exercise
of a power already possessed or to perform a duty already imposed.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Mandamus will lie to compel action, or to re­medy official inaction.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

violators of the radio laws or the regulations and confiscate the radio
apparatus in case of illegal operation; or simply suspend or revoke the offender's
station or operator licenses, or refuse to renew such licenses; or just repri­mand
and warn the offenders."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The exercise of the above-enumerated
specific powers and duties involves judgment and discretion on the part of the
Secretary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Discretion,</p>

<blockquote>"when applied to public functionaries,
means a power or right conferred upon them by law of acting officially, under
certain circumstances, according to the dictates of their own judgments and
consciences, uncontrolled by the judgments or consciences of others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>.A purely ministerial act or duty, in
contradistinction to a discretional act, is one which an officer or tribunal
performs in a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obedience to the
mandate of a legal authority, with out regard to or the exercise of his own
judgment upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>If the law imposes a duty upon a public
officer</u>, <u>and gives him the right to decide how or when the duty shall be
performed, such duty is discretion­ary</u> and not ministerial. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The duty is ministerial only when the
discharge of the same requires neither the exercise of official discretion or
judgment."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under section 9 of the Radio Control Law, the Public Works
Secretary is authorized "to create a <u>Radio</u> <u>Regulation</u>
Section, Division or <u>Office</u> which shall take charge of carrying out the
provisions of this Act and of the regulations prescribed by him, or to delegate
temporarily the duties herein conferred upon him and the enforcement of the
regulations prescribed by him, to any bureau or office under his department,
subject to his general supervision and control."</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar,
the respondents Secretary and Chief of the Radio Control Office patently
neglected the discharge of the duty, under Section 3(1), <u>supra</u>, to
"approve or disapprove" the petitioner's applications for renewal of
the radio license.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="12" month="4">April 12, 1961</st1:date> the latter filed the
first application for renewal of license 5931, and paid the corresponding
license fee of P50.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Radio Control
Office which is directly under the "supervision and control" of the
Public Works Secretary took no action on this application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="5">May
 31, 1962</st1:date> the petitioner filed another application for renewal of
his radio license and paid the corresponding renewal license fee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No action was likewise taken on this
one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And despite the continued operation
of the radio station since <st1:date year="1961" day="23" month="5">May 23,
 1961</st1:date>, the date license 5931 expired, there was no interference
whatsoever from the office of the respondent Secretary and the Radio Control
Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In point of fact, such continued
operation was officially tolerated, as can be gleaned from the letter dated
December 7, 1962 sent by the Chief of the Radio Control Office to the
petitioner, at the behest of the respondent Secretary, requesting the licensee "to
feature the many newly recorded Philippine Christmas songs," as a special
public feature in the radio programs of station DZQR.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The respondents maintain, however, that the petitioner is not
entitled to the renewal of his license, because the first renewal application
was filed only on April 12, 1961, 41 days more or less before license 5931
expired (on May 23, 1961), and the second renewal application was filed only on
May 31, 1962, 8 days more or less after the period supposedly covered by the
first application for renewal was to expire (on May 23, 1962), in violation of
section 2 of Act 3846, as amended, which requires that "if a renewal is
desired, the licensee shall submit application x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <u>at least two months before</u> the <u>expiration</u>
date <u>of</u> the <u>license to be renewed</u>."</p>

<p class="BODY">We see no obstacle to the application to the case at bar of our
ruling in <span class="SpellE"><u>Bolinao</u></span><u> Electronics Corporation

There this Court made the following pronouncements:</p>

the petitions for renewal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The notices
sent to petitioners x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
alleged only one supposed violation which would justify disapproval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But petitioners claim that this violation has
ceased to exist when the act of late filing was condoned or pardoned by respon­dents
by the issuance of the circular dated <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="7">July
 24, 1962</st1:date>, which in its pertinent part, reads:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'It has come to the attention of this Office that a great number of

transmitter was an "UNELMANCO-BCT 500 S/N RCD-0503" which, upon prior
approval of the Radio Control Office, was later changed to a "COLLINS T.
M. 400 S/N RCD-0637;" that the transmitter which was seized on January 11,
1963 was "without any name plate or serial number," in gross
violation of section 1-A of Act 3846, as amended, providing that "no

of his discretionary power under section 3(m), <u>supra</u>, the respondent
Secretary filed a criminal action against the petitioner for such violation

<blockquote>"True, a memorandum submitted on March 29, 1962, by <span class="SpellE">Eliodoro</span> B. Jose, Head, Project No. 2, to the Chief, Radio
Control Division, is to the effect that, in a previous report made by him, he
had stated that when he inspected petitioner's station then located at the
Capitol Technical Institute Building, he was shown a permit for the transfer of
the station from Globe Theater Building to the Capitol Technical Institute
Building; that the transmitter then being used was not the same for which the
permit to transfer was issued; that he advised petitioner to apply for the
corresponding permit to purchase, possess, or construct the transmitter so that
a license may be issued for the new station; but the same report shows that Mr.
Jose had recommended that a license be issued to petitioner upon the filing of
the corresponding application; that the non-closure of radio station DZQR, in
spite of an order given to Mr. Jose to have it closed was explained by him in
another memorandum of March 26, 1962, this being the reason presumably - why
the station continued to operate without any interference on the part of the
Radio Control Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This report or
memorandum, itself shows that, aside from the claim <u>that the radio
transmitter used at the</u> <u>time by petitioner</u> was not the one he was
authorized to use, the same was not objectionable in any other respect; that
its use <u>was known and was</u> - <u>to a certain extent</u> - <u>tolerated by
the Radio Control Office</u>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The use of the radio transmitter by the
petitioner having been "known and - to a certain extent - tolerated"
by the Radio Control Office; "the violation in legal effect, ceased to
exist."</p>

<p class="BODY">No validity can be accorded to the respondents' assertion that,
in seizing the transmitter, the respondent Secretary was merely exercising his
confiscatory power under section 3(m), <u>supra</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court in no certain terms declared in
its resolution of February 28, 1963 that the seizure, though made under
authority of a search warrant, cannot obliterate the fact that such seizure
violated section 3(1), <u>supra</u>, which provides that "no application
for renewal shall be disapproved without giving the licensee a <u>hearing</u>,
" and section 17 of Department Order 11 which provides that no "radio
station license may be revoked for willful violations of the radio laws and
regulations, local or internatio­nal x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> without giving the licensee a <u>hearing</u>;" that
the application for issuance of the search warrant and the ultimate seizure of
the radio transmitter in effect amounted to an attempt to evade the requirement
of such hearing; and that the seizure effected made it impossible for the radio
station to continue operating.</p>

<p class="BODY">The requirement of a hearing as provided by the Radio Control Law
and the rules and regulations promulgated <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>,
is founded on the fundamental principle that no person shall be deprived of his
property without due process of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
franchise, like the one granted by R.A. 1553 to the petitioner, is property
entitled to constitutional protection.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
A “radio license is an operating authority of importance involving primarily
the inte­rest of the public,"<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
and "valuable rights and investments made in reliance on a license x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> should not be destroyed x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> except for the most
compelling reasons.”<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents
finally maintain that the present petition is premature because the petitioner
failed to exhaust available remedies on the administrative level.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contention is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no statute providing for an appeal
from an action taken by the Radio Control Office to the Secretary of Public
Works and Communications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if an appeal
there be to the respondent Secretary, by virtue of the latter's power of general
supervision and control" over the Radio Control Office,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
this remedy is not such "adequate remedy in the ordinary course of
law" as would bar the present action for mandamus, for the acts committed
by the respondents are "patently illegal,"<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
having been performed in violation of the Radio Control Law and the rules and
regulations promulgated <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>, and the immediate
return of the transmitter demanded "urgency of judicial intervention"<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
as its seizure completely immobilized the radio station DZQR and prevented the
petitioner from complying with his contractual commitments.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the matter of the <u>ex</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> motion of the petitioner that the
respondents be cited for contempt, we fully concur in the finding of our then
1st Deputy Clerk of Court &amp; Reporter, contained in his report of January
18, 1964, that although the conduct of the respondents in "not
faithfully" complying with the terms of the writ of preliminary mandatory
injunction issued by this Court on March 4, 1963, constitutes "reckless
imprudence," such con­duct "may not be as grave as contempt as it
would had they actually refused to return the transmitter."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction
issued on <st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1963</st1:date> is
made permanent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although there was clear
official neglect and unwarranted inaction on the part of the respondents in the
matter of the issuance of the renewal licenses applied for in the first and
second renewal applications, the periods covered by the said applications have
long expired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent relief
prayed for is now a matter that is obviously moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to costs.</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">REYES, J. B.L., <i style="">J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I fully concur with the opinion of Mr. Justice Castro, but would
like to express emphatic condemnation of the practice followed by the Radio
Control Office of indefinitely and unreasonably delaying action upon radio license
applications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I view official conduct of
the type described in the main opinion not as a mere instance of official
indolence, but as a subtle attempt to impose absolute radio censorship, and to
silence at will radio stations which allow airing of views critical of the
powers that be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We should be ever alert
to such indirect subversion of the constitutional liberties of speech and of
the press.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
