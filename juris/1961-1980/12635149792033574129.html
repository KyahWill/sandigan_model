City Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> is the one vested with power to
appoint the officers </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">employees of the <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>
Waterworks System; ordering </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">Commissioner of Civil Service to attest and

Law, and ordering the City Treasurer and City Auditor of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>

Water­works System by the City Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. "A", "A-1" to

appointments, promotional in nature, were made by the Secretary of Public Works
and Communications, while the others - original appointments - were signed by
the City Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> like previous appointments
made in 1957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appointments issued by
the Secretary were duly approved but those signed by the City Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> were refused approval by the Commissioner of Civil
Service who held the view that the proper appointing power is the Secretary of
Public Works and Communications.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, who were adversely
affected by said ruling, commenced the present action for mandamus against the
Commissioner of Civil Service to compel him to attest and approve their
appointments (issued by the City Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>), and
against the City Auditor and City Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>

the appoint­ments issued by the City Mayor to petitioners, attached to the
records of this case as Annexes A, A-1, A-2, etc., up to A-174 is admitted by
the parties; that some of these appointments are promotional and the rest are
original; <span style="">that </span>the previous
appointments <span style="">of those given promotional
appointments in this case were extended by the Secretary of Public Works and
Communications; and that all those appointees of the Secretary of Public Works
and Communications were in 1957 or there about also extended appointments by
the City<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
which appointments so far have been refused attestation or approval by the
Commissioner of </span>Civil <span style="">Service
who returned the same to the City Mayor;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

authenticity of Annexes A, <span style="">A-1, </span>A-2, A-3, A-4 and A-5 of this stipulation; <span style="">but res­</span>pondents aver that Annexes A-2
and A-3 are immaterial, irrelevant and impertinent on the ground that they <span style="">do not prove any </span>allegation in the
petition and, besides, Annex A-2 is <u>post</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>litem</u></span>

we said:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<blockquote><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>"Appellants' claim that the Mayor
of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> City was the one empowered to appoint the
employees of the <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> Waterworks System <span style="">is based </span>on the provisions of Art. IV,
sec. 19, <span style="">of </span>Commonwealth Act No.
547, commonly known <span style="">as </span>the Charter of the City of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, <span style="">which provides that all <u>other</u> officers
and employees </span>of the City <u>whose</u> <u>appointment</u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">is</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>not</u> <u>otherwise</u> <u>provided</u>
<u>for</u> <u>by</u> <u><span style="">law</span></u><span style="">, shall be appointed by the Mayor, upon
recommenda­tion of the corresponding city department heads, in</span> <span style="">accordance with the Civil Service Law, and </span>m<span style="">ay </span>be
suspended or removed only <span style="">in accordance
with law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Paragraph (j), section 22,
Article </span>VI of the same Act, clearly provides, on the other hand, that<span style=""> the City Engineer of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>
City shall have the care and custody of the public system of waterworks and
sewerage, while Section 1 of Commonwealth Act No. 424, <span style="">in relation to </span>the personnel of the engineering departments of
chartered cities, provides that -<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The assistant engineer, su­perintendents, and other employees <span style="">as are </span><span style="">from time to time <span style="">provided</span> <span style="">for in
appropriation ordinances of the City shall </span>be appointed in accordance
with existing laws go<span style="">verning the
appointment of civil engineers, assistant civil engineers </span>and other
personnel in the various engineering districts of the Bureau of Public Works in
the provinces.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In connection with the legal provisions mentioned above,
Section 79-D of the Revised Administrative Code, which governs the appointment
of civil engineers, assistant civil engineers and other personnel in the
various en­gineering districts under the Bureau of Public Works, provides the
following:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The Department Head, upon the recommendation of the Chief of the
Bureau or Office concerned, shall appoint all subordinate officers and
employees whose appointment <span style="">is </span>not
expressly vested in the (Governor General) President of the Philippines, and
may remove or punish them except as specifically provided otherwise, in ac­cordance
with the Civil Service Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Laborers receiving
compensation at the rate of seven hundred and twenty pesos or <span style="">less </span>per annum and other employees
receiving com­pensation at the rate of two hundred pesos or less per annum,
shall be appointed and removed by the Chief of the Bureau or Office, subject
only to the general control of the Department Head.</p>

<p class="2Q">'The Department Head also may, from time to time in the interest of
the service, change the distri­bution among the several Bureaus and Offices of
his Department of the employee or subordinate author­ized by law.'</p>

<blockquote>"As already stated heretofore, <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
were appointed by the Under-Secretary of Public Works and Communications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Morales' appointment was for Item No. 52 in <span style="">the </span>approved city <span class="SpellE">Plantilla</span>
of personnel of the Office of the City Engineer, <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>
City, de la Cruz' was for Item No. 48, Vicente's for Item No. 59 <span style="">and Mendoza's for Item No. 61.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since their respective appointments several
years prior to their removal they had rendered apparently satisfactory ser­vice,
and had been paid with funds </span>appropriated by the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It would seem, therefore, that, according to law, the
employees of the <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> Waterworks System are to be
appointed by the Department of Public Works and Communications; that the City
of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> has fully acquiesced to this interpretation
by recognizing appoint­ments made by the Secretary of Public Works and
Communications and paying the salaries due to the appointees; that even while
the present action was pend­ing, in view of the reinstatement of <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> pursuant to the orders of the Director of Public
Works, the City of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> and the City Engineer had <span style="">again acknowledged </span>the
right of the Secretary of Public Works and Communications to appoint the
employees of the <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> Waterworks System.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conclusion is, therefore, inescapable
that <span class="SpellE">appellees</span><span style="">
were illegally removed from office on </span><st1:date year="1954" day="26" month="7"><span style="">July 26, 1954</span></st1:date><span style=""> and that the order for their reinstatement
issued by the Director of Public Works, in conform­ity with the favorable
recommendation of the Bureau of Civil Service, was in accordance with
law."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Subsequently, We had

as Manager of the National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority </span><span style="">(G. R. No. L-15142).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">It
involved the appointment of officers and employees of the <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>
Waterworks System </span><span style="">in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City, </span><span style="">and
the particular issue submitted for resolution was identical to the one now
before </span><span style="">Us - whether </span><span style="">it is the City Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
or the Secretary of Public Works and Communications who has the authority </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">appoint the officers and employees of the <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>
Waterworks System.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Resolving the same,
We said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Petitioners' appeal hinges on this lone question:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Who is the official vested by law with the
power of appointment over the officers and employees of the <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>
Waterworks System?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Petitioners' contention that the Mayor of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city> possesses the power in
question is based on section 1916 of the Re­vised Administrative Code, which
reads, in part:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'In their respective districts, district engineers shall operate
and maintain all municipal and provincial waterworks in accordance with the
general regulations jointly issued by the Secretary of Interior and the
Director of Public Works, and superintendents of waterworks, inspectors,
plumbers, pump engineers, and all other employees as may be necessary for the
proper operation and maintenance of these systems shall be under his direct
supervision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Employees of the systems
owned or administered by the province<span style=""> shall
be appointed by him with the advice and consent of the provincial board and
those of the mayor in accordance with section twenty one hundred and ninety
nine as amended of the Administrative Code upon recommendation of the district
engineer.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>and section 21 of the Charter of the City
of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
Commonwealth Act 58, which states that 'the Mayor shall appoint all other
officers and employees of the city whose appointment is not otherwise provided
for by law.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The above contention deserves scant consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cited provision of the administrative
code clearly refers to waterworks owned or administered by provinces and
municipalities and does not include chartered <span style="">cities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the power of the
city <span style="">mayor under section </span>21 of
the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cebu</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> charter applies only </span><span style="">if </span><span style="">the appointment is not otherwise provided by law.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Section 30, Article IV of the City Charter of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> states that the City Engineer shall have the care and
custody of the <span style="">public system of
waterworks </span>and sewers, and all sources of water supply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In relation to the duties and functions of
City Engineers in all chartered cities, Commonwealth Act 424 states:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span style="">'The City engineers of </span>chartered

Works.</p>

<p class="2Q">'The assistant engineers, superintendents and <u>other employ</u><u><span style="">ees</span></u><span style=""> as are from time to time pro</span>vided for in appropriation

December 29, 1960, where the <span style="">power to
appoint the employees of </span>the <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> Waterworks
System was put at issue, this Court, thru Justice ­<span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>,
has expressed the opinion that Section 79(d) of the Revised
Administrative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Code is the provision
referred to <span style="">in the above quotation
(underlined portions) govern­ing the appointment of personnel in the en­</span>gineering

</span>Said section says:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The Department Head, <span style="">upon
the </span>recommendation of the Chief of the bureau or office concerned, shall
appoint all subordinate officers <span style="">and employees whose appointment is not expressly

<p class="2Q">'The Department Head also may, from time to time, in the interest
of the service, change the distribution among the several bureaus and offices
of his Depart­ment of the employees or subordi­nates authorized by law.'</p>

<blockquote>The conclusion was thus reached in that case
that the power or appoint officers and employees of the <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>
Waterworks System is lodged in the Secretary of Public Works and
Communications.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Since, by virtue of section 8, Act 2009, the law creating the
<span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> Water­works System, 'the Director of Public
Works of the Philippines shall have exclusive charge and control of all work to
be done and improvements to be made' under the said Act, and in view of the
similarity in the pro­vision of the charters of the cities of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> regarding their
Engineering Depart­ments, We see no reason to deviate from the ruling laid down
in the <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> Waterworks case, <u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is noteworthy that previous to the questioned appointments
made by the Mayor of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city>
to employees of the <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> Waterworks System in 1956,
the City had recognized and acquiesced to the ap­pointments extended by the
Secretary of Public Works and Communications to such employees who were then
receiving their salaries as authorized in said appoint­ments.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In conclusion, we declare that it is the Secretary of Public
Works and Com­munications who is empowered to appoint the officers and
employees of <span style="">the <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>
Waterworks System.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this respect, and
the declaration that the petitioners employees of the <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>

those appointed by the City </span><span style="">Mayor, on the basis of the Minimum Wage Law, up to
the </span><span style="">time they have been duly
advised of the disapproval of their appointments, We are affirming <span style="">the decision of the lower court.<o:p></o:p></span></span></blockquote>
