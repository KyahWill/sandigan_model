				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of
Manila sentencing defendants to pay plaintiffs P24,570.76 as unpaid
wages and P5.000.00 as attorney's fees, for the officers and crew of a
vessel to be brought from Hongkong to Manila for the account of
defendants.
<p>The complaint filed in the case contained 3 causes of action, (1) to
collect P24,570.76 representing unpaid wages as per contract, (2) moral
damages at the rate of P10,000.00 for the Master, and P5,000.00 each
for each marine officer, including radio officer, P2,000.00 for each
crew member or a total of P111,000.00 and (3) P5,000.00 attorney's
fees. It is contended on the appeal that if the amount claimed
totalling P140,570.76 be divided among the 38 members and officers of
the crew, each would be demanding only P3,699.23-1/19, which claim does
not reach the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance where the
action was brought. But the second cause of action of the complaint
alleged that the captain demanded P10,000.00 as damages, plus the
amount of his pay. The claim, therefore, that the case does not fall
within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance, is without
merit.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala </em>and <em>Makalintal, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
