				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal by the defendants from a decision of the Court of First Instance of 
Davao, the dispositive part of which reads:
<blockquote>
<p>"In view of the foregoing, this Court annuls that portion of the decision of 
this Court in Civil Case No. 959 dated June 16, 1953, declaring the plaintiff 
therein as lawful owner of the property under litigation tog-ether with the 
improvements thereon, subject to the final disposition of the same by the Bureau 
of Lands and. the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources in accordance 
with the provisions of law, without special pronouncement as to costs.</p>
<p>"Consequently, the execution of the decision insofar as that part of the same 
where the plaintiff was declared owner in that Civil Case No. 959, is hereby 
nullified."</p></blockquote>
<p>It appears that on or about November 29, 1952, Potenciana Plando filed with 
the Court of First Instance of Davao a complaint (Exhibits C-4 to C-6), which 
was docketed as Civil Case No. 959 of said court, against Luis Pineda and Bruno 
Eamirez. Potenciana Plando alleged in said pleading that she was the surviving 
spouse and only heir of the deceased Domingo Ramirez, who in life, was the 
actual possessor of a parcel of land situated in Lasang, formerly municipality 
of Tagum, now Panabo, Province of Davao, and more particularly described in the 
complaint; that said land was covered by Homestead Application No 166166 
(E-77371), in the name of said deceased, which had been approved by the Director 
of Lands on December 18, 1930; that, by virtue of an order of this officer, 
dated November 18, 1932, for the "issuance of patent", the rights to and 
interest in said land became definitely vested in Domingo Ramirez; that upon his 
death, such rights and interests were transmitted, by operation of law, to 
Potenciana Plando; that said land had been jointly occupied and cultivated by 
her and Domingo Eamirez, during his lifetime, since early in 1930 until sometime 
in 1948, and had become improved and productive through their common efforts; 
that, in 1948, Luis Pineda and Bruno Ramirez took material possession of said 
land illegally and in bad faith, thereby excluding her from the possession and 
enjoyment thereof, despite her repeated demands that they vacate said property, 
which they refused to do; and that she thereby suffered the damages specified in 
the complaint. Accordingly, she prayed that judgment be rendered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(a) Declaring the plaintiff the lawful owner and possessor of the land and 
improvements described in the complaint;</p>
<p>"(b) Ordering the defendants to vacate the premises in question and to 
restore the possession thereof to the plaintiff;</p>
<p>"(c) Condemning and ordering the defendants to pay, jointly and severally, 
the plaintiff the sum of P5,000.00, representing the fruits of the land due the 
plaintiff;</p>
<p>"(d) Condemning and ordering the defendants to pay jointly and severally, the 
plaintiff the sum of P2,000.00, in concept of damages;</p>
<p>"(e) Condemning and ordering the defendants to pay the costs of this suit; 
and</p>
<p>"(f) Granting the plaintiff such and other relief consonant with law, justice 
and equity."</p></blockquote>
<p>Although the court had denied a motion to dismiss filed by Luis Pineda and 
Bruno Kamirez, neither answered the complaint, because of which they were 
declared in default, at the instance of Potenciana Plando, who, thereafter, 
presented her evidence. Based upon the same, decision was rendered on June 16, 
1953, finding that the allegations of the complaint had been proven and 
declaring Potenciana Plando "the lawful owner and possessor of the land and 
improvements described in H.A. No. 166166 (E-77371)" and ordering Luis Pineda 
and Bruno Ramirez "(1) to vacate the premises in question and restore the 
possession thereof to" her; "(2) to pay, jointly and severally", to her "the sum 
of P1,000 representing the fruits of the land due" to her and for attorney's 
fees and (S) to pay the costs". On July 16, 1953, Luis Pineda and Bruno Ramirez 
moved to "set aside the judgment by default", but the motion was denied by an 
order dated August 4, 1953. A reconsideration of this order, sought by them on 
August 17, 1953, was denied on November 16, 1953.</p>
<p>Soon later, or on December 4, 1953, they filed with the Court of Appeals a 
petition, docketed therein as CA-G.R. No. 12164-R, for a writ of certiorari with 
preliminary injunction against the Judge of First Instance of Davao and 
Potenciana Plando, upon the ground that the former had acted with grave abuse of 
discretion in denying the motion to dismiss the Complaint in said Civil Case No. 
959, and the motion for relief of judgment by default therein rendered. In a 
fireasoned resolution, dated May 19, 1954, the Third Division of the Court of 
Appeals dismissed the petition upon the ground that no abuse of discretion had 
been committed in denying the aforesaid motion to dismiss; that the order 
denying relief of judgment by default was a final order and, as such, 
appealable; and that, having failed to appeal therefrom, Luis Pineda and Bruno 
Ramirez were not entitled to the writ of certiorari prayed for.</p>
<p>On October 4, 1954, Luis Pineda and Bruno Ramirez sought from the Supreme 
Court, in case G.R. No. L-8357 thereof, a review by certiorari of said 
resolution of the Court of Appeals, but their petition for review was, by minute 
resolution, dated November 18, 1954, dismissed for lack of merit.</p>
<p>Subsequently, or on January 27, 1955, Luis Pineda instituted the present 
action against the Court of First Instance of Davao, Eriberto Unson as 
Provincial Sheriff <em>Ex-oficio</em> of Davao, and Potenciana Plando. After 
making pertinent averments about the filing of Civil Case No. 959 of said court, 
the denial of his motion to dismiss the complaint therein, the order declaring 
him in default, the decision therein rendered declaring. Potenciana Plando the 
lawful owner and possessor of the land in dispute and of the improvements 
thereon, and the final and executory nature of said decision, Pineda alleged in 
his complaint that said declaration of ownership in favor of Potenciana Plando 
is null and void for lack of jurisdiction, because the question of title to and 
ownership of a homestead and the improvements thereon is a function exclusively 
belonging to the Bureau of Lands, before which there was a pending controversy 
between the parties, which the Director of Lands decided, on March 6, 1954, in 
his (Pineda's) favor, although Potenciana Plando had moved for a reconsideration 
of said decision, which was still pending determination. Plaintiff prayed that 
judgment be rendered "annulling partially the decision by default in Civil Case 
No. 959, particularly the portion * * * adjudicating the ownership of the land 
in Question and improvements thereon and to suspend the execution of said 
decision during the pendency of the case and pending the result of the 
controversy between the parties now in the Bureau of Lands."</p>
<p>Their motion to dismiss the complaint having been denied, the defendants 
filed an answer maintaining that the decision rendered in Civil Case No. 959 is 
valid and in accordance with law. After appropriate proceedings; the lower court 
rendered the decision appealed from, which appears to be based upon 
the-following predicates, namely: (1) that Civil Case No. 959 was merely one for 
the "recovery of possession and damages" and did not involve the title to the 
land in question; and (2) that "the Supreme Court has set the doctrine * * * 
that courts of justice have no jurisdiction to determine the ownership and 
disposition of agricultural lands".</p>
<p>The first predicate is false, for Potenciana Plando had, not only alleged in 
her complaint in said case that she had acquired the proprietary rights of 
Domingo Ramirez on the land in dispute, but, also, prayed specifically that she 
be declared "the lawful owner", aside from "possessor of the land and the 
improvements described in" said pleading.</p>
<p>With respect to the second predicate, relative to the jurisdiction of the 
Court of First Instance of Davao to pass upon the title to the land in dispute, 
it should bo noted that jurisdiction over the subject matter of a case is 
determined by the pleadings therein.</p>
<p>According to the complaint in Civil Case No. 959, said land was covered by a 
homestead application of Domingo Ramirez, approved by the Director of Lands way 
back on December 18, 1930. On November 18, 1932, said officer had ordered the 
issuance of the corresponding patent in favor of Domingo Ramirez, thus 
indicating that he had submitted final proof, which was found satisfactory by 
the Director of Lands, of compliance with the requirements of our laws for the 
issuance of such patent. Hence, Domingo Ramirez had acquired a vested property 
right in said land and the equitable ownership thereof, which may be conveyed or 
inherited, unaffected by the fact that the paramount title thereto was still in 
the hands of the government (Balboa <em>vs</em>. Farrales, 51 Phil., 498). Upon 
the death of Domingo Ramirez, said property right and equitable ownership passed 
to this surviving spouse and only heir, Potenciana Plando, who had occupied and 
cultivated said land jointly with him, during his lifetime, from 1930 to 1948, 
and had improved it and made it productive through their common efforts, 
according to said pleading. Inasmuch as Luis Pineda and Bruno Ramirez had, 
allegedly, taken possession of said land in 1948, excluding her illegally and in 
bad faith from such possession and from the enjoyment thereof, Potenciana Plando 
sought a judicial declaration of her title, as the basis for her right of 
possession.</p>
<p>No answer having been filed by Luis Pineda and Bruno Ramirez both were 
declared in default. Thus, the only issue for determination by the court in 
Civil Case No. 959 was the truth of the allegation in said complaint, which was 
established by the evidence introduced by Potenciana Plando, so that the court 
had, not only the authority, but the duty to render the disputed decision 
holding that Potenciana Plando is the lawful owner of the land in 
litigation.</p>
<p>Again, the petition for relief of judgment by default filed by Luis Pineda 
and Bruno Ramirez did not question the title of Domingo Ramirez to the land in 
dispute. What is more, in such petition and in the answer thereto attached they 
<em>relied</em> upon said title of Domingo Ramirez, for Luis Pineda claimed to 
have acquired it by purchase and they alleged that Potenciana Plando was merely 
a common-law wife of Domingo Ramirez, without any right to succeed him. In other 
words, the records of Civil Case No. 959, showed that the equitable title of 
Domingo Ramirez in and to the disputed land was uncontested. The only issue 
raised after the rendition of the decision therein, was: Who succeeded to such 
equitable proprietary rights? Was it Potenciana Plando or Luis Pineda? Obviously 
this question was within the competence of the Court of First Instance of Davao 
to settle.</p>
<p>Regardless of the foregoing, it is true that, subject to the authority of the 
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Eesources, the Director of Lands has, by 
law, direct control over the sale or any other form of concession or disposition 
and the management of the public domain (Commonwealth Act No., 141 sections 4 
and 5) and that, accordingly, said officers are clothed with authority to 
decide, <em>inter alia</em>, conflicts between applicants for homestead. It is, 
likewise, settled that, until such controversy has been decided by the Director 
of Lands and/or the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources—or, to put it 
differently, until all administrative remedies have been exhausted—a judicial 
recourse for the settlement of said controversy has generally been held to be 
"premature" (Municipality of Hinabañgan <em>vs</em>. Municipality of Wright and 
Julian Abegonia, 107 Phil., 394). The rule to the effect that administrative 
remedies must "first be exhausted merely implies, however, the absence of a 
"cause of action" (M. Vda. de Villanueva <em>vs</em>. Ortiz (103 Phil., 875; 
Lubugan <em>vs</em>. Castillo, L-10521, May 29, 1957), and does <em>not</em> 
affect the "jurisdiction" of the court, either over the parties, if they have 
been properly summoned, or over the subject matter of the case.</p>
<p>Luis Pineda does not claim that he had not been properly summoned in Civil 
Case No. 959. Upon the other hand, courts of first instance are, and have been 
expressly vested, with original jurisdiction "in all civil actions which involve 
the title to or possession of real property, or any interest therein * * *" 
(Republic Act No. 296, section 44). Accordingly, even if the issue in Civil Case 
No. 959 had been who, as between the parties therein had a better title to a 
given <em>public</em> land, the court would have retained its jurisdiction to 
hear and decide the case, although, had its attention been called to the 
proceedings then pending in the Bureau of Lands—which were not disclosed by the 
record when the decision was rendered—it should have dismissed the case, 
<em>not</em> for want of jurisdiction, but for lack of "cause of action" on the 
part of Potenciana Plando.</p>
<p>At most, therefore, said court <em>erred</em> in refusing to grant the motion 
for relief of judgment by default, and, had an appeal been taken from the order 
denying said motion, it would have been proper for the appellate court to 
reverse said order and set it aside. But, no such appeal was taken, and the 
decision in Civil Case No, 959 was thus allowed to become final and executory. 
Inasmuch as the court had jurisdiction to render it, said decision is valid and 
binding upon the parties therein, no matter how erroneous it might have 
been.</p>
<p>Moreover, plaintiff herein sought to annul the pertinent portion of the 
aforementioned decision by applying from the Court of Appeals for a writ of 
certiorari upon the ground of nullity of said portion for alleged lack of 
jurisdiction, and not only was the writ prayed for denied by the Court of 
Appeals, by resolution dated November 18, 1954, but, we likewise, refused to 
review by certiorari said Resolution of the Court of Appeals. Since the 
jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance of Davao to make the disputed 
.pronouncement in its decision in Civil Case No. 959 was the main issue in the 
certiorari case aforementioned, the aforementioned resolution of the Court of 
Appeals and that of this Court refusing to review said resolution constitute 
another bar to the present action seeking to revive said issue.</p>
<p>It is, therefore, our considered opinion, and we so hold, that the lower 
court erred in rendering the decision appealed from, and that the same should, 
accordingly, be, as it is hereby, reversed, and the complaint herein dismissed, 
with costs against plaintiff Luis Pineda. It is so ordered.</p>

Barrera, Paredes,</em> and <em>Dizon, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
