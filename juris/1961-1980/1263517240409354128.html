				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, in its Special Civil Case No. 6104,
granting a motion to dismiss and dissolving a preliminary injunction previously
issued by said Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In brief, the case is as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner-appellant, <span class="SpellE">Araceli</span> <span class="SpellE">Malag</span>, is the duly elected mayor of <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime in early June, 1968, a barrio
captain, <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Gilledo</span>,
lodged sworn charges against the said mayor with the Provincial Board of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, accusing said official of serious misconduct in
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, respondent Ramon de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <span class="SpellE">Cientos</span>, in his capacity as
Provincial Governor, required Mayor <span class="SpellE">Malag</span> to answer
the charges, and on <st1:date year="1968" day="3" month="7">3 July 1968</st1:date>
preventively suspended the mayor from office and directed the other res­pondent,
Vice-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Coong</span>,
to assume the post.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mayor <span class="SpellE">Malag</span> refused to turn over the office, contending that said
order of preventive sus­pension had no warrant in law; filed with the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> a petition for prohibition
against the enforcement of the governor's order, and secured a writ of
preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, after hearing the parties, the court below concluded
that the order of suspension was valid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1968" day="10" month="9">10 September 1968</st1:date>,
the court granted the governor's motion to dismiss, and dissolved the writ of
preliminary in­junction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unable to
secure reconsideration, Mayor <span class="SpellE">Malag</span> resorted to this
Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue at bar, on basically identical facts, was finally
resolved by this Supreme Court in <span class="SpellE">Sarcos</span> vs. Governor
Castillo, L-29755, promulgated on <st1:date year="1969" day="31" month="1">31
 January 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therein, this
Court, through Mr. Justice Enrique M. Fernando, ruled that after the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the Decentralization Act of 1967, Republic
Act No. 5185, the power of preventive suspension of municipal officials was
taken away from the Provincial Governor and lodged, in the Provincial
Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the reasons set out at length
in said decision, which we need not repeat here, we hold that the order of
preventive suspension of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Malag</span> by Governor de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <span class="SpellE">Cientos</span> is not in accord with
law, and, therefore, invalid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
corollary, the order authorizing and directing Vice-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Coong</span>
to assume the functions of the mayor is likewise null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents sought dismissal of this case as moot, pleading that
the Pro­vincial Board had found Mayor <span class="SpellE">Malag</span> guilty as
charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was <span class="GramE">shown,</span>
how­ever, that <span class="SpellE">operativeness</span> of the decision has been
arrested by higher executive authority.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Not only this, but it likewise appears that, during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of this appeal, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> has reconsidered its opinion and reinstated the
injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, the order of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, dated 10 September 1968, is
declared erroneous, and the same is reversed and set aside, and respondents,
their agents and represent­atives are prohibited and enjoined from enforcing or
implementing the order of suspension of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Malag<span class="GramE">,as</span></span> well as the directive to the Vice-Mayor to assume
and discharge herein petitioner's functions; and should they have done so, to
immediately desist <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against respondents.</span></p>
