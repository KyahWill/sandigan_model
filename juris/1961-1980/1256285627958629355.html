Marcelo, in her behalf and in that of her minor children <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span>, Eduardo, Maria <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>
and Romeo, filed on September 28, 1959 with the Regional Office No. 4
of the Department of Labor a complaint for compensation arising from
the death of Domingo <span class="SpellE">Punzal</span>, their husband
and father respectively, who died of pulmonary tuberculosis contracted
and aggravated while in the employ of the Manila Railroad Company as
assistant train conductor.<o:p></o:p></span>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The company <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
the claim on several grounds, namely, (1) the deceased contracted
tuberculosis not because of the nature of his employment but due to his
poor health and lack of care of his body; (2) the company has always
provided all means necessary to protect the health of its employees but
the deceased failed to avail of them (3) after separation from the
service an employee is no longer entitled to medical treatment; (4) an
employer is not an insurer of the life and health of its employees; (5)
the claim has already prescribed; (6) the company has already settled
in full whatever claim may be due the deceased; and (7) the claim
states no valid cause of action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After
hearing on the merits, Juan N. Gerardo, hearing officer, rendered
decision dismissing the complaint for lack of merit having found that
the deceased died of a cause independent of his employment and not
arising in the course thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Claimants filed a petition for review with the Workmen's Compensation Commission, and on March 9,1961, Associate Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Cesareo</span>
Perez rendered decision reversing that of the hearing officer, holding
that the illness of the deceased was aggravated by the nature of his
work as train conductor, and so he ordered the company to pay the
claimants the sum of P3,455.71 as death benefits, to reimburse them the
sum of P200.00 for burial expenses, to pay the amount of P259.18 as
attorney's fees, and pay the Commission the sum of P35.00 as fees
pursuant to law. Its motion for reconsideration having been denied, the
company interposed the present petition for review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Domingo <span class="SpellE">Punzal</span>, husband and father respectively of the claimants, was employed by the Manila Railroad Company as brakeman from </span><st1:date year="1929" day="16" month="1"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 16, 1929</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> to </span><st1:date year="1929" day="30" month="9"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 30, 1929</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. He was dismissed from the service on </span><st1:date year="1931" day="1" month="1"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 1, 1931</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. Seven years later, or on </span><st1:date year="1936" day="1" month="1"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 1, 1936</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, he was reemployed as assistant train conductor who continued as such up to </span><st1:date year="1941" day="8" month="12"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 8, 1941</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. On </span><st1:date year="1946" day="1" month="4"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 1, 1946</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, he was reemployed as brakeman until </span><st1:date year="1948" day="15" month="9"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 15, 1948</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. From this date up to </span><st1:date year="1957" day="3" month="10"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 3, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">,
when he died, he was employed as assistant train conductor. As
assistant train conductor his duties were to revise passenger tickets,
to attend to the <span class="SpellE">signalling</span> of the engine
man both while the train is in motion as well as when the train is to
depart; to see that the brakes are in good condition; to help the
passengers carry their <span class="SpellE">luggages</span> in boarding the train as well as in <span class="GramE">disembarking</span>; to load and unload <span class="SpellE">baggages</span>
and merchandise in the freight train; and to travel by night under all
kinds of weather conditions. He was not given any pre-employment X-ray
examination and so he was presumed to be physically fit and free from
tuberculosis. On </span><st1:date year="1957" day="1" month="4"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 1, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">,
he applied for optional retirement on the ground of physical disability
alleging that one of his lungs was afflicted with tuberculosis. He was
extended medical treatment by the company and in fact he was given
leave of absence without pay from June 2 to </span><st1:date year="1957" day="30" month="9"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 30, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. He was treated in the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Institute on </span><st1:date year="1957" day="3" month="10"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 3, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> where he was found suffering moderately from tuberculosis, and on that same date he died.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">From
the facts found by the Workmen's Compensation Commissioner there is no
doubt that the deceased contracted tuberculosis during his employment
as train conductor in the Manila Railroad Company and that that
sickness was aggravated due to the nature of the work undertaken by him
which finally brought him to his grave. The record, however, shows that
the deceased died on </span><st1:date year="1957" day="3" month="10"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 3, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, and yet the present complaint was filed by his heirs only on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="28" month="9"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 28, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">,
or more than 20 months from the death of the deceased. This is contrary
to what Section 24 of Act 3428 provides to the effect that no
compensation under the law shall prosper unless the claim for
compensation, in case of death, is made <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">not later than 3 months after death.</span></em>
In a recent case, this Court said: "This section establishes a
condition precedent to the maintenance of any compensation proceeding
under the Act. It requires previous notice of the injury or sickness as
well as previous claim for compensation within a period fixed in either
case. Non-compliance with that requirement bars recovery for
compensation" (Luzon Stevedoring Company <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs.</span></em> Hon. <span class="SpellE">Cesareo</span>
de Leon, et al., 106 Phil., 562). It is clear, therefore, that the
claimants failed to comply with the condition precedent for the filing
of their claim, and, hence, non-compliance therewith is a bar to
recovery of compensation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is, therefore, with regret that we have to reverse the decision of respondent Commission, without pronouncement as to costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
