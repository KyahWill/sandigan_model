				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by defendant Roberto <span class="SpellE">Ner</span> y
Feliciano from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila convicting
him of the crime of murder, with which he is charged, and sentencing him to
life imprisonment, with the corresponding accessory penalties, to indemnify the
heirs of the deceased Jose de Leon, in the sum of P6,000, without subsidiary
imprisonment in the event of insolvency, and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">It is not disputed that, while he was
in <span style="">his </span>apartment at No. 2036-C <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> Street, Sta. Cruz, Manila, on May 17, 1964, at
about 10:00 p.m., Jose de Leon was shot and sustained several wounds in
different parts of the body, as a consequence of which, he died soon
thereafter, before reaching the North General Hospital, to which he was brought
immediately after the occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to Dr. Angelo <span class="SpellE">Singian</span>, Assistant
Chief Medical Examiner of the Manila Police Department, the cause of death was
profuse hemorrhage due to <span style="">9 </span>"through
and through" gunshot wounds, five (5) produced by a .38 or .45 caliber
firearm and four (4) by a .32 caliber firearm.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, .45 and .32 caliber slugs and shells were found at the scene of
the shooting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, the corresponding
information for murder was filed against Roberto <span class="SpellE">Ner</span>
y Felicia o, who allegedly killed Jose de Leon "conspiring and
confederating With two (2) others, whose true names, identities and whereabouts
are still unknown," although the complaint filed with the office of the
City Fiscal of Manila named Valentino Villanueva and Jose <span class="SpellE">Lopena</span>
as the persons who had thus assisted <span class="SpellE">Ner</span> in the
commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due
trial, under a plea of not guilty, the lower court convicted and sentenced <span class="SpellE">Ner</span> as above stated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, <span class="SpellE">Ner</span> moved for a new trial, upon the
ground of newly discovered evidence, but the motion was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case hinges on whether or not appellant has been sufficiently
identified as the killer or one of the killers of Jose de Leon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, the main witnesses for
the prosecution were <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> de Leon, Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Bolea</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rddolfo</span> Rosales and <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first is a lieutenant in the Manila Police Department, and
will, accordingly, be referred to by his aforementioned rank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lieutenant was, at the time of the
occurrence, in his house at No. 2063 <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> St.,
about 30 meters away from that of Jose de Leon, who was his nephew and will
hereafter be referred to as "Boy", his nickname.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon hearing the report of gun fire, the
lieutenant ran to the latter's house, at the ground floor of which he learned
that the shooting had taken place in Boy's apartment, at the third floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the door of said apartment, he found Boy
on the floor, lying on his right side, bleeding profusely, with his feet at the
door and the head inside the room, wearing no other garment than a "short"
trunk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lifting Boy's head, the lieutenant
inquired about the identity of his assailant, to which Boy answered, in a
"low voice":<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Bobby"
"Pirate".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are the
nicknames of appellant herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the
lieutenant asked "who Bobby" and "who Pirate" was, Boy
looked at him (lieutenant), but did not answer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Forthwith, the lieutenant ran down and asked several persons, whom he
found at the ground floor, to get a vehicle so that Boy could be taken to a
hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the lieutenant and four
(4) other persons, who followed him to Boy's apartment, brought Boy down and
placed him in a jeep, at the door of the building, whereupon the lieutenant
bade those helping him to take Boy "to the hospital," which they
did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, the lieutenant posted himself
at the door of the apartment, outside the same, "so that nobody could
touch anything."</p>

<p class="BODY">According to Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Bolea</span>, he thrice
saw appellant <span class="SpellE">Ner</span>, accompanied by Jose <span class="SpellE">Lopena</span> and Valentino Villanueva, in the evening of <st1:date year="1964" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1964</st1:date>, cruising aboard a
red-colored jeep along <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span>
  St.</st1:address></st1:street>, where he was.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, when the jeep passed in front of <span class="SpellE">Bolea</span>,
for the first time - after he had bought cigarettes from a store nearby - <span class="SpellE">Lopena</span> greeted him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the jeep passed for the third time, <span class="SpellE">Bolea</span>
was seated in front of the house of one <span class="SpellE">Aling</span> <span class="SpellE">Asiang</span>, about 15 meters away from the building in which
Boy's apartment was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ner</span>
was then behind the “wheel”, with Villanueva seated beside him, and <span class="SpellE">Lopena</span> in the back seat.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The jeep made a U-turn and then parked in front of said apartment,
facing <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lopena</span> alighted
from the jeep and talked with someone seated on a bench, whereas <span class="SpellE">Ner</span>, followed by Villanueva, entered said building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon there was a volley of shots in Boy's
apartment, after which <span class="SpellE">Ner</span> emerged hurriedly from the
building, holding a firearm, which he threw into the back of the jeep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He blew its horn twice, and, forthwith
starting the motor, drove off alone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then Angelina <span class="SpellE">Viray</span>, Boy's common-law-wife,
rushed out of the apartment shouting several times "<span class="SpellE">Binaril</span>
<span class="SpellE">si</span> Boy <span class="SpellE">ni</span> Pirate; <span class="SpellE">binaril</span> <span class="SpellE">si</span> Boy" (Boy was
shot by Pirate; Boy has been shot).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, the lieutenant came running towards the apartment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of Rodolfo Rosales was, substantially, to the same
effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, near said
apartment, at the time of the occurrence and shortly before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, <span class="SpellE">Bolea</span>
passed in front of him on his (<span class="SpellE">Bolea's</span>) way to the
place of <span class="SpellE">Aling</span> <span class="SpellE">Asiang</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the aforementioned jeep passed for the
third time, with <span class="SpellE">Ner</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lopena</span>
and Villanueva on board the vehicle, they parked it in front of the building
above mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then <span class="SpellE">Ner</span> and Villanueva entered the same, but, no sooner had
they done so than gunshots were fired.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Forthwith, <span class="SpellE">Ner</span> ran out of the building and
sped away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then Angelina <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> emerged <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> saying
"<span class="SpellE">Tulungan</span> <span class="SpellE">ninyo</span> <span class="SpellE">ako</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Binaril</span> <span class="SpellE">si</span> Boy; <span class="SpellE">binaril</span> <span class="SpellE">si</span> boy x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Pirate" (Help me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Boy has been shot; Boy has been shot x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>Pirate").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Immediately thereafter, the lieutenant went
up the building and entered Boy's apartment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rosales followed the lieutenant to the third floor of the building and
saw the body of Boy on the floor, in a pool of blood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lieutenant held Boy's head and asked him
who had shot him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Boy opened his eyes
and, with a trembling voice, replied:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Pirate" or "Bobby Pirate".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lieutenant further inquired:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"What Bobby?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What Pirate?" Rosales heard no
answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was, also, one of those who
brought Boy to the <st1:place><st1:placename>North</st1:placename> <st1:placename>General</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>, but Boy died before
reaching the same.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>
declared that, in response to a call, received by him as mobile patrolman, he
reached Boy's apartment at about 10:<st1:time minute="0" hour="21">09 p.m.</st1:time>,
but he (Boy) was then already gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>, however, asked Angelina <span class="SpellE">Viray</span>
what had happened, and she said that Boy lived with her in the apartment, she
being his wife; that between 9:50 and 10:00 o'clock that evening, Pirate Bobby <span class="SpellE">Ner</span> had visited them; that Boy and <span class="SpellE">Ner</span>
talked in the living room, after which, <span class="SpellE">Ner</span> left;
that, when Boy and Angelina retired to their bed-room, soon thereafter,
somebody knocked at the door; that as Boy opened the same, there was a hail of
gunshots; that rushing out of the bed-room, she saw Boy sprawled on the floor,
mortally wounded; and that his assailant was Bobby <span class="SpellE">Ner</span>
<u>alias Pirate</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The main witness for the defense was Rolando <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>,
an 18-year old tricycle operator, who would have us believe that, at the time
of the occurrence, he was with his tricycle, parked beside the house of one
Mrs. Aguilar, across the street from Boy's apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then two (2) men came in an army jeep and
went up the apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon, several
shots rang out in succession, whereupon said men rushed out of the apartment,
boarded the jeep and sped away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of
them was, however, appellant <span class="SpellE">Ner</span>, whom the witness
knows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nei­ther did he see either the
lieutenant or Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Bolea</span> or Rodolfo Rosales, at
the scene of the occurrence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense introduced, also, the testimony of Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> and Eduardo Benito, who affirmed that on <st1:date year="1964" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1964</st1:date>, between <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00</st1:time> and <st1:time minute="0" hour="22">10:00
 p.m.</st1:time>, <span class="SpellE">Bolea</span> and Rosales were in a
pool-room at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>,
from which they proceeded to the scene of the occurrence after being informed
that the same had taken place.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, testifying for the defense, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
Villanueva, father of Valentino Villanueva, stated that Angelina <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> had never mentioned the name of Boy's assailant and
that the first person who entered Boy's apartment, after the occurrence, was
one Corporal Herrera, not Lt. de Leon, who did not reach the apartment until 12
minutes after the shooting.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Ner</span> did not take the witness
stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He now maintains that His Honor,
the trial Judge, Hon. Federico <span class="SpellE">Alikpala</span>, had erred in
giving credence to the witnesses for the prosecution; in taking into account
the testimony of Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>, relative to the
statements made to him by Angelina <span class="SpellE">Viray</span>,
notwithstanding the fact that she had not been placed on the witness stand; in
drawing an unfavorable infer­ence from his (appellant's) failure to testify on
his behalf; in not hold­ing that the evidence is insufficient to establish his
guilt; and in deny­ing his motion for a new trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon a review of the record, we find ourselves unable to disturb
the findings of fact made by Judge <span class="SpellE">Alikpala</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the lieutenant had no reason to
implicate appellant herein, if Boy had not really named him (appellant) as his
assailant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of impelling him to
commit perjury, the fact that Boy was his nephew was an added inducement for
the lieutenant to adhere to the truth, as, otherwise, he would not only
contribute to the conviction of an innocent person, but, also, assist the
guilty party in evading punishment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
veracity of the lieutenant's testimony is, moreover, bolstered up by the
testimony of Rosales, who heard the lieutenant inquire about the identity of
the assailant, as well as the answer given by Boy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither had Rosales and <span class="SpellE">Bolea</span> any
possible motive to falsely incriminate appellant herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the records show that
Rosales and <span class="SpellE">Bolea</span> were old acquaintances of and in
friendly terms with appellant <span class="SpellE">Ner</span> and Valentino
Villanueva, as well as Jose <span class="SpellE">Lopena</span>, both of whom
were, likewise, implicated by said witnesses for the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this they must have done from the very
beginning, for - as stated in appellant's motion for reconsideration -
Villanueva and <span class="SpellE">Lopena</span> were included in the charge
filed by the police in the office of the City Fiscal of Manila, because of
which they took to hiding soon thereafter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense makes capital of the fact that, according to Dr. <span class="SpellE">Singian</span>, Boy may have lived "one to two minutes"
after being shot, during which period of time "it might be possible but less
probable" for him to speak.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant deduces <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> that Boy could not
have told the lieutenant, when the latter reached the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
apartment, that his assailant was "Bobby", "Pirate",
because the lieutenant's residence was about 30 meters away from Boy's
apartment and said two minutes must have elapsed before the lieutenant had
covered the distance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This conclusion
is, however, debatable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be­sides, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Singian</span> spoke merely in terms of possibilities and
probabilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not say that Boy could
not have lived longer than or spoken after two (2) minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He even confessed that one "could <u>not</u>
be certain," or positive about it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, Boy <u>did</u> live several minutes <u>after</u> the lieutenant
had reached him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the lieutenant
even asked several persons to take Boy to the North General Hospital, in view
of which, said persons went up the apartment of Boy, took him down the building
in which his apartment was, placed him in a jeep parked at <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span>
street and brought him to said hospital, although he died on the way
thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By this time, from <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5</st1:time> to 10 minutes, at least, must have elapsed
since he was shot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, Boy may have
really told the lieutenant that the assailant was "Bobby"
"Pirate".</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant assails the veracity of Rosales, upon the ground that
there are several contradictions between his testimony in court and that given
by him at the preliminary investigation, in the office of the City Fiscal and
between his testimony in chief and the answers given by him on
cross-examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged
contradictions refer to whether the jeep used by appellant <span class="SpellE">Ner</span>
came from <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> street or <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span>
street, before it parked in front of the house in which Boy had his apartment;
whether the jeep had three (3) or four (4) passengers; whether the passengers
who entered said house were two (2) or three (3); the period of time that
elapsed from such entry to the shooting; the caliber and color of the gun
carried by appellant, when he emerged from said house, immediately after the
occurrence; whether he started the motor of the jeep before blowing its horn,
or the latter was first; and the precise words uttered by Angelina <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> when she came out of the building.</p>

<p class="BODY">These are, however, minor details which do not affect the
testimony of Rosales on appellant's presence in Boy's apartment, at the time of
the occurrence, on which he has not incurred in any contradiction and was
corroborated by <span class="SpellE">Bolea</span>, the lieutenant and <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
as regards the events immediately preceding the occurrence, it is well to
remember that Rosales had not anticipated the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, his attention was not <span class="SpellE">focussed</span> on appellant's jeep and its occupants, so that it
was only natural for him (Rosales) to have no more than a general idea about
it, and to be uncertain about minute details.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, minor inconsistencies of a witness tend to reinforce, rather
than weaken, his testimony, for they indicate that it was spontaneous and
unrehearsed.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Again, when Rosales testified in the City <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span>
office, Valentino Villanueva, his father <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
Villanueva, Jose <span class="SpellE">Lopena</span> and the latter's lawyer were
seated beside him (Rosales).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Valentino
Villanueva was so close to Rosales that the former used to nudge the latter's
feet in the course of his testimony.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There were then no other persons in said office, except the
investigating fiscal and Boy's father, who was some distance away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that Valentino Villanueva and
Jose <span class="SpellE">Lopena</span>, aside from appellant <span class="SpellE">Ner</span>,
who was then at large, had been implicated by Rosales, we accept, as satisfactory,
his explanation to the effect that the inaccurate details mentioned by him on
that occasion were due to his extremely nervous condition at that time.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is next contended that Rosales had contradicted the lieutenant,
because the latter testified that he was <u>alone</u> in Boy's room when he
(lieutenant) inquired about the assailant's identity and Boy-answered
"Bobby" "Pirate", whereas Rosales affirmed that he saw and
heard Boy give his <u>ante</u> <u>mortem</u> statement, and because the
lieutenant claimed not to have met Angelina <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> as
the former proceeded to Boy's apartment, although Rosales declared
otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Are </span>find no contradiction between
these testimonies, for the lieutenant was <u>inside </u>Boy's apartment and
Rosales was <u>outside</u> the same when the <u>ante</u> <u>mortem</u>
statement was made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, too, when the
lieutenant proceeded to said apartment, he was in such a hurry that he did not
pay attention to the people on the way thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">What has been said concerning Rosales applies equally to the
contradictions allegedly found in <span class="SpellE">Bolea's</span>
testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Emphasis is placed by
appellant upon <span class="SpellE">Bolea's</span> failure to relate to the
relatives of Boy, at any of the three (3) or four (4) days he (Boy) was lying
in estate, what he (<span class="SpellE">Bolea</span>) had witnessed in the
evening of the occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This has been
sufficiently explained by <span class="SpellE">Bolea</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Boy's assassination was not an ordinary
passion crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had been killed in
gangland or goon fashion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of his
supposed assailants were then at large.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Worse still, Valentino Villanueva, one of those he believed to have
participated in the commission of the offense, was living in the same building
in which Boy had his apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
short, <span class="SpellE">Bolea's</span> silence was dictated by prudence and
the instinct of self-preservation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense insists that the testimony of Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> concerning his conversation with Angelina <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> should be disregarded as hearsay, for Angelina did
not take the witness stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
conversa­tion took place in Boy's apartment, on <st1:date year="1964" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1964</st1:date>, between <st1:time minute="9" hour="10">10:09</st1:time>
and <st1:time minute="30" hour="22">10:30 p.m.</st1:time>, or immediately after
the occurrence, and referred to the circumstances surrounding the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time, Angelina had not, as yet, fully
recovered from the effects of the as­sassination of her common-law husband,
practically, if not actually, before her own eyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, she was not only crying; she had,
also, been repeatedly saying, almost hysterically, that Boy had been shot by
"Pirate".<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tiong's</span>
testimony about the statements then made by her, before she could deliberate on
the events that had transpired a few minutes before, was properly admitted
under Sec. 36 of Rule 130 of the Rules of Court, pursuant to which:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Statements made by a person while a startling occurrence is taking place <u>or
immediately<span style="">&nbsp; </span>prior </u><u><span style="">or </span>subsequent thereto</u> with respect
to the circumstances thereof, may be given in evidence as a part of the RES
GESTAE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, it has been held:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> that declarations which are the natural emanations or
outgrowths of the act or occurrence in litigation, <u>although not precisely
concurrent in point of time</u>, if they were yet voluntarily and spontaneously
made so <u>nearly contemporaneous as to be in the presence of the transaction
which they illustrate and explain</u>, and were <u>made under such
circumstances as necessarily to exclude the idea of design or deliberation</u>,
<span style="">must, </span>upon the clearest
principles of justice, be <u>admissible</u> as part of the act or transaction
itself.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is true that, in saying that Boy had been shot by Pirate,
Angelina did not explain to Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> whether or
not she had seen the latter in the act of firing, although she said so in an
affidavit made by her in the City <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span>
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her story to Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> indicated, however, that she had seen appellant and
Boy talking in the living room of his apartment, shortly before the shooting,
and that, accordingly, she had personal knowledge of appellant's <u>presence</u>
at the scene of the occurrence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that Angelina's statement to <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>
was part of her narration, prompted by his questions about the details of the
occurrence, does not detract from the spontaneity of her statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that is required for the admissibility of
a given statement as part of the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>gestae</u></span>, is that it be made under the influence of a
startling eve<span style="">n</span>t witnessed by the

<p class="BODY">Thus, in People v. <span class="SpellE">Ruzol</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>,

convincing proof that he recognized the accused when he saw them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The discovery of the crime by the witness,
his pursuit of the accused, and the fact that immediately thereafter, as soon as
he arrived at the barracks, he positively pointed to the accused as the
perpetrators of the crime, without any sufficient intervening time for him to
fabricate his account, is convincing proof of the correctness of his
identification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the events occurred

<p class="BODY">Little need be said about the evidence for the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
Villanueva's assertion that Angelina had not mentioned appellant's nickname,
immediately after the occurrence, cannot affect the result of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To begin with, his son, Valentino Villanueva,
was one of those implicated by the evidence for the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being naturally interested in the latter's
failure, the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> does not have much
weight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said interest is made even more
manifest by the fact that it was <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Villanueva
who asked Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> and Eduardo Benito to
testify for appellant herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any
rate, said testimony cannot prevail over the positive evidence for the
prosecution concerning the presence of appellant in Boy's apartment,
corroborated by Boy's <u>ante</u> <u>mortem</u> declaration and the testimony
of Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> regarding the statement of
Angelina <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> immediately after the occurrence.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is, likewise, clear that the negative testimony of Rolando <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> to the effect that none of the two (2) men who
alighted from the jeep and entered the building at No. 2036 <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span>
street, was appellant <span class="SpellE">Ner</span>, and that he (<span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>) had not seen the lieutenant, Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Bolea</span> and Rodolfo Rosales in that place, cannot blunt the
positive testimony to the contrary of these witnesses for the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inherent weakness of <span class="SpellE">Raymundo's</span>
testimony becomes evident when we bear in mind that he denied having seen at
the place of the occurrence, not only <span class="SpellE">Bolea</span> and
Rosales, but, also, the lieutenant, despite the fact that the latter's presence
in Boy's apartment had been admitted by defense witness <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
Villanueva.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, again, if <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> merely failed to notice the lieutenant when the
latter entered said building, then it is not unlikely - assuming that his (<span class="SpellE">Raymundo's</span>) tricycle was really parked in front of said
build­ing - that he had incurred in a similar oversight as regards the entry of
<span class="SpellE">Ner</span> in the same building and the presence of <span class="SpellE">Bolea</span> and Rosales in the vicinity thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, such presence is incontestable, not
only as regards the lieutenant, but, also, insofar as Rosales is concerned, he
being one of those who brought Boy to the <st1:place><st1:placename>North</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>General</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">This fact, in turn, discredits the testimony of Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> and Eduardo Benito, who would have us believe that
Rosales and <span class="SpellE">Bolea</span> were in a pool-room at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>, when Boy was
shot, and that said witnesses for the prosecution did not leave said place
until later, when someone came and brought news about the occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, considering that the messenger of
this news was someone who, apparently had walked from the scene of the
occurrence, after inquiring about the identity of the victim, and that it took
less than <span style="">9 </span>minutes to remove
the latter from his apartment, Rosales could not have reached the same on time
to bring Boy to the hospital - as he did - had <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
and Benito told the truth.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon a careful review of the record, we are fully satisfied that
Judge <span class="SpellE">Alikpala</span> has not overlooked or misunderstood
any fact or circumstance of weight and importance in deciding this case, in
view of which we can not disturb his findings of fact based upon a reliance on
the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution, and the view that that of
the witnesses for the defense is unworthy of credence.</p>

<p class="BODY">About a week after the promulgation of the decision appealed
from, appellant filed a motion for new trial based upon allegedly newly
discovered evidence, namely, the testimony of Angelina <span class="SpellE">Viray</span>,
Valentino Villanueva and Jose <span class="SpellE">Lopena</span>, whose
affidavits were attached to said motion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant maintains that the lower court has erred in denying said
motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is alleged therein that the defense could not have availed,
prior thereto, of the testimonies of Valentino Villanueva and Jose <span class="SpellE">Lopena</span> because they had been in hiding up to <st1:date year="1965" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1965</st1:date>, or after the
conclusion of the trial on <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="4">April 2,
 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows,
however, that, as early as <st1:date year="1964" day="16" month="12">December
 16<span style="">, </span>1964</st1:date>, or even
before the prosecution had completed the presentation of its evidence,
Villanueva and <span class="SpellE">Lopena</span> had executed a joint affidavit,
in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, before appellant's
counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the testimony of said
witnesses is not newly discovered evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither is that of Angelina <span class="SpellE">Viray</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the decision appealed from was
promulgated on <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="10">October 4, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, a news item about it appeared in
the issue of the Manila Daily Bulle­tin, of <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1965</st1:date>, reading:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">"<u>YOUNG HOOD
METED OUT A LIFE TERM</u><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"A youthful police character Roberto <span class="SpellE">Ner</span>
y Feliciano, was convicted for murder yesterday and sentenced to life
imprisonment by the Court of First Instance.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Judge Federico <span class="SpellE">Alikpala</span> convicted <span class="SpellE">Ner</span> for the slaying of Jose de Leon nephew of a police
officer, last May 17, 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>De <st1:country-region><st1:place>Leon</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was shot and killed in his house.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The defense headed by <span class="SpellE">Candelario</span> R.
Domingo, indicated it would ask for a new trial on the basis of new­ly found
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It intended to present a
certain Angelina <span class="SpellE">Viray</span>, who was said in the verdict
to be the common-law wife of De <st1:country-region><st1:place>Leon</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and was also the lone eye­witness to the slaying."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is thus manifest that the testimony of Angelina <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> was available to the defense even before October 4,
1965, for, otherwise, appellant's counsel could not have announced then the
intention to file a motion for new trial based upon her testimony, which, in
fact, he filed soon thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
explains why she did not appear before the court, despite the subpoena issued
to her, as witness for the prosecution, when the trial began on September 10,
1964, and notwithstanding an affidavit subscribed and sworn to by her, before
an assistant fiscal of Manila, on June 17, 1964 - or before the filing of the
information against appellant herein - confirming the story given by her to
Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> in the evening of May 17, 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another subpoena issued to her for the resumption
of the trial on <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1965</st1:date>,
could not be served, because she was "no longer residing at given
address." The prosecution stated to the Court that it (the prosecution)
had "tried to locate her" and had "not been successful" in
this endeavor.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, in her affidavit attached to the motion for new
trial, Angelina declared - contrary to her aforementioned affidavit of June 17,
1964 - that she did not see the person who shot Boy and that, immediately after
the occurrence, she did not mention appel­lant's nickname as that of Boy's
assassin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their joint affidavit
appended to the same motion, Valentino Villanueva and Jose <span class="SpellE">Lopena</span>,
in turn, stated that <span class="SpellE">Lopena</span> "was never at <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> Street, Sta. Cruz, Manila, during the evening of
May 17, 1964" and that "Valentino Villanueva was already sleeping in
the bedroom of their apartment during said time" -- "about 10
o'clock" in the evening -- "and date." Thus, this alleged newly
discovered evidence is merely impeaching, cumu­lative or corroborative of that
already introduced by the defense, for which reason Judge <span class="SpellE">Alikpala</span>
did not abuse his discretion in denying appellant's motion for new trial.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as Boy was shot suddenly and unexpectedly, as he opened
the door of his apartment, in response to the knocking thereat, soon after the
visit paid to him by appellant herein, when he (Boy) was almost naked, for he
was about to go to bed, it is evident that appellant had acted with treachery,
he having employed means and ways, in the commission of the crime, tending
directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to himself arising
from the defense that Boy may put up, and which Boy had no opportunity to make.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The crime committed was, therefore, murder, which was attended, also, by the
aggravating circumstance of dwelling of the offended party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, nighttime was manifestly sought, to
be sure that Boy was not only in the house, but, also, about to go to bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, to avoid any possible
miscalculation, appellant even pretended to pay Boy a social visit and to part
from the apartment in seeming friendly spirit, only to knock at the door
thereof soon thereafter for the kill.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
The measures thus taken by appellant, coupled with the fact that he drove three
times past the building in which the apartment was, together with two (2) men,
before entering said building, armed with a firearm, establish beyond doubt
that he had planned the commission of the offense and had, accordingly, acted
with evident premeditation.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
In view of this circumstance and the aggravating circumstances of nighttime and
dwelling, without any mitigating circumstance to offset the same, the maximum
penalty prescribed for murder, or death, should be meted out to appellant
herein, although, for lack of the number of votes necessary <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
the penalty imposed by the lower court is in order.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, modified as to the indemnity, which is

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">CASTRO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1964</st1:date>
Roberto <span class="SpellE">Ner</span> <span style="">y </span>Feliciano was charged before the Court of
First Instance of Manila with murder, committed, according to the indictment,
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 17th day of May, 1964, at nighttime
purposely sought to better accomplish his criminal ends, in the City of Manila,
Philippines, the said accused conspiring and confederating with two (2) others
whose true names, identities and whereabouts are still unknown and helping one
another, with intent to kill and with evident premeditation and treachery, did
then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously
attack, assault and shoot with a gun Jose de Leon <span style="">y </span>Buenav<span style="">e</span>ntura several times on the different parts of his body, inside
his residence, thereby inflicting upon the latter mortal gunshot wounds which
were the direct and imme­diate cause of his death moments thereafter."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">After due trial, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
found the defendant guilty of murder, qualified by treachery, and, there being
no other modifying circumstance, sentenced him to suffer the penalty of life
imprisonment (<u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>), with
the accessory penalties of the law, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in
the sum of P6,000, without subsi­diary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and
to pay the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this decision,
the defendant <span class="SpellE">Ner</span> appealed to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts, as found by the trial court and set forth in its deci­sion,
<span style="">are </span>as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sometime after <st1:time minute="30" hour="21">9:30 p.m.</st1:time> on <st1:date year="1964" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1964</st1:date>, Jose <span class="SpellE">Lopeña</span>,
Roberto <span class="SpellE">Ner</span> and Valentino Villanueva were riding in a
jeep along <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>,
coming from <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>;
the jeep proceeded to <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span>
  Street</st1:address></st1:street>, with the first-named party driving the
vehicle.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After a short while, the
vehicle, with the same parties on board, passed for the second time <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, coming from <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, and again
proceeded to <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the third time,
the said vehicle, with the accused this time driving it, entered <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, coming from <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, after several
minutes had elapsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of
proceeding to <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>,
the jeep, however, made a U-turn in front of the apartment building where Jose
de Leon was residing, after which it parked directly in front of the building,
facing <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lopeña</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Ner</span> and Villanueva alighted from the vehicle, after
which <span class="SpellE">Lopeña</span> approached and talked to a person seated
on a bench on the sidewalk, while <span class="SpellE">Ner</span> and Villanueva
entered the apartment.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ner</span>
proceeded to the third floor, and, upon being admitted to the living room (<span class="SpellE">sala</span>), had a short talk with Jose de Leon, after which he
left and the latter returned to his bedroom.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After a short while,
someone knocked at the main door of the third-floor apartment and when Jose de
Leon opened it, there came successive discharges of firearms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Angelina <span class="SpellE">Viray</span>
immediately went out of the bedroom and saw Jose de Leon sprawled on the floor
near the door, his assailant still firing.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moments after the
shots were fired, <span class="SpellE">Ner</span> came running out of the ground
floor of the apartment, threw a firearm into the back seat of the jeep, and
seated himself behind the steering wheel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He then started the engine, sounded the horn three times, and drove
away.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>8.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Angelina <span class="SpellE">Viray</span>, the common-law wife of Jose de Leon, ran down the
apartment toward the residence of the parents of the latter, shouting, "<span class="SpellE">Tulungan</span> <span class="SpellE">ninyo</span> <span class="SpellE">ako</span>, <span class="SpellE">binaril</span> <span class="SpellE">si</span>
Boy <span class="SpellE">ni</span> Pirate," which she repeated several
times.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>9.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Police Lieutenant de
Leon heard the shots while he was standing by the window of his house and he
immediately ran toward the place where the shots came from.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>10.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching the
third floor of the apartment building, the police lieutenant saw Jose de Leon
lying on his right side on the floor, and he forthwith placed the head of the
latter in his arms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This pol­ice officer
inquired from Jose de Leon who shot him and the latter in a weak, faltering
voice replied, "Bobby Pirate." The police officer asked who "Bobby
Pirate" was, but Jose de Leon did not answer anymore and merely looked at
the face of the former.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>11.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jose de Leon was
brought to the <st1:place><st1:placename>North</st1:placename> <st1:placename>General</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> but was already dead upon
arrival at <st1:time minute="10" hour="22">10:10 p.m.</st1:time><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>12.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At <st1:time minute="9" hour="22">10:09 p.m.</st1:time>, Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>
arrived in the apartment, and questioned Angelina <span class="SpellE">Viray</span>
who in reply stated that Jose de Leon was shot by "Bob­by Pirate."<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>13. The body of Jose de Leon was autopsied by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Singian</span> who found nine "thru and thru" gunshot
wounds, resulting in profuse hemorrhage which caused the death of the former.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>14.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"Bobby
Pirate" is the nickname of Roberto <span class="SpellE">Ner</span>.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From this "chain of circumstances," the court <u>a</u> <u><span style="">quo</span></u> deduced that the assailant of
Jose de Leon could have been only the accused, with the assistance of two other
persons whose identities have not yet been established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No eyewitness to the shooting incident was
presented by either of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although listed in the information as one of the witnesses for the
prosecution, Angelina <span class="SpellE">Viray</span>, the common-law wife of
the deceased and the on­ly probable eyewitness to the murder, did not testify
in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing appears in the record
to explain adequately the Government's failure to find and present her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only evidence intro­duced by the
prosecution to inculpate the appellant consisted of the testimony of Lt. <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> de Leon of the Manila Police Department (an
uncle of the deceased) relative to an alleged dying declaration made by Jose de
Leon, and the declarations of Leo­nardo <span class="SpellE">Bolea</span>,
Rodolfo Rosales and Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> re­ferring to statements allegedly made by Angelina <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> that the appellant was the murderer of the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">I will now analyze their testimonies <u>in</u> <u><span style="">seriatim</span></u><span style="">.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>Lt. <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> de Leon</u> - The strongest link in the incriminating
chain of circumstantial evidence forged by the prosecution is provided by the
testimony of this fifty-nine year old police lieutenant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He declared that he was standing by the
window of his house on <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span>
  Street</st1:address></st1:street> when he heard the sound of gunfire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Quickly, he grabbed his carbine, loaded it,
and ran downstairs and out into the street.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Without breaking his stride, he sprinted toward the apartment of his
nephew, rushed to the third floor where the latter lived, and found him near
the door riddled with bullets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nobody
else was in the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In answer to his
inquiry as to the identity of the assailant, Jose de Leon, in a very weak, low
and faltering voice, answered, "Bobby Pirate." The lieutenant tried
to elicit more information from the deceased to no avail, as the latter could
thereafter no longer speak.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found the requisites for a dying declaration
present and ruled the victim's statement to his uncle admissible as such.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon a careful examination of the evidence on
record, however, I find the lower court's appreciation of the factual situation
faulty and at war with common human experience.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Angelo <span class="SpellE">Singian</span>, Assistant Chief
Medical Examiner of the Manila Police Department and a witness for the
prosecution, testified on cross-examination that the left auricle of the
victim's heart was pierced by a .45 caliber bullet; that considering the nature,
number and gravity of the wounds sustained by the deceased, he could have
survived for only one or two minutes after the last gunshot wound had been
inflicted; that while the deceased could have lived for one or two minutes, he
could not have retained his senses for more than one minute and even then they
would have been very much impaired; that within a minute after he received the
last gunshot wound, it might be possible but less probable for him to be able
to speak; that if he could speak, he could utter only words and monosyllables
but not sentences; and that after a minute, it was most probable that he could
no longer talk.</p>

<p class="BODY">Evidently, the time element is of crucial importance to de Leon's
testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution claims that
the police lieutenant was able to negotiate the distance from the second floor
of his house to the third floor of the apartment where his nephew lived in
thirty or forty seconds and that he was in time to receive the deceased's dying
declaration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mass of facts on
record, however, does not support this assertion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the house of Lt. de Leon to the
apartment of the deceased is a distance of about thirty meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To get to the third floor of the apartment
building where his ne­phew lived, the lieutenant had to come down from the
second floor of his house, run the length of the street, and climb two flights
of stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the distance might have
been easy for a young man to negotiate in thirty or forty seconds, it is
noteworthy to remember that the witness was already fifty-nine years old at the
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, two circumstances
delayed his progress:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>first, he had to
take his carbine and load it before he could go downstairs, and second, when he
came out of his house, he did not yet know where to go or what direction to
take.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">A</span>s he himself admitted, it was only after someone told him that
the shots came from the apartment that he ran toward it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other evidence presented by the prosecution
discloses that by the time Lt. de Leon arrived in front of the apartment house,
several other circumstances had meantime occurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the last shot was fired, the supposed
assailant ran out of the house, seated himself in the jeep, blew his horn three
times, started the vehicle, and sped away toward <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>
Street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the jeep had gone, Angelina
<span class="SpellE">Viray</span> rushed out of the building and ran toward the
house of the victim's parents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
way, he met the lieutenant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As narrated
by the witnesses for the prosecution, the events that transpired from the time
the last shot was fired to the time Lt. de Leon arrived at the apartment
occurred successively and not simultaneously.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We cannot, therefore, entertain the suggestion of the prosecution that
all these happened within the space of thirty or forty seconds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In all probability, these events took more
than a minute and by the time the lieutenant reached his nephew the latter
could no longer speak.</p>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>Rodolfo Rosales</u>
- This witness narrated that between the hours of nine and ten in the evening
of May 17, 1964, he was standing with a friend in front of the store of Mrs. de
Leon (the legal wife of the deceased) along <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span>
Street when the jeep bearing <span class="SpellE">Ner</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lopeña</span>
and Villanueva passed by thrice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
third turn, it parked in front of Jose de Leon's apartment, and the three
occupants alighted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lopeña</span>
sat on a bench nearby while <span class="SpellE">Ner</span> and Villanueva went
inside the apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After three or
five minutes, he heard gunshots.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Forthwith, he and his friend ran to an alley.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From his hiding place, he saw <span class="SpellE">Ner</span> run out of the apartment, throw something into the back
of the jeep, board the vehicle, blow the horn three times, and then speed
away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not long thereafter, Angelina <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> came out of the house, shouting as she ran toward Lt.
de Leon's house, "<span class="SpellE">Tulungan</span> <span class="SpellE">ninyo</span>
<span class="SpellE">ako</span>, <span class="SpellE">Binaril</span> <span class="SpellE">si</span> Boy, <span class="SpellE">Binaril</span> <span class="SpellE">si</span> Boy," and "Pirate." On the way, she met
the lieutenant who was hurrying toward the apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the police lieutenant entered the
building, Rosales followed him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He saw
the body of the deceased bleeding profusely with his head cradled in the arms
of Lt. de Leon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reply to the
lieutenant's query as to the identity of his assailant or assailants, Rosales
testified that he heard the deceased mention the name "Pirate."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Through Rosales' testimony, the prosecution hoped to place the
appellant within the vicinity of the crime and to provide corroborative
evidence for Lt. de Leon's statement as to the deceased's alleged dying
declaration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I find myself, however,
unable to give credence to his testimony on account of its inconsistency with
his previous declarations made before the investigating fiscal during the
preliminary investigation of the case as well as with the declarations of the
other witnesses for the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was the <u>fiesta</u> of the parish of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> Santo</st1:place> on the night of the murder, and
<st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>
was well-lighted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Adding to the
illumination was the light coming from the store of Mrs. de Leon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The street is narrow, around four and a half
meters wide according to one witness, and any vehicle that passes by would be
readi­ly noticed as Rosales did notice, according to his testimony, the jeep
carrying <span class="SpellE">Ner</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lopeña</span> and
Villanueva.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, while Rosa­les
declared in court that in the three times the jeep passed the store of Mrs. de
Leon it was moving toward <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> Street, he stated
at the preliminary investigation that on the first two trips it headed for <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> and only on the third turn did it move toward <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In court,
Rosales emphatically stated that there were only three persons inside the jeep
(<span class="SpellE">Ner</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lopeña</span> and Villanueva),
while before the investigating fiscal, he repeatedly mentioned the presence of
a fourth one, even going to the extent of describing him in detail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the order of alighting from the jeep,
Rosales said the first one to get out was <span class="SpellE">Lopeña</span>,
followed by <span class="SpellE">Ner</span> and then Villanueva.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before the fiscal, however, it was Villanue­va
first, followed by the unidentified man, then <span class="SpellE">Lopeña</span>,
and, lastly, <span class="SpellE">Ner</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Not only <span class="SpellE">Ner</span> and Villanueva entered the
apartment, as he testified in court later, but also the unidentified man.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the beginning to the end of his story, Rosales made a number
of statements inconsistent with his previous declarations, thus putting a heavy
cloud of doubt over the accuracy and veracity of his testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As he continued, Rosales buried himself
deeper in the quagmire of contradiction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Before the investi­gating fiscal, he stated that ten or fifteen minutes
elapsed after the appellant entered the apartment of the deceased before he
heard the shots and that when the former came out of the building, he threw a
nickel-plated .45 caliber firearm inside the jeep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the witness stand, however, he changed his
testimony and said that only three or five minutes passed and that the gun was
a .32 caliber of indeterminate color.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering the inherent weakness of Lt. de Leon's testimony, I am
persuaded that alterations were made in Rosales' previous statements to
corroborate and strengthen the lieutenant's declarations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in confirmation of Lt. de Leon's
testimony, Rosales related in court that the former was carrying only a carbine
when he went to the apartment of the de­ceased and that it was the lieutenant
who held the head of the deceased before the latter died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the preliminary investigation,
however, Rosales emphatically stated that not only was the lieutenant carrying
a carbine but he also had with him a .45 caliber fire­arm, and that it was
Angelina <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> who held the head of Jose de Leon.</p>

<p class="BODY">The most telling point in Rosales' story was the affirmation of
Lt. de Leon's statement with respect to the deceased's alleged dying
declaration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the evidence on
record does not sustain his assertion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>First, Lt. de Leon was unequivocal that there was nobody else in the
room where he found the deceased when the latter made his dying
declaration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Second, Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Bolea</span> testified that Lt. de Leon was alone when he went up
the apartment, contrary to Rosales' statement that he followed the lieutenant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lastly, even assuming that he was present in
the room, it is highly improbable that he would have heard the deceased's declaration
as it was delivered in a very weak, low and faltering voice and, by his own
admission, he was two meters away from the deceased at the time.</p>

<p class="BODY">Taken singly, these inconsistencies do not even appear to be
minor and unimportant; considered together, their cumulative effect is to
completely impeach Rosales' testimony.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His excuse that he was nervous and confused during the preliminary
investigation does not merit belief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
subsequent alterations in his testimony appear to me to have been made
deliberately to shore up the improbabilities in Lt. de Leon's story.</p>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Bolea</span></u> - This witness' testimony substantially
corroborates the prosecution's theory as to the events that transpired before
and after the shooting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It suffers,
however, from two major infirmities which considerably weaken its corroborative
value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, he related that after the
shooting and the subsequent departure of <span class="SpellE">Ner</span>, he met
Lt. de Leon as the latter ran toward the apartment of the deceased; but neither
the lieutenant nor Rosales remembered having seen him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While Rosales saw Angelina <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> meet the lieutenant, he did not see <span class="SpellE">Bolea</span> at all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Second, on the night of the murder he had all the opportunity to
disclose to Lt. de Leon and to the relatives of the deceased the events he had
witnessed, but he never told anyone about what he saw until the preliminary
investigation of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bolea</span> sought to excuse himself by stating in court that he
was afraid, but, surprisingly, while the shooting was going on, he never
attempted to hide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even after <span class="SpellE">Ner</span> allegedly came out of the apartment with gun in hand, <span class="SpellE">Bolea</span> remained in his position near the apartment, seemingly
unafraid of the suspected assailant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span></u> - As a member
of the mobile patrol division of the MPD, this witness investigated Angelina <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> on the night of the murder in the latter's
apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His findings dis­close that
the incident took place sometime between <st1:time minute="50" hour="9">9:50</st1:time>
and <st1:time minute="0" hour="22">10:00 p.m.</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1964" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tiong's</span> testimony
dealt mainly with what Angelina <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> related to him
in the course of his investigation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to Angelina, <span class="SpellE">Ner</span> visited her husband
that night, talking with him for a few minutes in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>
and leaving afterwards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon thereafter,
they heard knocks on the main door of their third-floor apartment and the
deceased went out of their bedroom to see who it could be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, she heard shots, and when she
rushed out, she saw her husband sprawled and bleeding on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In answer to the patrolman's question as to
the deceased's assailant, Angelina <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> was supposed
to have replied that it was Roberto <span class="SpellE">Ner</span>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Tiong's</span> testimony as
to Angelina <span class="SpellE">Viray's</span> statement regarding the
circumstances surrounding the shooting and the identity of her husband's slayer
is hearsay, but the trial court admitted it as an exception under the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>gestae</u></span> rule
(Sec. 36, Rule 130, New Rules of Court).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Reviewing the facts narrated by Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>
and the jurisprudence on this point, I find the lower court in error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 36, Rule 130 of the New Rules of
Court<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
speaks of two classes of statements: spontaneous exclamations and verbal
acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Angelina <span class="SpellE">Viray's</span>
declaration to Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> is neither a verbal
act nor, as the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> mistakenly construed it, a spontaneous
exclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a declaration to fall
under the latter category, three essential requisites must be met, namely, that
the principal fact be a startling occurrence, that the statement or statements
be made before the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span> has had time to contrive
or devise, and that the statement or statements must refer to the occur­rence
in question and its immediately attending circumstances (VI <span class="SpellE"><u>Wigmore</u></span><u>
on Evidence</u> 142-155).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the
hearsay statements are being offered as testimonial evidence under the
exception provided by the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>gestae</u></span> rule, the ordinary principles applicable to
all testimonial evidence must first be complied with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of these is that the witness can testify
only to those facts which he knows of his own knowledge, that is, which are
derived from his own perception (section 30, Rule 130, New Rules of
Court).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To put it in another way, the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span> must appear to have had an opportunity to observe
personally the matter whereof he or she speaks (VI <span class="SpellE"><u>Wigmore</u></span>,
<u>supra</u>, 155).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The consequence of a
contrary rule would be disastrous to the rights of an accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would emasculate his fundamental right to
cross-examine those who would testify against him and lead to the absurd
situation whereby one hearsay statement is founded on another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, even before the presence of the three
afore-mentioned requisites may be looked into by the court, it should satisfy
itself first that the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span>, whose statement or
statements are being related in court by another, had indeed ob­served that
whereof he or she speaks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Absent a
showing of testimonial knowledge, it is futile to consider whether the
statements are spontaneous exclamations or not.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case at bar, Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> testified
that in answer to his question as to the identity of Jose de Leon's assailant,
Angelina replied that it was Roberto <span class="SpellE">Ner</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How she arrived at her conclusion, Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Tiong's</span> testimony does not disclose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did she see the appellant shoot the deceased,
or did the latter make a dying declaration to her identifying the appellant as
the killer?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it were the first then
her statement may be admitted as part of the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>gestae</u></span>; if it were the second then it would be
inadmissible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the latter case, Angelina
herself should testify and not Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>, as
the latter would then be testifying on something which is hearsay based on
another hearsay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true the trial
court in its decision made the finding that when Angelina rushed out of her
bedroom, she saw Jose de Leon sprawled on the floor near the door "while
his assailant was still firing at the former." I have closely combed the
evidence on record, however, and I cannot find support for this conclusion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even in the presence of testimonial knowledge, Angelina's
statements to Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> cannot be admitted
under the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>gestae</u></span>
rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I find them devoid of that
spontaneity required of this class of exclamations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The test is whether the evidence offered is
that of the event speaking through the participant (or ob­server) or that of
the participant (or observer) speaking about the event.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I <u>Wharton's Criminal Evidence</u>
745).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it were the former, what was
thus said can be introduced without calling those who said it; if it were the
latter, such participant or observer must be called to testify.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The circumstances enveloping Angelina's de­claration
to Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> point to the latter
conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her statements were not
forced out of her by the event in question but were elicited by the
interrogation of the policeman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
identifi­cation of the appellant was not an impulsive utterance but a part of a
mere narration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The form it took
presupposes reflection on her part, which is alien to the concept of a spontaneous
exclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a fact that prior to
the arrival of the patrolman there were already other policemen in the
apartment, yet Angelina, as far as the record shows, never revealed to any of
them what she knew of the killer's identity.</p>

<p class="BODY">To secure the conviction of the appellant, the Government chose
to rely on evidence wholly circumstantial in character supplied by Lt. de Leon,
Rosales, <span class="SpellE">Bolea</span> and Pat. <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No direct proof of guilt was adduced against
the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even on the supposition
that Angelina's declaration to Pat. <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> is a
spontaneous exclamation, it would be improper for the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
to accept the same, under the circumstances of the present case, without the
strongest proof of her inability or unavailability to testify personally in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Angelina <span class="SpellE">Viray</span>, the
only person who could have unraveled the tangled mass of conflicting
testimonies given by the prosecution witnesses and perhaps positively identify
the murderer of the deceased, should have been presented in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But she was not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither was she made to testify in the
preliminary investigation conducted by the fiscal although she was present
thereat twice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In truth, her testimony
was waived by the prosecution in the hearing before the fiscal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing appears on record to explain
satisfactorily the Government's failure to locate and present her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution's effete reason that she had
disappeared cannot and should not be accepted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To do so is to encourage reliance by the prosecution on circumstantial,
indirect and less explicit evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
allow the same is to sanction a practice dangerous to the rights of accused
persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What would prevent an unscrupulous
prosecuting officer from conjuring incriminatory evidence out of supposed
spontaneous exclamations?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am not here
formulating as an additional requisite for the admissibility of spontaneous
exclamations that the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span> testify in court for
that would render the rule superfluous, but where, as in this case, the horn
that impales the accused is that of a person not presented in court and not
subjected to the probing scalpel of cross-examination, courts must be doubly
cautious in accepting so-called spon­taneous exclamations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the source of the inculpating statement,
testified to by Rosales, <span class="SpellE">Bolea</span> and Pat. <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>, that it was the ap­pellant who killed the deceased,
Angelina <span class="SpellE">Viray's</span> appearance in court was imperative.</p>

<p class="BODY">This leads me to a consideration of the prosecution's failure to
prove motive and to link the accused with the alleged murder weapons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an accepted principle that proof of
motive in criminal prosecutions is not indispensable nor necessary if the guilt
of the accused is otherwise established by sufficient evidence (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Divinagracia</span>, L-10611, March 13, 1959) as the absence of
motive or the apparent lack of it is not proof of innocence (Peo­ple vs. <span class="SpellE">Ragsac</span>, 61 Phil. 146, 152; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Caggauan</span>,
94 Phil. 118, 129; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Reyno</span>, L-19071, April
30, 1965).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where there is no eyewitness,
however, and there is doubt as to whether the defendant is or is not the person
who committed the offense charg­ed, the question of motive becomes very
important (U. S. vs. <span class="SpellE">M'Mann</span>, Phil. 561, 563; People
vs. <span class="SpellE">Tagasa</span>, 68 Phil. 147, 153).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proof of motive in such cases is a
substantial aid in completing the proof of the commission of the crime by the
accused (<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. Carlos, 15 Phil. 47, 51) and in attaining the necessary judicial
perspective of the case (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Dalmani</span> and <span class="SpellE">Marudi</span>, 63 Phil. 188, 195).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A void in the evidence in this respect lays bare a weakness in the case
for the prosecution (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Hajan</span>, 50 Phil. 545,
547).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present case, no attempt
was made by the prosecution to show motive on the part of the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This lacuna in the evidence against the
accused engenders very grave doubt as to his guilt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The last item in the evidence for the prosecution concerns the
ballistic findings of the Government experts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Of the nine gunshot wounds sustained by the deceased, Dr. Angelo <span class="SpellE">Singian</span> testified that five were probably caused by bullets
discharged from either a .38 or a .45 caliber gun and four by a .32 caliber
firearm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The empty shells and slugs
recovered from the premises of the deceased's apartment by police investigators
were examined by Simeon Molina, Chief of the Forensic Ballistics Section of the
Ma­nila Police Department, and he found that five slugs and five cartridges
were discharged from one .45 caliber pistol while three slugs and three
cartridges were fired from one .32 caliber pistol.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two .32 caliber cartridge cases were also
examined by Molina, but he did not find sufficient markings thereon to form a
definite conclusion as to whether they were discharged from the same firearm as
the other three .32 caliber cartridge cases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span style="">possi</span>bility that not
only two but three firearms were used in shooting down Jose de Leon cannot thus
be discounted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, none of
these weapons were produced in court nor was proof adduced linking the
appellant to any of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No evidence
was presented to show that Roberto <span class="SpellE">Ner</span> ever owned or
possessed or was <span class="SpellE">priorly</span> seen with any firearm of the
calibers referred to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rosales, as we
have noted before, stated during the preliminary investigation of the case that
when <span class="SpellE">Ner</span> came out of the apartment where the deceased
lived, he threw a .45 caliber pistol inside the jeep but, as we pointed out, he
contradicted himself in court later when he said it was a.32 caliber gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This absence of a nexus between any of the
alleged murder weapons and the appellant further considerably weakens the case
for the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">For his defense, the appellant presented the testimonies of
Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>, Eduardo Benito, Rolando <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
Villanueva.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the declarations of
these four witnesses, the accused sought to impeach and destroy the apparently
damaging statements made by Rosales, <span class="SpellE">Bolea</span> and Lt. de
Leon implicating him in the murder of Jose de Leon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the pursuit of this objective, <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> and Benito both averred that during the shooting incident,
they were in a pool hall located on <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Avenue,
near the corner of that thoroughfare and <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span>
Street, and on the said occasion, the two prosecution witnesses, i.e., Rodolfo
Rosales and Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Bolea</span>, were also in the same
place, watching a game of pool.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
discredit the assertion of Lt. de Leon that he was the first to reach the
deceased and that he was able to do so in less than a minute, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Villanueva testified that the lieutenant arrived in
the apartment more than twelve minutes after the last shot was fired and that
it was a certain Corporal Herrera who first responded to the sound of
gunfire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rolando <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>,
a tricycle operator, tried to mitigate the effect of Rosales' and <span class="SpellE">Bolea's</span> identification of the appellant as one of the men
who ran out of the apartment house after the shooting by declaring in court
that he saw the men who came out of the building and that neither of them was
the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The declarations of <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> and Benito
serve to confirm my grave doubts as to the truth of the testimonies of Rosales
and <span class="SpellE">Bolea</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
doubts, as I have lengthily discussed earlier, were occasioned by the
innumerable contradictions made by these two prose­cution witnesses in court
and before the investigating fiscal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
would then appear that Rosales and <span class="SpellE">Bolea</span> were not
present near the scene of the murder at the time it was committed and that
their testimonies were nothing but the figment of their, or somebody else's,
imagination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rest of the evidence
for the defense, however, is as improbable as that for the prosecution, and, were
the burden of proof on its shoulders, it would have failed to exculpate the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But since the onus is on the
prosecution, the weaknesses of the defense do not work to convict the
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conviction in a criminal
prosecution can only rest on the strength of the Government's case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence presented against Roberto <span class="SpellE">Ner</span>
is purely circumstantial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a
painstaking examination of the whole proof, I am unable to let my mind rest
easy upon the certainty of his guilt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Lt. de Leon's revelation of an alleged dying declaration made to him by
the deceased, naming the appellant as his murderer, does not inspire
belief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite his asserted celerity,
the lieutenant could not have made it to the scene of the crime in time to hear
the last words of Jose de Leon, on account of the latter's gravely impaired
physical condition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The declarations of
Rosales and <span class="SpellE">Bolea</span>, on the other hand, concerning the
supposed presence of the appellant within the vicinity of the incident before
and after the shooting, and the alleged exclamations of Angelina <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> identifying the accused as the killer, are saddled
with too many damaging contradictions as to be unworthy of credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither can I accept the narration of
Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> with respect to Angelina's imputation
of the crime to Ner as the same is pure hearsay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering further the failure of the
prosecution to prove motive and to relate any of the alleged murder weapons to
the accused, I am completely unconvinced of the appellant's guilt.</p>

<p class="BODY">I vote for his acquittal.</p>
