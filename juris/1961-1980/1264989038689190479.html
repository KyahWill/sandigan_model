<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Koppel (Phil.), Inc. prays for 
review of the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission awarding 
compensation benefits to Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span>, Sr. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span> started working as salesman for Petitioner on 
</span><st1:date month="3" day="22" year="1954"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 22, 
1954</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
without undergoing pre-employment physical examination. Prior thereto he had 
been confined in the Iloilo TB <span class="SpellE">Pavillion</span>, where he was 
treated for pulmonary tuberculosis from January 13 to </span><st1:date month="4" day="29" year="1953"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 
29, 1953</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
His last fluoroscopic examination in June 1953 revealed "minimal lesions" in the 
right lung and a "prominent <span class="SpellE">hilar</span> shadow" in the left. 
A few weeks after his employment, however, <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span> 
was examined by Dr. Agustin <span class="SpellE">Bencer</span> at the instance of 
petitioner's </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Davao</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> branch manager, Max <span class="SpellE">Stuessi</span>, and allowed to continue working. Respondent's 
duties as salesman took him through <span class="SpellE">Koronadal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">lligan</span></span></span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, northwestern

northern part of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>,

In those travels he took any 
available means of transportation although later on he was allowed to use the 
company’s pick-up truck, which he drove personally. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Sometime in November 1956, having 
driven the truck to <span class="SpellE">lligan</span>, respondent spat blood and 
was confined at the Mindanao Sanitarium in 
</span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">lligan</span></span></span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. Upon <span class="SpellE">Stuessi's</span> orders he went back to 
</span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Davao</span></span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, where he was X-rayed and 
examined by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Gantioque</span>. He was then sent to the 
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Institute in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, where he was confined from 
</span><st1:date month="12" day="26" year="1956"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 26, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> to 
</span><st1:date month="1" day="24" year="1957"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 24, 
1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. A 
week after his discharge, again upon <span class="SpellE">Stuessi's</span> 
instruction, he resumed his duties as salesman. Several weeks later, he was 
assigned as acting officer-in-charge of petitioner's <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> Office, at the same time continuing to perform his 
duties as salesman in the area. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="4" day="21" year="1958"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 
21, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
while respondent was driving the company truck to 
</span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">lligan</span></span></span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, it developed some defect in the 
brakes, and fell into a ravine. He sustained injuries in one of his ears and on 
his left arm and complained of chest and back pains. He was taken to the <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> Provincial 
Hospital, where he stayed three days, after which he was confined for, a week at 
the <span class="SpellE">Brokenshire</span> Hospital. Late in May 1958 he again 
resumed his duties as salesman in </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">lligan</span></span></span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. On November &amp; 1938 Dr. 
<span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> Tech of the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> 
Chest Center X-rayed him and found that his tuberculosis was active in a far 
advanced stage. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On September 30, 1959 respondent 
filed in Office No. 3, Department of Labor, a compensation alleging that his 
pulmonary illness had been aggravated by the nature and conditions of his 
employment. The claim was dismissed by the hearing officer, but reconsidered by 
the Workmen's Compensation Commission, which after hearing, ordered petitioner 
to pay respondent P4,000.00 as compensation, minus the sum of P1,098.00 which it 
had previously paid him. The Commission denied a motion for reconsideration, 
whereupon the company filed the instant petition for review. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The first issue raised by 
petitioner is the question of compensability. Petitioner contends that the 
Commission erred in holding (1) that the claimant's work and the vehicular 
accident which befell him aggravated his pre-existing illness and (2) that the 
mere "worsening" of his ailment was equivalent to "aggravation" within the 
meaning of Section 2 of the Workmen's Compensation Act. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The company maintains that before 
an employee may be awarded compensation benefits due to the aggravation of his 
disease he must prove that he had a pre-existing dormant or inactive disease; 
that an injury which is in itself compensatory lighted up or aggravated the 
same; that the aggravation or acceleration must be substantial or material 
beyond the natural progress of the disease; and that the injury or accident must 
have arisen out of and in the course of the employment. Petitioner points out 
that in a number of states in the American Union the laws on Workmen's 
Compensation cover only occupational diseases, while in other states they cover 
principally industrial injuries accidentally sustained and arc generally 
construed as not including occupational diseases (3 Schneider's Workmen's 
Compensation Law 497). Citing decisions in this latter group, where only 
non-occupational diseases are compensate, petitioner argues that to be 
compensable respondent's illness must be shown to have been aggravated by a 
determinate injury or accident sustained at work. The decisions relied upon, 
however, are Hot in point here in view of our own law on compensation. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Section 2 of Act No. 3428 
provides that when an employee suffers personal injury from any accident arising 
out of and in the course of his employment, or contracts tuberculosis or other 
illness directly caused by such employment, or <i>either aggravated by or the 
result of the nature of such employment</i>, his employer shall pay 
compensation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The conclusion reached by the 
Commission that the aggravation of respondent's illness was attributable to his 
Koppel (Phil.) Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span>, Sr. and WCC 
employment is premised on the following findings of fact: The disease was in its 
minimal stage when petitioner first employed respondent on </span><st1:date month="3" day="22" year="1954"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 22, 
1954</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. His 
work as salesman took him to different places, traveling over rugged, bumpy and 
dusty roads. He would often rise as early as three o'clock in the morning to 
catch buses bound for his destination. He underwent considerable physical strain 
when driving the company's pick-up truck. At times, when his destination could 
not be reached by any means of transportation, he had to go on foot. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">These circumstances affected his 
health; his minimal tuberculosis become moderately advanced and caused him to 
spit blood. In spite of this petitioner allowed him to resume work after a short 
rest and treatment at the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Institute, Because of 
the accident he had while driving the company's pick-up truck he was again 
hospitalized. And although he complained of chest and back pains he was 
permitted by petitioner to resume his work as salesman. There can be no doubt 
that his illness was aggravated by his employment, so much so that when he was 
X-rayed on November 6, 1958, it was discovered that his tuberculosis was already 
in a far-advanced stage. It is significant likewise that on December 8, 1959, 
that fat after respondent retired from his employment, his physical condition 
improved and his tuberculosis regressed to a moderately advanced stage only. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">“Another situation arises when 
the disease antedates the injury or the exposure to unfavorable conditions. If 
the employee has tuberculosis in an inactive or dormant form, and the injury or 
exposure lights up or activates the disease, that constitutes a compensable 
injury. This is on the theory that the injury or exposure set in motion a force 
or disease that possibly would never have manifested Us presence had it not been 
activated by injury or exposure. The same rule applies when there is an active 
tubercular condition and the injury or exposure aggravates the malady and 
possibly accelerates the demise of the victim. This is compensable when the 
increased intensity of the disease is traceable to the injury or exposure. In a 
word, every employee is taken as he is, with his infirmities, whether few or 
many, and those infirmities are not to he aggravated or accelerated 
unnecessarily during his employment. <i>And to the extent they are aggravated or 
accelerated by accidental injuries and in some states to exposures to hazardous 
conditions not necessarily constituting an accident, compensation may be 
awarded</i>." 5 Schneider's Workmen's Compensation Law 
501.<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The next issue is with respect to 
the amount which, prior to the award, petitioner paid to respondent and which 
must therefore be deducted from the amount of compensation due the latter. The 
Commission allowed the deduction of only P1<span class="GramE">,098.00</span>, 
this being the amount which petitioner mentioned in its "Employer's 
Supplementary Report" dated </span><st1:date month="4" day="4" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 4, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
However, on </span><st1:date month="6" day="13" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 13, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, it 
submitted to the Commission another "Employer's Supplementary Report," wherein 
it stated that the amount it had paid respondent was really P1<span class="GramE">,199.00</span>. The first report, as now pointed out, must have been 
a mistake. It refers to payment of P1<span class="GramE">,098.00</span> for 15 
weeks and 5 days or 3 months 19 days,” but the correct amount for such period of 
time, at respondent's salary of P330.00 a month, is P1,199.00. This is the 
amount that should have been deducted from the compensation due to respondent. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We now come to the amount of 
P1<span class="GramE">,237.50</span> which respondent had likewise received from 
petitioner. The Commission refused to subtract this amount from respondent's 
compensation award on the ground that it constituted retirement pay. The ruling 
is based on the fact that in the voucher covering the payment it is referred to 
as retirement pay" and as "retirement credits of Salesman A.E. <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span> from March 22, 1954 to March 31, 1959 at 6.25% of 
P330.00 (monthly salary) per month, or P20.625 x 60 months." But it appears that 
on the same day the amount was paid the parties executed on "Agreement and 
Release,” out of the provisions of which was that "all claims of whatever nature 
and kind which employee has or may have against employer and its officer be 
considered fully satisfied upon payment of the <span class="SpellE">Catapang</span> vs. WCC and <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> 
Milling Co., Inc. sum of one thousand two hundred thirty seven pesos and fifty 
centavos (P1,237.50), provided that, with respect to any Workmen's compensation 
to which employee may be entitled and in the event that the Workmen's 
Compensation Commission awards employee an amount greater than P1,237.50, said 
sum of P1,237.50 shall be considered as an advance against the amount so awarded 
to employee." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The terms of the agreement are 
quite clear. Should the Commission grant compensation to respondent said amount 
would be deemed as an advance on the award. This does not run counter to Section 
7 of our Compensation law, which says that any contract, regulation or device of 
any sort intended to exempt the employer from all or part of the liability 
created by the law shall be null and void the agreement does not in any way 
exempt petitioner from paying compensation should respondent be declared 
entitled thereto. It merely provides that the payment voluntarily made shall be 
deemed as an advance payment on any compensation to be awarded. There is nothing 
illegal in this agreement and it must be given effect. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The decision appealed from is 
modified, by allowing the deduction of the sums of P1, 199.00 And P1<span class="GramE">,237.50</span> from the award of P4,000.00 in favor of respondent, 
leaving balance of P1 ,563.50, which petitioner should pay respondent <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span>. No pronouncement as to costs.
