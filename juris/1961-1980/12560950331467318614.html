				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On December 14, 1959, defendants Rufino G. Pineda and his mother
Juana Gonzales (married to Gregorio Pineda), borrowed from plaintiff
Conrado P. Navarro, the sum of P2,550.00, payable 6 months after said
date or on June 14, 1959. To secure the indebtedness, Rufino executed a
document captioned "DEED OF REAL ESTATE and CHATTEL MORTGAGES", whereby
Juana Gonzales, by way of <em>Real Estate Mortgage</em> hypothecated a
parcel of land, belonging to her, registered with the Register of Deeds
of Tarlac, under Transfer Certificate of Title No. 25776, and Rufino G.
Pineda, <em>by way of Chattel Mortgage</em>, mortgaged his two-story
residential house, having a floor area of 912 square meters, erected on
a lot belonging to Atty. Vicente Castro, located at <em>Bo</em>. San
Roque, Tarlac, Tarlac; and one motor truck, registered in his name,
under Motor Vehicle Registration Certificate No A-171806. Both
mortgages were contained in one instrument, which was registered in
both the Office of the Register of Deeds and the Motor Vehicles Office
of Tarlac.
<p>When the mortgage debt became due and payable, the defendants, after
demands made on them, failed to pay. They, however, asked and were
granted an extension up to June 30, 1960, within which to pay. Came
June 30, defendants again failed to pay and, for the second time, asked
for another extension, which was given, up to July 30, 1960. In the
second extension, defendant Pineda in a document entitled "Promise",
categorically stated that in the remote event he should fail to make
good the obligation on such date (July 30, 1960), the defendant would
no longer ask for further extension and there would be no need for any
formal demand, and plaintiff could proceed to take whatever action he
might desire to enforce his rights, under the said mortgage contract.
In spite of said premise, defendants failed and refused to pay the
obligation.</p>
<p>On August 10, 1960, plaintiff filed a complaint for foreclosure of
the mortgage and for damages, which consisted of liquidated damages in
the sum of P500.00 and 12% per annum interest on the principal,
effective on the date of maturity, until fully paid.</p>
<p>Defendants, answering the complaint, among others, stated—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Defendants admit that the loan is overdue but deny
that portion of paragraph 4 of the First Cause of Action which states
that the defendants unreasonably failed and refuse to pay their
obligation to the plaintiff the truth being the defendants are hard up
these days and pleaded to the plaintiff to grant them more time within
which to pay their obligation and the plaintiff refused; * * *</p>
  <p>"WHEREFORE,
in view of the foregoing it is most respectfully prayed that this
Honorable Court render judgment granting the defendants until January
31, 1961, within which to pay their obligation to the plaintiff."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On September 30, 1960, plaintiff presented a Motion for Summary
Judgment, claiming that the Answer failed to tender any genuine and
material issue. The motion was set for hearing, but the record is net
clear what ruling the lower court made on the said motion. On November
11, 1960, however, the parties submitted a Stipulation of Facts,
wherein the defendants admitted the indebtedness, the authenticity and
due execution of the Real Estate and Chattel Mortgages; that the
indebtedness has been due and unpaid since June 14, 1960; that a
liability of 12% per annum as interest was agreed, upon failure to pay
the principal when due and P500.00 as liquidated damages; that the
instrument had been registered in the Registry of Property and Motor
Vehicles Office, both of the province of Tarlac; that the only issue in
the case is whether or not the deed of Real Estate and Chattel
Mortgages is valid, particularly on the questions of whether or not the
residential house, subject of the mortgage therein, can be considered a
chattel and the propriety of the attorney's fees.</p>
<p>On February 24, 1961, the lower court held-</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"* * WHEREFORE, this Court renders decision in this Case:</p>
  <p>(<em>a</em>) Dismissing the complaint with regards to defendant Gregorio Pineda;</p>
  <p>(<em>b</em>)
Ordering defendants Juana Gonzales and the spouses Rufino Pineda and
Ramona Reyes, to pay jointly and severally and within ninety (90) days
from the receipt of the copy of this decision to the plaintiff Conrado
P. Navarro the principal sum of P2,550.00 with 12% compounded interest
per annum from June 14, 1960, until said principal sum and interests
are fully paid, plus P500.00 as liquidated damages and the costs of
this suit, with the warning that in default of said payment the
properties mentioned in the deed of real estate mortgage and chattel
mortgage (Annex 'A' to the complaint) be sold to realize said mortgage
debt, interests, liquidated damages and costs, in accordance with the
pertinent provisions of Act 3135, as amended by Act 4118, and Art. 14
of the Chattel Mortgage Law, Act 1508; and</p>
  <p>(<em>c</em>)
Ordering the defendants Rufino Pineda and Ramona Reyes, to deliver
immediately to the Provincial Sheriff of Tarlac the personal properties
mentioned in said Annex 'A', immediately after the lapse of the ninety
(90) days above-mentioned, in default of such payment."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above judgment was directly appealed to this Court, the
defendants therein assigning only a single error, allegedly committed
by the lower court, to wit—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"In holding that the deed of real estate and chattel
mortgages appended to the complaint is valid, notwithstanding the fact
that the house of the defendant Rufino G. Pineda was made the subject
of the chattel mortgage, for the reason that it is erected on a land
that belongs to a third person."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Appellants contend that Article 415 of the New Civil Code, in
classifying a house as immovable property, makes no distinctions
whether the owner of the land is or is not the owner of the building;
the fact that the land belongs to another is immaterial, it is enough
that the house adheres to the land; that in case of immovables by
incorporation, such as houses, trees, plants, etc; the Code does not
require that the attachment or incorporation be made by the owner of
the land, the only criterion being the union or incorporation with the
soil. In other words, it is claimed that "a building is an immovable
property, irrespective of whether or not said structure and the land on
which it is adhered to, belong to the same owner" (Lopez <em>vs</em>. Orosa, 103 Phil., 98). (See also the case of Leung Yee <em>vs</em>.
Strong Machinery Co., 37 Phil. 644 ). Appellants argue that since only
movables can be the subject of a chattel mortgage (Sec. 1, Act No.
3952), then the mortgage in question which is the basis of the present
action, cannot give rise to an action for foreclosure because it is a
nullity. (Citing Associated Ins. Co., et al. <em>vs</em>. Isabel Iya, Isabel lya <em>vs</em>. Adriano Valino, et al 103 Phil., 972;).</p>
<p>The trial court did not predicate its decision declaring the deed of
chattel mortgage valid solely on the ground that the house mortgaged
was erected on the land which belonged to a third person, but also and
principally on the doctrine of estoppel, in that "the parties have so <em>expressly agreed</em>" in the mortgage to consider the house as a chattel "for its smallness and mixed materials of <em>sawali</em>
and wood". In construing Arts. 334 and 335 of the Spanish Civil Code
(corresponding to Arts. 415 and 416, N.C.C.), for purposes of the
application of the Chattel Mortgage Law, it was held that under certain
conditions, "a property may have a character different from that
imputed to it in said articles. It is undeniable that the parties to a
contract may <em>by agreement, treat as personal property that which</em> by nature would be real property" (Standard Oil Co. of N.Y. <em>vs</em>.
Jaranillo, 44 Phil., 632-633). "There can not be any question that a
building of mixed materials may be the subject of a chattel mortgage,
in which case, it is considered as between the parties as personal
property. * *. The matter depends on the circumstances and the
intention of the parties". "Personal property may retain its character
as such where it is so agreed by the parties interested even though
annexed to the realty * *". (42 Am. Jur. 209-210, cited in Manarang, et
al. <em>vs</em>. Ofilada, et al., 99 Phil., 108; 52 Off. Gaz., No. 8,
p. 3954). The view that parties to a deed of chattel mortgage may agree
to consider a house as personal property for the purposes of said
contract, "is good only insofar as the contracting parties are
concerned. It is based, partly, upon the principles of estoppel * *"
(Evangelista <em>vs</em>. Alto Surety 103 Phil., 401). In a case, a mortgaged house built on a <em>rented land</em>,
was held to be a personal property not only because the deed of
mortgage considered it as such, but also because it did not form an
integral part of the land (Evangelista <em>vs</em>. Abad, [CA]; 36
Off. Gaz., 2913), for it is now well settled that an object placed on
land by one who has only a temporary right to the same, such as a
lessee or usufructuary, does not become immobilized by attachment
(Valdez <em>vs</em>. Central Altagracia, 222 U.S. 58, cited in Davao Sawmill Co. Inc. <em>vs</em>. Castillo, et al., 61 Phil. 709). Hence, if a house belonging to a person stands on a <em>rented land</em>
belonging to another person, it may be mortgaged as a personal property
if so stipulated in the document of mortgage. (Evangelista <em>vs</em>. Abad, <em>supra</em>).
It should be noted, however, that the principle is predicated on
statements by the owner declaring his house to be a chattel, a conduct
that may conceivably estop him from subsequent claiming otherwise
(Ladera, et al. <em>vs</em>. C.W. Hodges, et al., [CA]; 48 Off. Gaz.,
5374). The doctrine, therefore, gathered from these cases is that
although in some instances, a house of mixed materials has been
considered as a chattel between the parties and that the validity of
the contract between them, has been recognized, it has been a constant
criterion nevertheless that, with respect to third persons, who are not
parties to the contract, and specially in execution proceedings, the
house is considered as an immovable property (Art. 1431, New Civil
Code).</p>
<p>In the case at bar, the house in question was treated as personal or
movable property, by the parties to the contract themselves. In the
deed of chattel mortgage, appellant Rufino G. Pineda conveyed by way of
"Chattel Mortgage" "my personal properties", a residential house and a
truck. The mortgagor himself grouped the house with the truck, which
is, inherently a movable property. The house which was not even
declared for taxation purposes was small and made of light construction
materials: G.I. sheets roofing, <em>sawali</em> and wooden walls and wooden posts; built on land belonging to another.</p>
<p>The cases cited by appellants are not applicable to the present case. The Iya cases, 103 Phil., 972 <em>supra</em>),
refer to a building or a house of strong materials, permanently adhered
to the land, belonging to the owner of the house himself. In the case
of Lopez <em>vs</em>. Orosa, (103 Phil., 98), the subject building was
a theatre, built of materials worth more than P62 000.00 attached
permanently to the soil. In these two cases and in the Leung Yee Case, <em>supra</em>,
third persons assailed the validity of the deed of chattel mortgages;
in the present case, it was one of the parties to the contract of
mortgages who assailed its validity.</p>
<p>Conformably with all the foregoing, the decision appealed from,
should be, as it is hereby affirmed, with costs against appellants.</p>
