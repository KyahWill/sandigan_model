wherein the petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Maliwanag</span>,
prays for a writ to issue, ordering the respondent judge of the Court of F<span style="">i</span>rst Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts which disclose the law questions involved
are not disputed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the local election of <st1:date year="1967" day="14" month="11">November
 14, 1967</st1:date>, peti­tioner <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Maliwanag</span> and respondent Cesar <span class="SpellE">Bolaños</span>
were the opposing candidates for the office of Mayor in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Candelaria</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>. <span class="SpellE">Maliwanag</span> <span class="GramE">was</span> thereafter proclaimed elected by the Municipal Board of
Canvassers with a plurality of 36 votes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In due time, Cesar <span class="SpellE">B<span style="">o</span>laños</span> filed a protest against the election of <span class="SpellE">Maliwanag</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 4, 1967, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Maliwanag</span></span><span style=""> </span>was
served with the corresponding summons, together with a copy of the protest
filed by <span class="SpellE">Bolaños</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The former did not immediately file his answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He filed instead <span style="">a m</span>otion seeking extension of ti<span style="">n</span>e within which to answer; and the
same was granted by the trial court which, in an order dated December 7, 1967,
fixed the time for filing the answer not later than December 22.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before the expiration of the time granted<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the court, he move<span style="">d</span> for further extension of time to
file his answer and, once again, the <span style="">m</span>otion
was gra<span style="">n</span>ted the trial court in
an order dated December 21, 1967, requiring <span class="SpellE">Maliwanag</span>
to <span class="SpellE">subnit</span> his responsive pleading on or before
January 6, 1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Maliwanag</span></span><span style=""> </span>filed his answer within the time,
submitting therewith his counter-protest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, it turned out that protesta<span style="">nt</span> <span class="SpellE">Bolaños</span> had also filed, in the
meantime, an amended pleading dated December 7, 1967, seeking to add new<span style=""> </span>precincts to those embraced in his
original protest.</p>

<p class="BODY">On Januar<span style="">y</span> 16,
1968, the court a <u>quo</u>, <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> ordered both <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Maliwanag</span> and
protestant Cesar <span class="SpellE">Bolaños</span> to appear before it on
January 27, 1968, to show cause, orally or in writing, why latter's supplemental
pleading of December <span style="">7, </span>1967,
and the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> counter-protest filed on January 6,
1968, should not be stricken from the record of the case on the ground of lack
of jurisdiction - both pleadings having been <span style="">filed, according to the order, after the lapse of the corresponding
statutory periods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In obedience to the
said order of the court, the parties filed their <span style="">res­</span>pective memoranda.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On February 27, 1968,
both the protestant's sup­plemental pleading dated December 7, 1967, and the <span class="SpellE">protestee's</span> counter-protest filed on January 6, 1968, <span class="GramE">were</span> ordered stricken from the record by the trial
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Maliwanag</span>
moved for reconsideration of the </span>order, <span style="">re­iterating </span><span style="">his contention in his previous </span><span style="">memorandum that his counter-protest was not </span><span style="">filed out of time </span>because he <span style="">has filed it within the time fi<span style="">xed </span>by the respondent judge for the
filing of the answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion was de­nied
by the trial court in its order of April 5, 1968.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On April 10, 1968, <span class="SpellE">Maliwanag</span> filed a notice of </span><span style="">appeal, manifesting </span><span style="">to the
court below that he was appealing from the orders of February 27 and April 5,
1968, to the Supreme Court where he would raise only questions of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent judge, however, re­fused to
give due course to the appeal in an order of April 24, 1968, which reads as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The orders of February 27, 1968 and April 5, 1968 are
interlocutory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They cannot be appealed
from but can be the subject of certiorari and/or <span style="">mandamus proceedings.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, <span class="SpellE">protestee's</span> appeal from said
Orders is hereby disallowed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In a motion dated May 3,
1968, </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">protestee</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Maliwanag</span> </span><span style="">moved
for reconsideration of the order above quoted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But the same was denied by the respondent judge in an order of May 16, </span><span style="">1968.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A </span><span style="">second motion for recon</span><span style="">sideration </span><span style="">also proved futile; hence, the instant peti­tion for mandamus with
preliminary, injunction wherein herein petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maliwanag</span> prays, among other things, for a writ to
issue ordering the respondent judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> </span><span style="">to
allow his appeal from the questioned orders.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is clear </span><span style="">from the pleadings of </span><span style="">the parties </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">from the circumstances above set forth, they simply want to force the
issue on whether </span><span style="">or not </span><span style="">the striking of herein petitioner's
counter-protest, which is the error supposed to have been </span><span style="">committed by the </span><span style="">trial court, may he corrected by appeal or by
the use of the writ of cer­tiorari or mandamus - </span><span style="">herein petitioner taking the </span><span style="">posi­tion that appeal is </span><span style="">the
plain, speedy and adequate </span><span style="">remed</span><span style="">y </span><span style="">in the ordinary </span><span style="">course of law, and the other contending </span><span style="">that the said </span><span style="">orders, being interlocutory, may </span><span style="">not be </span><span style="">appealed </span><span style="">from but </span><span style="">may only be questioned by </span><span style="">certiorari or mandamus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">As
<span class="GramE">We</span> </span><span style="">view
</span><span style="">the present controversy </span><span style="">however, We see that </span>t<span style="">he settlement alone of the procedural
question thus posed will not settle </span><span style="">once and for </span><span style="">all the
real problem </span><span style="">that stands in the
way of the </span><span style="">parties toward the
early disposition </span><span style="">of the
election contest </span><span style="">between
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We consider it idle, </span><span style="">therefore, to discuss </span><span style="">here whether </span><span style="">one </span><span style="">or the </span><span style="">other remedy suggested </span><span style="">would be more expedi­tious under the circumstances
not because We believe </span>the procedural question is unimportant, but to
keep alive the fundamental principle underlying the trial of election cases
that technicalities and procedural barriers should not be allowed to stand if
the same would tend to defeat rather <span style="">than
</span>promote the interest of justice, (<span class="SpellE">Ibasco</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Ilao</span>, et al., L-17512, December 29, 1960.) Rather, We
believe it to be our duty, here and now, to pass upon the more important
question whether or not it was right and legal <span style="">f</span>or the respondent judge to order the striking out of herein
petitioner counter-protest on the ground that the same was filed out of time.</p>

<p class="BODY">With this in mind <span class="GramE">We</span> are inclined to
view the pre­sent application as one for certiorari, directed not only against
the order of the trial court disallowing herein petitioner's appeal, but
principally against, the order of the respondent judge striking out the
counter-protest and the subsequent order denying reconsideration thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The situation presented here is one that
needs prompt and immediate action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And <span class="GramE">We</span> fully realize that the value of the election contest
herein involved is becoming less with the passing of each day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We note further that the protest filed in
this case has been pending before the respondent judge for a considerable
length of time now; yet it appears that the opening of the ballot boxes in the
precincts co­vered by the said protest, has not even been ordered by the trial
court for purposes of going into the merits of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse still, herein petitioner, by design or
otherwise, insists that the trial court should be enjoined from opening the
said ballot boxes pending resolution of the question whether or not the trial
court was right in striking out his counter-protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And to be sure, to entertain his pleas -
limiting the issue as to whether his appeal blocked by the <span style="">trial </span>court
should be allowed, and ordering the respondent judge to refrain from holding
trial on the merits of the protest until <span style="">such
</span>time that the said appeal of his should be settled - would only prolong <span style="">the </span>determination
of the question as to who, between the par­ties here, had been legally chosen
by the electorate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these
circumstances, the action of this Court in entertaining the present application
as a case of cer­tiorari will be conducive to the speedy disposition of the
case, will save the parties from further expense, and will not unnecessarily
extend and prolong the proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
any rate, the allegations of the present petition may be considered sufficient
for the purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming to the fundamental question involved, it was herein
respondent judge's view that the extension of the period within which to answer
the protest in this case, did not carry with it the right on the part of the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> to file a counter-protest within the same period;
that is why, when the counter-protest of herein petitioner was filed with his
answer within the extended period, said trial judge ruled that the counter­
protest was filed out of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such view
is not well taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Torres <span style="">vs. <span class="SpellE">R<span style="">ibo</span></span></span>, 83 Phil. 645, it
took a long time to dispose of a motion to dismiss filed <span style="">by </span>the <span class="SpellE">pro­<span style="">testee</span></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>And only after the final
disposition of the <span style="">said </span>motion
to dismiss, did the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> answer, filing
therewith a counter-protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The </span>latter pleading was ordered stricken
from the record <span style="">by </span><span style="">the trial court; </span>but on appeal, this
Court sustained the right of the <span class="SpellE">pro­testee</span> to file
the same, <span style="">holding that the motion </span>to
dis­miss had suspended the period for filing the answer, and the
counter-protest, having been filed within the period left after the suspension
was terminated, must be deemed filed within the statutory period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Valenzuela vs. Judge of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, 40 Phil. 163, it was, likewise,
held that a counter-protest is tantamount to a counter-claim in a civil action
and may be presented as <span style="">a </span><span style="">part of the answer
within the time </span>the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> is required to
answer the protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With these
authorities then, <span class="GramE"><span style="">We</span></span><span style=""> </span>really see no reason why the <span style="">respondent </span>judge in this case has
ordered the striking out of herein petitioner's counter-protest, even after
herein petitioner had called her attention to such holdings of the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such act, to our <span style="">mind, constitutes not </span>merely a mistaken view of the law, but a
gross abuse of discret­ion neither governed by rule nor exercised under estab­lished
principles of law, which makes <span style="">it
void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It </span>is not one which <span style="">will </span>withstand review by certiorari
and mandamus, and may be interfered with.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the <span class="GramE">order <span style="">of the trial court striking out herein
petitioner's counter-protest, together with the other orders </span>complained
of <span style="">in </span><span style="">this proceeding are</span></span></span> set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Case remanded to the trial court for further
proceedings.</p>
