				<BR><STRONG>BARREDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for review of the resolution of the Court of Appeals
dated January 29, 1974 in CA-G.R. No. 52726-R, Felisa Vecino vs. Barcelisa
Vecino and of the resolution also in the same case of April 3, 1974 denying
reconsideration of the former.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Land Registration Case No. N-5475, LRC No. 28981, Felisa
Vecino, herein private respondent, applied for the registra­tion of a parcel of
land.  Petitioner, a sister of Felisa
and who claims to be co-owner of the land applied for by inheritance from their
common parents, appeared in the case only after a decision in favor of Felisa
had already been rendered, by filing a petition for review.  After due hearing, this petition was
dismissed.  Peti­tioner appealed.</p>

<p class="BODY">After petitioner's record on appeal had reached the Court of
Appeals, Felisa filed with said court a motion to dismiss the appeal on two (2)
grounds, namely:  (a) that said appeal
was made out of time and (b) that the Record on Appeal does not contain such <span style="">data as will show that said appeal was made
on time.  After receiving the opposition
to said motion filed by petitioner, the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal
thru its resolution afore­mentioned of January 29, 1974 reading thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"This will dispose of motion to dismiss appeal on p. 79 of
rollo, which has been opposed by appellant on p. 95 of rollo.  The antecedents are not very com­plicated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Appellee filed this case for land registration in lower court,
CFI-Rizal; she got decision on 19 June, 1967, p. 10 of Record on Appeal.  On 22 July, 1967, appellant herein filed
petition for review, p. 11 of Record on Appeal; it was opposed by appellee, and
after hearing, denied by order of 6 July, 1972, p. 49 of Record on Appeal; it
is here where complica­tions set in; because</blockquote>

<blockquote>On 16 August, 1972, appellant moved for 10 days "from
today" to file motion for reconsideration, p. 50 of Record on Appeal,
alleging that counsel got xerox copy of denial order only on 11 August, 1972
from son of appellant who had gotten it from lower court on same day, p. 50 of
Record on Appeal; this motion for extension was granted, p. 53 of Record on
Appeal, and appellant thereupon filed motion for reconsideration on 25 August,
1972, p. 53 of Record on Appeal and it was denied on 2 September, 1972 and copy
thereof received by appellant's counsel on 14 September, 1972, p. 71 of Record
on Appeal; there­upon, she filed notice of appeal and appeal bond on 15
September, 1972 p. 72 and Record on Appeal on 3 October, 1972, p. 72 of Record
on Appeal, it is this setting that prompted appellee to move trial Court to
disapprove Record on Appeal, principally on ground that it had been filed too
late, judgment had already become final, p. 73 of Record on Appeal, and first
trial Judge dismissed appeal on 14 October, 1972, p. 91 of Record on Appeal,
but upon motion for reconsideration by appellant, second Judge (Executive
Judge) granted reconsideration and approved appeal, p. 133 of Record on Appeal,
and appellee moved for reconsideration while appellant moved to amend her
Record on Appeal to clarify certain dates, - and once again, Executive Judge
granted appellant's petition and overruled appellee's <span style="">opposition and prayer to dismiss appeal, - so that </span>the question
now presented in present motion to dismiss appeal, - which is a reiteration of
said incident in lower court, is whether or not appeal had been timely
perfected, - this is the principal question to which this Court of Appeals will
direct its attention.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Considering:  That appellant does not apparently debate the point that copy of
order denying petition for review was posted by registered mail to his counsel
on July 13, 1972 but returned unclaimed, with the envelop stamped that 2nd
notice for the said mail matter was delivered to counsel for
petitioner-appellant on July 25, 1972, p. 88 of Record on Appeal - it is easy
to see that applying the Rules, Rule 13, Sec. 5 in relation to Sec. 8, -
counsel must be deemed to have been served copy of said denial order as of 30
July 1972 in the least, since under the Rules, if addressee,</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 0in;">'fails to claim his mail from the post
office within 5 days from the date of first notice by the postmaster, service
shall take effect at the expiration of such time.'</p>

<blockquote>if that be the case, then it is also easy
to see that last day to perfect appeal should have been 29 August, 1972, but
since on 25 August, 1972, appel­lant filed motion for reconsideration; that
motion was filed on time, but neither should it be over­looked that in the
least, appellant had already consumed 26 days of the period to appeal, for even
if he had filed motion to extend time to file motion for reconsideration, that
motion became pointless when after all, he filed within period to appeal.  This Court neither can on the other hand,
count the 30-day to appeal from,</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 0in;">'August 11, 1972 when allegedly petitioner-­oppositor
learn for the first instance of the existence of the said order (denying
petition for relief) and obtained the 'xerox copy' of the same for her
counsel,' p. 143 of Record on Appeal.'<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>because the counting of the period to
appeal is not from the date a party comes to know of the existence of order
sought to be appealed but from the day he is legally deemed notified thereof;</blockquote>

<blockquote>Considering:  Now, that appellant received order denying reconsideration on 14
Sept. '72 and filed notice of appeal and appeal bond on 15 September, 1972 and
Record on Appeal on 3 October, 1972, therefore, from date of notice thereof up
to date of filing of Record on Appeal, she consumed another 19 days, which
added to the original 26 days would bring to a total of 45 days the period she
consumed in perfecting her appeal, - that was too late; the dismissal of her
appeal by the first Judge who had issued denial order to petition for relief
was cor­rect, and reconsideration by Executive Judge was not; and any attempt
by appellant to still ask to be permitted to amend her Record on Appeal by
clarifying certain dates, p. 133 of Record on Appeal, - which was again
permitted by the Execu­tive Judge, p. 141 of Record on Appeal, was also wrong;
the result must be to grant the move to dismiss this appeal, reiterated in this
Court of Appeals.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>IN VIEW WHEREOF, this Court is constrained to dismiss, as it now
dismisses, the appeal." (Pages 35-37, Record.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's motion for reconsideration was denied on April 3,
1974 thru the following resolution:</p>

<blockquote>"After hearing counsel and examining original expediente
brought to hearing by representative of Clerk of Lower Court, this Court is
convinced:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1st - That copy of order of 6 July, 1972 sought to be appeal from,
was sent by registered mail to Attorney for appellant, but was returned
unclaimed, and that the words 'Second Notice' really appear rubber stamped upon
envelope in between the dates '7-25' and '8-8'; following Rule 11, Sec. 5 and
8, he was deemed served at least as of 30 July, 1972, since he filed motion for
reconsideration on 25 August, 1972 and was notified of denial on 14 Septem­ber,
1972 but filed Record on Appeal only on 3 October, 1972, therefore appeal was
too late;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2nd - Even disregarding foregoing, and following appellant's
own computation on page 9 of his motion for reconsideration, page 113, rollo,
that he actually received copy of decision on 11 August, 1972, filed motion for
reconsideration on 25 August, 1972, was notified of denial thereof on 14
September, 1972, and filed Record on Appeal on 3 October, 1972 - this means
that he had also con­sumed 33 days which is also too late.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In view whereof, this Court is constrained to deny, as it now
denies, reconsideration." (Page 74, Record.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The problem resolved by respondent court appears to have arisen
from the following facts:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. The order of the trial court denying petitioner's petition for
review of the land registration decision in favor of Felisa, which was dated
July 6, 1972, was attempted to be served on the former by registered mail.  It has been shown that the envelope
containing said order duly addressed to her counsel of record was returned un­claimed.  It is pretended that the annotations reading
'7-25' and '8-8' appearing on the face of the returned envelope together with
the stamp "Return to Sender-Unclaimed" indicate that two notices were
sent, on the dates thus noted, which are supposed to correspond to July 25 and
August 8 (presumably 1972), to petitioner's counsel but he must have ignored
them.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. On August 11, 1972, a son of petitioner secured a
"xerox" copy of the above order of July 6, 1972 from the court.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. On August 16, 1972, petitioner's counsel filed a motion for an
extension of ten (10) days of the period within which to file a motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="NUM">4. This motion was granted on August 19, 1972 and copy of the
favorable order was served on counsel on August 24, 1972.</p>

<p class="NUM">5. On August 25, 1972, counsel filed petitioner's motion for
reconsideration.</p>

<p class="NUM">6. This motion was denied on September 2, 1972 and copy of the
order of denial was served on counsel on September 14, 1972.</p>

<p class="NUM">7. On September 15, 1972, a notice of appeal as well as the
corresponding appeal bond were filed.</p>

<p class="NUM">8. The record on appeal was filed on October 3, 1972.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering these facts, We are of the view that the Court of
Appeals was rather overly strict in dismissing petitioner's appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Relative to the supposed
service of the disputed order of July 6, 1972 to the counsel of petitioner by
registered mail, it is to be noted that there is actually no presumption of
regularity that can arise from the meager facts relied upon by the Court of
Appeals.  The provision of Section 8 of
Rule 13 regarding completeness of service by registered mail emphasizes that
such complete­ness takes place ordinarily upon actual receipt by the
addressee.  Thus, in applying the
proviso for cases in which the addressee "fails to claim his mail from the
post office within five (5) days from the date of the first notice of the
postmaster", it is but proper that there must be clear proof of compliance
with the postal regulations governing the sending and receipt of the notice
referred to in the rule.  In Hernandez
vs. Navarro, 48 SCRA 44, the Court discussed at length the implications of the kind
of service by registered mail herein involved and We held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Clearly then, proof should always be available to the post
office not only of whether or not the notices of registered mail have been
reported delivered by the letter carrier but also of how or to whom and when
such delivery has been made.  Consequently, it cannot be too much to expect that when the post office
makes a certification regarding delivery of registered mail, such certification
should include the data not only as to whether or not the corresponding notices
were issued or sent but also as to how, when and to whom the delivery thereof
was made.  Accordingly, the
certification in the case at bar that the first and second notices addressed to
Atty. Narvasa had been 'issued' can hardly suffice to satisfy requirements of
equity and justice.  It was incumbent
upon the post office to further certify that said notices were reportedly
received.  When there are several
related acts supposed to be performed by a public officer or employee in regard
to a particular matter, the presumption of regularity in the performance of
official functions would not arise and be considered as comprehending all the
required acts, if the certification issued by the proper office refers only to
some of such acts, particularly in instances wherein proof of whether or not
all of them have <span style="">been performed is
available under the law or office regulations to the officer making the
certification.  In other words, the
omission of some of the acts in the certification may justify the inference
that from the proof available to the officer there is no showing that they have
also been performed.  Of course, where
the certification is worded in general terms that reasonably com­prehend
performance of all the related acts, the presumption of regularity holds as to
all of them.  We hold, therefore, that
there being no showing that the first and second notices were received by Atty.
Narvasa, the service of the order of probate in question upon him must be
deemed to have been made on July 24, 1967, the date he actually received the
same."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, there is no showing at all of how the notice
of the registered mail containing the order in question was sent and
received.  In the Hernandez case, supra,
there was even a certification that the Postmaster had actually issued the
notices addressed to counsel; here, there is not even such a
certification.  The meager annotations
appearing on the envelope aforementioned cannot obviously serve the purpose
just indicated.  For this reason, We are
left with no alternative except to hold that the attempted service by
registered mail relied upon by the Court of Appeals and private respondent did
not in legal contemplation materialize.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the best that can be done here is to find out what
legal significance can be given to the fact adverted to earlier that the son of
petitioner secured from the court a "xerox" copy of the order sought
to be appealed on August 11, 1972.  It
is more or less conceded that said copy was delivered to counsel on the same
date and it was evidently as a matter of precaution that a motion for extension
of time to file the above-mentioned motion for recon­sideration was filed by
counsel on August 16, 1972.  In any
event, that promised motion was actually filed on August 25, 1972.  And because the motion was denied on
September 2, 1972 and the order of denial was served on counsel on September
14, 1972, the question that arises is, up to when was petitioner supposed to
file her record on appeal, the notice of appeal and appeal bond having been
filed already on September 15, 1972.</p>

<p class="BODY">On this score, it is the rule that service upon any person other
than the counsel of record, even actually upon the party <span style="">in </span>interest himself, is not legally
effective and may not serve to start the corresponding reglementary period for
the subsequent procedural steps he is supposed to take.  In the case of Chainani vs. Tansinco, 90
Phil. 862, Chainani himself, instead of his counsel, secured and signed for the
copy of the decision.  This Court held
that the period for appeal was nevertheless to be counted from the date counsel
was served therewith.  To quote from the
decision:</p>

<blockquote>"Accordingly, as the petitioner was represented by Atty.
Barrera, the receipt by the petitioner on September 18, 1950, of a copy of the
decision cannot be considered a valid notice, since it is not pretended that
service on the petitioner himself was ordered by the lower court.  It is immaterial or unimportant <span style="">that the petitioner volunteered to get the
copy, because the purpose of section 2 of Rule 27 is obviously to maintain a
uniform procedure calculated to place in competent hands the orderly
prosecution of a party's case.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The contention of respondent Tomas de Vera that Atty. Barredo was
not authorized to receive a copy of the decision on behalf of petitioner's
attorney of record J. G. Barrera, cannot alter the conclusion that the motion
for new trial filed for the petitioner on November <span style="">17, </span>1950, was within the 30-day regle­mentary period.  Assuming that Atty. Barredo could not
receive service of notice, the motion for new trial was filed even before the
reglementary period had begun to run.  There can be no question about the authority of Atty. Barredo to file
the motion for new trial, especially in view of the motion of Atty. Barrera of
February 6, 1951, making of record the appearance of Atty. Barredo, praying for
favor­able action on the latter's motion for new trial, and seeking the denial
of the motion for execution filed by respondent Tomas de Vera."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It cannot be otherwise in the case at bar.  But here, counsel was never served in any of
the modes provided in the rules.  He got
his copy from petitioner's son, which cannot be deemed as legal service, there
being no official record thereof.  It
results, therefore, that under the peculiar circumstances of this case, the
earliest date that can be considered as the date of service of the order in
dispute to counsel would be August 16, 1972, the date he filed his motion for
extension of time to file a motion for reconsideration, which should be deemed
to be his formal indisputable acknowledgment of the date he came to know of
said order.  In this manner, there would
be uniformity in the rule and the courts would not have to depend on possibly
conflicting evidence as to when actually service has been factually made to
counsel, not taking into account anymore the instances when attempts to prove
the most favorable date, even without real factual basis, may be made.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly again, and considering that from August 16 to August
25, when counsel filed his motion for reconsideration only nine (9) days had
elapsed, it should follow that he still had twenty-one (21) days from service
of the denial order to make his appeal.  This service took place on September 14, 1972 and 21 days from that date
is October 5, 1972.  And since the
record on appeal of petitioner was filed on October 3, 1972, there can be no
question that petitioner's appeal was made on time.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, the resolutions of the Court
of Appeals mentioned at the outset, of January 29, 1974 and April 3, 1974, are
hereby reversed, and the respondent court is hereby ordered to give due course
to petitioner Barcelisa Vecino's appeal in CA-G.R. No. 52726-R.  Costs against respondent Felisa Vecino.</p>
