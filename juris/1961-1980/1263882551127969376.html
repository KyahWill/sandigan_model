				<BR><STRONG>ANTONIO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Administrative complaint, filed by Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Formoso</span>,
Jr., dated December 7, 1972, charging respondent Municipal Judge Francisco Ante
with:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) knowingly consenting to the
use, and acceptance of falsified documents as bail bonds, and/or knowingly and
actively participating in the falsification of said documents; (2) evident and
notorious partiality and leniency in his treatment of the accused in Criminal
Cases Nos. 3692 and 3695, and in other cases against the same accused; and (3)
usurping the powers of the Executive Judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Required to comment on the charges by the
Secretary of <span style="">Justice, </span>respondent
Judge submitted his answer on <st1:date year="1972" day="26" month="12">December
 26, 1972</st1:date>, alleging that:</p>

<p class="BODY">On the first charge, bail bonds of the accused, <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabillaran</span>, in Criminal
Cases Nos<span style="">. </span>3692 and 3695 of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>
had been prepared by the Office of the Clerk of Court of the Court of First
Instance, as the Clerk of Court himself, his deputy, or any of their
subordinate employees "accomplished those bail bonds in question, by
verifying all the supporting papers, such as the tax declaration, tax receipts,
and the residence certificates of the bondsmen"; that he carefully
examined the said bail bonds when it was presented to him, as well as the
supporting papers thereof, like the tax declarations, tax receipts, <span style="">and residence certificates of the bondsmen,
and found everything in order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
admitted, however, that the tax declarations and tax receipts submitted and
attached to the bail bonds in question "were not duly certified copies of
the same, but simple copies".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He,
however, contends that the actual verification of the genuineness of a
supporting paper to the bail bond is "a clerical job, and not that of the
judge who qualifies or approves the same" and any error or defect of the
bail bond must be attributed to the clerk who processed them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the second charge, respondent claims that in Criminal Cases
Nos. 3910 and 3922, entitled "People vs. <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span>
Peralta, et al.", the accused <span style="">moved
for the reduction of the amount of the bail P10,000.00 for each accused and
Asst. Fiscal Jose <span class="SpellE">Tabanda</span> gave his conformity
thereto; that in Criminal Cases Nos. 3743 and 3810 (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Emeterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Asistin</span> and Mario <span class="SpellE">Agtutubo</span>) both accused petitioned for the reduction of
their bail bond to P20,000.00, to which Asst. Fiscal Jose <span class="SpellE">Tabanda</span>
likewise gave his conformity; that in Criminal Cases Nos. 3910 and 3922, the
evidence presented was very weak as "Pfc. de la Cruz, one of the supposed
victims, refused to testify therein, alleging he could not pinpoint any of the
supposed authors of the crime", while in Criminal Cases Nos. 3810 and
3743, "the evidence was strong, especially the latter"; that he had
to "respect the recommendation of the Fiscal * * * in the light of the
evidence on record."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the third charge, respondent denied that he usurped the powers
of the Executive Judge; that he acted in Criminal Case No. 44-V only after the
Clerk of Court of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sur</span> had affixed his signature on the bail bond and
assured him that the Executive Judge was then ab­sent; that the bail bond of
the accused in the afore-cited Criminal Case No. 44-V was submitted to him for
approval as the "Municipal Judge of the Capital, for and in the absence of
the Executive Judge" late in the afternoon of June 10, 1970 by the Clerk
of Court himself; that although Executive Judge <span class="SpellE">Arciaga</span>
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> was present and held sessions in his branch up to 12:00
o'clock noon on June 10, 1970, said judge was already out of his territorial
juris­diction in the afternoon of the above-mentioned date when the bail bond
in question was submitted to respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under 3rd <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span> dated <st1:date year="1973" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1973</st1:date> by then
Undersecretary of Justice <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> I. <span class="SpellE">Plana</span>, this case was forwarded to this Court pursuant to <span style="">Section 7, Article X of the
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By Res</span>olution of
this Court on <st1:date year="1974" day="28" month="8">August 28, 1974</st1:date>,
the records of this administrative case were transmitted to the Executive Judge
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ilocos</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> for investigation, report and recommendation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="20" month="1">January 20, 1977</st1:date>,
the Investigating Judge, Hon. <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Adduru</span>--<span class="SpellE">Santillan</span>, submitted her
report recommending <i style=""><span style="">dismissal</span></i><span style=""> </span>of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to said report, the investigation
was set on <span style="">various dates during the
period from </span><st1:date year="1974" day="27" month="9"><span style="">September 27, 1974</span></st1:date><span style=""> until </span><st1:date year="1976" day="29" month="9"><span style="">September 29, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">, but the hearing was not held because of the
motions for postponement submitted by either the complainant or the
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, on </span><st1:date year="1975" day="30" month="1"><span style="">January
 30, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="">,
complainant manifested to the Court that he was submitting the case without the
presentation of any testimonial evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This notwithstanding, the Investigating Judge re-set the hearing for </span><st1:date year="1975" day="7" month="2"><span style="">February
 7, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="">, but the
hearing on said date was postponed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, on </span><st1:date year="1975" day="5" month="3"><span style="">March 5, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="">, respondent filed a motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Investigating Judge again re-set the case
for hearing on </span><st1:date year="1976" day="21" month="6"><span style="">June 21, 1976</span></st1:date><span style=""> and </span><st1:date year="1976" day="9" month="7"><span style="">July 9, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
hearing was held on said dates, but on </span><st1:date year="1976" day="29" month="9"><span style="">September 29, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">, both the complainant and the respondent
appeared and submitted the case on the basis of the documentary evidence
attached to the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Finding that
the charges were not proven "beyond reasonable doubt", the
Investigating Judge recommends the dismissal of the charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find that the charges of falsification,
partiality and usurpation are not substantiated by the documents submitted.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In her report, however, the Investigating Judge made the
following significant observations:</p>

<blockquote>"Firstly, respondent Judge's defense that the preparation of <span class="SpellE">bailbonds</span> and verification of supporting papers thereof are
clerical in nature and not his job as judge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>True it is not properly a judicial duty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, while a judge need not personally perform this work, it is the
better part of prudence to inquire into the correctness and veracity of the
bonds he is approving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This latter is
his duty and responsibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He may not
blindly sign any paper placed before him by anybody without satisfying himself
that everything is in order.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, clerks are supervised <span style="">by
judges in their work and this duty may not be shirked without opening the door
to anomalies which may impinge on a judge's integrity and honor.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Respondent judge also alleged that he has many cases to attend
to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not a valid excuse for
sloppy work nor haphazard performance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even the fact that the approval of the particular <span style="">bail </span>bonds under discussion was not
regular work truly belonging to his '<span class="SpellE">sala</span>' should
have alerted him and made him more circumspect in his actuations for the papers
brought to him for approval and signature were not prepared by his own staff on
whom he could have relied.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Respondent judge's presumption that because the use of simple
and not duly certified copies of tax declarations and tax receipts in support
of bail bonds is acceptable procedure in his own (municipal) court and
therefore should be likewise acceptable in courts of first instance, is arrogance
beyond our understanding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Law and regulations
have required that only certified true copies or the owner's own copy of these
documents are the only ones acceptable in these matters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, respondent judge adopts a wrong practice
and expects that his adoption of it makes the practice right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing could be farther from the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A wrong act does not become right because a
judge does it."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">[To prevent the commission of frauds in connection with the
posting of personal bail bonds and protect the interest of the government,
judges are required by Circular No. 44, dated <st1:date year="1958" day="30" month="7">July 30, 1958</st1:date>, of the Department of Justice, to exercise
utmost care in the scrutiny of the qualifications of sureties and in the
approval of bail bonds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To eliminate or
minimize anomalies on the matter, in doubtful cases, it is suggested therein
that judges should examine the sureties under oath concerning their sufficiency
as provided for in Section 10, Rule 110, of the Old Rules of Court (now Section
10, Rule 114, Revised Rules of Court), and that bail bonds consisting of real
properties which are not covered by certificates of title should not be
accepted unless they have been declared for taxation purposes in favor of the
person offering the property as bond for a period of at least five (5) years.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
These suggestions were reiterated in Circular No. 2, dated <st1:date year="1964" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1964</st1:date>, of the Department of Justice,
which circular was addressed to Judges of the Court of First Instance, City
Fiscals, City and Municipal Judges.] [It should be noted also that Section 9 of
Rule 114 of the Revised Rules of Court provides for the qualifications of
sureties.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Section 10 of Rule 114 provides that the "sureties must in all cases
justify by affidavit taken before the judge, that they each possess the
qualifications named in the preceding section, and each may be required to
describe in the affidavit the property by which he proposes to justify and the
encumbrances thereon, the number and the amount of other bonds and undertaking
for bail entered into by him and remaining <span class="SpellE">undischarged</span>,
and all his other liabilities."] [It also states that the "court may
further examine the sureties upon oath concerning their sufficiency in such
manner as it may deem proper." Contrary, therefore, to the pretensions of
the respondent, the responsibility for ascertaining the sufficiency of <span style="">the sureties is lodged exclusively upon the
judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This responsibility he cannot
abdicate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present case,
respondent judge failed to discharge faithfully such duty and responsibility
when he accepted </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">approved the bail bonds in question, solely
on the basis of plain and simple copies of tax declarations and tax receipts as
supporting papers, which were not certified by any competent authority and
without examining under oath the sureties pursuant to Section 10 of the
Rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had respondent Judge been more
circumspect in ascertaining the qualifications of the bondsmen, he would have
been able to ascertain that the assessed value of the real properties submitted
as bond in Criminal Cases Nos. 3692 and 3695 were unduly inflated when compared
with the genuine tax declarations.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>
