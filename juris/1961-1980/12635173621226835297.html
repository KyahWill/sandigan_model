<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner moved to quash
in each of the cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ground <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> was that the court did not validly acquire
jurisdiction over his person since the warrants of arrest were issued by the
court without the judge personally examining the complainant and his witnesses
under oath or affirmation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
charges infringement of his consti­tutional right to due process, particularly
citing Section 1(3), Article III of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an almost simultaneous move, he asked the
different judges to consolidate the different cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both the motion to quash and the motion to
consolidate were rejected by re­spondent judges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were the familiar motions to reconsider
and the equally usual turndowns.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present petition for certiorari to nullify <span style="">the orders </span>of denial of the motion to
quash; prohibition to stop the <span style="">lower
court </span>judges from proceeding with the cases; and mandamus to compel
consolidation, and to direct respondent judges to recall the warrants of arrest
and thereafter to personally conduct the examination of complainants and their
witnesses to determine the existence of pro­bable cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We issued a cease-and-desist order on October
3, 1968 upon a P5,000-bond.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. One reason exists why petitioner's cause must fall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prior to petitioner's questioning the court's
jurisdiction over his person, he had already filed a bond for his provisional
liberty <span style="">in all </span>of the criminal
cases in question and had already pleaded to all the <span class="SpellE">infor­mations</span>
therein.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find a statement by
respondents in their return before this Court, to which petitioner does not
except, and which statement runs as follows: "The petitioner in the
above-entitled case cannot and does not deny that he has appeared before your
respondent Judges (both <span style="">in </span>person
and thru counsel),</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> <u>that</u> <u>he</u> <u>has</u> <u>filed</u>

<u>has</u> <u>pleaded</u> <u>to</u> <u>all</u> <u>the</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>informations</u></span>
<u>therein</u>, that he has asked for postponements, and that he has otherwise
submitted himself to other court proceedings and processes."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> That petitioner had pleaded to the <span class="SpellE">informations</span> before he moved to quash is implicit in his
motion to quash of June 27, 1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
there stressed that his motion to quash was filed under Section 10, Rule 117 of
the Rules of Court, which explicitly allows <span style="">questions of </span>want of jurisdiction to be raised at any stage of the
proceedings.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing facts attain meaning in the context of established
precepts in jurisprudence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Recognized by
case law is the principle that the posting of a bail bond constitutes waiver of
any irregularity <span style="">attending the arrest
of a person,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">estops</span> him from
discussing the validity of his arrest.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Recently, this Court found occasion to pro­nounce
that when petitioner filed an application for bail and waived the preliminary
investigation proper, "he had waived his objection to whatever defect, if
any, in the preliminary examination conducted x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> prior to the issuance of the warrant of arrest."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> And then, a rule that has by now acquired
deep roots is that an entry of a plea waives the right to preliminary
investigation and any irregularity that surrounds it.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Anyway, the absence of a preliminary investi­gation
does not impair the validity of a criminal information, does not otherwise render
it defective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor does it affect the
jurisdiction of the court over the case.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Besides, criminal procedure tells us that if
a person does not move to quash a complaint or information until after he has
pleaded thereto, he is deemed to have waived all objections then available
which are grounds of a motion to quash except when the complaint or information
does not charge an offense or the court is without jurisdiction of the same.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> So it is that one of the grounds that must
be deemed waived if defendant does not move to quash the complaint or
information before pleading thereto is "<span style="">th</span>at the court trying the cause has no jurisdiction of the person
of the defendant,"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Here, the fact that petitioner posted bail bonds for his
provisional liberty and the other fact that he already entered his not guilty
plea to all the 22 <span class="SpellE">informations</span>, bar him from there­after
questioning the validity of his arrest and bringing up the absence of a proper
preliminary investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His failure
to move to quash before plea is tantamount to the submission of his person to
the jurisdiction of the court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner's waiver is patent.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. One other question: Did the judges below abuse their discretion
in denying petitioner's motion to consolidate all the 22 criminal cases in one
branch of the trial court?</p>

<p class="BODY">In arguing for consolidation, petitioner submits that all the 22 <span class="SpellE">informations</span> filed against him show only one offended
party, one accused, one set of witnesses listed by the prosecution, the
identical offense of “<span class="SpellE">estafa</span> thru falsification of
public documents”, the identical language of the <span class="SpellE">informations</span>,
and the commission of the offenses over the same period of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner submits that much will be gained
and nothing will be lost by consolidating these 22 cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He reasons out thus: (1) considering that the
alleged offended party has its offices and lawyers in Manila, that defendants'
counsel is also from Manila, and the witnesses are mostly from Iloilo City, the
requirement that the parties and the witnesses be made to repeat the same
evidence, objections and arguments in the four branches of the court is not
only wasteful of time, energy and money, but is patently vexatious and
harassing which could be avoided if both prosecution and defense would pre­sent
their respective witnesses, offer their documentary evidence, make their
objections, and submit their arguments only once and to one judge at a great
saving of time, energy, trouble and expense; (2) the 22 cases will engage the
time of only one judge and the three other judges will be free to attend to
other cases; (3) the assign­ment of all these 22 cases to one judge will not
materially increase the judge's case load, for he would be passing on the
credibility of the same witnesses, and the validity of the same objections and
arguments.</p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, respondent fiscal denies that the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">informations</span></span><span style=""> </span>list the same set of witnesses; that
the witnesses will be the <span style="">same </span>for
all cases because after listing the witnesses, the <span class="SpellE">informations</span>
specifically state "and others"; and that the testimony of the wit­nesses
will be the same in each and every one of the aforesaid 22 cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He says that the 22 cases are distinct from
one another, involve different subject matters, different manners of <span style="">commission, </span>different dates of
commission, different sets of documents, and different testimony of different
witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He submits that con­solidation
will only cause confusion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 15, Rule 119 of the Rules of Court, provides that
"[c]<span class="SpellE">harges</span> for offenses founded on the same
facts, or which form or are a part of a series of offenses of the same or
similar charac­ter may, in the discretion of the court, be tried jointly."</p>

<p class="BODY">The question that projects itself, therefore, is whether the
discretion granted respondent judges has been here abused.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not to lose sight of the object of consolidation - avoid
multiplicity of suits, guard against oppression or abuse, prevent delay, clear
congested dockets, simplify the work of the <span style="">trial court, </span>save unnecessary costs and expense, In brief,
consolidation seek to attain justice with the least expense and vexation to the
litigants.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Elsewhere, the present tendency is to permit consolidation when­ever possible
and irrespective of the diversity of the <span style="">issues in­</span>volved.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that separate accusations charging a
defendant with disconnected but joinable crimes may be tried to­gether on
condition that no substantive rights of defendant are adversely affected.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
More elaborately, joint trial is proper "where the offenses charged are
similar, related, or connected, or are of the same or similar character or
class, or involve or arose out of the same or related or connected acts,
occurrences, tran­sactions, series of events, or chain of circumstances, or are
based on acts or transactions constituting parts of a common scheme or plan, or
are of the same pattern and committed in the same man­ner, or where there is a
common element of substantial importance in their commission, or where the
same, or much the same, evi­dence will be competent and admissible or required <span style="">in their prose­</span>cution, and if not
joined for trial the repetition or reproduction of substantially the same
testimony will be required on each <span style="">trial."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appropriately to be emphasized here is the appellate court's
supervisory authority over the lower court, notwithstanding the wide discretion
given the latter, whenever the appellate court <span style="">is satisfied </span>that the trial court has abused its discretion in
denying <span style="">motions to </span>consolidate.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
In <u>De</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Luccy</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><u>vs</u>. <u><span style="">Ferrara</span></u><span style="">, </span>209
N.Y.S. <span style="">2d. 676, 678, </span>the lower
court's denial of the motion to consolidate was <span style="">stricken down </span>because it appeared that no party would be
prejudiced and multi­plicity of trials would be avoided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, in a cluster of Amer­ican cases, the
lower court's refusal to consolidate was over­ruled by the appellate
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this, because no substantial
rights were shown to be prejudiced, the same witnesses were to be presented,
and the cases involved common issues save in some cases for the question of
damages.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Sideco</u></span> <u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Paredes</u></span>, 74 Phil. 6, 7, an action for <span style="">cer­tiorari </span>and
mandamus, we found no valid reason for the lower court's refusal of a
consolidated appeal of sixteen cases involving a common question of law,
Instead, we held that consolidation was an imperative necessity to minimize
appellant's expense in prosecuting his appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instructive in this respect is Section 2, Rule 1 of the Rules of Court,
which gives the guideline that the "rules shall be liberally construed in
order to promote their object and to assist the parties in obtaining just,
speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding."</p>

<p class="BODY">Let us go back to the cases before us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be denied that in all these cases
there is only one offended party, one accused, an identical offense committed
in substantially the same <span style="">way </span>over the same period of time, such that the criminal <span class="SpellE">informations</span> were couched in almost identical
language.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The witnesses listed are the
same except that in some <span class="SpellE">informations</span>, Atty. Romeo H.
<span class="SpellE">Mediodia</span> appear as a witness and in others, Atty.
Fernando <span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And this, because these two were the two notaries public that
interchangeably notarized the documents.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is much to petitioner's claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reasons he ad­vances deserve assent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be achieved by consolidation are sim­plification,
not confusion, of procedure; economy, not waste, of time, energy and expense.
And with one judge to hear the case, shuttling from one judge to three others
at the same time or at different times will be obviated.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defendant will be insulated from unjust vexation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, indeed, correct to say that, all
things con­sidered, the administration of justice would be better <span style="">served if only </span><u>one</u> <u>trial</u>
before <u>one</u> <u>judge</u> is conducted in these 22 cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We parti­cularly note the absence of justifiable
ground back of respondent judges respective rulings against consolidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All they say is that the cases are well
distributed to the four branches of the court and that the denial was the
consensus of all the judges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
circumstances here presented, no potent reason suggests itself why these cases
should not be lumped together in one branch of the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">A policy statement of note is that "[t]he public interests
of economy and speed weigh in favor of trying x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> closely related charges together, especially where x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> no prejudice to defendant
appears."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>In the case at bar, we fail to
discern any prejudice to defendant in consolidating trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, <u>it</u> <u>is</u> <u><span style="">precisely</span></u><span style=""> <u>defendant</u> <u>himself</u> </span><u>who</u> <u><span style="">requests</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>such</u> <u><span style="">consolidation</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Consolidation
is proper.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conclusion here reached does not cross paths with our
decision in <u><span style="">Philippine</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>Air</u> <u>Lines</u>, <u>Inc</u>. <u>vs</u>.
<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Teodoro</span></u></span><span style="">, </span>97 Phil. 461, 468, an original
action before this Court for certiorari and man­damus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, a motion was filed below to
have one case before one branch of a court transferred to another branch for
joint hearing with a second case involving similar issues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After denial of the motion for consolidation,
the first case was partially heard by the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We held that no ministerial duty existed to
compel the transfer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The factual
background of the <u><span style="">Philippine</span></u><span style=""> <u>Air</u> </span><u>Lines</u> case is different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the cases was there <u><span style="">already</span></u><span style=""> <u>par</u></span><u>tially</u><span style="">

any of the 22 cases concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consolidation of trial is the clear course of action to
take.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the judges below refused to so
act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We, therefore, do not hesitate to
say that respondent judges gravely abused their dis­cretion in denying

however, the defendant learns after he has pleaded or has moved to quash on
some other ground that the offense for which he is now charged is an offense
for which he has been pardoned, or of which he has been convicted or acquitted
