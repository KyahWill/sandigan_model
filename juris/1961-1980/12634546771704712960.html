National Economic Council of the Philippine Government with respect to the

Government to implement the pro­ject for which said dollars were released, the
U.S. Go­vernment demanded upon the Republic of the Philippines to refund the

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The parties further agreed to submit to
the court's re­solution the question on the rate of exchange to be used in
converting dollars to pesos in regard to the refund claimed by plaintiff under
the three aforesaid contracts in the total sum of $358,885.02.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1965</st1:date>
the lower court rendered the following judgment based upon our holding in <span class="SpellE">Arrieta</span> v. NARIC, L-15645, <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1964</st1:date>, fixing the rate of conversion from
dollars to pesos as at the time the principal obli­gation was contracted:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, and following the said deci­sion cited by both
parties, judgment is hereby rendered fixing the rate of exchange of pesos to
dollars at P2.00 to $1.00, the same being the judicial determination called for
by the aforesaid paragraph 8 of said parties' COMPRO­MISE AGREEMENT."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Its motion for reconsideration having been denied, the Republic
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
appealed to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question raised is what rate of exchange shall be applied in
converting to pesos the obligation in ques­tion which is expressed in dollars.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Appellees</span> contend that the conversion
rate should be that prevailing in 1959 when <span class="SpellE">Laureano</span>
Bros., Inc. en­tered into contracts with the Republic of the Philippines to
supply the latter with plumbing materials in conso­nance with the ruling in <span class="SpellE">Arrieta</span> v. NARIC, supra, or two pesos to one dollar.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, appellant maintains that the rate of exchange
applicable is that prevailing when the par­ties entered into a compromise
agreement on <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1965</st1:date>,
that is, at P3.91 to $1.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">This suit was filed to recover damages and the plain­tiff is
entitled to recover a sum of money which will constitute an indemnity for
damage occasioned by defen­dant's breach of contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The breach of contract and the damage
expressed in dollars are admitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And <span class="GramE">We</span> are called upon to determine the damage's equivalent in
Phi­lippine currency.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of Engel v. Mariano Velasco &amp; Co., 47 Phil. <span class="GramE">115,</span> decided in 1924, where a similar question of the
applicability of exchange rates was presented, the Supreme Court applied the
exchange rate prevailing at the time judgment for damages was rendered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inten­tion was "to give judgment for
such an amount as will, at the time of judgment, purchase the amount due on the
note in the funds or currency in which it is payable." The Su­preme Court
rejected the proposition to apply the exchange rate prevailing at the time of
breach of contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">Forty years later, the Supreme Court held in the cited case, <span class="SpellE">Arrieta</span> v. NARIC, supra, that the exchange rate applicable
is that prevailing when the obligation was incurred - that is, in said case,
the original prin­cipal obligation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the facts and circumstances obtaining in the instant
case, there is merit in both parties' insis­tence to apply to this case the
rationale of the ruling in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Arrieta</u></span>
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, the facts of the two ca­ses
are nearly similar, aside from the fact that the <span class="SpellE"><u>Ar­rieta</u></span>
case is more recent than the <u>Engel</u> case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the <span class="SpellE">Arrieta</span> case, the
rate of ex­change applicable should be that prevailing when the par­ties
entered into the compromise agreement in 1965 or P3.91 to one dollar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">For it is from that moment
when <span class="SpellE">Laureano</span> Bros., Inc. has bound itself to pay to
the Repu­blic of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE"> the sum of $358,885.02 as damages under the three aforementioned
contracts.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is being
collected in this suit is said sum of $358,885.02, sub­ject of the compromise,
which supplanted or took the place of the sum of $<span class="GramE">357,758.86</span>
originally prayed for in the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Stated differently, inasmuch as the obligation to pay the amount of
$358,885.02 came to exist on March 12, 1965, the conversion rate from dollar to
pesos should be that current as of the same date or P3.91 to $1.00.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is reversed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rate of exchange applicable for the
conversion of the damages payable by <span class="SpellE">Laureano</span> Bros.,
Inc. to the Republic of the Philippines expressed in dollars is hereby fixed at
P3.91 to $1.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
