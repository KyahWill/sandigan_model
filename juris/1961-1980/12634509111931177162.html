<p class="BODY">Pursuant to Act 3688, "An Act for the protection of persons
furnishing materials and labor for the construction of public works", <span class="SpellE">Prmcci</span> jointly and severally executed with Central Surety

</span>From time to time, petitioner delivered to <span class="SpellE">Prmcci</span>
the needed construction <span style="">materials.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On January 31, 1952, petitioner lodged with the <span style="">Court of First </span>Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, a complaint against <span class="SpellE">Prmcci</span>
<span style="">[Civil </span>Case No. 1636, entitled
"Domingo Bautista, plaintiff <span style="">vs. </span><span style="">Philip­pine </span>Ready-Mixed Concrete Co.,

unpaid balance of the price of sand and gravel "furnished <span style="">and delivered </span>to the latter from
September, 1951 to January, <span style="">26, </span>1952,
which it used in its contracts with the Government and <span style="">for its </span><span style="">batching plant”.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Central was
included in that complaint as defendant by reason of the P20,000.00-bond
heretofore adverted <span style="">to.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On February 14, 1952, plaintiff [petitioner herein, Do­mingo
Bautista] defendant contractor <span class="SpellE">Prmcci</span> [principal
respondent herein] entered into a judicial compromise agreement <span style="">in said </span>Civil Case 1636, as follows:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">"1. That the defendant Philippine Ready-Mixed Concrete
Company, Inc. acknowledges by virtue of these presents that it owes the
plaintiff the sum of P104,000.00 for all materials already supplied and
delivered to and used by the said corporation<span style="font-size: 12pt;">;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2. That for the payment on account of the said amount of
P104,000.00, the defendant corporation hereby irrevocably authorizes the
plaintiff to obtain in his own name from and by these presents empowers the
Bureau of Public Works to issue in the name of the plaintiff a check amounting
to P14,000.00 more or less on or before February 15, 1952 from any amount which
will be collected by the said corporation in connection with its contract
PR-521 [Plaza Lawton] and another check for P67,000.00 in his name to be
obtained from the said Bureau of Public Works on or before February 21, 1952 in
connection with contract PR-13(1), contract No. 1, comprising Plaza <span class="SpellE">Moriones</span> and Juan Luna, thus making a total of
approximately P81,000.00;</p>

<p class="NUM">3. That the balance of P23,000.00 has already been assigned by the
defendant cor­poration to the plaintiff by virtue of the agreement had between
the parties in civil case No. 1482 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>;</p>

<p class="NUM">4. That the price of all the supplies and materials which will be
delivered and supplied by the plaintiff to the defendant corporation subsequent
to this agreement shall be deducted from all weekly collections which will be
paid by the Bureau of Public Works to the said cor­poration in connection with
any contract or contracts which it has or might have with the Philippine
Ready-Mixed Concrete Company, Inc., it being expressly understood in this
connection that any assignment heretofore made and which may be made
hereinafter by the de­fendant corporation in favor of any person or persons,
firm or corporation should not be honored, respected and paid by the Bureau of
Public Works, Provided, furthermore, that for the failure of the plaintiff to
obtain the said weekly payments, he is hereby authorized and empowered to stop
the supply and delivery of materials which may be needed by the said de­fendant
corporation.”</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 15, 1952, pursuant to the prayer in the fore<span style="">going compromise </span>agreement,
the Court of First Instance <span style="">rendered judgment "in accordance with the said agreement" wit</span><span style="">ho</span>u<span style="">t</span><span style="">
pronouncement </span>as to costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Came April 2, 1952.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
this date, petitioner Domingo <span style="">Bautista instituted against </span><span style="">respondent </span><span class="SpellE">Prmcci</span>
another civil action [Civil Case No. 1711, CFI, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>]
to recover P37,686.80 repres<span style="">enting the unpaid balance of </span>the sand and gravel "furnished
and <span style="">delivered
</span>to the latter during the months of February and March, <span style="">1952, which it used in its contracts with the
Government of the Republic of the Philippines, and for its batching
plant".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accord­ing to the judgment
of the Court of </span>Appeals, <span style="">that
case was then still pending before the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Then, on July 31, 1952 the Director of Public Works wrote
petitioner Domingo Bautista, stating that the work on Highway 54 [contract
PR-10(9)], was completed on June 8, 1952 and that "after final
liquidation<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>there will
be no further payment to be made by this Bureau to the contractor"; and
that petitioner could then "proceed to take necessary action" for the
recovery of his claim for materials supplied the contractor upon the
performance bond of P313,407.00 furnished by Central.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 3, 1952, Bautista filed the case <u>now before us</u>
[Civil Case No. 1888, Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>]

balance of the price of sand and gravel fur­nished and delivered to and used by
<span class="SpellE">Prmcci</span> for the construction of the Highway 54
project, in the total sum of P48,807.74.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Of this amount, the sum <span style="">of P</span>8,012.59
represents the value of construction materials from February 14, 1952 to March
31, 1952.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The remainder, i.e.,
P40,795.15, was for the sand and gravel deli­<span style="">vered to </span>Highway 54 up to January 26, 1952 which was "<u>included
<span style="">in </span>the complaint</u> in Civil
Case No. 1636".</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 23, 1953, in this last Case 1888, pursuant to Act
3688, the <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> court issued notice by publication,

claims" therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 22, 1953, Allied Enterprises Co., Inc. moved to
intervene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint in intervention
avers that <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> furnished crushed rock used in
Highway 54, and prays that, upon the provisions of Act 3688, <span class="SpellE">Prmcci</span> and Central be adjudged, <span style="">jointly and severally, to pay <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> the
balance of the value thereof in the sum of P13,629.42, with </span><span style="">damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On November 24, 1953, the Court admitted the complaint in
intervention.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the issues raised by the pleadings, and after trial,
judgment was, on January 3, 1956, rendered in Case 1888, as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">The correctness of the decision of the Court of Appeals directing
respondents to pay, jointly and severally, to petitioner the sum of P8,012.59
is not open to inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because said
respond­ents did not appeal from the judgment of the appellate court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Solely disputed here is the amount of
P40,795.15, balance of the value of the sand and gravel delivered to Highway 54
during the period <u>from </u><u><span style="">September

<p class="BODY">With respect to the sum of P40,795.15, is the final judgment by
compromise in Civil Case 1636 [CFI, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>] a bar to

<p class="BODY">That payment of the amounts just <span style="">listed, </span><span class="SpellE">totalling</span> P104, 000.00 <span style="">had been made, is beyond debate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, upon the terms of the compromise
agreement of </span><st1:date year="1952" day="14" month="2"><span style="">February 14, 1952</span></st1:date><span style="">, reduced to judgment on </span><st1:date year="1952" day="15" month="2"><span style="">February

Case 1636, that judgment for P</span><span style="">104,</span><span style="">000.00 had been fully satisfied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Not that petitioner Bautista did not consider himself bound by
the <span style="">agreement and judgment </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">Civil Case 1636.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proof:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>when he </span>subsequently filed on <st1:date year="1952" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1952</st1:date> <span style="">another suit, Civil Case 1711, </span>CFI, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
against the same respondent <span class="SpellE">Prmcci</span>, he only prayed
for P37,686.80, the unpaid balance on the sand and gravel used in <span class="SpellE">Prmcci's</span> contracts, during the months of February and
March, 1952.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Case 1711, he did not
lay claim to any amount due him - upon the Highway 54 account - <u>prior</u> to
the judgment in Case 1636.</p>

<p class="BODY">But, thereafter, came the <span style="">letter
of the Director of Public </span>Works of <st1:date year="1952" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1952</st1:date> addressed to petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The suggestion therein that petitioner sue <span class="SpellE">Prmcci</span> on the latter's P313,407.00-bond, naturally opened
petitioner's eyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He registered the
present suit, Case 1888, CFI-<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time, he sought to recov<span style="">er </span>not only
for deliveries made <u>subsequent </u>to the judgment in Case 1636.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He<span style=""> </span>also
prayed for judgment for an alleged amount still unpaid on the <span style="">deliveries </span>of
materials for Highway 54 <u>prior to February 4, 1952</u>, for <span style="">which judgment was already rendered in Case
1636.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To our mind, Case 1888, this case,
is but an eleventh-hour effort to </span><span style="">shy
</span><span style="">away from the import of the
agreement and judgment in Case 1636.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
now, attempt is made by petitioner to apply the collections (enumerated in, and
to be applied by the terms of, the judgment </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">Case 1636, to the
obligation of P104,000.00), first, "to the accounts of the particular
projects from which the money came and the sur­plus of such collections from
the other projects to the account of Highway 54".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aptly did the Court of Appeals state:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Such application of payments would be proper if it is not clearly
deduced from the compromise agreement that the total payment of P104,000.00 by
the Bureau of Public Works consisting of <span style="">P14,000.00,
more or less; to be covered by a check to be issued on or before February 15,
1952, from any amount collectible under contract </span>PR-521 [Plaza Lawton]
and P67,000.00 to be obtained from said Bureau through another check to be
issued on or before February 21, <span style="">1952, </span>col­lectible
under contract PR-13(1) comprising Plaza <span class="SpellE">Moriones</span> and
Juan Luna, or a total of approximately P18,000.00, plus the balance of P<span style="">23,</span>000.00 assigned by defendant
corporation to plaintiff by virtue of the agreement had between the parties in
Civil Case No. 1482 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
covered all the indebtedness of the Philippine Ready-Mixed Concrete Co., Inc.
for construction materials already supplied and delivered to and used by said
corporation during the period from September 12, 1951 to January 31, 1952.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently the cost of these construction
materials were all paid for by applying said sum of P104,000.00 <span style="">t</span>o the
balance of all accounts due <span style="">unpaid on</span><span style=""> </span><st1:date year="1952" day="14" month="2"><span style="">February 14, 1952</span></st1:date><span style="">, the date of the </span>compromise
agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, any application
of payment made at variance with the intent behind the agreement in the
judicial compromise cannot be sanctioned.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Furthermore, it appears from plaintiff's evidence that a part of
the account for Highway 54 had been paid from the surplus funds from other
projects (Exhibits D and D-5).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
surplus funds include treasury warrants from the Bureau of Public Works dated <st1:date year="1952" day="18" month="3">March 18, 1952</st1:date>, and <st1:date year="1952" day="24" month="3">March 24, 1952</st1:date> (Exhibits D-7 and D-8).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the collection on these dates were already
considered <span style="">as
‘surp</span><span style="">lus
funds </span><span style="">from
</span>other projects' and, therefore, the account for these other projects had
already been <span style="">fully settled, we see no
reason why plaintiff instituted Civil Case No. 1711 on April 2, 1952, allegedly
to collect the payment of the unpaid de­liveries for all projects during the
months of February and March, 1952.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, why did plain­tiff's witness, Jaime Bautista, testify during the
trial of the instant case, while Civil Case No. 1711 was still pending, that
the accounts for all projects except that for Highway 54 had already been
settled, although it appears that the last check paid for these projects was dated
March 24, 1952?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only logical and
reasonable explanation that can be drawn from these apparently irreconcilable
facts </span><span style="">is
</span><span style="">that, in accordance with the
terms of the judicial compromise, plaintiff did apply the col­lections from the
Bureau of Public Works to the accounts for the deliveries made to all the
projects </span><span style="">during the period </span><span style="">from </span><span style="">September 12, </span><span style="">1951, to January </span><span style="">26, </span><span style="">1952, and thereafter instituted Civil </span><span style="">Case </span><span style="">No. 1711 for the payment of the deliveries to
all projects made during the months of February and March 1952.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the filing of said case, plaintiff
received the letter from the Bureau of Public Works informing him that he could
proceed against the performance bond for all unpaid claims for Highway 54.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order to take advantage of the security of
the bond, plaintiff changed the applica­tion of payments by settling first all
the accounts for the other projects from the collections received from the
Bureau of Public Works including those already applied in accordance with the
terms of the judicial compromise in Civil Case No. 1636, so as to leave only
the account for Highway 54 as still unpaid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff, however, cannot, by the simple expedient of changing the
application of payments, revive an obligation that had been legally
extinguished by payment."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUM">2. Petitioner seeks protection in the P313,407.00-performance bond
given <span style="">under Act </span>3688.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, as far as his claim to any amount due
before the judgment <span style="">in </span>Case 1636, petitioner lost his recourse thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He cannot now undo what was effectively
concluded by the judgment in Civil Case 1636.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">By </span>that
judgment, the identity of each separate account of <span class="SpellE">Prmcci</span>
as of <st1:date year="1952" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1952</st1:date>,
had been en­tirely extinguished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Only
</u><u><span style="">one account that very date
existed</span></u><span style="">, </span>and it was
fixed at P104,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And there <span style="">was </span>no
