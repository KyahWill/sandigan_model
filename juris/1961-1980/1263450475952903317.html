				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Sometime in 1943 <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Aquisap</span> filed "Civil Case No. 1, <span class="SpellE">por</span>
<span class="SpellE">Detentacion</span>, dated <st1:date year="1943" day="28" month="7">July 28, 1943</st1:date>" with the just­ice of the peace court
of San <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>,
against <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> and
Santiago Amos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judgment was rendered on <st1:date year="1943" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1943</st1:date>, sentencing the
defendant "to vacate and restore possession of the land to him and to pay
damages and costs".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> received a copy of the decision, he remained in
possession of the land, planted it to palsy in 1944, 1945 and 1946 and,
according to <span class="SpellE">Aquizap</span>, "reaped and harvested for
himself, exclusively," 16 <span class="SpellE">cavanes</span> of palsy for
each agricultural year or 48 <span class="SpellE">cavanes</span> all told.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In November, 1946 the deputy sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>, by force of a writ of execution issued by the
said JP court on October 23, 1946, "constituted himself in the place and
delivered the posses­sion of the same" to <span class="SpellE">Aquizap</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1946" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1946</st1:date>
<span class="SpellE">Aquizap</span> filed a complaint (CC 1150) with the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>, "asking payment of
certain amount of money and damages" against <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>
and others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1953" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1953</st1:date> this complaint was dismissed, for <span class="SpellE">Aquizap's</span> failure to appear when the case was called for
hear­ing, "without prejudice to the filing of a new complaint".</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 3, 1953 <span class="SpellE">Aquizap</span> filed the
present action (CC 1631) with the same CFI of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>,
alleging that <span class="SpellE">Ba­silio's</span> <span style="">illegal possession of </span><span style="">the
</span><span style="">premises in the years </span><span style="">1944, 1945 and 1946, </span><span style="">caused him to suffer "damages and
prejudice" to the extent of </span><span style="">48
</span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">cavanes</span></span><span style=""> of <span class="SpellE">palay</span>,
represent­ing the harvest for </span><span style="">the
</span><span style="">said agricultural years, </span><span style="">at P11 </span><span style="">per <span class="SpellE">Cavan</span>, or a total </span><span style="">equivalent </span><span style="">sum of P528, </span><span style="">and
"other </span><span style="">damages in the amount
of P200.00, representing expenses and the rea­sonable value of his professional
</span><span style="">works in </span><span style="">handling </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">case".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He prayed that <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"judgment be rendered: (a) sentencing
the defend­ants <span style="">to pay </span>the
plaintiff the amount of 48 <span class="SpellE"><span style="">cavanes</span></span><span style=""> </span>of
palsy or its <span style="">equivalent value </span>in
the sum of P528.00, Philippine Currency, plus its legal in­terest until it is
fully paid; (b) sentencing the defendants to pay another sum of P200.00 for dam­ages
caused against him; and (c) ordering the de­fendants to pay the cost."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After filing his answer to the complaint, <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>
died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was substituted by his
"heirs and successors in interest", namely, <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span>, Francisca, <span class="SpellE">Pio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span>, Ricardo, Tomas and <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>,
all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>, and Maria <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Against these defendants, <span class="SpellE">Aquisap</span>
<span style="">then </span>filed an amended complaint
which reproduced <u><span style="">verbatim</span></u><span style=""> </span>the allegations and prayer of the
first complaint, <span style="">with </span>the
addition of a paragraph re­citing that the said amended complaint was filed
"only to make (them) party defendants, by substitution according to law *
* *, who are the heirs and successors in interest of the said de­ceased
original defendant, <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>".</p>

<p class="BODY">The heirs-defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint,
averring that it does not state a cause of action; that the cause of action, if
any, does <span style="">not </span>accrue against
then; and that the action is barred by the statute of limita­tions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In spite of opposition by the plaintiff, the
lower court dismissed the amended complaint on the ground that it is
"barred by the statute of limitations." The plaintiff appealed to the
Court of Appeals after denial of his mo­<span style="">tion
</span>for reconsideration of the order of dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because only questions of law are involved,
the appeal was certified to us.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's 1946 action <span style="">seeking
</span>recovery of the sum of P528 was dismissed on <st1:date year="1953" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1953</st1:date> for his failure to ap­pear,
"without prejudice to the filing of a new complaint." It was
obviously in accordance with this reservation that he filed the present <span style="">action on </span><st1:date year="1953" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1953</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By then, how­ever, the <span style="">Court of </span>First
<span style="">Instance </span>of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>
had lost juris­diction because the Judiciary Act of 1948, which took affect <span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1948" day="17" month="6"><span style="">June 17, 1948</span></st1:date><span style="">, gave inferior
courts "exclusive original jurisdiction where . . . the amount of the
demand does not exceed two thousand pesos, exclusive of interest and
costs."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It may indeed be true that at the time the appellant filed his
action in 1946 the Court of First instance had ju­risdiction of his claim since
the former law<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
on the juris­diction of courts placed cases in which the demand, exclusive of
interest and costs, amounts to P600 or more, within the exclusive jurisdiction
of the courts of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it
is a rule firmly imbedded in jurisprudence that jurisdic­tion is determined by
the statute in force at the time of the filing of the action,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and since the present action was filed in 1953, the Judiciary Act of 1948,
which had earlier taken effect, governed the jurisdiction of courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">The reservation of the appellant's action made in the order of
dismissal of <st1:date year="1953" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1953</st1:date>
did not make the present action a continuation of that which was thereby
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The notation in the order
that the dismissal was "without prejudice to the filing of a new
complaint" was intended merely to avoid the effects of the Rules of Court
provision<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
that dismissal for failure of the plaintiff to appear is equi­valent to
"an adjudication on the merits [with prejudice] <u>unless</u> <u>otherwise</u>
<u>provided</u> <u>by</u> <u>the</u> <u>court</u>," but it did not render
the order any less final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The<span style=""> order here</span> in question is not like
the "sin <span class="SpellE">perjuicio</span>" decision which this
Court condemned as a nullity in <u>Director</u> <u>of</u> <u>Lands</u> <u>v</u>.
<span class="SpellE"><u>Sanz</u></span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
because it did not contain” a statement of the facts which were essential to a
clear understanding of the issues presented by the respective parties as to the
facts involved.”<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The order of dismissal in this case is complete in all details and, though
without pre­judice, nonetheless finally disposed of the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The result is that the jurisdiction which the
Court of <span style="">First Instance </span>of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> had acquired in 1946 under Act 136 was fully
discharged and terminated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The present
action, then, is a completely new action which should have taken into account
the law in force at the time of <span style="">its </span>filing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the totality of the demands contained in the amended
complaint of the appellant is way below P2,000, it was plainly below the
minimum jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance under section 88 of the
Judiciary Act of 1948, and therefore this Court is without appellate
jurisdiction to review this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span style="">view </span>of the <span style="">conclusion we have </span>thus reached, we
deem it unnecessary to pass upon the <span style="">issues
</span>raised by the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the appeal is dismissed, and the proceedings
in the lower court are set aside, without pronouncement as to costs.</p>
