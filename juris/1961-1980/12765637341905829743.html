				<H3>MANILA UNDERWRITERS INSURANCE CO., INC., PETITIONER, VS. HON. BIENVENIDO A. TAN, AND JOSE DE BORJA, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>This is a petition for certiorari and prohibition filed by the Manila 
Underwriters Insurance Co., Inc. to annul the orders issued by the respondent 
judge on August 30, 1960 and September 10, 1960 in Civil Case No. 12796 entitled 
Gelacio E. Tumambing vs. Jose de Borja, on the ground that they were issued 
without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion. </p>
<p>In the civil case above mentioned, the respondent judge, upon application of 
the plaintiff therein, issued a writ of preliminary attachment against the 
properties of the defendant, upon a bond executed by petitioner, Manila 
Underwriters Insurance Co., Inc., in the amount of P8,000.00 conditioned for the 
payment of such damages as defendant may suffer by reason of the attachment, 
should the court finally adjudge that plaintiff was not entitled thereto. </p>
<p>After issues had been joined, the case was tried, and on December 21, 1954, 
the court rendered judgment as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In view of the foregoing consideration, the court hereby renders judgment: 
</p>
<p>(a) Dismissing the plaintiff's complaint; </p>
<p>(b) Ordering the dissolution of the writ of preliminary attachment of the 
defendant's properties, but maintaining the bond filed by the plaintiff in full 
force and effect so as to respond for damages suffered by the defendant for the 
wrongful issuance of the said writ of preliminary attachment; and </p>
<p>(c) Sentencing the plaintiff to pay the defendant the sum of P8,138.30) for 
the first counterclaim, P5.500.00 for the second counter-claim. P5.000.00 for 
the third counterclaim, P20.000.00 for the fourth counter-claim, or a total of 
P38,938.39, with legal interest from the filing of the said counterclaim, until 
paid, with costs against the plaintiff." </p></blockquote>
<p>It is not disputed that petitioner was not impleaded nor given any kind of 
notice in relation to the counter-claim filed by the defendant. Neither was he 
given notice of the trial. On January 25, 1955, however, a copy of the decision 
was served upon it </p>
<p>On March 19, 1957, after the Court of Appeals had affirmed said decision, 
respondent Borja filed a motion for a writ of execution against petitioner which 
the latter op- posed alleging that, inasmuch as it had not been notified of the 
claim for damages in the manner required by Section 20 of Rule 59 of the Rules 
of Court (now Section 20 of Rule 57 of the New Rules of Court), it cannot be 
made liable under its bond. This opposition notwithstanding, on March 27, 1957, 
the respondent judge issued an order granting Borja's motion for execution. 
Petitioner appealed to Us (G. R. No. 12256) and on April 29, 1960, We rendered 
judgment in favor of petitioner, as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In accordance with the foregoing interpretation, petitioner Surety not 
having boon notified in the manner required by the Rules of Court before 
judgment has become final, should not be made liable under its bond. </p>
<p>Wherefore, the order appealed from is hereby set aside. So ordered." 
</p></blockquote>
<p>On August 15, 1960, respondent Borja, filed another motion in the same case 
asking the court to require petitioner again to show cause why it should not be 
made liable under its bond, and thereafter to issue a writ of execution against 
it. Petitioner opposed the motion on the ground that our decision in G.R. No. 
L-12256 had finally disposed of the issue raised therein. Despite this, the 
respondent judge, on August 30, 1960 issued an order citing petitioner to appear 
before it and show cause why it should not be liable under its bond, and on 
September 10 of the same year, his honor also denied petitioner's motion for 
reconsideration of said order. Thereupon the present action was filed. </p>
<p>Upon the undisputed facts stated heretofore, it appears abundantly clear that 
the respondent judge seriously erred in issuing the orders complained of. The 
question of whether petitioner could still be held liable upon its bond must be 
deemed finally settled by our decision in G. R. No. L-12256, and any attempt to 
hold petitioner liable upon the bond already mentioned must necessarily be 
deemed as an improper attempt to reopen a case already finally adjudicated. </p>
<p>Wherefore, the orders complained of are hereby declared void and or of no 
legal force and effect. The writ of preliminary injunction issued in this case 
on October 26, 1960 is hereby made final. Costs against respondent Borja. </p>
