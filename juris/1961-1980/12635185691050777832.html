				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The failure of respondent Judge, the Honorable Mateo <span class="SpellE">Canonoy</span>, to defer to the controlling doctrine that the
one-year period within which to file an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
case is to be counted from the last demand, supplies the basis for this special
civil action for certiorari.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On its
face, then, its merit is rather apparent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We find for petitioners Development Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and the <st1:place><st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>San
  Carlos</st1:placename></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Right at the outset, after the allegation as to parties, the
petition filed on August 22, 1968 makes mention of a decision of respondent
Judge of April 24, 1968<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>ordering defendant in such case, now
respondent Pedro <span class="SpellE">Clavano</span>, to remove his house and
vacate the premises, the plaintiffs being now petitioners Develop­ment Bank of
the Philippines and the University of San Carlos.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such decision, it was noted that the five
lots in question were owned by the Development Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
thereafter made the subject of a conditional sale to the <st1:place><st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>San Carlos</st1:placename></st1:place>, which required
defendant <span class="SpellE">Clavano</span> to vacate the premises, a demand
not heeded by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a refusal, as
set forth in the decision, was predicated on the alleged illegality of such
sale as the University of San Carlos is run by foreigners, defendant, moreover,
having since 1945 occupied that place on which he did thereafter build a
residential and commercial house of strong materials, with its original owner,
the Philippine Railway, having promised through its manager to sell him such
land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge, after a thorough
study of the facts and the law, came to the conclusion that the plaintiff, now
petitioner University of San Carlos, had the right to possession, but allowed
the defendant one more year, to expire until April 30, 1969, for the removal of
his house and the improvements on the premises, with plaintiff being authorized
to do so in the event of his failure to comply with this portion of the
decision, at the same time requiring him to pay monthly rentals of P24.00 from
April 30, 1960 with legal interest until the delivery of the premises.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Assertion was then made in the petition as to respondent <span class="SpellE">Clavano</span> filing a motion for reconsideration on <st1:date month="5" day="24" year="1968">May 24, 1968</st1:date>, where­in the question
of jurisdiction was raised on the plea that more than one year had elapsed from
the time of the demand.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The plea for reconsideration was successful, as, on <st1:date year="1968" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1968</st1:date>, respondent Judge, in a resolution
now challenged in this petition, yielded assent.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The cause of action accrued
in July, 1960, that is, after 30 days from <st1:date year="1960" day="10" month="6">June 10, 1960</st1:date>, when defendant was notified by the <st1:place><st1:placename>plaintiff</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype></st1:place> to vacate the premises
and [remove] his building. * * * (Under the terms of the lease contract, the
lessee is entitled to 30-day notice of termination.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, when the original complaint was filed on
November 19, 1962 snore than one year had already elapsed; consequently, the
lower [court] did not have jurisdiction over the present case of unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Con­sequently
also, on appeal this Court as an appellate Court could not [assume] power in
excess of the jurisdiction of the lower court."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
In the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of such resolution,
respondent Judge granted the motion for reconsideration and dismissed the case
without prejudice, reserving to plaintiffs, however, the right to file the
proper action in a competent court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was an urgent motion for reconsideration filed by plaintiffs, now
petitioners, on <st1:date month="7" day="25" year="1968">July 25, 1968</st1:date>,
but it was denied on <st1:date month="8" day="6" year="1968">August 6, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decisive facts are, therein set forth thus: "a) That on <st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="11">November 19, 1962</st1:date>, Civil Case No.
R-8996 was filed in the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
against 62 defendants, and respondent Pedro <span class="SpellE">Clavano</span>
was one of the defendants who moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground of
lack of jurisdiction and <span class="SpellE">misjoinder</span> of parties; b) That
on March 25, 1963, the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, <u>denied
the motion to dismiss</u>, and instead ordered that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'However, the Court orders the plaintiff to
split the complaint, that is, one complaint against one defendant, in order
that the issues between the plaintiffs and one particular defendant, who has a
separate and different defense from the others can be fairly tried.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The present complaint shall be maintained but
against the first named defendant only.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the meantime, the hearing of the case is held pending until
compliance by the plaintiffs with this Court's Order." <span style="">* * *; </span>c) That on June 22, 1964, after
various motions and pursuant to the Order of May 8, 1964, issued by the
Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, Civil Case No. 10354,
against respondent Pedro <span class="SpellE">Clavano</span>, was filed. * * *;
d) That the Municipal Court, after denying respondent Pedro <span class="SpellE">Clavano's</span>
motion to dismiss and its subsequent motion to suspend hearing, tried the case
on its merits and judgment was rendered on June 30, 1966, in favor of
petitioners but granting to respondent Pedro <span class="SpellE">Clavano</span>,
the right to recover P10,000.00 for the improvement and to remain in possession
of the land until fully paid with right to buy the land should petitioner
University of San Carlos fail to pay respondent, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Clavano</span>,
within 90 days the amount of P10,000.00; e) That petitioners not being
satisfied with the decision, appealed the judgment to the Court of First
Instance; f) That in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
where the case was elevated on appeal, no motion to dismiss was filed and the
case was tried on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
question of ownership as well as who had a better right to the property were
considered and pertinent oral as well as documentary evidence were submitted by
respondent Pedro <span class="SpellE">Clavano</span>; g) That on April 24, 1968,
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, after a lawful
and due hearing and trial, rendered its decision in favor of petitioners and
ordering defendant to vacate the premises, ruling that respondent is not a <span style="">builder in good faith; h) That the Resolution
of the Respondent Judge, Hon. Mateo <span class="SpellE">Canonoy</span> setting
aside its Decision, is predicated on the proposition that the cause of action
accrued on June 10, 1960, when petitioners made its first demand for respondent
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Clavano</span> to vacate and not on May 14, 1962 when
the second demand was made."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In the answer filed on </span><st1:date month="10" day="7" year="1968"><span style="">October

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the above decisive
undisputed fact that the filing of the action for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
was within the one-year period after the second letter of demand of May 14,
1962, the challenged order of reconsideration of respondent Judge of June 25,
1968 as well as the later order of August 6, 1968, wherein respondent Judge
maintained his stand, cannot be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> Oh v. Garcia,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> we reaffirmed in categorical language the

that defendant detained the premises is to be reckoned with from the date of
the last demand."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The year before, in <span class="SpellE">Racaza</span>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge, in his order of <st1:date month="8" day="6" year="1968">August 6, 1968</st1:date>, apparently was misled by a 1966
decision, <span class="SpellE">Desbarats</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Segarra</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
where the one-year period for filing the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
suit was computed from the first letter of demand as there was an absence of
tolerance or waiver on the part of the landlord.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reliance is misplaced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a ruling does not call for application
here on the facts as disclosed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather,
what is to be emphasized in the opinion in <span class="SpellE">Desbarats</span>
by Justice Barrera is the following excerpt:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"For, although it is true that the lessee was required to pay the
rentals or vacate the premises by letter of March 11, 1955, which should make
the lessee's possession unlawful from that time, the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
has also the privilege to waive the right to bring the proper action, or to
allow the lessee to continue in his occupation, thereby legalizing the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in one case, where despite
the lessee's failure to pay the rent after the first demand, the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> did not choose to bring an action in court, but
'suffered the lessees to continue occupying the lands for nearly two years',
the <span class="SpellE">lessor's</span> inaction was construed as waiver of his
right to file the case, and his tolerance of the lessees' possession of the
property, consi­dered to have legalized the said otherwise unlawful
possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the cause of
action for illegal <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> was therein declared to
have accrued only when the second demand for rents and for surrender of
possession was not complied with."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Nor should it be lost sight of that if an attempted distinction
were made, the Court in the <span class="SpellE">Desbarats</span> ease, had to do
so as otherwise the <span class="SpellE"><u>accion</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>publiciana</u></span>
filed by the landlord for the recovery of possession could be deemed
objectionable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What emerges clearly,
then, is the reluctance on the part of this Court to justify a <span class="SpellE">wilfull</span> refusal on the part of a person no longer entitled
to possession to continue the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
is the fundamental assumption ignored by respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the propriety of this petition for certiorari.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the writ of certiorari prayed for is granted,
the resolution of <st1:date month="6" day="25" year="1968">June 25, 1968</st1:date>
