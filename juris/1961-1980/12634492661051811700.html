				<H3>IN RE:  PETITION FOR THE CORRECTION AND/OR MARGINAL
ANNOTATION OF ENTRIES IN THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE OF OSCAR SIA OLIVA, DOMINGO DY OLIVA, AND VICENTA SIA
OLIVA, PETITIONERS-APPELLEES, VS.
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR-APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., Acting C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal of the Solicitor General from the decision of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (<span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>
City) in Sp. Proc. No. 1834-P, ordering the Local Civil Registrar of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City to correct his record, "as to the
nationality of Oscar <span class="SpellE">Sia</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span>
by substituting the word 'Filipino' in lieu of 'Chinese' in entry No. 8 of his
certificate of live birth, upon payment of the prescribed fees."</p>

<p class="BODY">The spouses Domingo <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span> and <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> <span class="SpellE">Sia</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span>, allegedly both
citizens of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
petitioned the Court of First Instance on <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1963</st1:date>, to order the correction and/or
annotation of cer­tain entries in the Certificate of Live Birth of their child,
Oscar <span class="SpellE">Sia</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span>, who was
born on <st1:date year="1958" day="28" month="10">October 28, 1958</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was claimed that through mistake and
inadvertence in the preparation and registra­tion of the birth certificate of
said child, petitioners' nationality was entered as <u>Chinese</u>, instead of <u>Filipino</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over the State's op­position, the lower court
rendered the decision now on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Justifying the exercise of jurisdiction by the lower court, and
disputing the applicability in this case of the authorities cited by the
Solicitor General, that citizenship cannot be the subject of the summary
proceeding for correction of entries in the civil registry, petitioners-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> contend that it is not the declaration of their
citizenship that is here involved, because that is supposed to be already
settled,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
but only the correction of an erroneous entry in the certificate of birth of
their son, Oscar.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the settled rule that the jurisdiction of the court to
order the correction or alteration of entries in the civil registry, allowed
under Article 412 of the Civil Code, is limited only to innocuous or clerical mistakes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated in the leading case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Ansaldo</u></span><u> vs. Republic</u>:<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
</span><span class="SpellE">x</span> the clerical errors which might be corrected
through judicial sanction under Article 412 of the New Civil Code, would be
those harmless and innocuous changes, such as, correction of a name that is
clearly misspelled, occupation of the parents, etc.; but for changes involving
the civil status of the <u>parents, their nationality or citizenship</u>, those
are grave and impor­tant matters <u>which may have a bearing and effect on the
citizenship and nationality not only of said parents, but of the <span class="SpellE">offsprings</span></u>, and to seek said changes, it is necessary
to file a proper suit wherein not only the State, but also all parties
concerned and affected should be made parties defendants or respondents, and
evidence should be submitted, either to support the allega­tions of the
petition or complaint, or also to dis­prove the same so that any order or
decision in the case may be made with due process of law and on the basis of
facts proven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then and only then may the
change or changes be made in the entry in a civil register that will affect or
even determine conclusively the citizenship or nationality of a person therein
involved." (Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">With the data presently appearing in the civil registry, which,
according to the certificate of live birth of the child, were furnished by <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1-A), Oscar <span class="SpellE">Sia</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span>, as the son of Do­mingo <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span>, a Chinese national, and of Vicente Yu <span class="SpellE">Sia</span>, another Chinese national, is a Chinese citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To alter the entries by changing the
nationality of said parents, from "Chinese" to "Fili­pino",
would be to make it appear in that public record that the same Oscar <span class="SpellE">Sia</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span> is the son of Filipino
citizens and, therefore, is a citizen of the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not difficult to see that the changes
asked for are neither harmless nor innocuous, as petitioners-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> pretend them to be.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither is the case exempted from the operation of the rule
simply because the petitioning parents were able to present evidence tending to
establish their (the parents') Philippine citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That fact would not be material in a summary
proceeding for judicial cor­rection of the civil registry, citizenship not
being a proper subject of inquiry therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the complaint of <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> that
parties similarly situated as they are left without recourse under the law,
this Court once said:</p>

<blockquote>"It follows <span style="">that since
</span>the correction contemplated in this case does not refer merely to
clerical errors, a summary proceeding would not be sufficient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In­stead, petitioners should file a petition
as that pro­vided for under Article 108 of the Revised Rules of Court, section
4 of which requires notice and pub­lication, <span style="">x </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and which was precisely established in
1964 for the purposes of petitioners herein.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby reversed,
and the petition ordered dismissed, without prejudice to new proceedings in
conformity with Rule 108 of the Revised Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.</p>
