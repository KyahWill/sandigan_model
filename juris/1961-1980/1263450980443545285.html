				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">All over the world, Constitutions share one purpose:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to protect and enhance the people's interest,
as a nation collectively and as persons individually.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Philippine Constitution is no
exception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Interpretation of its pro­visions,
therefore, should be done with a view to realiz­ing this fundamental
objective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among the provisions in our
Constitution is one both timely and far-reaching, as it affects the people at
large and relates to social-jus­tice problems of the day. It is Subsec.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>21, Sec. 1 of Art. III:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Free access to the courts shall not be
denied to any person by reason of poverty." It is the one in­volved in
this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">A suit was filed in the Court of First Instance of Negros
Oriental on February 21, 1963 by ten persons for their own behalf and that of
9,000 other farm laborers working off and on in sugar cane plantations at the
Bais milling district, Negros Oriental, against Compania Gene­ral de Tabacos de
Filipinas, Central Azucarera de Bais, Compafuia Celulosa de Filipinas, Ramon
Barata, Aurelio Mon­tinola, Sr., and Miguel Franco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs sought to re­cover their alleged
participations or shares amounting to the aggregate sum of n4,031,836.74, in
the sugar, molas­ses, bagasse and other derivatives based on the provisions of
Republic Act 809 (The Sugar Act of 1952), particularly Sections 1 and <span style="">9 </span>thereof:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
absence of written milling agreements between the majority of planters and the
millers of sugar-cane in any milling district in the Philippines, the unrefined
sugar produced in that district from the milling by any sugar central of the
sugar-cane of any sugar-cane planter or plan­tation owner, as well as all
by-products and derivatives thereof, shall be divided between them as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sixty per centum for the planter, and forty per centum for
the central in any mill­ing district the maximum actual production of which is
not more than four hundred thou­sand piculs:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>Provided</u>, That the provisions of this section shall not apply to
sugar cen­trals with an actual production of less than one hundred fifty
thousand piculs;</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sixty-two and one-half per centum for the planter, and thirty-seven
and one-half per centum for the central in any milling dis­trict the maximum
actual production of which exceeds four hundred thousand piculs but does not
exceed six hundred thousand piculs;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sixty-five per centum for the planter, and thirty-five per
centum for the central in any milling district the maximum actual production of
which exceeds six hundred thou­sand piculs but does not exceed nine hundred
thousand piculs;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sixty-seven and one-half per centum for the planter, and
thirty-two and one-half per centum for the central in any milling district the
maximum actual production of which exceeds nine hundred thousand piculs but
does not exceed one million two hundred thousand piculs;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Seventy per centum for the planter, and thirty per centum for
the central in any mill­ing district the maximum actual production of which
exceeds one million two hundred thou­sand piculs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"By actual production is meant the to­tal production of the
mill for the crop year immediately preceding."</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SEC. <span style="">9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In addition to the benefits granted by
the Minimum Wage Law, the proceeds of any increase in the participation granted
the planters under this Act and above their present share shall be divided
between the planter and his laborers in the plantation in the following
proportion:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sixty per centum of the increased par­ticipation for the
laborers and forty per cen­tum for the planters. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The distribution of the share corresponding to
the laborers shall be made under the supervision of the Department of Labor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The benefits granted to laborers in su­gar plantations under
this Act and in the Mi­nimum Wage Law shall not in any way be dimi­nished by
such labor contracts known as 'by the piece,' 'by the volume,' 'by the area,'
or by any other system of 'pakyaw,' the Secre­tary of Labor being hereby
authorized to is­sue the necessary orders for the enforcement of this
provision."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, plaintiffs asked thereunder as well as by separate
motion, that the aforementioned court autho­rize them to sue as pauper
litigants, under Sec. 22, Rule <span style="">3 </span>of
the Rules of Court:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 22.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="">Pauper litigant</span></u><span style="">. - </span>Any court may authorize a litigant
to prosecute his ac­tion or defense as a pauper upon a proper show­ing that he
has no means to that effect by af­fidavits, certificate of the corresponding
pro­vincial, city or municipal treasurer, or other­wise, Such authority once
given shall include an exemption from payment of legal fees and from filing
appeal bond, printed record and printed brief.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The legal fees shall be a lien to any judgment rendered in the case
favora­bly to the pauper, unless the court otherwise provides."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">invoking Sec. 1, subsec. (21) of Art. III
of the Consti­tution of the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They alleged that they had no means to pay the docket fee of <span style="">P14,500.00, </span>being la­borers dependent
solely on their daily wages for liveli­hood and possessed of no
properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in support of the
foregoing, the ten named plaintiffs submitted certi­ficates of the municipal
treasurers of their places of residence stating that they have no real property
dec­lared in their names in said municipalities.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on the petition to litigate <u>in</u> <u>forma</u> <u><span style="">paupe</span>ris</u>, the Court of First
Instance issued an order<span style=""> </span>on May <span style="">27, 1963 </span>denying the same upon the
ground that the plain­tiffs have regular employment and <span style="">sources </span>of income and, thus, cannot be classified as poor or
paupers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs sought reconsideration of said order but reconsideration
was denied in an order dated June 11, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Assailing said two CFI orders and asserting their alleged right not to
be denied free access to the courts by reason of poverty, plaintiffs in said
case filed here­in, on August 1, <span style="">1963, </span>the
present special civil action for certiorari and <u>mandamus</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petition to litigate as pauper in the instant
case before Us was also filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on
August 16, 1963, We allowed petitioners herein to li­tigate in this Court as
paupers and required respondent to answer. Respondent's answer was filed on
November 2, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After hearing on
February 10, 1964 this case was submitted for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sole issue herein is whether petitioners were deprived, by
the orders in question, of free access to the courts by reason of poverty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In denying petitioners' motion to litigate as
paupers, respondent Judge adopted the definition of "pauper" in
Black's Law Dictionary (at p. 1284) as "a person so poor that he must be
supported at public expense".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And,
as afore-stated, he ruled that petitioners are not <u>that</u> poor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such interpretation, to our mind, does not fit with the purpose
of the rules on suits <u>in</u> <u>forma</u> <u>pauperis</u> and the provision
of the Constitution, in the Bill of Rights, that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Free access to the courts shall not be
denied to any person by reason of poverty." As applied to statutes or
provisions <span style="">on </span>the right to sue <u>in</u>
<u>forma</u> <u>pauperis</u>, the term has a broader meaning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has thus been recognized that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"An applicant for leave to sue <u>in</u>
<u>forma</u> <u>pauperis</u> need not be a pauper; the fact that he is
able-bodied and may earn the necessary money is no answer to his state­ment
that he has not sufficient means to prosecute the action or to secure the
costs" (14 Am. Jur. 31).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It suf­fices
that plaintiff is <u>indigent</u> (Ibid.), tho not a public charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the difference between
"paupers" and "indigent" persons is that the latter are
"persons who have no property or source of income sufficient for their
support aside from their own labor, though self-supporting when able to work
and in employment" (Black's Law Dictionary, p. 913, "Indigent",
citing Peo. v. Schoharie County, 121 NY 345, 24 NE 830).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is therefore in this sense of being
indigent that "pauper" is taken when refer­ring to suits <u>in</u> <u>forma</u>
<u>pauperis</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Black's Law Dictionary
in fact defines pauper, thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"A
person so poor that he must be supported at public expense; <u>also a suitor
who, on account of poverty, is allowed to sue or defend with­out being </u><u><span style="">chargeable </span>with costs</u>" (p.
1284, underscoring supplied).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is further argued that the docket fee of P14,500 could very
well be shouldered by petitioners since there are around 9,000 of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be remembered, however that the
action in question was filed by way of a class suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the Rules of Court allowing such
procedure state under Sec. 12, Rule <span style="">3:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 12.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="">Class suit</span></u><span style="">. - </span>When the subject matter of the controversy is one of common
or general interest to many persons, and the parties are so numerous that it is
impracticable to bring them all before the <span style="">court, </span>one or more may sue or defend for the benefit of
all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in such case the court shall
make sure that the parties actually before it are suf­ficiently numerous and
representative so that all interests concerned are fully protected. Any party
in interest shall have a right to intervene in protection of his individual in­terest."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">So that in the suit before respondent Judge the ten named
petitioners herein are the ones suing, albeit for the benefit of all the
others. It follows that the pay­ment of docket fee would be directly charged
upon them, not upon the unnamed "9,000 other laborers." And even if
the 9,000 other laborers should later bear the payment of said docket fee of P<span style="">14,500, </span>the same would be spread among
them at about <span style="">1.60 </span>each.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said cost of pressing their respective
average demand of <span style="">P1,600 </span>each
is, to Our mind, a substantial imposition on a seasonal farm laborer earning
barely subsistent wages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as pointed
out, this is only the initial fee; subsequent fees and charges would have to be
paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The philosophy underlying the
Constitutional mandate of free access to the courts not­withstanding poverty,
therefore, calls for exemption of herein petitioners from payment of the
aforesaid legal fees in their assertion and claim of substantial rights under
the Sugar Act of 1952.</p>

<p class="BODY">Returning to the purpose of all Constitutions, as mentioned
earlier, We find this course the most sensible, logical and practical
construction demanded by the free access clause of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a contrary inter­pretation could not make
said provision the living reali­ty that it is designed to be.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the fact that the supporting certifica­tions of
indigence refer only to the ten named plaintiffs, suffice it to reiterate that
this involves a class suit, where it is not practicable to bring all the other
9,000 laborers before the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
Court finds the support­ing evidence of indigence adequate, showing in
petitioners' favor, as plaintiffs in the suit before respondent Judge, the
right not to be denied free access to the courts by reason of poverty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since they were excluded from the use and
enjoyment of said right, mandamus lies to enforce it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appeal was unavailing, since they were not
even accorded the status of litigants, for non-payment of docket fee; and
perfecting an appeal would have presented the same question of exemption from
legal fees, appeal bond and similar requisites.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, petitioners are declared entitled to li­tigate
as paupers in their class suit before respondent Judge and the latter is hereby
ordered to grant their pe­tition to litigate <u>in</u> <u>forma</u> <u>pauperis</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
