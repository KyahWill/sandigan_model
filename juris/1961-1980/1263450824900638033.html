filed in Case 61-5270 and the other related cases, a petition "to suspend
the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of increased rates." Their
theory:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conditions in the original
decision of <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1963</st1:date>
were not eliminated, expressly or impliedly, by the amending <st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="1">January 9, 1964</st1:date> decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alleging that PLDT has failed to remove all
faulty installations and to connect 5,000 telephones within the required period
or that at least PSC records do not show compliance thereof by PLDT, <span class="SpellE">Telectronics</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tesco</span> prayed
that the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the increased rates be <u>suspended</u>
until PLDT complies.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 11, 1965, PLDT registered its opposition to the
petition just mentioned upon the grounds that:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) the conditions in the original decision are no longer contained in
the amended January 9, 1964 decision; (2) at the time <span class="SpellE">PLDT's</span>
motion to reconsider the decision was resolved (January 9, 1964), it was
impossible to comply with the condition of installing telephones because the
deadline <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> [December 31, 1963] had long
expired; and (3) PLDT, nonetheless, did install more than 5,000 telephones and
continues to do so.</p>

said cases, a joint petition "for a <u>reexamination</u> of the amount of
the increase in rates" to be charged by PLDT.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appearing as telephone subscribers, they
allege that subsequent to the July 31, 1963 original decision "certain
facts and circumstances were brought out disclosing or tending to disclose,
that PLDT has acquired and/or is about to acquire, telephone equipment and
material from its sister or associated companies abroad, at <u>excessive</u> <u>or</u>
<u>exorbitant</u> <u>prices</u>, although the same, or compatible equipment,
may be acquired from other sources, including domestic sources, at much less
cost and under more favorable terms"; and that because of this, PLDT can
carry out its improvement and expansion program at a lesser burden to its
subscribers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They reiterated the prayer
for suspension, and asked that, after hearing, the increased rates originally
authorized be lowered "to a more equitable, reasonable and justifiable
level."</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 5, 1965, PLDT opposed the petition just described,
because:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the petition seeks to
revive a case which is already final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
and the decision <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> has already gone into
effect since January 1, 1965; (2) the petition is upon the same grounds urged
by the same parties in <span class="SpellE">PLDT's</span> application [PSC Case
64-5437]<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
for the approval of its financing agreement with Export Credits Insurance
Corporation [ECIC] and are matters still pending resolution by PSC; and (3) the
petition is premature, patently unmeritorious and groundless.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="2">February 16, 1965</st1:date>,
PLDT moved to dismiss the petition of <st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="12">December
 28, 1964</st1:date>, for the suspension of the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of rates, filed by <span class="SpellE">Telectronics</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tesco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reasons:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) that actually, from <st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1963</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1963</st1:date>, PLDT has installed 9,482 telephones,
and from January 1 to <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="12">December 31,
 1964</st1:date>, a total of 16,776 telephones; and (b) that a similar petition
filed by one Ramon G.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Umali</span> was dismissed on <st1:date year="1965" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1965</st1:date>, not merely because <span class="SpellE">Umali</span>
moved to dismiss it, but also for the reason that, as PSC said, "the rate
increases were authorized in a final decision on the merits on <st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="1">January 9, 1964</st1:date>, effective from <st1:date year="1965" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1965</st1:date>".</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="22" month="2">February 22, 1965</st1:date>,
PSC issued an order denying the motion to dismiss just recited, because it
raises points evidentiary in character.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>PSC, however, stated that the denial is without prejudice to raising the
same questions at the proper time.</p>

<p class="BODY">PSC set the two petitions - <st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1964</st1:date>, by <span class="SpellE">TelecÂ­tronics</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Tesco</span>; and <st1:date year="1965" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1965</st1:date>, by <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, <span class="SpellE">Telectronics</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tesco</span> - for
hearing on <st1:date year="1965" day="10" month="3">March 10, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 3, 1965, PLDT filed a motion to reconsider the February
22, 1965 order and "for immediate resolution of grounds to dismiss" <span class="SpellE">Telectronics</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tesco's</span> petition
dated December 28, 1964 and the other petition of January 26, 1965, filed by <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, <span class="SpellE">Telectronics</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tesco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>PLDT claims
that its motion to dismiss of February 16, 1965 is planted not only on factual
averments, but also on purely legal grounds, namely, the finality of the
January 9, 1964 decision, the dismissal by PSC of a similar petition (<span class="SpellE">Umali's</span>), and the elimination in said January 9, 1964
decision of the conditions imposed in the original decision of July 31, 1963.</p>

<p class="BODY">The PSC order [signed by respondent <st1:city><st1:place>Medina</st1:place></st1:city>]
of <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1965</st1:date>, denying
the motion for reconsideration, stated:</p>

<blockquote>"The fact that the decision rendered by this Commission on
July 31, 1963 as amended by the majority opinion of January 9, 1964, is final
with respect to the merits of the case, does not deprive the undersigned of his
supervisory powers to deterÂ­mine whether any of the conditions imposed in said
decision had been violated or ignored by the public utility concerned or
whether said public utility is or is not rendering adequate, sufficient and
satisfactory service.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Furthermore, Section 16 (m) of the Public Service Law gives the
Commission ample powers to amend, modify or even to revoke any order or
certificate of public convenience granted, whenever the circumÂ­stances have
materially changed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This order was received by the PLDT on <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present petition for prohibition filed on <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon respondents' separate returns to the petition, and after
oral arguments and memoranda, the case for prohibition was submitted to this
Court for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since then, supervening incidents occurred.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1966</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Telectronics</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tesco</span>
moved in the PSC to dismiss their petition of <st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1964</st1:date> to suspend the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of increased rates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They state that PLDT
has subÂ­stantially complied with the conditions prescribed in the <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1963</st1:date> decision, and that
because PLDT has shown good faith in rendering adequate service, "the
rates as authorized in the decision of <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="7">July
 31, 1963</st1:date> as amended by that of <st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="1">January 9, 1964</st1:date>, can no longer be suspended or reexamined
under the same proÂ­ceedings".</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter [by petition which bears date of October 27, 1966], <span class="SpellE">Telectronics</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tesco</span> registered
in PSC a motion to dismiss their petition of January 26, 1965 for rate
reexamination, insofar as they are concerned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They there aver that the comÂ­promise agreement filed in the case of
Lozano vs. PSC, et al. (L-25979) already included "provisions regarding
purchases by PLDT" of its equipment and supplies (which agreement was
referred by this Court to PSC, approved by the latter on July 22, 1965, and was
the basis of the dismissal by this Court of the Lozano case).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They allege that the compromise agreement
"prescribed the factors to be considered and the methods to be adopted by
the PLDT in making purchases of equipment and supplies, including provisions
for competitive bidding therein specified." <span class="SpellE">Movants</span>
then believed that the rate reexamination proceedings have become moot, and
felt satisfied that public interest has been served.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="18" month="11">November 18, 1966</st1:date>,
PSC issued an order, which reads:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Upon motion of counsel for the petitioners, without objection on
the part of the respondent, the petition filed in this case is considered
withdrawn and the case dismissed without prejudice".<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> </p>

<p class="BODY">With the foregoing backdrop, we grapple with the problems posited
by the prohibition case now before us.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. Forefront amongst these is <span class="SpellE">Araneta's</span>
insistence that PSC suspend the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of PLDT
rates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The theory relied upon is that
the conditions in the <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1963</st1:date>
decision have not yet been met.</p>

<p class="BODY">Tersely stated, the key question is this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Are the conÂ­ditions in the <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1963</st1:date> original decision taken
away by the <st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="1">January 9, 1964</st1:date>
amended decision?</p>

<p class="BODY">This requires but a comparison of the two decisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So comparing, it will not be difficult to
arrive at the conclusion that the conditions previously imposed are no longer
tacked to the amended decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">To fully project the marked difference between the two PSC
decisions, we set them out in parallel columns:</p>

decision of <st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="1">January 9, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Decisive of <span class="SpellE">PSC's</span>
intent to eliminate them, is the fact that, whereas the original decision
provides that "the new rates [<u>not</u> <u>to</u> <u>exceed</u> 47% and
40%) herein authorized <u>may</u> take effect from January 1, 1965, subject to
the following conditions", the amended decision made a specific
pronouncement for "the new rates <u>[definitely</u> <u>fixed</u> at 47%
and 40%) <u>to</u> <u>take</u> <u>effect</u> from January 1, 1965".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plain import of the phrase "to take
effect" is that no obstacle stands in the way of rate <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>,
no condition precedent is exacted of PLDT to enable it to implement the rates.</p>

<p class="BODY">True it is that in the first portion of the amendatory decision
of <st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="1">January 9, 1964</st1:date> the
Commissioners stated that they "hereby maintain with minor modifications,
the decision dated <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1963</st1:date>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The term "minor modifications"
could yet be the subject of guesswork, conjecture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But we need not shake meaning from this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, that same amendatory decision concludes
with the emphatic statement that the same "(5) HEREBY MODIFIES AND AMENDS
the decision of the Commission dated <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="7">July
 31, 1963</st1:date> <u>accordingly</u>".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This consideration is convincing enough to warrant a conclusion that the
new decision supplants the old.</p>

<p class="BODY">A striking fact is that the amendments in the new decision are
not piddling; they are meaningful, important.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In writing out a new <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion, the
Commissioners could not have simply deleted the conditions in the old, if their
intention was to reincorporate them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
absence therein of those conditions forecloses a speculative approach to the
intent and meaning of the amended decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Virtually crossed out, such conditions cannot now be <span class="SpellE">scissored</span>
from the original decision and pasted to the amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">We rule that the amended judgment on the merits - January 9, 1964
- is the final repository of the conclusions reached by the Public Service
Commission, is meant to replace that of July 31, 1963,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
and that, accordingly, the conditions required in the original decision of July
31, 1963 were eliminated from the amended decision of January 9, 1964.</p>

<p class="BODY">We note that this Memorandum of <st1:date year="1965" day="22" month="2">February 22, 1965</st1:date> - to serve as guide - was written at a
time when the amended decision of <st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="1">January
 9, 1964</st1:date> had long become final.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If for this fact alone, we are wholly unprepared, at this late date, to
lend an attentive ear to the <u>opinion</u> expressed in that memorandum.</p>

<p class="BODY">More to this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
memorandum does not partake of the nature of a <span class="SpellE"><u>nunc</u></span>
<u>pro</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>tunc</u></span> order.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
The language of a decision should suffice to give the meaning the
decision-makers intend to convey.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A fair
notion of justice will not permit a <u>material</u> elaboration of a decision -
which has become final - by the authors thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are to be guided solely by the decision,
as it is written.</p>

<p class="BODY">What could prevent another set of Commissioners from appending
another opinion as to the meaning of the amended decision, written in so clear
a language? Were this to be allowed, instability of written opinions
results.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, judges may bandy their
judgments about from time to time, recast them as they please.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The baneful effect is that a decision in
terminated proceedings becomes subject to the winds of change; a decision,
whose main purpose is to end controÂ­versies, can instead ignite other needless
lawsuits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So basic is our respect for
final judgments that no further amendments or corrections of substance - not
merely clerical errors, misprisions or omissions - may be authorized, no matter
how flagrant and glaring they may be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
judgment long final, cannot be made to speak a different language.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Illuminating is the following lifted from II
Moran, Rules of Court, 1963 ed., pp. 197-198:<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The
general power to correct clerical errors and omissions does not authorize the
court to repair its own inaction, to make the record and judgment say what the
court did not adjudge, although it had a clear right to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court cannot, under the guise of
correcting its record put upon it an order or judgment it never made or
rendered, or add someÂ­thing to either which was not originally included
although it might - and should have so ordered and adjudged in the first
instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot thus repair its own <span class="SpellE">laches</span> and omissions to do what it could legally and
properly have done at the right time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
court's mistake in leaving out of its decision something which it ought to have
put in, and something in issue of which it intended but failed to dispose, is a
judicial error, not a mere clerical misprision, and cannot be corrected by
adding to the entered judgment the omitted matter on the theory of making the
entry conform to the actual judgment entered".</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, there is no need to expand on the meaning of the amended
decision herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its language, we
repeat, is plain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was granted, was
expressly set forth therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To assure
stability of judgments, they must be taken at their face value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Words employed therein are to be construed as
any right thinking reader would accept them as their meaning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Writers of opinions should make sure that
they say what they mean.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From them,
precision is not merely desired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
demanded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, if later on they
would want to turn out meanings distinct from what was unambiguously written,
the law will stop them, <span class="SpellE">disauthorize</span> them to take
back what has already been said, or substitute another, or add new material
matter thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is in this context that we hold that the memorandum heretofore
transcribed, is null and void, without force and effect, and did not operate to
vary the terms of the amended judgment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And, PSC may not suspend the rates thus fixed.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

the remedy.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> seeks reexamination of the
rates approved by the Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> avers that PLDT can carry out its improvement and

<p class="BODY">But <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> [University] was not a
party to the rate-fixing case or to any of the other proceedings below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These rate-fixing and allied cases terminated
with the final judgment of <st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="1">January 9,
 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not being a party, it
could not have moved to reconsider said decision.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>

Even if we treat <span class="SpellE">Araneta's</span> reexamination petition as
one for reconsideration, the time <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> has long
passed.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">4. On top of all these is the fact that the amended judgment has
reached the stage of finality before <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> sought
reÂ­examination of rates.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On this point, it may be well to take a look at the historical
background of the present statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
old Public Service Law, Public Act 3108, provides in Section 28 thereof, that
the <u>Public</u> <u>Service</u> <u>Commission</u> "at any time, may order
a rehearing to extend, revoke, or modify any order made by it".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An examinaÂ­tion of jurisprudence under the
legal provisions just cited is quite revealing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court has held that "[f]<span class="SpellE">inality</span> must
be written on Public Service Commission cases just as public policy demands
that it be written on judicial controversies".<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
That was later clarified by this Court to mean that "once a question has
been definitely decided and the decision has become final, that same question
cannot again be raised between the same parties".<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
And in another case, we made it abundantly clear that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Public interest requires that
proceedings already terminated should not be altered at every step.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule of <u>non</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>quieta</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>movere</u></span> prescribes that what has already been
terminated should not be disturbed".<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
As a corollary, a record of a case once closed, should not be reopened to
permit presentation of evidence which could have been offered before the close
of the record.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">That final judgments of PSC should command respect is
well-exemplified in the present case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here, PLDT has entered into financial arrangements in no small amounts
for the expansion of its telephone service.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And this, in natural reliance upon a final decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Paraphrasing the language of this Court in <span class="SpellE">Ariaga</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span>, 92 Phil.
330, 338, to uproot the decision, suspend the rates, and return <span class="SpellE">PLDT's</span> position to where it was before the cases herein
involved were decided, "would be most unfair and unjust as it would be
tantamount to ignoring the big investment already made" by PLDT and
"would be tantamount to a punishment" which PLDT "does not
deserve".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Serious consequences that
might ensue from a contrary rule, are not difficult to perceive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The flow of operations may be disturbed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The program of expansion may suffer from a
bottleneck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inefficiency or inadequacy
of service may result.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Oppositors</span> to a given final decision, may yet constitute a
wrecking crew of a public utility company.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They may even bring about its financial ruin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the end, the consumers are prejudiced.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">5. We are not to deny the power of
the Public Service Commission to amend, modify or revoke or establish rates in
lieu of those set forth in the final decision.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">The reexamination herein sought by <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>,
perforce seeks the fixing of new and different rates.</p>

<p class="BODY">We part from the premise that, by reason of the final judgment of
<st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="1">January 9, 1964</st1:date>, the current
rates are being enforced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These rates
were arrived at after PSC had considered the factors in rate-making, following
a protracted hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These rates are
meant to be in force not for a day or a week.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We are quite certain that said rates were fixed in the expectation that
they are to stay till conditions warrant a change.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now to change once more the recently changed rates, a number of
elements need again be considered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
new rates to be fixed should allow PLDT to economically and efficiently manage
its business, such that its revenues adequately meet its operating expenses and
fixed charges; should afford it a fair return upon its capital; should give it
sufficient leeway to maintain and support its credit and enable it to raise
money necessary for the proper discharge of its public duty.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, the party primarily interested in an
adequate and efficient service is the public, the persons to use and pay for
the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such service does not necesÂ­sarily
mean reduced rates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could be quite
the contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it is, that, at bottom,
a just rate must be founded upon conditions which are fair and reasonable both
to the public utility and the public itself.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Stated in another way, it is not merely PLDT, not merely <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, but the consuming public as a whole, who stand to
be affected by any change of rate <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> now
proposes.</p>

<p class="NUM">6. <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, in effect, institutes a <u>fresh</u>
<u>petition</u> - for new rates, different from those already established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such petition is a proceeding separate and
distinct from those concluded by the final judgment of PSC of <st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="1">January 9, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records of the finished cases are
closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, <span class="SpellE">Araneta's</span> petition for new rates should be instituted as a <u>new</u>
<u>proceeding</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is but
consistent with orderly procedure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
such a step is proper, if only to avoid confusion, promote expediency, and
canalize attention to the substance of the new petition for change of existing
rates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been truly said that
"[w]here the matters involved can be made the subject of new proceedings,
the dismissal of a petition for rehearing decides nothing adversely to the

<p class="BODY">We, accordingly, hold that to reexamine the existing rates for
telephone services charged by petitioner, a new case must be filed under
separate docket in the Public Service ComÂ­mission.</p>

<p class="BODY">7. It thus becomes necessary that, for <span class="SpellE">Araneta's</span>
petition to be cognizable, opportunity must be afforded the consumers to have a
say on the merits of the petition, the public utility to object to the same,
and the competitors to protect their interests.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
It is for this reason that the law (<span class="SpellE">Secs</span>. 16 and 20,
Public Service Act) has appropriately provided that in a rate-fixing case, <u>proper</u>
<u>or</u> <u>reasonable</u> <u>notice</u> be given.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The familiar method of notice by publication <u>must</u>
be complied with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not to say
that the Public Service Commission is consÂ­tricted by this manner of issuing
notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition, other forms of
notice may, in the Commission's discretion, be required.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this, to the end that all parties to
public utility rate proceedings receive reasonable notice thereof to enable
them to prepare and present their respective sides in the controversy.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the Public Service Commission may not reduce or
increase rates established in a judgment that has become final, without proper
notice; and that a Commission order reducing or increasing said rates without
such notice is void.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">8. As we look in retrospect at <span class="SpellE">Araneta's</span>
petition for reexamination, we find:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
that <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> was not a party to the original
proceedings below and has no standing therein; (2) that it was belatedly filed
in those cases which are closed; (3) that no provision was made for bringing in
as parties thereto <span class="SpellE">PLDT's</span> competitors; and (4) that
the public - the subscribers most conÂ­cerned - were not appropriately
notified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are compelling reasons
which justify this Court to hold that the Public Service Commission did not
acquire jurisdiction to entertain and hear the petition aforesaid.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prohibition again is the proper remedy.</p>

<p class="NUM">9. One last question remains:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Was the petition for proÂ­hibition prematurely filed before this Court?</p>

<p class="BODY">It is well to recall here that on <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="2">February 16, 1965</st1:date>, petiÂ­tioner filed a motion to dismiss
the petition for suspension of rates.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This motion was planted, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
upon the ground that the judgment increasing rates was final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The CommisÂ­sion overruled said motion on <st1:date year="1965" day="22" month="2">February 22, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's motion to reconsider dated <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="3">March 3, 1965</st1:date> suffered the same
fate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Medina's resolution of
March 5, 1965 on this point invoked the Commission's power, on mere motion,
"to amend, modify or even to revoke any order" of the Commission - in
the same proceedings where the rates were fixed - in spite of the fact that
such order has acquired the status of finality.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the question of the Commission's power, respondent ComÂ­missioner
stood firm; he confirmed his stand in his return to the present petition for
prohibition before this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming now to the petition for reexamination of rates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, as in the petition for suspension,
petitioner urged in its opposition that reexamination could not be had in the
same proceedings for the reason, amongst others, that judgment thereon had
become final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, in the
motion of <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="3">March 3, 1965</st1:date>
referred to in the preceding paragraph, PLDT <u>also</u> sought "immediate
resolution of grounds to dismiss" <u>both</u> the suspension and <u>reexamination</u>
petitions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order of March 5, as
aforesaid, shunted aside this motion, instead set the petitions for
hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the issue of the CommisÂ­sion's
power was thus squarely met and decided by respondent Commissioner, there is no
necessity to reopen that question.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the circumstances, to require petitioner to further press the
dismissal of the petition for reexamination of rates, would be but an act of
supererogation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely enough, the law does
not exact useless ceremony.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prohibition is proper.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>For the reasons given,</b> the prayer for prohibition is
granted, the corresponding writ will issue, and respondent Enrique Medina,
Commissioner of the Public Service ComÂ­mission, is hereby ordered to desist
from further hearing <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> University's petition
