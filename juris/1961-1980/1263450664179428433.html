Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. of the P.I.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and Andres <span class="SpellE">Bonifa­cio</span> in the Court of First Instance
of <span style="">Manila as a </span>con­sequence of a
collision, on <st1:date month="5" day="10" year="1958">May 10, 1958</st1:date>,
involving the car of <span class="SpellE">Placido</span> Ramos and a
tractor-truck and trailer of PEPSI-COLA.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said car was at the time of the collision driven by <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span>
Ramos, son and co-plaintiff of <span class="SpellE">Placido</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>PEPSI-COLA's tractor-truck was then driven by
its driver and co-defendant Andres <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the Court of First Instance rendered judgment on <st1:date month="4" day="15" year="1961">April 15, 1961</st1:date>, finding <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> negligent and declaring that PEPSI-COLA had not
sufficiently proved its having exercised the due diligence of a good father of
a family to prevent the damage.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>PEPSI-COLA and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>, <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span>,
were ordered to pay the plaintiffs P2,638.50 actual damages; P2,000.00 moral
damages; P2,000.00 as exemplary damages; and, P1,000.00 attorney's fees, with
costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with this decision, the defendants ap­pealed to the
Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said Court, on January 15, 1964, affirmed the trial court's
judgment insofar as it found defendant <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
negligent, but modified it by absolving defendant PEPSI-COLA from liability,
finding that, contrary to the plain­tiffs' contention, PEPSI-COLA sufficiently
proved due di­ligence in the selection of its driver <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs thereupon appealed to Us through this petition for
review of the Court of Appeals' decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And appellants would argue before this Court that de­fendant
PEPSI-COLA's evidence failed to show that it had exercised due diligence <u>in
the selection</u> of its dri­ver in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said point, as stated, was resolved by the Court of Appeals in
PEPSI-COLA's favor, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span> testimony of
Juan T. <span class="SpellE">Añasco</span>, personnel manager of defendant
company, was to the effect that defendant driver was first hired as a member of
the bottle crop in the production department; that when he was hired as a
driver, 'we had size<span style=""> [sic]</span> him
by looking into his background, asking him to submit clearances, previous
experience, physical examination and later on, he was sent to the pool house to
take the usual driver's examination; con­sisting of:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"First, theoretical examination and
second, the practical driving examina­tion,' all of which he had undergone, and
that the defendant company was a member of the Safety Council.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>In view hereof, we are of the sense that
defendant company had exercised the diligence of a good father of a family in
the choice or selection of defendant driver</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of Campo vs. <span class="SpellE">Camarote</span>,
G.R. No. <span style="">L-9147
(1956), </span><span style="">53 </span><span style="">O.G. </span><span style="">2794, </span>cited in
<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> brief, our Supreme Court had occasion to
put it down as a rule that 'In order that the defendant may be consi­dered as
having exercised all the diligence of a good father of a family, he should not
have been satisfied with the mere posses­sion of a professional driver's
license; he should have carefully examined the appli­cant for employment as to
his qualifications, his experiences and record of service.' <u>Defendant
Company has taken all these steps.</u>"<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellants herein seek to assail the foregoing por­tion of the
decision under review by taking issue with the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Añasco</span>
upon which the findings of due diligence afore-stated are rested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it is now con­tended that <span class="SpellE">Añasco</span>, being PEPSI-COLA's employee, is a biased and interested
witness; and that his testimony is not believable.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is rather clear, therefore, that appellants would raise herein
an issue of fact and credibility, something as to which this Court has
consistently respected the findings of the Court of Appeals, with some few
excep­tions, which do not obtain herein.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Stated differently, <span class="SpellE">Añasco's</span>
credibility is not for this Court now to re-examine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And said witness having been found credible
by the Court of Appeals, his testi­mony, as accepted by said Court, cannot at
this stage be assailed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As We said in Co
Tao v.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Court of Appeals, G.R. No. L-­<span style="">9194, </span><st1:date year="1957" day="25" month="4">April <span style="">25, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>assignments of error involving the
credibility of witnesses and which in effect dispute the findings of fact of
the Court of Appeals, cannot be re­viewed in these proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a question to be one of law it must
involve no examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the
litigants or any of them.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
And the distinction is well-known:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
is a question of law in a given case when the doubt or dif­ference arises as to
what the law is on a certain state of facts; there is a question of fact when
the doubt or difference arises as to the truth or the falsehood of alleged
facts.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">From all this it follows that for the purposes of this appeal, it
must be taken as established that, as testified to by <span class="SpellE">Añasco</span>,
PEPSI-COLA did in fact carefully examine the driver-applicant <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> as to his quali­fications, experiences and record
of service, taking all steps mentioned by the Court of Appeals in its decision
already quoted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such being the case, there can be no doubt that PEPSI-COLA
exercised the required due diligence in the selec­tion of <span style="">its </span>driver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As ruled by this Court in Campo v. <span class="SpellE">Camarote</span>, 53 O.G. 2794, 2797:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In order that the defen­dant may be
considered as having exercised all diligence of a good father of a family, he
should not be satisfied with the mere possession of a professional driver's
license; he should have carefully examined the applicant for employment as to
his qualifications, his experience and record of service."</p>

<p class="BODY">It should perhaps be stated that in the instant case no question
is raised as to due diligence <u>in the supervi­sion</u> by PEPSI-COLA of its
driver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 2180 of the Ci­vil Code
provides <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span><u>:<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>The owners and <span style="">managers </span>of an es­tablishment or enterprise are likewise res­ponsible
for damages caused by their emplo­yees in the service of the branches in which
the latter are employed or on the occasion of their functions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The responsibility treated of in this Article shall cease
when the persons herein mentioned prove that they observed all the diligence of
a good father of a family to prevent damage."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">And construing a similar provision of the
old Civil Code, this Court said in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bahia</span></st1:place>
v. <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span>, 30 Phil. 624, 627:</p>

<blockquote>"From this article two things are appa­rent:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) That when an injury is caused by the
negligence of a servant or employee there instantly arises a presumption of law
that there was negligence on the part of the mas­ter or employer either in the
selection of the servant or employee, or in supervision over him after the
selection, or both; and (2) that the presumption is <span class="SpellE"><u>juris</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>tantum</u></span> and not <span class="SpellE"><u>juris</u></span>
<u>et</u> <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>jure</u></span>, and consequently may
he rebutted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It<span style=""> </span>follows necessarily that if the employer shows to the
satisfaction of the court that in selection <span style="">and </span>supervision he has exercised the care and diligence of a
good father of a family, the presumption is overcome and he is relieved from
liability."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As pointed out, what appellants here contend as not duly proved
by PEPSI-COLA is only due diligence in the selection of its driver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, parenthetically, <span style="">it is </span>not surprising that appellants thus confine their argu­ments
to this aspect of due diligence, since the record - as even appellants' brief
(pp. 13-17) reflects in quoting in part the testimony of PEPSI-COLA's witness -
would show sufficient evidence to establish due diligence in the supervision by
PEPSI-COLA of its drivers, includ­ing <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' other assignment of errors are likewise outside the
purview of this Court's reviewing power.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, the question of whether PEPSI-COLA violated the Revised Motor
Vehicle Law and rules and regulations re­lated thereto, not having been raised
and argued in the Court of Appeals, cannot be ventilated herein for the first
time.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
And the matter of whether or not PEPSI-COLA did acts to ratify the negligent
act of its driver is a factual issue not proper herein.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby
affirmed, with costs against appellants.</p>
