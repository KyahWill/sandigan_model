				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On June 4, 1964, <span class="SpellE">Justino</span> <span class="SpellE">Quetulio</span>, et al.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> filed
a complaint before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span>
Norte for recovery of real property against <span class="SpellE">Nena</span> de
la <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span>, et al., alleging <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span> that they are heirs in possession since 1906,
of a parcel of land located at Bo. 23, <span class="SpellE">Sarrat</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, originally co-owned by Vicente, <span class="SpellE">Emerenciano</span>, Simon, <span class="SpellE">Eulalio</span>,
Primo, Rosa, <span class="SpellE">Vitaliano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span>,
all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Quetulio</span>, all of whom are now deceased;
that in May 1948 <span class="SpellE">Nena</span> de la <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span>,
alleged owner of the property abounding theirs, caused her men to usurp the
eastern portion of their land as a result of which they filed against her on
May 19, 1948 Civil Case No. 705 which however was dismissed without prejudice
on June 25, 1955; that on September 2, 3 and 4, 1963, the acts of usurpation
were again committed despite their protests and demands for the defendants to
stop, depriving them of fruits of the land worth P350, causing them P5,000
actual damages, P5,000 moral damages plus P1,000 attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">In answer, the defendants alleged that the land in question was
part of the land formerly owned since 1902 by <span class="SpellE">Anselma</span>
<span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>, wife of <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span>
de la <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the death of the spouses, their heirs - Tomas, <span class="SpellE">Anastasio</span>,
Jose and Elias, all surnamed de la <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span>, possessed
the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the heirs partitioned the
property, Tomas de la <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span> got the land in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nena</span>
de la <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span>, as wife of Tomas and <span class="SpellE">usufructuary</span> of 1/5 of the land and, Feliciano, <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Fresnida</span> and Fe, as
children and heirs of Tomas, then took possession of the land after the death
of Tomas de la <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also claimed that whatever rights
plaintiffs could assert had already prescribed the ten-year period of
prescription not having been interrupted by the filing of Civil Case No. 705,
and asked for P1,000 attorney's fees and P200 litigation fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, on <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="8">August
 31, 1964</st1:date>, the defendants moved for the dismissal of the complaint
on the ground of prescription, reiterating their stand that the filing of Civil
Case Mo. 705 did not interrupt the period of prescription.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs opposed the proposed dismissal - maintaining that
Civil Case No. 705, dismissed in June 1955 without prejudice, interrupted the
period of prescription and later, in a supplemental memorandum, invoking <span class="SpellE">imprescriptability</span> of actions to quiet title.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1964</st1:date>
the Court of First Instance dismissed the case on the ground of prescription
and in support of its conclusion cited <span class="SpellE">Amar</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Odiamon</span>, L-15179, <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="9">September
 30, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court, on <st1:date year="1964" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1964</st1:date>, de­nied admission of
plaintiffs’ "First Amended Complaint".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this denial order and in relation to the
dismissal of the complaint, plaintiffs appealed directly to Us.</p>

<p class="BODY">The reason for the proposed amendment was stated by the
plaintiffs themselves:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To allege by
necessity all the facts and circumstances that arose in Civil Case No. 705, as
the present case is merely a refilling of Civil Case No. 705.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The proposed amended complaint Itself is substantially the same, except that
the cause of action is alleged to have arisen on <st1:date year="1946" day="19" month="11">November 19, 1946</st1:date>, the alleged usurpation described more
in detail and the alleged expenses are raised to P500.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 1116 of the new Civil Code provides: "Pres­cription
already running before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of this Code
shall be governed by the laws previously in force, but if since the time this
Code took effect the entire period herein required for prescription should
elapse, the present Code shall be applicable even though by the former laws a
longer period might be required."</p>

<p class="BODY">At the latest, the plaintiffs’ cause of action accrued in May
1948 as alleged in the original complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The period of prescription started to run from then and clearly, the law
applicable is Section 40 of Act 190 otherwise known as the Code of Civil
Procedure, which provides for a ten-year prescriptive period for actions to
recover title to or possession of real property or any interest therein,
counted from the date of the accrual of the cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The settled interpretation of this provision,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
rightly applied by the lower court, is that "the filing of an action
within the prescriptive period, if the plaintiff desists in its prosecution or [if
it] is dismissed, does not suspend the running of the statute of limitations
and takes no time out of the period of prescription under Act 190." This
is so because Act 190 does not have any specific or express provision on the
suspension or interruption of the prescriptive period by the institution of an
action that is subsequently dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The denial of the permission to amend a complaint that was
dismissed because on its face the cause has prescribed, is not justified where
the allegation of fact upon which prescription was based is sought to be
rectified by the amendment which plaintiff sought permission to make.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The proposed amendment in the present case, however, seeks no rectification of
any fact which would do away with the application of prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the amendment would
establish the cause of action to have arisen even earlier, in 1946, instead of
1948.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, even if the amendment is
admitted, the cause would still have prescribed by 1964, when this present suit
was brought.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed order of the lower court denying
admission of the proposed amended complaint and dismissing the original
complaint, are hereby affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
costs against appellants.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
