Criminal Court (Manila) in CCC-VI-628 imposing the death penalty on the accused
Aurelio Cristobal, Jr., Vicente Duncil and Florentino Valerio, Jr., who were
found guilty of the crime of Robbery with Homicide with the aggravating
circumstances of nighttime, abuse of superior strength and craft, without any
mitigating circumstances to offset the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been established that on December 23, 1969, at about 1:00
o'clock in the morning, a hold-up occurred inside passenger jeepney driven by
Melquiades San Jose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The jeepney was on
its way from Malabon to Sta. Cruz, via Rizal Avenue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the occasion of the robbery, Dominador
Villanueva, a special police officer of the Bureau of Customs, was stabbed and
killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other victim, Mario
Fernandez, survived with a "punctured" wound on the chest.</p>

<p class="BODY">One of the jeepney passengers, Mario Fernandez, narrated the
incident in this manner:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He boarded the
passenger jeepney, which had one passenger, Dominador Villanueva, at Pulong
Duhat, Malabon, Rizal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Four passengers,
namely, the accused Aurelio Cristobal, Jr., Vicente Duncil, and Florentino
Valerio, Jr., together with Canuto Pagaduan, boarded the jeepney near the Venus
Hotel on Rizal Avenue Extension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then
another passenger boarded the jeepney.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The position of the occupants inside the jeepney was as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>an unidentified passenger and Valerio sat in
the front seat beside the driver with Valerio sitting on the extreme right; on
the left side of the jeepney, be­hind the driver, were Pagaduan and the
witness, Fernandez, and opposite them on the right side of the jeepney, and
behind Valerio, were Villanueva, Cristobal and Duncil, Villanueva being seated
directly behind Valeria (Exhs. "1" and "M").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the jeepney passed the traffic light at
the inter­section of Aurora Blvd. and Rizal Avenue Extension, witness Fernandez
was attracted by a commotion inside the jeepney when the victim, Villanueva,
transferred to the opposite seat directly behind the driver, because of an
attempt made by Duncil to grab his (Villanueva's) watch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, he saw Cristobal pulling a knife from
the lower portion of the body of Villanueva and, at the same time, Fernandez's
watch was grabbed by Pagaduan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cristobal
likewise stabbed witness Fernandez on the chest after which all the accused,
together with Pagaduan, fled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Villanueva
then moved in front of Fernandez and fired two shots at the fleeing men.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Villanueva asked to be brought to the
hospital but he expired before they could reach the Jose R. Reyes Memorial
Hospital (JRRMH).</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing testimony was corroborated in its essential details
by the driver of the passenger jeepney, Melquiades San Jose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition, the dri­ver stated that after
the jeepney had passed the Victory Liner Station in Rizal Avenue Ext., Valerio
leaned outside and kept looking towards the rear and he noticed the passengers
at the back, who boarded together with Valerio, elbowing one another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the jeepney reached the intersection of
Rizal Avenue and Samal Sts., Valerio told him to stop, and as the jeepney was
slowing down, Valerio stood on the running board, hung himself on the side of
the jeepney and grabbed Villanueva, the passenger seated behind him, by the
waist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Villanueva immediately
transferred to the opposite seat directly behind the driver, San Jose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Villanueva rested his left hand on the
iron railing behind the front seat, Valerio reached for Villanueva's left hand,
and another hand grabbed Villanueva's wrist watch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The driver sped away and after the jeepney
had travelled some six meters, Valerio and his companions jumped out and ran
away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stepped on the brakes upon
seeing Villa­nueva with blood on his chest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Villanueva then drew his gun and fired two shots at the fleeing Valerio
and his companions.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that the security guard at the Jose R. Reyes Memorial
Hospital reported the incident to the police.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon being informed of the incident, Patrolmen Cesar Arsaga, Rolando
Macabejo and R. Casupanan proceeded to Rizal Avenue Extension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching the intersection of Abad Santos
and Corre­gidor Sts., they spotted four persons trying to hide whenever a
vehicle would pass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They accosted the
suspicious-looking persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Arsaga was
able to take hold of Duncil and Macabejo took hold of Pagaduan, while Casupanan
chased the other two but failed to apprehend them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Duncil was wearing a yellowish polo shirt
with bloodstains.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They frisked both
Duncil and Pagaduan and found in the possession of Pagaduan an Omega wrist
watch with a broken bracelet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They <span style="">proceeded to the corner of Aurora Blvd. where
the crime reportedly took place, which was three or four blocks </span>away
from the place of apprehension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As no
one pre­sent there could give any information about the incident, they
proceeded to the JRRMH to interview Fernandez.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Fernandez failed to identify Duncil and Pagaduan but claimed as his the
wrist watch taken by the police from Pagaduan.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Duncil and Pagaduan were then brought to the police headquarters for
investi­gation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the investigation,
Duncil and Pagaduan identified Cristobal and Valerio as their companions and
informed the police of their whereabouts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Cris­tobal was thus apprehended at about 5:00 o'clock in the morning of
December 23, 1969 at No. 2981 Bagag, Corner Morong, Manuguit Subdivision,
Tondo, Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cristobal readily
admitted his participation in the crime and a Seiko watch was found in a pocket
of <span style="">his </span>pants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From Cristobal's abode, the police proceeded
to Valerio's place at the squatter's area at the back of Greenfield Motel on Abad
Santos, Tondo, Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Valerio
voluntarily went with them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cristobal
and Valerio were then brought to police headquarters for investigation.</p>

San Jose merely testified that he saw a hand snatch Villanueva's wrist watch
but did not identify it to be the hand of Duncil; (b) Mario Fernandez only
witnessed the attempt made by Duncil to grab the watch of Villanueva but not
the actual taking of said watch; (c) as appearing in the sketch showing the seating
arrangement of the passengers in the jeepney (Exhs. "M" &amp;
"I"), Duncil was seated at the extreme rear on the right side of the
jeepney so that for him to have grabbed the watch of Villa­nueva after the
latter transferred to the left side of the jeep immediately behind the driver,
required that he reach across the full length of the jeepney; <span style="">(d) </span>the watch was not recovered from
Duncil although <span style="">he was apprehended
almost immediately after the in­cident; (e) Cristobal, whose statement (Exh.
"F") was given full credence by the trial Court, declared that he was
the one who snatched the watch of Villanueva; and (f) Fernandez was not able to
identify Duncil when the latter was brought before him for confront­ation at
the hospital nor was he able to pinpoint Duncil as the one who grabbed the
watch of Villanueva in his statement given to the police (Exh. "E")
only a few hours after the incident.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As found by the trial Court, however, there was conspiracy among

the actual grabbing of the watch of Villa­nueva.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that Duncil was seated farthest from
Villanueva could not have prevented the former from grabbing the latter's watch
as he (Duncil) could have moved directly in front or by the side of
Villanueva.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Likewise, the fact that the police was not able to re­cover the watch
from Duncil upon his apprehension could have only meant that he had passed the

Fernandez to identify Duncil in the hospital, this could be attributed to the
fact that Fernandez was in pain because of the wound he had received on his
chest, although Fernandez did identify Duncil in open Court.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">3. The accused assail the findings of the trial Court that
Villanueva was stabbed by Cristobal on the basis of the testimony of witness
Fernandez which, they claim, was replete with inconsistencies and un­certainties
in substantial matters as to be unworthy of credence, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) Fernandez testified that he saw Cristobal
in the act of pulling out a knife from the lower part of the body of Villanueva,
somewhere in the abdomen, when the death certificate shows that Villanueva
sustained a stab wound on the chest (Exh. "C"); (b) Fernandez
declared in his statement (Exh. "J") that the person who took his
watch was also the one who stabbed him, meaning Cristobal, whereas at the
trial, <span style="">he </span>stated that the one
who grabbed his watch was Canuto Pagaduan and his allegation that <span style="">he made the statement during the
investigation because he was confused and he wanted to </span><span style="">go </span><span style="">home already; (c) Fernandez declared that Cristobal, together with
Duncil, was presented to him at the hospital for iden­tification when the truth
is that it was Pagaduan, together with Duncil, who was brought by the police </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">the hospital.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Again, we find no merit
in the foregoing contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact
that Fernandez was mistaken with regard to the part of the body, where
Villanueva was stabbed does not affect his main testimony to the effect that
Villanueva was stabbed by Cristobal, considering that the incident was a
startling one and must have transpired very fast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, Cristobal did not deny the
imputations made by Fernandez in his regard but merely claimed that his
statement (Exh. "F") was not given by him voluntarily and that it was
the police who supplied the names of Valerio, Duncil and Canuto appearing
therein.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Regarding Fernandez' statement as to the
identity of the person who grabbed his watch, he explained that he thought that
the person (Cristobal) who stabbed him was also the one who grabbed his watch,
because his attention was on the <span style="">knife </span>and
that the stabbing and grabbing took place almost at the same time.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Be­sides, considering the conspirary among
the accused, the exact participation of each becomes of minimal importance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The error of Fernandez in
stating that Cristobal, together with Duncil, was brought by the police to the
hospital whereas Pat. Arsaga declared that it was Pagaduan, together with
Duncil, </span><span style="">whom </span><span style="">they brought to the hospital for Fernandez to
identify them, is not such as to destroy the credibility </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">Fernandez' testimony in respect of the robbery itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 31.5pt; text-indent: -9.9pt;">4. In support of
their argument that their con­fessions (Exhs. "F", "G" and
"H") were not voluntarily given, the accused capitalize on the
statement in the police report (Exh. "K") that Duncil and Pagaduan
were subjected to "relentless questioning", as, in fact, their
statements were taken several hours after their apprehension, and the failure
of Pat. Brigido de Leos to properly state the order in which the accused and
witness Fernandez were investigated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How­ever,
the fact that the investigation of the accused was conducted in a
"relentless" manner in no wise implies the employment of coercion or
improper methods on them as to make their confessions invo­luntary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Moreover,
while the accused insist that these statements were prepared by the police
inves­tigators and that they were forced to sign the same, yet, they did not
explain the nature of the mal­treatment suffered by them in the hands of the
police investigators other than Valerio's allegation that he was boxed by a
corporal who was a big man.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">Thus,
the trial Court correctly observed:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Valerio, Cristobal and Duncil likewise denied that their
respective statements were voluntarily given.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As has been said before, how­ever, their testimonies on this score, were
given in a timid and hesitant manner which do not generate any belief at
all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, had it been the
intention of the police to implicate all these three accused in this heinous
crime of robbery with homicide, then the statement of Duncil (Exhibit 'H')
would also contain admission of his participation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the fact that Duncil did not like to give
a statement inculpatory to him but allowed to give a statement negating his
liability shows that it is not the desire of the police to get statements from
the accused thru force or inti­midation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is also worth­while to note that the statement of Cristobal con­tained
details which could have been known to him alone and for which the police could
not be much interested, like for example, the breaking into three pieces of the
brace­let of the watch; the throwing of the knife at Samal Street; that the
knife is used for cutting; that the watch was taken from his pants and that one
of those persons whom he robbed kicked him on his hip which caught him by surprise
and that is the reason why he stabbed him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The statement of Valerio likewise contained details that he decided to
stay in the front seat; that Nestor was the one who carried a bladed instrument
and that one passenger fought back, and, therefore, stabbed by Nestor and they
all ran away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Settled is the rule that
where the confession is rich in details about which the <span style="">police authorities could not be much interested and which could have
been known to the declarant alone, the con</span>clusion is that no pressure
was brought to bear on the appellants and their ad­missions were voluntary
(People vs. Baquiño alias Mirong, <span style="">G.R. </span>No.
L-390, Phil. March 5, 1961)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As to the failure of Pat. de Leos to <span style="">correctly </span>state the order in which the accused were <span style="">investigated, </span>the same does not imply
involuntariness on the part of the accused, nor is it of crucial
importance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said police officer could
not be expected to remember such <span style="">a
minor detail after more than a month from investigation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->In finding the accused guilty of the crime of
Robbery with Homicide, the trial Court made the following observations:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x x </span>x From the
testimony of Fernandez and San Jose, it is clear that the persons who helped
one another in robbing Villanueva were Cristobal, Duncil and Valerio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appa­rently, to rob Villanueva, the intention
of Valerio was to pin him down first in his seat, hence, he grabbed his waist,
but he failed, as Villanueva was able to transfer to the opposite seat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Valerio still grabbed Villanueva's hand but
failed again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this precise moment,
Duncil grabbed the wrist of Villa­nueva and that was the hand seen by San Jose
in midair with a bracelet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But since
Villanueva was offering resistance, Cristobal stabbed him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The afore­said concerted actions of these
said three accused in robbing Villanueva show that there was conspiracy among
the three persons to rob him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact
that <span style="">these three accused boarded the
jeepney together and </span>ran away together after the happening of the
incident with one Canuto Pagaduan strengthen again the con­clusion that there
was <span style="">Conspiracy among them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the statements (Exhibits 'F' and
'G') </span><span style="">of </span>the two accused,
Valerio and Cristobal, show that they conspired to rob and <span style="">that </span>they actually participated in
robbing Villa­nueva.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that
Cristobal, Valerio and <span style="">Duncil are all
members of the 'Sigue-Sigue Sputnik' as shown by the </span>tatoo on their
bodies gives additional weight to the conclusion that there was conspiracy
among them."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the infallible earmarks of a conspiracy are present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the accused were together in the evening
of December 22, 1969, having a drinking session at the International Cabaret on
3rd Avenue, Grace Park, Caloocan City.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On their way home at about one o'clock in the morning of the following
day, they decided to stage a hold-up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They boarded a passenger jeepney at the same time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Valerio, who sat in front, leaned out­side
and kept looking at his companions who were seated at the back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After Villanueva transferred seats and rested
his left hand on the iron railing behind the front seat, Valerio reached for
Villanueva's hand, whereupon Duncil grabbed Villanueva's wrist watch and
Cristobal stabbed Villanueva.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Immediately thereafter, they all jumped out of the jeepney and ran.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were still together when spotted by
policeman, trying to hide whenever a vehicle would pass, at the intersection of
Abad Santos and Corregidor Sts., about three or four blocks away from the scene
of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Signi­ficant is it also to
recall that it was information furnished to the police by Pagaduan and Duncil
them­selves that led to the apprehension of Valerio and Cristobal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the conduct of the accused
before, during and after the commission of the crime clearly shows that they
acted in concert.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>More­over, the fact that all three
accused are members of the "Sigue-Sigue Sputnik" gang, as evidenced
by tatoo marks on their bodies, strengthens a finding of community of design
among them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial Court, therefore,
correctly rejected the claim of Duncil and Valerio denying participation in the
robbing of Villanueva alleging that they immediately got out of the jeepney and
ran away when a commotion broke out inside the jeepney.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused, Valerio and Duncil, further urge that inasmuch as
the stabbing of Villanueva was not part of the conspiracy to rob him, they can
not be held to answer for the death of Villanueva, citing People vs. Pelagio,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
wherein it was held that "where the appellant conspired to commit robbery
and he acted as lookout during the commission of the robbery, but after the
robbery was consummated and as the other conspirators were leaving the scene <span style="">of the crime (and the lookout himself had
fled), they encountered a policeman, whom they killed, the look­out is guilty
only of robbery with intimidation and not of robbery with homicide."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is apparent, however,
that the factual situation therein described is essentially dissimilar from the
case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Herein, both Valerio and
Duncil were still inside the jeepney when Cristobal stabbed Villa­nueva, who
resisted the grabbing of his watch by Duncil as his (Villanueva's) left hand
was held by Valerio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Applicable to the
accused, therefore, is the rule that where the conspiracy to commit robbery is
con­clusively shown by the concurrent and coordinate acts of the accused, and
homicide is committed as a con­sequence or on the occasion of the robbery, all
of the accused are guilty of <u>robo con homicidio</u>, whether or not they
actually participated in the killing,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> unless it appears that they endeavored to

on the occasion of the robbery, and there being conspiracy among the accused,
each one of them is liable for the crime committed by anyone of them,
regardless of the degree of their respective participation in the execution of
the act.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In order to determine the existence of the crime of robbery
with homicide, it is enough that a homicide would result by reason or on the
occasion of the <span style="">robbery and it is
immaterial that the death would super­vene by mere accident pro­vided that the
homicide be produced by reason or on occasion of the robbery inasmuch as it is
only the result obtained, without reference or distinction as to the
circumstances, causes, modes or persons intervening in the commission of the
crime, that has to be taken into consideration."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUM">6. We agree with the accused that the trial Court erred in
considering nighttime as an aggravating cir­cumstance inasmuch as the
conspiracy to commit robbery was conceived only shortly before its commission.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
It appears from the extrajudicial statements of the accused that they decided
on the commission of the robbery only when they were on their way home at about
one o'clock in the morning after a drinking session at International Cabaret at
3rd Avenue, Grace Park, Caloocan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
thus clear that nighttime was not especially sought for, considering further

did not cooperate in such a way as to secure advantage from their combined
strength.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While in the commission of the
robbery, it was not superior strength that the accused took advantage of but
dexterity and speed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere fact of

<p class="BODY">The penalty for the crime of Robbery with Homicide is <u>reclusion
