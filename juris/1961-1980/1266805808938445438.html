<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"That on or about the 7th day of 
December, 1956, in the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Tanay</span>, province 
of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of 
this Honorable Court, the above-named accused conspiring and confederating 
together and mutually helping one another, with evident premeditation and 
treachery did, then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully 
kill one <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> 
by then and there tying his hands and while the victim wan in this position, the 
accused hit him with the butt of their gun, and one after the other the same 
accused struck and <span class="SpellE">thrushed</span> with a <span class="SpellE">balisong</span> on the body of the said <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> until the 
latter died.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"That the following aggravating 
circumstances were present to insure the commission of the 
crime:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">“(1) Taking advantage of superior 
strength;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"(2) That crime was committed by 
armed band;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"(3) That means was employed 
which add ignominy to the natural effects of act<span class="GramE">. "Contrary to 
Law."</span><o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Arrest having been effected on 
<span class="SpellE">Sulpicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> and Marcos 
<span class="SpellE">Castalone</span> only, while the other accused remained at 
large or unidentified, these two accused were arraigned; and they entered a plea 
of not guilty, and trial proceeded against them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After due hearing, the trial 
proceeded against them. Gustavo <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span>, Judge, 
rendered s decision dated 16 November 1957, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In view of the foregoing 
considerations, the Court finds the accused <span class="SpellE">Sulpicio</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Tica</span> guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of 
murder, as charged in the information* and sentences him to life imprisonment, 
with the accessories of the Jaw, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Traquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> in the amount of 
P6.000.00 without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency due to the 
nature of the principal penalty imposed upon him, and to pay one-half of the 
costs of this action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"It appearing that the guilt of 
the accused Marcos <span class="SpellE">Castalone</span> has not been established 
beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution, the Court acquits him of the 
charges, with 1/2 of the costs de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"It is so 
ordered."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Counsel for accused <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> presented a motion to reconsider the above decision; 
but while said motion was pending resolution, said accused personally filed his 
notice of appeal. The trial court denied the motion and gave due course to his 
appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Subsequent to the promulgation of 
the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> decision, Accused Romeo Paz alias 
Commander <span class="SpellE">Romy</span>, was apprehended. He was immediately 
arraigned, and he pleaded not guilty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On 8 April 1958 counsel for 
accused Paz presented a motion to quash the information on the ground that the 
offense charged therein was allegedly committed by said accused in the course of 
his rebellious activities as a <span class="SpellE">Huk</span>; hence, said 
accused should be prosecuted for the crime of rebellion only, and not of murder. 
This motion was opposed by the Fiscal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The trial court denied said 
motion. Paz moved to reconsider said order of denial, but the same was likewise 
denied; hence, trial against said accused was commenced and 
terminated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The trial court, presided by Hon. 
Cecilia <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> Palma, Judge, rendered a judgment dated 
</span><st1:date month="10" day="27" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">27 October 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
<span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of which is quoted below, to 
wit<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In view of the above 
considerations, this Court finds the accused Romeo Paz Guilty beyond reasonable 
doubt of the crime of Murder as charged with no mitigating or aggravating 
circumstance to modify his criminal liability, and pursuant to the provisions of 
Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, hereby imposes upon said accused the 
penalty of Life Imprisonment with the corresponding accessory penalties provided 
for by law, and orders him to indemnify the heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> in the amount 
of P6,000.00 without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay 
the proportionate costs. Accused shall be credited with one-half of such 
preventive imprisonment as he may have suffered by reason of this 
case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"So 
ordered."</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">A motion to reconsider the above 
decision having been denied, accused Paz also appealed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">At the separate trial of accused 
<span class="SpellE">Tica</span> and <span class="SpellE">Castalone</span>, the 
evidence for the prosecution showed that sometime in the year 1953 <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> and his wife, 
<span class="SpellE">Narcisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Tadong</span>, stayed in 
the house of accused <span class="SpellE">Sulpicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> situated in the mountains of <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pinagsibiran</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tanay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>; that in the same 
year and place the spouses met <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> Commanders <span class="SpellE">Romy</span> and Garcia when their land was surveyed and often met 
the <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> Commanders whenever they asked food from <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span>; that sometime in the months of March and April, 
1956, while the <span class="SpellE">Dayrits</span> were staying in <span class="SpellE">Tica's</span> house, accused <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> 
proposed to the <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> Commanders and their <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> companions to liquidate suspected army informers, among 
whom were the <span class="SpellE">Dayrits</span>, which conversation was Reported 
to the army authorities; that sometime in July, 1956 <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> denounced accused <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> as a 
<span class="SpellE">Huk</span> and his <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> activities 
to the 19th BCT in Sta. Maria, Lacuna; that about a week before 7 December 1956 
accused <span class="SpellE">Tica's</span> <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> ate 
the rice plants of <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span>; that <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> got angry with <span class="SpellE">Tica</span>; that 
accused <span class="SpellE">Tica</span>, his father and brother went to <span class="SpellE">Dayrit's</span> place carrying <span class="SpellE">boloes</span> and 
challenging <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> to go out of his house; and that 
because of this quarrel <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> lodged a complaint 
against the <span class="SpellE">Ticas</span> in the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> office in <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, the investigation of which was scheduled for 19 
December 1956.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">That in December, 1956 the <span class="SpellE">Dayrits</span> used to stay in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Pinagsibiran</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tanay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, where they had a house neighboring that of accused 
<span class="SpellE">Tica's</span>; that at about 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon of 
6 December 1956, <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> Commanders <span class="SpellE">Romy</span> and Garcia, some other <span class="SpellE">Huks</span>, 
and the accused <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> and <span class="SpellE">Castalone</span> went to their house and asked for <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> from <span class="SpellE">Narcisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Tadong</span>; that upon being told that he (<span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span>) was not at home, for he was then in Manila, they 
inquired what time he will arrive, to which <span class="SpellE">Tadong</span> 
replied that he might come that day or the following day; that the group left 
and retired for the night at accused <span class="SpellE">Tica's</span> 
house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">That at about 9:00 o'clock in the 
morning of the next day, 7 December 1956, the same group of men came back to 
<span class="SpellE">Dayrit's</span> place; that when the group arrived <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> was in front of their house cutting grass; that 
accused <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> and <span class="SpellE">Castalone</span> 
stationed themselves outside the fence along the road while the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> approached <span class="SpellE">Tadong</span> from whom 
they again inquired as to the whereabouts of her husband; that as <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> was already seen by the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> she pointed him (<span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span>) out 
to them and told <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> that there were persons 
looking for him; that <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> instructed his wife to 
allow the men to enter; that <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> went up to his 
house, followed by <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> Commander <span class="SpellE">Romy</span> and some <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> companions, 
while four other <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> remained in the ground; that 
once they were inside the house the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> told <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> that <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> is calling for 
him and he (<span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span>) will have to accompany them to the 
headquarters of the BCT in <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span> to settle the 
matter; that <span class="SpellE">Tadong</span> confirmed the presence of <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> as he was waiting in the road; that <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> was seemingly unwilling to go with the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> for he seated himself, removed his eye-glasses, and got 
a towel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">At this juncture, the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> hogtied <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> with a piece 
of big rattan, dragged him out of the house, and brought him to the road where 
accused <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> and <span class="SpellE">Castalone</span> 
were waiting; that before leaving the house, the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> 
took rice, <span class="SpellE">clothings</span> and shoes, and even warned <span class="SpellE">Tadong</span> and her son, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span>, not to leave the house, otherwise they will be 
killed; that <span class="SpellE">Tadong</span> and her son followed the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> to see what they will do with <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span>; that upon reaching the road the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> surrounded <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span>, then 
pulled him to a grassy place along the road and hit him with the butts of their 
guns; that Commander <span class="SpellE">Romy</span> pulled out his knife and 
began stabbing <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> on his neck, after which he 
handed the same knife to accused <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> who also stabbed 
<span class="SpellE">Dayrit's</span> neck, followed by the other <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> who took turns in stabbing <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> until the latter fell down; that the group repeated 
the stabbings on the different sides of <span class="SpellE">Dayrit's</span> body; 
that accused <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> removed the right eye of <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> by means of a "<span class="SpellE">balisong</span>", 
and then <span class="SpellE">Dayrit's</span> lips were pierced and tied together 
with a rattan; that after seeing <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> was already 
dead, the group looked around and left the place; that <span class="SpellE">Tadong</span> and her son also left the place, took another way, 
and went to <span class="SpellE">Baras</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, to 
report the incident to the army authorities; and that the soldiers took the 
corpse of <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The above narration was 
established through the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Narcisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Tadong</span>, widow of the late <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span>. The killing of 
<span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> was also corroborated by <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span>, 7-year old son of 
<span class="SpellE">Narcisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Tadong</span>, who declared 
that his father was stabbed and killed by <span class="SpellE">Sulping</span> 
(pointing to accused <span class="SpellE">Sulpicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tica</span>) in the presence of Commander <span class="SpellE">Romy</span>; that the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> took his 
father and brought him to a grassy place along the road where he was killed; 
that Commander <span class="SpellE">Romy</span> and Commander Garcia also stabbed 
his father; and that he was with his mother when his father was 
killed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The fact of death of said <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> was testified 
to by <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> E. Diaz, Medical Officer of the 8th 
BCT, who conducted, on 8 December 1956, an examination of the cadaver of said 
deceased and found that <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> died of shock secondary 
to hemorrhage caused by the stab wounds inflicted by means of a sharp-pointed 
instrument for which he issued the following medical certificate (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "A"):<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"1. Multiple stabbed wounds on 
the right and left sides of the neck;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">2. Multiple stabbed wounds 
between the scapular regions;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">5. Cut wound on the anterior 
surface of the left forearm."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">And, as additional proof of the 
corpus <span class="SpellE">delicti</span>, the prosecution submitted the death 
certificate of said <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> (Exhibit "C").<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The prosecution also established, 
through the testimony of Capt. Claudio P. <span class="SpellE">Sucgay</span>, 
former Intelligence Officer of the 19th BCT, that on 18 July 1956 <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> reported and 
denounced accused <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> as a <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> supply officer, for which he executed a sworn statement 
Exhibit "B").<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Accused <span class="SpellE">Sulpicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> premised his defense 
on alibi by flatly denying that he took part in the killing of <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> for his 
non-presence in the scene of the crime in the afternoon and evening of 6 
December and the whole morning of 7 December 1956. Thus, he claims that after 
lunchtime in the afternoon of 6 December 1956 he left his house in <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pinagsibiran</span>, bound for the 
town proper of <span class="SpellE">Tanay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, 
to attend to the celebration of the death anniversary of his grandmother, which 
was scheduled for the next day, 7 December 1956; that upon reaching his house in 
<span class="SpellE">Aldea</span>, within the town proper, at around 5:00 o'clock 
of the same afternoon, he dressed up and went to the barber shop for a haircut, 
but he was unable to have it because there were many people waiting to have 
their haircut so he went back to his house where he met and saw many guests 
attending the anniversary celebration, such as Pat. <span class="SpellE">Ponso</span> (<span class="SpellE">Inagan</span>) with whom he had a 
brief conversation at around 8:00 p.m., Dr. <span class="SpellE">Anihin</span>, 
whom he s aw at around 11:00 <span class="SpellE">p.m</span>; and Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Ponso</span></span><span class="GramE"> again at 
about 3:00 o'clock in the dawn of 7 December 1956; that after this second 
meeting with Pat.</span> <span class="SpellE">Ponso</span> he went to sleep and 
woke up before 7:00 o'clock in the morning of 7 December 1956, ate, dressed up, 
and proceeded to the barbershop at about 8:00 a.m.; that while on his way there, 
he happened to walk along with Dr. <span class="SpellE">Anihin</span> until they 
reached the barbershop where they parted ways as Dr. <span class="SpellE">Anihin</span> was going to his office; that as the barbershop was 
still closed he walked around the place where he was approached by the Chief of 
Police of <span class="SpellE">Tanay</span> telling him to go with his father to 
the municipal building to get their subpoena, to which request he gave an 
affirmative reply; that after this brief meeting he proceeded to the barbershop 
where he met Pat. <span class="SpellE">Ponso</span> again; that at around 9:00 
o'clock a.m., while having his haircut, he was again approached by the Chief of 
Police reminding him not to forget to go to the municipal building; that after 
his haircut he fetched his father and went to the municipal building where they 
met Guillermo (<span class="SpellE">Memong</span>) <span class="SpellE">Melendres</span>, a policeman, from whom they asked for the Chief 
of Police; but as the latter had not yet arrived, they waited for him (Chief of 
Police) in vain until noon time, and, as they were already hungry, they went 
home to eat and returned at about 2:00 o'clock p.m. to the municipal building; 
that upon arrival there they were informed by <span class="SpellE">Melendres</span> that the Chief of Police had already arrived but 
was in the second floor; that they waited for the Chief of Police in his office, 
located in the ground floor of the municipal building; that after a short while 
the Chief of Police came, but was not able to attend to them, and told them to 
wait; that at around 4:00 o'clock p.m. the Chief of Police attended to them and 
let them sign the subpoena (Exhibit "I"), after which they went home to <span class="SpellE">Aldea</span>; that before midnight of 7 December 1956 he, together 
with his father and <span class="SpellE">Castalone</span>, were taken by army 
soldiers to the 8th BCT camp in <span class="SpellE">Baras</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, where they were questioned in connection with the 
killing of <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> upon complaint of <span class="SpellE">Narcisa</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Tadong</span>; that in the investigation they denied 
participation in said killing, and after the investigation they were released 
and brought to their homes; that <span class="SpellE">Narcisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Tadong</span> implicated him (<span class="SpellE">Tica</span>) in 
the killing of <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> because he reported to <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> during his lifetime about her illicit relations with 
a certain Mr. Cruz.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> produced several witnesses to support his alibi: 
Reynaldo Vera, who testified that after lunch on 6 December 1956 the appellant 
left his house in <span class="SpellE">Pinagsibiran</span> for <span class="SpellE">Tanay</span> proper to attend an anniversary celebration; policeman 
<span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span> <span class="SpellE">Inagan</span> of <span class="SpellE">Tanay</span>, who claimed to have seen this accused three times, at 
eight in the evening of 6 December, in barrio <span class="SpellE">Aldea</span>, 
<span class="SpellE">Tanay</span>, and again at 3:00 and 8:00 a.m. of 7 December; 
municipal health officer <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> <span class="SpellE">Anihin</span>, who asserted having seen <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> in the night of December sixth and conversed briefly 
with the appellant on his way to the barbershop in <span class="SpellE">Tanay</span> before 8:00 a.m. of 7 December 1956 and again shortly 
past noon of the same day in the <span class="SpellE">Tanay</span> plaza; barber 
<span class="SpellE">Vitaliano</span> <span class="SpellE">Viray</span>, who 
testified having seen <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> at about 8:00 a.m. of 7 
December in front of his barbershop in <span class="SpellE">Tanay</span> proper; 
later told <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> to wait for his haircut because of 
other customers ahead of him; cut his hair at around 9:30 a.m., and during the 
process saw Chief of Police <span class="SpellE">Cautivo</span> tell <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> to go to his office. <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Cautivo</span>, Chief of 
Police, affirmed in court having met <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> around 8:00 
a.m. in <span class="SpellE">Tanay</span> and told him that there was a subpoena 
for him, his father and brother, and again, at around 10:30 a.m., he told <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> at the barbershop not to forget to drop at his office; 
that <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> and the letter's father came at around 2:30 
p.m. and were finally attended to at 4:00 p.m., when they were made to sign the 
subpoena, Exhibit "1", wherein the witness noted "12-7-56 at 4:10 p.m.". 
Policeman Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Melendres</span>, guard at the office of 
the Chief of Police, testified to <span class="SpellE">Tica's</span> having called 
at said office several times, at 11:00 a.m., 2:00 and 3:00 p.m. of 7 December, 
looking for Chief <span class="SpellE">Cautivo</span>, and that accused stayed at 
said office until after 4:00 p.m.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The trial court convicted 
appellant <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> on the strength of the concordant 
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Narcisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Tadong</span> 
and her young son, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span>. The conviction is assailed on the ground that the 
testimonies were improbable and contradictory, and were negated by the alibi of 
the witnesses" of this appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We have gone over the record and 
see no error in the conviction. The discrepancies and alleged improbabilities of 
the testimony of both prosecution witnesses were in matters of detail and, in 
fact, coupled with their lack of education, heighten their credibility rather 
than otherwise, and show that the testimony was neither coached nor rehearsed. 
<span class="GramE">(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Selfaison</span>, L-14732, Jan. 
28, 1961).</span> This court has noted that such differences are due to 
individual variations in observation and memory, and do not necessarily indicate 
falsehood (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>, 86 Phil. 278; People vs. 
<span class="SpellE">Calleha</span>, L-2264, 27 December 1950). The fact is that 
the late <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> 
was killed in broad daylight, and that <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> was 
well-known to <span class="SpellE">Narcisa</span> and her son, being their 
neighbor, so that the possibility of error in identification at the scene of the 
crime is remote (cf. People vs. <span class="SpellE">Quiatchon</span>, L-11109, 30 
June 1958).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellant stresses that <span class="SpellE">Tadong</span> testified that after stabbing <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span>. <span class="GramE">his</span> assailants removed one of his eyes and sewed his lips, 
but the certificate of post mortem examination showed no such lesions. In the 
first place, the post mortem does not appear to have been very thorough: no 
autopsy was made. Secondly, it is common experience, and writers and students of 
Psychology and criminal investigation, like Gross and <span class="SpellE">Munsterberg</span>, have so remarked, that in the excitement and 
confusion that attend the witnessing of startling occurrences, particularly when 
coupled with heightened emotions, it is not rare for excitable witnesses to 
actually suffer illusions that lead them to believe having seen things that 
actually did not happen (cf. People vs. <span class="SpellE">Layos</span>, 60 
Phil. 761). The cruel and bloody murder of <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> by 
an armed band was an event of the type described. Such illusion, however, could 
not have existed with respect to the actual presence of appellant <span class="SpellE">Sulpicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> at the locus of the 
crime, for he was seen even before <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> was seized 
and killed, and, therefore, before the emotions of the prosecution witnesses 
were much aroused. Certainly if, as hinted for appellant, these witnesses had 
been coached by the army combat team officers, in revenge for <span class="SpellE">Tica's</span> denunciation of their excesses, the officers would 
not have allowed such gross errors to creep into the testimony for the 
prosecution. It is noteworthy that the stories of <span class="SpellE">Narcisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Tadong</span> and her son were 
scrutinized and believed by two different judges, who separately tried 
accused-appellants <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> and Paz. Their belief must be 
accorded great weight, and, under the circumstances, the faults stressed by the 
defense do not justify total discarding of the incriminating 
testimony.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This Court has repeatedly ruled 
that oral evidence of alibi can not prevail over positive identification of the 
accused by witnesses who saw them at the scene of the crime and who could not be 
mistaken because the accused was well-known to them (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Quiatchon</span>, supra; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Sabuero</span>, 108 Phil. 74; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Divinagracia</span>, 13 April 1959. In the case at bar, there are 
details to support the trial court's rejection of <span class="SpellE">Tica's</span> alibi. With the sole exception of Reynaldo Vera, who 
saw Ties once at noon of 6 December (the day preceding that of the killing), it 
is an incredible coincidence that each and all of the other alibi witnesses 
should have met appellant <span class="SpellE">Tica</span>, not once or twice, as 
might be expected, but three times in less than twenty-four hours, from the 
night of 6 December to the afternoon of 7 December. One of them, <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span> <span class="SpellE">Inagan</span>, even insisted on 
the plainly ridiculous story that he met <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> three 
times, and that every time <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> reported that the 
rooster of the witness, that was in flea's care, had died, and that <span class="SpellE">Inagan</span> in each instance gave the same reply, "what can we 
do?" Then again, Chief of Police <span class="SpellE">Cautivo</span>, while 
carefully noting the time when <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> received the 
subpoena, Exhibit "I", could not show or recall any other instance of subpoena 
service in which he had noted the time in writing. Withal, there are hiatuses as 
to the whereabouts of <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> on the fatal morning, so 
that it can not be safely asserted that it was materially impossible for him to 
be at the scene of the crime, which was only 23 kilometers away. All in all, the 
trial court had reasons to observe that the alibi witnesses might have seen 
appellant <span class="SpellE">Sulpicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tica</span>, but 
not on the date and hour they specified. The court below had special opportunity 
to observe closely the demeanor of the individual witnesses that is not 
available to us, and our review of the evidence does not afford any adequate 
basis for discarding its appreciation of their 
credibility.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Where there is a conflict in the 
testimony of witnesses in a criminal action, these of the defense giving 
evidence directly contradicting that given by those of the prosecution, the 
appellate court, on appeal, will not interfere with the conclusions of the trial 
court concerning the credibility of such witnesses in view of the act that the 
trial court saw them in the act of testifying and observed their manner and 
demeanor as witnesses, unless it is satisfactorily shown that the trial court 
overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied sonic fact or circumstance of weight and 
influence sufficient to induce belief that, if the error had not been committed, 
the decision on the question would probably have been different." (Francisco, 
Evidence, 1964 Ed., p. 1132)<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The judgment of conviction 
against accused <span class="SpellE">Sulpicio</span> should, therefore, be 
affirmed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">With regard to the appellant, 
Romeo Paz, Commander <span class="SpellE">Romy</span>, who was separately tried 
and convicted on the same prosecution evidence, we have the added circumstance 
that said Paz admitted in the sworn statement (Exhibit "B") that he was with the 
group of men who took <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> from his house in <span class="SpellE">Tanay</span>, 
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, but it was his companion by the name of "<span class="SpellE">Hira</span>" who actually stabbed <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> 
while he (Paz) and his companions were surrounding and guarding him (<span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span>). In another sworn statement (Exhibit "C"), Paz 
admitted that he was a member of the <span class="SpellE">Hukbalahap</span> 
organization, and that he was with "<span class="SpellE">Hira</span>" when <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> was killed with 
a bayonet in the mountains of <span class="SpellE">Tanay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">For his defense, accused Romeo 
Paz declared that since 1950 he was a member of the <span class="SpellE">Hukbalahap</span> organization; that he was with the group of <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> who killed <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span>; that <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> was killed 
because he was suspected by the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> to be an army 
informant or spy; that when <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> was killed he 
merely stood as guard to give warning to his companions if any army men 
approached. Paz also admitted having signed the sworn statements Exhibit "B* and 
"C".<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As rebuttal evidence, the 
prosecution presented Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Amable</span> <span class="SpellE">Vicencio</span>, who declared that he issued a subpoena dated 23 
November 1956 (Exhibit "E") in the case of <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> against <span class="SpellE">Sulpicio</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Tica</span>, et al., for Grave Threats; that this subpoena, 
as per return, was received by <span class="SpellE">Sulpicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> on or before 7 December 1956, but that this case was 
dismissed because before any preliminary investigation could be conducted on 19 
December 1956 complainant <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> was 
killed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the instant appeal, accused 
Romeo Paz contends the killing of <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> was done in connection with, or in the furtherance 
of, the subversive movement of the <span class="SpellE">Hukbalahaps</span> or HMB; 
hence, he should be held liable only for the crime of simple rebellion under 
Article 1" and/or article 135 of the Revised Penal Code, and the information 
against him be dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This contention has no merit. The 
prosecution established that the killing: of <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> was motivated 
by the personal or private quarrel which accused <span class="SpellE">Sulpicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> had with <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> during his lifetime, for <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> was asked by the band to "come with us to the PC so 
that your case with <span class="SpellE">Sulping</span> (<span class="SpellE">Tica</span>) would be fixed" (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 
2-3, March 9, 1959). Apparently, <span class="SpellE">Tica</span> utilized the 
<span class="SpellE">Huks</span> as the instrument in pursuing his design of 
killing <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> because of his grudge against him for 
filing a complaint in the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal’s</span> 
office.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">That the killing was in pursuance 
of the <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> rebellion is a matter of mitigation or 
defense that the accused has the burden of proving clearly and satisfactorily; 
The lone and uncorroborated assertion of appellant Paz that his superiors told 
him of <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> being an informer, and his suspicion 
that he was one such, is neither sufficient or adequate to establish that the 
motivation for the killing was political, considering appellant's obvious 
interest in testifying to that effect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This Court has already held 
that—<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"While this Court ruled in People 
v. Hernandez, 52 O. G., 5506 that there is no complex crime of rebellion with 
murder because the latter offense is absorbed by the former, however, 
distinction was made in the care of People vs. Geronimo, 53 O. G., 68 where this 
Court held that if the Wiling is inspired by personal motive such killing is not 
absorbed by the rebellion but may be the subject of separate prosecution." <span class="GramE">(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Rogado</span>, G. R. No.</span> 
L-13025, December 29, 1959).<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The guilt of this accused is 
clear even upon his own version that he merely stood guard while his companions 
stabbed and killed <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span>. His avowed conduct in going 
with the band to the house of the deceased, and standing while <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> was seized, abducted from his house, killed, is 
adequate proof of his participation as conspirator, and of his responsibility as 
co-principal in the murder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; text-transform: uppercase; font-family: Verdana;">Wherefore</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the two (2) decisions,
