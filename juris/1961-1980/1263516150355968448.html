				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">An appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, rendered on October 16, 1962 in its Civil Case
No. D-1367, dismissing the petition for <span style="">certiorari
</span>filed by herein petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of this case are not disputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Tomas B. <span class="SpellE">Tadeo</span>
was charged with <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> in a criminal complaint <span style="">filed </span>on <span style="">April </span>30, 1957 before the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Mangaldan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, where­in
it <span style="">was alleged </span>that on or about
March 27, 1948 petitioner willfully and feloniously, with <span style="">deceit </span>and intent to defraud, made
complainants <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maicon</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> Acosta - herein respondents and <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> - sign a document which he represented to
complainants as the deed of partition that they had asked him to prepare, but
complainants later found the deed to be that of a sale of their land in favor
of petitioner's brother-in-law Francisco <span class="SpellE">Bongato</span> for
the sum of P400.00, and that on <span style="">April </span>11,
1948 petitioner, in conspiracy with his brother-in-law, sold the same property
to Nicolas <span style="">Perez </span>for P700.00,
thereby fraudulently depriving complainants of their land to their damage and
prejudice.</p>

<p class="BODY">After conducting the first stage of the preliminary
investigation, respondent Justice of the Peace <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>
M. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Visperas</span></span><span style=""> </span>found probable cause that petitioner
had committed the crime of which he was charged, and so said Justice of the
Peace issued a warrant for his ar­rest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner was arrested, but he was later released upon his having
posted the requisite bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, respondent Justice of the Peace set the case for
the second stage of the preliminary investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But at the scheduled hearing petitioner,
instead of presenting evidence in his favor, moved for the reinvestigation of
the case, alleging that the criminal complaint <span style="">was </span><span style="">inherently defective
in </span>that it is therein alleged that complainants suffered moral and
exemplary damages in the amount of P5,000.00 when under the law the
determination of the penalty for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> is only the
actual damage suffered by the offended party, and the fact was that the land in
question had an area of only one-half hectare and was later sold for
P700.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion for <span style="">reinvesti­gation was denied by respondent
Justice of the Peace.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the day when </span>the
second stage of the preliminary investigation <span style="">was again set, petitioner verbally prayed the court that he be given
ten days within </span>which <span style="">to file a
motion to quash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Justice of
the Peace, after discussing with counsel for petitioner the grounds upon which
the </span>motion to <span style="">quash would be
based, considered the move </span><span style="">as a
</span>di­latory tactic and forthwith denied the motion to file a motion to
quash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When petitioner's motion to file
a motion <span style="">to quash was denied,
petitioner manifested that he would introduce evidence in </span><span style="">his </span><span style="">behalf at the next
hearing, scheduled for September 7 and 12, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, before </span>the date of the
hearing, petitioner filed a <span style="">petition </span>for
certiorari with the Court of <span style="">First
Instance </span>of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, alleging that
respondent Justice of the Peace committed grave abuse of discretion in denying
both his motion for <span style="">reinvestigation </span>and
his motion to file a motion to quash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
<st1:date year="1962" day="16" month="10">October 16, 1962</st1:date>, the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> rendered <span style="">a </span><span style="">decision dismissing the petition for cer­tiorari, and ordered the
respondent Justice </span>of <span style="">the Peace </span>to
continue with the proceedings in the criminal case against the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From <span style="">said
</span>decision petitioner filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals,
but <span style="">the </span>lower court ordered that
the appeal be forwarded to this Court because only questions of law are involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not find merit in this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In contending that respondent Justice of the Peace committed
grave abuse of discretion in denying his motion for reinvestigation and his
motion to file <span style="">a </span>motion to
quash, petitioner claims:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the
penalty of the crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> is based only on the
value of the fraud, without including the damages that the offended party may
have suffered; (2) that in the instant case the value of the land which
complainants were alleged to have been fraudulently deprived was P400.00, or at
most P700.00, and not the exaggerated sum of P2,000.00 - it being al­leged in
the criminal complaint that complainants had been damaged and <span style="">prejudiced "in
the </span>sum of P2,000.00 the actual current value (market) of the property <span style="">at </span>the time
of the sale, plus moral damages and exemplary damages in the amount of
P5,000.00 <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span>"; (3) that using <span style="">as basis </span>the sum of P400.00 or
P700.00, the penalty imposable would be such that the criminal action had
already prescribed, since the crime was alleged to have been committed on March
27, 1948 while the criminal complaint was filed only on April 30, 1957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is
</span>the stand of petitioner that when respondent Justice of the Peace denied
his motion for reinvestigation and his motion to file a motion to quash, he was
thereby deprived of <span style="">his </span>right
to due process because he was not given opportunity to be heard and to bring
out all his <span style="">defenses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner's
stand </span>cannot be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
pe­titioner asked for <span style="">reinvestigation he </span><span style="">was </span>practically asking the respondent Justice
of the <span style="">Peace </span>to reopen the preliminary
examination that he had previously conducted - which was the first stage of the
preliminary investiga­tion when he had ascertained that a crime had been com­mitted
and that there was probable cause that the accused (petitioner herein)
committed it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was on the basis of his
finding in that preliminary examination that respondent Justice of the Peace
issued an order for the arrest of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is apparent that the purpose of the petitioner in asking for
reinvestigation wag to have the complainants and their witnesses recalled in
order that he could cross-examine them and perhaps elicit from them a statement
of the actual value of the property involved so he could have <span style="">a basis </span>for
setting up the defense of prescription.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is the settled rule, however, that it is not a matter of right for
the accused to confront the witnesses against him during the preliminary examination
prior the issuance of the warrant of arrest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The accused cannot as a matter of right ask that the complainant and his
witnesses be made to repeat in his presence what they had said in the
preliminary examination before the issuance of the order of arrest.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
It <span style="">is </span>discretionary
for respondent Justice of the Peace to grant petitioner the privilege of
cross-examining the witnesses against him in that preliminary <span style="">examination </span>which
is known <span style="">as
the first stage of the preliminary investigation under Section </span>6 of Rule
108 of the old Rules of Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
It was <span style="">after </span>the
petitioner was arrested - as in fact he had filed the requisite bond - during
the second stage of the preliminary investigation pursuant to Section 11 of
Rule 108 of the old Rules of Court when petitioner was precise­ly afforded the
opportunity to present evidence in his favor.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
If in that second <span style="">stage </span>of the preliminary investigation the petitioner could show,
by his evidence, that the crime of which he was charged had already prescribed,
it was within the power of respondent Justice of the Peace to dismiss the
complaint against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not even
have to file a motion to quash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that
he had to do was to call the attention of respondent Justice of the Peace that
as shown by his evidence the proceedings against him should not continue
because the crime of which he was charged had <span style="">already prescribed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner claims that if the reinvestigation that he asked
was granted and he could show that the value of the land involved in the
criminal complaint for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> was at most P700.00,
the crime of which he was charged had already prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This claim of petitioner has no merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even granting that the value of the property
is only P400.00 still the penalty imposable for the crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> under Paragraph 3, Article 315 of the Revised Penal
Code, <span style="">is <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span>
<u>mayor</u> </span>in its maximum period to <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">prision</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span></span>
in its minimum period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 90 of the
same Code provides that "Those (crimes) punishable by <span style="">a </span>correctional
penalty shall prescribe in ten years; with the exception of those punishable by
<span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span> <u><span style="">mayor</span></u><span style="">, </span>which
shall prescribe in five years." When the penalty fixed by law is a
compound one, the higher penalty is made the basis in determining whether the
crime has prescribed or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as
in the instant case the imposable penalty of the crime of which peti­tioner is
charged - even if the value of the land involved is only P400.00 - is a
compound one, that <span style="">is, </span><span class="SpellE"><u>ar</u><u><span style="">resto</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">mayor</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">in
its </span><span style="">maximum
period to </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">prision</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span>
</span><span style="">in its
minimum period, the higher penalty being </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">correccional</span></u></span><span style="">, </span><span style="">the crime prescribes in ten years.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It appearing that

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We agree with the

second stage of the preliminary investigation when he would have the
