respondents-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> moved for the dismissal of the
appeal on the ground that the brief of petitioners-appellants "makes no
specific assignment of errors and does not contain any page references to the
record as required by the rules * * *." In support of such a motion to
dismiss, respondents-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> state that the
requirement for an assignment of error under the Rules of Court as well as the
provisions on a statement of the case and a statement of facts "are not
mere ornaments in the brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are
intended to expedite the business of the appellate court, aid the justices in the
investigation of the matters submitted, and facilitate prompt and orderly
disposition of cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They must,
therefore, be complied with if not strictly - at least substantially."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners-appellants, having been given an opportunity to
comment on the above motion to dismiss, filed their opposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"When the appellants brought the original case of certiorari with
the lower court, the same was decided on the sole question of whether or not
the Motion for Reconsideration of appellants filed with the city court was <u><span style="">pro</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>forma</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the
trial court rendered judgment against appellants, the latter elevated their
case to this Court raising the same and only legal question as put up by them
in the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having in mind
therefore the rules of brevity as the primordial element in a brief, the
appellants did not find it necessary to include an assignment of error in their
brief, for the simple reason that there is only a single issue raised thereof
as indicated in the heading 'Arguments'.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The appellants respectfully maintain that their brief has substantially
complied with the requirements of the New Rules of Court."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">If the question presented
by the appeal were substantial and the alleged error into which respondent
Judge was alleged to have fallen in dismissing the appeal on the ground that
the motion for reconsideration is <u>pro</u> </span><u><span style="">forma</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">manifest, then perhaps the above opposition
would be persuasive and the motion to dismiss appeal denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such is not the case however.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The five-page brief
submitted on </span><st1:date year="1967" day="22" month="9"><span style="">September 22, 1967</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>by petitioners-appellants was
deficient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not have as appendix,
the decision of the court below questioned in this petition for
certiorari.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only after counsel for
petitioners-appellants was reminded of his duty to do so and after 18 days from
receipt of the brief was there such compliance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A perusal of both brief and the lower court decision leads to the conclu­sion
that the appeal is devoid of merit and should be dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">No effort of persuasive character was made in the brief of
petitioners-appellants to show that the City Court of Manila in holding that
the motion for reconsideration was <u>pro</u> <u><span style="">forma</span></u><span style=""> </span>acted
illegally, much less arbitrarily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
understandable why.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the order of the
Court of First Instance of Manila, where a petition for certiorari, mandamus
and prohibition was filed to test the validity of the action taken by the city
court in holding the motion for reconsideration <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u>, such
motion was carefully scrutinized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
two grounds on which it was based, namely, lack of previous notice to the
defendants, petitioners-appellants herein to vacate, this being an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case, and non-payment of rentals as consti­tuting
a ground for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> there being an alleged <span class="SpellE">condonation</span> of their unpaid rentals in arrears, were duly
considered.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As to the defense of
non-payment of rentals which was reiterated in the motion for reconsideration,
the decision </span>of the Court of First Instance appealed from stated the
follow­ing:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Defendants pretend
that they were not given notice to vacate the premises before plaintiff filed
the complaint for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> against them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears, however, that due notice was
served upon them as early as February of 1966, but that they refused to receive
the same, hence plaintiff wrote to them, inviting them to an amicable conference
in its office, which they attended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
they did not refute, which shows to the satisfaction of the Court that there
was indeed notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is, therefore,
bad faith on the part of petitioners, hence they cannot now be heard to invoke
lack of notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They refused to receive
the notice, and they refuse to acknowledge the fact of notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No person is entitled to profit from his
wrong act of commission or omission."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Concerning the defense of <span class="SpellE">condonation</span>,
this is what appears in the lower court decision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Now, respecting this alleged <span class="SpellE">condonation</span> of unpaid rents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants-petitioners allege that plaintiff
condoned their unpaid rents, therefore it is now in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
to invoke nonpayment of rent as ground for their <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is untenable because there is no proof
of <span class="SpellE">condonation</span>, and even if true, it would only show
gracious <span class="SpellE">condonation</span> of debt which defendants could
not or would not pay anyway in the light of this action, and it is preposterous
and revolting to good human conscience for the defendants-petitioners <span style="">now </span>to turn around and blame plaintiff
for its liberality to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortcoming
deserved no premium, and good deeds are inflicted punitive action."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">What other conclusion can there be in the light of the above than
to hold such a motion for reconsideration as being <u><span style="">pro</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>forma</u>
as set forth in the decision of the lower court dis­missing this petition for
certiorari now on appeal to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Clearly, there is nothing to it, no material allegation of any
essence to persuade a reasonable judicial mind to change its decision, for the
two pretended grounds of lack of notice and of supposed <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
through <span class="SpellE">condonation</span> of unpaid rent, lack merit.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">When a motion for new
trial or for a reconsideration may be considered as <u>p</u></span><u><span style="">ro</span></u><span style=""> <u>forma</u>, has been aptly discussed in former Chief Justice Moran's
work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"For this reason, where a motion for a
new trial is filed under the third paragraph of </span>the preceding section
and fails to 'point out specifically the findings or conclusions of the
judgment which are not supported by the evidence or which are contrary to law,
making express reference to the testimonial or documentary evidence or to the
provisions of law alleged to be contrary to such findings or conclusions,' it
shall be treated as a motion <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u> intended merely to delay
the proceedings and it shall not interrupt or suspend the period of time for
the perfection of an appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
where the motion for reconsideration was based on a claim that the finding of
the trial court as to the authenticity of the disputed signature was not
justified by the evidence submitted, which is the testimony of the expert
witness denying such authenticity, it was held that the motion <span style="">points out sufficiently why the finding of
the court is not justified by the evidence, and is not a <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u>
motion hence it suspends the period for perfecting an appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rules has been liberalized in a recent
case where a motion for reconsideration pointed out specifically the findings
of the trial court that were not supported by evidence but without making
express reference to such evidence, but it also pointed out the conclusions
which were contrary to law reserving his right to submit written or oral
argument; our Supreme Court considered that the motion was a substantial
compliance with the rule."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners-appellants would invoke the two cases cited by former
Chief Justice Moran, <span class="SpellE">Elnar</span> v. <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
and <span class="SpellE">Ylanan</span> v. Mercado.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Neither case strengthens what is inherently a groundless appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the <span class="SpellE">Elnar</span> case,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
the motion for reconsideration points two errors allegedly committed by the
trial court, one on a question of fact and another on a question of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the former, petitioner pointed out the
findings or conclusions by the court which in his opinion "are not
supported by the evidence, although he does not make any express reference to
such evidence, and as to the latter, he also points specifically the findings
or conclusions which, in his opinion are contrary to law." Moreover, there
was a reservation of his right to submit written or oral argument to
substantiate his motion within such period of time as the trial court might
grant him, a request which was ignored by the court denying outright his motion
for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances,
this Court held:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"We believe that
the above averments when considered in the light of the de­cision on the merits
may be considered substantial compliance with the rule and may come under the
exception pointed out by former Chief Justice Moran.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here is where we may properly apply the
principle that the rules shall be liberally construed in order to promote the
interest of justice."</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Ylanan</span> v. Mercado,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
the opinion likewise made clear, why unlike in this case, the motion for
reconsideration could not rightly be considered <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the opinion penned by the then
Justice Labrador:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The only ques­tion
at issue in this Court is whether the motion for recon­sideration filed in the
municipal court is a <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u> motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question must be decided in the
negative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion was based on the
claim that the finding of the trial court as to the authenticity of the
disputed signature to Exhibit A was not justified by the evidence submitted,
which is the testimony of the expert witness denying such authenticity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a motion which points out why the
finding of the court is not justified by the evidence, and is clearly not a <u>pro</u>
<u>forma</u> motion for new trial or reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of First Instance erred in holding
that it did not suspend the period for perfecting the appeal."</p>

<p class="BODY">All relevant matters having been brought to the attention of this
Court and the brief for petitioners-appellants having been accorded the weight,
or lack of it, which it deserves and there being a motion to dismiss appeal,
based on Section 16 of Rule 46 of the Rules of Court made applicable to this
Court by Section 1, Rule 56, which has not been followed, there is more than
sufficient justification for the final disposition of this litigation.</p>
