<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">These are two (2) original 
actions for certiorari and mandamus against the Court of Appeals and Madrigal 
&amp; Co., Inc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The records show that petitioner 
J. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> had filed Civil Cases Nos. 37327 
and 40703 of the Court of First instance of Manila against respondent, Madrigal 
&amp; Co., Inc., for the recovery of damages resulting from the destruction 
caused in an orchard of <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, in Las <span class="SpellE">Pi√±as</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, by several fires 
that had allegedly crept into said property from the adjoining orchard of 
Madrigal; that, after a joint hearing of said two (2) cases, decision was, in 
due course, rendered therein sentencing Madrigal to pay to <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, by way of damages, the aggregate sum of P24,996.00, 
with interest thereon at the legal rate, from the date of the filing of the 
action until fully paid, and , the costs; that a reconsideration of said 
decision having been denied, Madrigal filed the corresponding notice of appeal, 
appeal bond and record on appeal, which was approved by the trial court; that 
the appeals were thereafter docketed in the Court of Appeals as CA-G.R. Nos. 
35044-R and 35045-R; that, after the submission of the printed record on appeal 
and of the briefs of both parties therein, <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> 
filed in the Court of Appeals a motion to dismiss the appeal, upon the ground 
that, in violation of Rule 41, Section 6, of the present Rules of Court, 
Madrigal's records of appeal did not contain "such data as will show that the 
appeal was perfected on time;" that said motion to dismiss the appeal was 
eventually denied by the Court of Appeals; that the same, likewise, denied a 
motion to reconsider the action it had thus taken; and that, thereupon, <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> commenced these actions for certiorari and mandamus, 
to set aside the resolutions of the Court of Appeals denying his aforementioned 
motion to dismiss the appeal and motion for 
reconsideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">By resolution dated 
</span><st1:date month="7" day="5" year="1966"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 5, 
1966</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, we, 
at first, dismissed the petitions filed by <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> 
with this Court, "without prejudice, to action, if any, in the Court of 
Appeals." However, on motion for reconsideration filed by <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, we set aside said resolution and gave due course to 
the petitions, as well as required respondent to answer 
thereto.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In its answer, Madrigal does not 
deny that its records on appeal in the basic cases do not comply with the 
aforementioned requirement of the Rules of Court. It, however, maintains that 
said records on appeal had been actually perfected within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period; that such fact had been proven to the 
satisfaction of the Court of Appeals; and that, under Rule 41, Section 6, of the 
Rules of Court, the Court of Appeals has discretion to give due course to 
respondent's appeals, upon proof of the seasonable perfection of said 
appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This pretense is, however, 
inconsistent with out ruling in Government of the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> vs. Luis Antonio, G. R. No. 
L-23736 (October 19, 1965), in which we held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"That the records of appeal 
submitted to this Court violate the provisions of Rule 41, Section 6, as 
contended by the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, is obvious from an 
examination thereof. Nowhere is it stated therein the date when the appellants 
or their counsel received notice of the appealed order of March 25, 1963 
dismissing their petition for cancellation of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> Certificates of Title and for a resurvey of Lot 
2959-A of the <span class="SpellE">Cuyapo</span> Cadastre.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"It is thus impossible to 
determine from the records of appeal, as submitted, whether or not the appeals 
were taken within the periods prescribed by the rules. <span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The deficiencies pointed out are 
fatal. For the reason that in ordinary appeals the original record is not 
forwarded to the appellate court, and because the dates when an applicant 
received the notice of the pertinent orders or judgment under appeal, and of the 
denial of his motion for reconsideration or new trial, are facts within the 
conclusive knowledge of said appellant, the Revised Rules of Court place upon 
the appellant the burden of showing that his appeal is timely, and for that 
purpose prescribe (Rule 41, sec. 6) that the record of appeal shall include 
'such data as will show that the appeal was perfected on time'. This requirement 
is mandatory and jurisdictional, for unless appeal is perfected on time the 
appellate court acquires no jurisdiction over the appealed case, and has power 
only to dismiss the appeal (</span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Bello</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> vs. Fernando, G.R.

Off.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Gaz</span></span><span class="GramE">., 
1439).</span> The certification of the record on appeal by the trial court after 
expiration of the period to appeal can not restore the jurisdiction which has 
been lost (<span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> vs. de la Rosa, 76 Phil. 428, 433, 
and cases cited). The principle is confirmed by Rule 50, section 1, <span class="SpellE">subpar</span>. (<span class="GramE">a</span>), heretofore 
quoted."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In this connection, it should be 
noted that, prior to the promulgation of the Rules of Court now in force, the 
first sentence of Section 6 of Rule 41, was as follows: "The full names of all 
the parties to the proceeding shall be stated in the caption of the record on 
appeal, and it shall include the order or judgment from which the appeal is 
taken, and, in chronological order, copies of all pleadings, petitions, motions 
and all interlocutory orders relating to the appealed order or 
judgment".<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This Court noticed, however, that 
issues were often raised in appellate courts on whether the appeal had been 
perfected on time or not, owing to the fact that the data pertinent thereto were 
not set forth in the record on appeal. Inasmuch as the records of trial courts, 
in cases appealed by record on appeal, are not forwarded to appellate courts, 
the latter had no means of checking or verifying the conflicting allegations of 
fact made, either in the briefs, or in the motion to dismiss the appeal and the 
opposition thereto, filed by the parties. As a consequence, appellate courts had 
to examine such evidence as the parties may have submitted thereto, in support 
of their respective contentions. This entailed additional work and unnecessary 
waste of <span class="GramE">time, that</span> contributed to the delay in the 
final determination of appealed cases. To eliminate such obstacles to the speedy 
administration of justice, this Court deemed it best, not only to rephrase the 
first sentence of said Section 6, so as to read: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The full names of all the 
parties to the proceedings shall be stated in the caption of the record on 
appeal and it shall include the order or judgment from which the appeal is 
taken, and, in chronological order, copies of only such pleadings, petitions, 
motions and all interlocutory orders as are related to the appealed order or 
judgment and necessary for the proper understanding of the issue involved", but, 
also, to add, at the end thereof, the clause: "together with such data as will 
show that the appeal was perfected on time".<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Obviously, this amendment would 
become useless and its purpose completely defeated, if we gave thereto the 
interpretation advocated by the main respondent herein. In other words, we would 
have the same issues and the same waste of time that were sought to be 
eliminated by the amendment. Hence, our ruling in Government vs. 
Antonio<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> (supra),</span></em> which, it 
should be noted, was made, not in a decision, but, in a resolution, so that the 
public may know immediately - instead of waiting for the decision on the merits, 
which might require more time - the effect of said amendment, and the injurious 
consequences of a failure to grasp its full import could thus be 
minimized.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is urged that said ruling 
should not affect retroactively the cases at bar, inasmuch as the records on 
appeal therein were filed and approved almost one year prior thereto, or in 
November, 1964. We should not overlook, however, the fact that the record on 
appeal in Government vs. <span class="GramE">Antonio,</span> was filed even 
earlier. Besides, the amendment of Section 6 of Rule 41 had been in force since 
</span><st1:date month="1" day="1" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 1, 
1964</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. The 
case cited merely expounded on its meaning, which we hereby 
reiterate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the resolutions complained of 
are hereby set aside, and respondent Court of Appeals directed to dismiss the 
appeal taken in the aforementioned cases, with costs against respondent Madrigal 
&amp; Co., Inc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">IT IS SO 
ORDERED.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
