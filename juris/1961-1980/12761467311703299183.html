				<BR><STRONG>REGALA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>The First National Surety &amp; Assurance Co., Inc. appeals from the order of 
the Court of First Instance of Manila denying its motion to fix liability on a 
bond filed by it in Civil Case No. 17876 of the same court. 
<p>The record shows that on September 28, 1955, the Court of First Instance of 
Manila rendered a decision finding that the minor Maria Lourdes Prianes, one of 
the Pontiffs, is the illegitimate child of defendant Fermin Henson. The 
dispositive portion of the decision reads: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, this Court hereby renders judgment 
in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant, <i>ordering the latter to 
support the herein plaintiff Maria Lourdes Prianes in the mint of P250.00 a 
month beginning June 19, 1952, through her guardian, Ines Prianes, until she 
reaches the age of majority,</i> to pay the sum of P2.000 as attorney's fees and 
the costs of this suit." </p></blockquote>
<p>The defendant having interposed an appeal to the Court of Appeals, the 
plaintiff filed a motion for writ of execution pending appeal. After hearing, 
the trial court issued an order granting said motion "unless the defeated part 
filed a supersedeas bond in the sum of P10,000 within ten (10) days from today." 
</p>
<p>After an extension of time, the defendant and the surety filed supersedeas 
bond, to wit: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE, PRESENTS: </p>
<p>That we, FERMIN HENSON, as Principal and the FIRST NATIONAL SURETY &amp; 
ASSURANCE CO., INC., as Surety are held and firmly bound unto MARIA LOURDES 
PRIANES, Plaintiff, in the penal sum of Pesos: Ten Thousand Only (P10,000.00) 
Philippine currency, for the payment of which well and truly to be made we bind 
ourselves, our heirs, executors, and administrators, jointly and severally by 
these presents: </p>
<p>WHEREAS, the above-named defendant has filed his appeal from the Decision of 
the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch I, dated September 28, 1955, and 
the said Fermin Henson, defendant, was ordered to file a supersedeas bond in 
favor of the above-named plaintiff; </p>
<p>NOW, THEREFORE, the conditions of this obligation is such that if the 
Appellate Court shall adjudge that the defendant has valid ground not to pay the 
plaintiff in the sum ordered by the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch I, 
in its decision in Case No. 17876 dated September 28, 1955, then this obligation 
shall be void, otherwise, to remain in full force and effect." </p></blockquote>
<p>Thereafter, the case which was up for consideration by the Court of Appeals 
was finally decided with certain modification of the trial court's decision-- 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * in the sense that the defendant-appellant be, as he Is hereby ordered 
to pay the plaintiff-appellee a <i>monthly support of P100.00</i> and is hereby 
affirmed in all other respects, without pronouncement as to costs." 
</p></blockquote>
<p>Consequently, a writ of execution was issued against the defendant commanding 
him to pay the plaintiff Maria Lourdes Prianes the amount of P100 a month 
beginning June 19, 1952 until she reaches the age of majority, but specifying, 
however, that the liability of the surety is limited up to P10,000, the amount 
mentioned in the supersedeas bond. </p>
<p>On May 8, 1958, the surety filed a motion to fix its liability on .the bond 
to P4,000, on the theory that since monthly support at P250 fixed by the trial 
court was reduced by the Court of Appeals to P100, the accrued support at the 
time the bond was filed would only be P4,000 instead of P10,000. The motion was 
denied for lack of merit, and motion for reconsideration of such denial was 
likewise denied, hence, this appeal. </p>
<p>The appellant contends that the Court of Appeals' decision reducing the 
amount of monthly support from P250 to P100 should result in correspondingly 
reducing also the surety's liability on the principle that the supersedeas bond 
in this case, as in the case of forcible entry and detainer cases, is only 
answerable for damages down to the perfection of the appeal. According to the 
appellant, at the time of the said supersedeas bond was filed on November 15, 
1954, the accrued pensions from June 19, 1952 the basis of P250 a month, as 
granted by the trial was P10,000. </p>
<p>The trial court's order granting execution pending appeal does not specify 
what was to be covered by the required bond of P10,000. While the said amount is 
not sufficient to cover the amount of support required in its entirety, that is 
up to the time that the minor reaches Majority age (she was only 3 years old 
when the com- Plaint was filed), we cannot say, nevertheless, that the trial 
court, in fixing the bond at that amount, intended it only to secure payment of 
the pensions up to the time of the judgment appealed from. For if such were the 
intention, the same judge who had fixed the bond at P10,000 and who had passed 
upon the motion to reduce the surety's liability would have granted the said 
motion after the amount of support was reduced by the Court of Appeals. The 
matter of fixing the amount of bond is usually left to the fair judgment and 
discretion of the trial court which has jurisdiction over the case, and unless 
this discretion is abused appellate courts do not interfere. </p>
<p>The wording of the bond is such that "if the Appellate Court shall adjudge 
that the defendant has a valid ground not to pay the plaintiff in the sum 
ordered by the Court * * * in its decision in Case No. 17876 dated September 28, 
1955, <i>then this obligation shall be void, otherwise, to remain in farce and 
effect."</i> In other words, the surety obligated itself to pay either the full 
amount of P10,000 or none at all. There is no insinuation whatsoever of any 
other intention of the parties, particularly on the matter of proportionate 
reduction of the surety's liability in case of modification of the judgment. 
</p>
<p>We have to reject appellant's proposal to apply the provisions of section 8, 
Rule 70 (Rule 72 of the old Rules of Court) to the effect that what should be 
considered secured by the bond pending appeal is the payment of rents, damages 
and costs <i>accruing down to the time of the judgment appealed from.</i> This 
provision has been intended only for forcible entry and detainer cases. There is 
nothing in the Rules indicates that it would applicable also to other cases. 
</p>
<p>The general rule on the matter, Section 3 of Rule 39, under which this case 
properly falls, states that the purpose of the supersedeas bond is for the 
performance of the judgment or order appealed from in case it be affirmed wholly 
or in part. Since the judgment here is for the defendant to give monthly support 
to the minor until she reaches the age of majority, and since the total sum 
involved would not be less than the amount of the bond, which is P10,000, it was 
only proper for the trial court to hold the surety answerable on its bond at its 
entire amount </p>
<p>It will not be amiss to state here that at the time the judgment of the Court 
of Appeals became final, the accrued pensions on the basis of P100 a month, plus 
attorney's fees of P2,000, would approximately amounting to P9,000. </p>
<p>PREMISES CONSIDERED, the order appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs 
against the appellant surety. </p>
