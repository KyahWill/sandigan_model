				<BR><STRONG>REGALA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This appeal was &nbsp;originally &nbsp;addressed &nbsp;to the Court of Appeals. &nbsp;&nbsp;For the &nbsp;reason, however, &nbsp;that this case "is one in which &nbsp;the jurisdiction of any inferior court is in issue and the evidence involved is &nbsp;largely &nbsp;the &nbsp;same as the evidence submitted in &nbsp;&nbsp;an &nbsp;appealed civil &nbsp;case &nbsp;within the exclusive &nbsp; jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, &nbsp;within the meaning of Section &nbsp;17, paragraphs &nbsp;(3) &nbsp;and &nbsp;(5) of Republic Act No. 296, &nbsp;the Judiciary &nbsp;Act of 1948," &nbsp;We allowed &nbsp;the endorsement of the same to Us &nbsp;by the appellate court &nbsp;above-mentioned. <p>The relevant circumstances which &nbsp;precipitated the filing of &nbsp;this suit, borne by the &nbsp;records and established &nbsp;by the trial court, are as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>1. On September 27, 1951, Federico Suntay the registered owner of &nbsp;the fishponds &nbsp;in question &nbsp;situated &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;municipality &nbsp;of Hagonoy, Bulacan, leased said fishponds to Virgilio I. Ramos, Maximo Santiago &nbsp;and Graciano &nbsp;Queyquep &nbsp; for a &nbsp;period of four &nbsp;years beginning October 1, &nbsp;1951 &nbsp;up to October 1, &nbsp; 1955.</p> <p>2. On September 29, &nbsp;1951, Federico &nbsp;Suntay signed a promissory</p> <p>note in favor &nbsp;of the aforesaid &nbsp;lessees, as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>"Value Eeceived &nbsp;:.................................................. P30,000.00</p> <p>For value received I hereby promise to pay Virgilio I. Ramos, Maximo Santiago and Graciano &nbsp;Queyquep, &nbsp;or order payable in &nbsp;Quezon City within 3 &nbsp;years from the herein stated date at &nbsp;&nbsp;10% &nbsp;&nbsp;a &nbsp;year. &nbsp;In &nbsp;case&nbsp;of &nbsp;my &nbsp;failure &nbsp;to &nbsp;pay &nbsp;within the said &nbsp;period &nbsp;of &nbsp;3 years, the &nbsp;said &nbsp;amount of &nbsp; P30,000.00 shall be &nbsp;consolidated &nbsp;and &nbsp;&nbsp;considered &nbsp;as &nbsp;additional &nbsp;sura &nbsp;&nbsp;to the consideration with corresponding &nbsp;extension &nbsp;of &nbsp;period &nbsp;&nbsp;of the contract &nbsp;of lease entered into &nbsp;between Virgilio &nbsp;I. &nbsp;Ramos, Maximo Santiago and Graciano Queyquep and &nbsp;Federieo &nbsp;Suntay, Docket No. 217, Book X, Page 4, Series of 1951 acknowledged &nbsp;before &nbsp;the &nbsp;Notary, Apolonio &nbsp;Amancio on the 27th day of &nbsp;September 1951 &nbsp;at &nbsp;the &nbsp;City of&nbsp;Manila.</p> <p>September 29, 1951.</p> <p align="RIGHT">(Sgd.) &nbsp;Federico &nbsp;Suntay</p> </blockquote> <p>3. On October 1, &nbsp;1951, Ramos, Santiago and Queyquep executed an "Assignment of Lease," whereby &nbsp;for and &nbsp;in consideration of the sum of P32,00O.0O Philippine Currency paid to them by the assignee, Fortunato &nbsp;F. Halili, they sold, &nbsp;conveyed, assigned and transferred unto the said Fortunato &nbsp;F. Halili, all their rights &nbsp;and &nbsp;interest to the contract of lease &nbsp; executed &nbsp;by Federico &nbsp;Suntay in their favor for the term &nbsp;of &nbsp;four &nbsp;years, &nbsp;beginning &nbsp;October &nbsp;1, &nbsp;1951. &nbsp;This assignment &nbsp;of &nbsp;lease, &nbsp; according to Suntay, was &nbsp;&nbsp;made by &nbsp;Ramos, Santiago and &nbsp;Queyquep &nbsp;without &nbsp;his &nbsp;knowledge and consent;</p> <p>4. On September &nbsp;28, 1955, Suntay leased the &nbsp;fishponds in question to &nbsp;the &nbsp;herein plaintiffs for &nbsp;a period &nbsp;of two &nbsp;years &nbsp;beginning October 2, &nbsp;1955 &nbsp;and ending October &nbsp;2, &nbsp;1957 &nbsp;&nbsp;for &nbsp;the &nbsp;sum &nbsp;of P32,000.;</p> <p>5. On October 4, 1955, as &nbsp; defendant &nbsp;was &nbsp;then in possession &nbsp;of the fishponds &nbsp;in &nbsp;question, &nbsp; and &nbsp;as &nbsp;he refused &nbsp;to relinquish the possession thereof, plaintiffs instituted &nbsp;an &nbsp;action &nbsp;for &nbsp;unlawful detainer &nbsp;against &nbsp;said &nbsp;defendant in &nbsp;the &nbsp;Justice &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;Peace Court of Hagonoy, Bulacan, which &nbsp;was docketed as Civil Case &nbsp;No. &nbsp;96 of the &nbsp;&nbsp;said &nbsp;court;</p> <p>6. On &nbsp; October 5, &nbsp;1955, &nbsp;Suntay filed a &nbsp;complaint in the &nbsp;Court of &nbsp;First &nbsp; Instance &nbsp;of Quezon &nbsp;City &nbsp;against &nbsp;the herein &nbsp;defendant Halili &nbsp; together &nbsp;with Virgilio I. Ramos, Maximo &nbsp;G. Santiago and Graciano &nbsp;Queyquep &nbsp;&nbsp;(which &nbsp;was &nbsp;docketed as &nbsp;Civil Case Q-1564) wherein &nbsp;he prayed for judgment:</p> <p align="CENTER">"I</p> <p><table align="center" border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="7%"><div align="justify">(A)</div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">Declaring the &nbsp;lease evidenced by Annex &nbsp;A and the assignment&nbsp; thereof as &nbsp;evidenced &nbsp;by Annex &nbsp;B, and plaintiff's promissory note,&nbsp; to be null and void for lack &nbsp;of, or for &nbsp;failure, of &nbsp;consideration, or</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">(B)</div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">Declaring the &nbsp;said lease &nbsp;and the said &nbsp;promissory note to be &nbsp;&nbsp;null&nbsp; and void &nbsp;under Art. 1409 of the &nbsp;Civil Code, in &nbsp;relation &nbsp;to &nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp; &nbsp;provisions &nbsp;of the &nbsp;Revised &nbsp;Election Code; &nbsp;and</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></p><div style="text-align: center;"><br>"II </div><p>In either &nbsp;event, sentencing defendant Halili &nbsp;to pay plaintiff the &nbsp;sum &nbsp;of P64,000.00 &nbsp;for the use and &nbsp;occupation &nbsp;of &nbsp;plaintiff's fishpond which he has &nbsp;held from &nbsp;Octoiber &nbsp;1, &nbsp;1951 &nbsp;to October 1, 1955.</p> <p>Plaintiff &nbsp;further &nbsp;prays for his costs &nbsp;of suit and &nbsp;for &nbsp;such other &nbsp;relief as &nbsp;in &nbsp;the premises he may be entitled &nbsp;to. 7. On January 1, 1956, &nbsp;the Justice of the Peace of &nbsp;Hagonoy, Bulacan rendered a &nbsp;decision in Civil &nbsp; Case No. 96, ordering:</p> <p>"1. The &nbsp;defendant &nbsp;and all &nbsp;persons &nbsp;claiming &nbsp;under &nbsp;him, &nbsp;to vacate the fishponds in question &nbsp;and &nbsp;to surrender possession thereof, to plaintiffs;</p> <p>"2. The defendant to pay the plaintiffs the sum of &nbsp; P2,200.00 a month as reasonable compensation for &nbsp;the &nbsp;use &nbsp;and occupation of the &nbsp;fishponds from &nbsp;October 2, &nbsp;1955 &nbsp;until defendant finally vacates the &nbsp; same, &nbsp;and</p> <p>"3. To pay the costs of &nbsp;the &nbsp;suit. &nbsp;The &nbsp;counterclaim of the defendant is &nbsp;hereby dismissed."</p> <p>8. On May 23, 1957, &nbsp;the &nbsp;Court of First Instance of &nbsp;Rizal, Quezon City &nbsp;Branch, &nbsp;rendered a &nbsp;decision in Civil Case &nbsp;Q-1564, the dispositive &nbsp;portion of which declared:</p> <p>"Premises &nbsp;Considered, the court &nbsp;hereby renders &nbsp;judgment in favor of plaintiff Federico &nbsp;Suntay, &nbsp;by declaring the promissory notes as well as the contract of &nbsp;lease, null &nbsp;and void, as they were executed in violation of &nbsp;Art. &nbsp;1409 &nbsp;of &nbsp;the new Civil &nbsp;Code and Section 48 of the &nbsp;Revised Election &nbsp;Code, and insofar as the claim of damages of both &nbsp;plaintiff and &nbsp;defendant &nbsp;in their respective pleadings &nbsp;are concerned, &nbsp; the &nbsp;court dismisses the same for both are in part delicto, without special pronouncement as &nbsp;to &nbsp;costs.</p> <p>9. The &nbsp;parties &nbsp;in &nbsp;Civil &nbsp;Case &nbsp;Q-1564, &nbsp;not &nbsp;satisfied &nbsp;with the decision above rendered, filed &nbsp;their &nbsp;respective &nbsp;notices &nbsp;of intention to appeal &nbsp;and eventually elevated the ruling &nbsp;to the Supreme Court.1 10. On &nbsp;Appeal of the decision of the Justice of the &nbsp;Peace Court to the &nbsp;Court of &nbsp;First &nbsp;Instance of Hagonoy, &nbsp;Bulacan, &nbsp;the &nbsp;same was reversed and the complaint dismissed. &nbsp;&nbsp;The CFI ruled that the Justice &nbsp;of the Peace could not have acquired &nbsp;jurisdiction over the case and &nbsp;that, consequently, it, the &nbsp; CFI, could likewise acquire no appellate &nbsp;jurisdiction to review the same. &nbsp;In support of the ruling, the CFI said:</p> <p>"After &nbsp;a careful study &nbsp;of the evidence &nbsp;of record, it is our sense that plaintiffs' &nbsp;right &nbsp;to &nbsp;the possession &nbsp;of the fishponds in dispute depends upon the declaration of nullity of the &nbsp;various documents under &nbsp;which defendant bases &nbsp;his right &nbsp;of possession. &nbsp;The basic &nbsp;issue &nbsp;involves not &nbsp;merely the question of possession which 'naturally &nbsp;flows &nbsp;as &nbsp;&nbsp;a &nbsp; consequence &nbsp;of the leasehold &nbsp;right' but also 'the validity of &nbsp;the source of the &nbsp;right of &nbsp;possession.' &nbsp;In &nbsp;order to &nbsp;determine the &nbsp;validity &nbsp;of the leasehold &nbsp;rights &nbsp;of &nbsp;the defendant, this &nbsp;court perforce &nbsp;has to make &nbsp;a judicial &nbsp;pronouncement or &nbsp;finding as to &nbsp;the &nbsp;validity or nullity of the deed &nbsp;of assignment executed in his (defendent) favor as &nbsp;well as the &nbsp;promissory note—the issue involved and/ or &nbsp;squarely &nbsp;presented in &nbsp;Civil Case No. Q-1564 of &nbsp;the &nbsp;Court of &nbsp;First Instance of Quezon &nbsp;City above-adverted &nbsp;to. &nbsp; It &nbsp;is our considered opinion &nbsp;that the Quezon City Court (now the Supreme Court &nbsp; where the &nbsp;case is on &nbsp;appeal) &nbsp;is the proper court that could &nbsp;legally pass &nbsp;upon and determine the &nbsp;validity of &nbsp;the documents &nbsp;upon which &nbsp;the defendant bases his &nbsp;right to &nbsp;possess &nbsp;the &nbsp;fishpond &nbsp;in &nbsp;dispute &nbsp;and not &nbsp;this &nbsp;court or the court of &nbsp;origin for that matter. &nbsp;Until said case is finally decided in favor of &nbsp;Suntay, &nbsp;the &nbsp;defendant &nbsp;cannot &nbsp;be dispossessed &nbsp;of the property in litigation &nbsp;by means of this action.Unless the contract of lease, assignment of &nbsp;lease and &nbsp;promisory&nbsp;note have been finally declared void by the &nbsp;Supreme Court decided that it &nbsp;did &nbsp;not have appellate jurisdiction &nbsp;over the case &nbsp;and remanded the appeal to the Court of Appeals. </p> <p>Court said documents are presumed &nbsp;valid. &nbsp;Undoubtedly, the justice of the peace court of &nbsp;Hagonoy had no power to declare said documents upon which defendant bases his right void. ***." Plaintiffs-appellants &nbsp;take &nbsp;exception &nbsp;to the &nbsp;aforequoted ruling of the Court of First Instance of Bulacan, assigning thereto the following errors:</p> <p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="TOP" width="12%"><div align="LEFT">First: </div></td> <td width="88%"><div align="JUSTIFY">That the &nbsp;trial court erred in finding that the &nbsp;issue &nbsp;involved in this case is not merely the question of possession but also the &nbsp;validity of &nbsp;the contract of &nbsp;lease, the promissory note and the assignment of &nbsp;lease: </div> </td></tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"> Second: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">That the trial court &nbsp;finally erred &nbsp;in refusing to take cognizance &nbsp;of &nbsp;this case in exercise of &nbsp;its &nbsp;appellate jurisdiction.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Third:</div> </td><td> <div align="JUSTIFY">That the &nbsp;trial &nbsp;court &nbsp;finally &nbsp;erred in not &nbsp;declaring the plaintiffs entitled to the possession &nbsp;of the property in question, &nbsp;together with the reasonable compensation for the use and occupation of the same.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></p> </blockquote> <p>We cannot subscribe to &nbsp;the stand taken by the herein plaintiffs-appellants.</p> <p>When the decision of the Justice of &nbsp;the &nbsp;Peace Court dated January 5, &nbsp;1956 was elevated &nbsp;for review &nbsp;to the Court of First &nbsp;Instance, the &nbsp;latter court &nbsp; could have acted on &nbsp;the same only in the &nbsp;exercise of its &nbsp;appellate jurisdiction. &nbsp;&nbsp;The exercise &nbsp;of &nbsp;appellate jurisdiction, &nbsp;however, calls &nbsp;for and demands a previous, legitimate &nbsp;jurisdiction by &nbsp;the court of origin. &nbsp;Unfortunately, this requirement for &nbsp;the proper dispensation of the Court &nbsp;of &nbsp;First Instance's appellate &nbsp;jurisdiction was wanting in the case at bar. &nbsp;It is the &nbsp;Court's considered view that &nbsp;the Justice of &nbsp;the Peace of &nbsp;Hagonoy, &nbsp;Bulacan had no &nbsp; jurisdiction over &nbsp;Civil Case No. 96.</p> <p>The disagreement of the parties in &nbsp;Civil Case No. &nbsp;96 of the Justice of the Peace of Hagonoy, Bulacan extended far beyond the issues &nbsp;generally involved &nbsp;in unlawful detainer suits. &nbsp;&nbsp;The litigants &nbsp;therein &nbsp;did not raise &nbsp;merely the question of who among them was entitled to the possession of &nbsp;the fishpond &nbsp;of &nbsp;Federico &nbsp;Suntay. &nbsp;&nbsp;For all judicial &nbsp;purposes, they likewise &nbsp;prayed &nbsp;of the court &nbsp;to rule on their respective rights under &nbsp;the &nbsp;various contractual documents—their respective &nbsp;deeds &nbsp;of lease, the deed of &nbsp;assignment and &nbsp;the &nbsp;promissory &nbsp;note upon &nbsp;&nbsp;which they predicated their claims to the possession of the &nbsp;said fishpond. &nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, &nbsp;they gave the court no alternative but to rule on the validity or &nbsp;nullity of the above documents. &nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, &nbsp;the &nbsp;case was &nbsp; converted &nbsp;into the determination &nbsp;of the &nbsp;nature of &nbsp;the &nbsp;proceedings from a mere detainer suit to one that is "incapable of &nbsp;pecuniary estimation" &nbsp;and thus beyond the &nbsp;legitimate authority &nbsp;of the Justice &nbsp;of the Peace &nbsp;Court &nbsp;to rule &nbsp;on. &nbsp;Under the Judiciary Act &nbsp;of 1948, as &nbsp;amended, civil actions &nbsp;"incapable of pecuniary estimation" &nbsp;can only &nbsp;be addressed &nbsp;to the original jurisdiction &nbsp;of the Court &nbsp;of First Instance (Section &nbsp;44, par. &nbsp;A).</p> <p>Considering that, as &nbsp;the &nbsp;Court of &nbsp;First Instance &nbsp;of Bulacan expressed &nbsp; it, &nbsp;"plaintiffs' &nbsp;right to &nbsp;the &nbsp;possession of the fishpond &nbsp;in dispute depends upon the &nbsp;declaration of nullity of the various &nbsp;documents under which &nbsp; defendant bases his right of possession," then &nbsp;truly, only the Court &nbsp;of First Instance of Quezon City &nbsp;(now &nbsp;the Court of Appeals) &nbsp;could have legally decided that question for two reason: &nbsp;First of all, the Court of First Instance &nbsp;of Bulacan could not try the case, even &nbsp;if it wanted to, because then &nbsp;it would have done violence to Section 11 &nbsp;of Rule &nbsp;40 of &nbsp;the Rules of &nbsp;Court which &nbsp;says—</p> <blockquote> <p>"SEC. 11. Lack of Jurisdiction.—A case tried by an inferior court without jurisdiction &nbsp;over the subject matter shall be dismissed &nbsp;on appeal by the Court &nbsp;of First Instance. &nbsp;But &nbsp;instead of dismissing the &nbsp;case, the Court of First Instance in the exercise of its original jurisdiction, may try the case on the merits if &nbsp;the parties therein file &nbsp;their pleadings and go to &nbsp;the trial without any objection &nbsp;to such jurisdiction."</p> </blockquote> <p>Pursuant &nbsp;to &nbsp;the above &nbsp;&nbsp;rule, &nbsp; therefore, &nbsp;the &nbsp;&nbsp;Court &nbsp;of First Instance of &nbsp;Bulacan &nbsp;could &nbsp; have &nbsp;tried the case on the merits only had the parties therein filed their pleadings and gone "to the trial without any objection to such jurisdiction." &nbsp;That &nbsp;was, &nbsp;however, &nbsp;a &nbsp;condition which could &nbsp;have &nbsp;not &nbsp;been &nbsp;met &nbsp;for the reason &nbsp;that a party thereto &nbsp;has &nbsp;precisely &nbsp;"objected &nbsp;to such &nbsp; jurisdiction." Secondly, &nbsp;the nullity of the various instruments under which the defendant (herein &nbsp;appellant) &nbsp;bases his &nbsp;right of possession &nbsp;was the &nbsp;sole and &nbsp;very bone &nbsp;of contention in Civil &nbsp;Case No. &nbsp;Q-1564 of the Quezon City &nbsp; Court of First &nbsp;Instance (now Court of Appeals). &nbsp;If the Court of First &nbsp;Instance of Bulacan were to make its &nbsp;own findings on that &nbsp;issue, and, thereafter the &nbsp;Supreme &nbsp;Court &nbsp;laid down &nbsp;a contrary &nbsp;ruling, &nbsp;then &nbsp;the &nbsp;proceedings in &nbsp;the Court of First Instance of Bulacan would only have &nbsp;been rendered naught &nbsp;since, naturally, the Court of Appeals's decision &nbsp;must prevail.</p> <p>One other observation may be pertinent. &nbsp;There is no privity &nbsp;of contract between the appellants and &nbsp;the defendant-appellee. &nbsp;The unlawful detainer case was &nbsp;filed by the herein appellants ostensibly as an assertion of their right under the &nbsp;contract &nbsp;of lease with Federico Suntay dated September &nbsp;28, &nbsp;1955. &nbsp;&nbsp;If, &nbsp;indeed, &nbsp; appellants &nbsp;trace &nbsp;their right to the possession of the fishpond to that lease &nbsp; contract, then &nbsp;We hold that the course of &nbsp;action taken by them was &nbsp;inadequate &nbsp; and &nbsp;essentially &nbsp;erroneous. Under the premises, We believe that they should &nbsp;have claimed their right &nbsp;under the said &nbsp;contract &nbsp;against the lessor, Federico Suntay, and &nbsp;not against the incumbent possessors who themselves had some colorable &nbsp;right to the disputed realty.</p> <p>Under Article &nbsp;1654 &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;Civil Code, &nbsp;the &nbsp;lessor is obliged:</p> <ol> <ol> <li>To &nbsp;deliver the thing which is &nbsp;the object of the contract in such a condition as to render it fit for the use intended;</li> <li>To &nbsp;make on &nbsp;the same &nbsp;during the lease all the necessary &nbsp;repairs in order to keep &nbsp;it suitable for the use to which it has been devoted, &nbsp;unless there is a stipulation to the contrary;</li> <li>To maintain the &nbsp; lessee in the peaceful and adequate &nbsp;enjoyment of the lease for the entire &nbsp;duration of the contract. Under the above-quoted provision of the Civil Code, appellants &nbsp;failure to take possession of the &nbsp;leased fishpond on account of the presence of persons unwilling to vacate the premises &nbsp;because of some previous act or transaction of the lessor, is a breach of &nbsp;the &nbsp;obligations of the lessor "to deliver the thing which is the object of the contract in such &nbsp;a &nbsp;condition as to render it fit &nbsp;for &nbsp;the use intended" &nbsp;as well &nbsp;as &nbsp;of his &nbsp;obligation &nbsp;"to &nbsp;maintain &nbsp;the lessee in the peaceful and adequate enjoyment &nbsp;of the lease for the &nbsp;entire &nbsp;duration of the &nbsp;contract." &nbsp; Consequently, appellants &nbsp;should &nbsp;have &nbsp;instituted an action &nbsp;against &nbsp;the lessor, Federico Suntay, based upon &nbsp;the latter's failure to comply with &nbsp;his obligations under the aforecited Article 1654 of the Civil Code.</li> </ol> </ol> <p>In &nbsp;view &nbsp;of all &nbsp;the foregoing, &nbsp;the judgment &nbsp;appealed from is hereby affirmed in full, with &nbsp; costs against the appellants &nbsp;in all instances.</p> <p><i>Bengzon, C.
