				<BR><STRONG>REGALA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>On July 10, 1956, Cromwell Commercial Co. and the Cromwell Commercial 
Employees and Laborers Union (PTUC) signed a collective bargaining agreement 
which provided, among other things, for the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"3. The Company agrees to consider as permanent employees and workers all 
those who have rendered three (3) months continuous, satisfactory service, and 
as such shall be entitled to all privileges enjoyed by all permanent and regular 
employees; provided, however, that the COMPANY reserves the right to dismiss any 
employee for cause;"</p>
<p>"6. A 'Grievance Committee' composed of three (3) representatives appointed 
by the COMPANY and three (3) UNION members elected by the UNION shall be 
immediately constituted. This Committee shall meet not more than once a week as 
may be called by proper notice of any three (3) members of said committee to 
hear and decide any differences on labor-management relations. The committee 
shall hear the grievance and the witnesses of the parties concerned, if any, and 
shall submit its recommendation to the President of the COMPANY who shall decide 
the same, within thirty (30) days from transmittal of said recommendation by the 
President's representative In the Philippines:</p>
<p>"7. Considering that the COMPANY has put into effect, effective April 16, 
1956, a minimum wage of P140.00 a month to permanent employees in its office and 
has given merit increase to a few others, the COMPANY agrees in principle to the 
demand of the UNION for a general increase of salaries and wages, if the 
financial position of the COMPANY shows that it can afford to give an increase 
after the second quarter of 1956 but reserves its decision as to the amount. The 
COMPANY further reserves its right as to whether to give or not to give 
increases to those who already received merit increases effective April 16, 
1956, provided, however, that those whose salaries were slashed in 1956 and were 
restored on April 16, 1956. shall not be considered as having received a merit 
increase;"</p>
<p>"10. That the COMPANY shall restore all salesmen to the status of salary 
basis effective May 1, 1056 and shall also restore the helpers allowance of 
provincial salesmen effective the same date;"</p>
<p>"12. The COMPANY agrees in principle to consider the giving of a share of its 
profits to its employees and workers, the amount and the time to depend in the 
sale discretion of the management of the COMPANY."</p></blockquote>
<p>However, it appears that, contrary to paragraph 7, the company gave no salary 
increase to its employees, except to three who were not union members, despite 
the fact that it had made a P90,000 profit at the close of the second quarter of 
1956.</p>
<p>With respect to paragraph 10 of the agreement, it appears that salesmen of 
the company used to be paid on a straight salary basis. Some were receiving 
P300, others P320 while still others were getting P350 a month. In addition, 
those assigned to the provinces were given a so-called helper's allowance of 
P120 a month, a <em>per diem</em> of P8 and an allowance for postage and other 
expenses incurred in remitting their collections. For some reason, however, the 
company reduced the salary of salesmen to P200 a month and their helper's 
allowance from P120 to P60 a month, although it paid them a commission of 1 per 
cent of their collections.</p>
<p>This is the reason why paragraph 10, which provided for the restoration of 
cuts in the salaries and allowances of salesmen, was inserted in the agreement. 
But instead of restoring the salaries in full, the company merely paid P300 even 
to those who, before salaries were reduced, were already receiving P320 or P350 
a month. The so-called helper's allowance, which as already stated had been 
reduced from P120 to P60 a month, was not restored at all.</p>
<p>What is worse, effective March 1, 1957, the company reverted all salesmen to 
salary and commission basis, stopped their helper's allowance altogether and 
discontinued the payment of <em>per diem</em> and other allowances to provincial 
salesmen, so much so that the latter found themselves again in the same 
situation they were in before the signing of the collective bargaining 
agreement. Worst of all the company increased the quotas of some salesmen and 
threatened them with dismissal if they could not fill their quotas.</p>
<p>These changes in the working conditions in the company and the latter's 
failure to carry out its part of the agreement became a source of complaint 
among the employees. But beyond promising that the matter would be looked into 
as soon as its President arrived from the United States, the company did 
nothing. The grievance machinery set up in the agreement could not function on 
account of the company's refusal to name its representatives in the 
committee.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, daily wage employees in the shipping department began agitating 
for the application of paragraph 10 to them. In a letter sent to the company on 
March 2, 1957, Jose J. Hernandez of the Philippine Trade Union Council asked 
that these employees be put on a monthly salary basis. He also called attention 
to the failure of the company to send representatives to the grievance 
committee.</p>
<p>Three days after, the company dismissed Francisco Gaddi and Crescenciano 
Andrada, leaders of the shipping department employees. And so on March 7, the 
union dispatched another letter to the company, calling attention to the 
contents of its March 2 letter and protesting the dismissal of Gaddi and 
Andrada. It gave the company 48 hours within which to act on its grievance and 
reinstate the dismissed employees.</p>
<p>On March 6, the company President replied, stating in part that—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * Effective March 1st, I reduced all salesmen's salaries, I discontinued 
the helper's allowance and, in the case of provincial salesmen, I discontinued 
the payment of any <em>per diem</em>s."</p></blockquote>
<p>In another letter sent the following day, the company explained that the 
relief of Gaddi and Andrada was in line with its policy of laying off extra 
employees.</p>
<p>From then on the relation between the company and the union steadily 
deteriorated.</p>
<p>On March 8, the company took back the keys from the warehouseman and ordered 
the salesmen to put their trucks in the garage.</p>
<p>On March 9, the parties met to resolve their differences only to part ways 
later-still poles apart.</p>
<p>Finally, on March 11, the union struck and picketed the premises of the 
company.</p>
<p>The company in turn gave the strikers until 8 a.m. of March 11, 1957 within 
which to return to work otherwise they would be considered dismissed for cause. 
It warned them that the strike was illegal for being against the no-strike 
clause of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p>In a conference called by the Department of Labor, the strikers offered to 
return to work provided the company observed the provisions of the bargaining 
contract. But the company insisted that the strikers could be taken back only 
under the terms of its March 1 order. As already stated, this order reverted 
salesmen to salary and commission basis, abolished their helper's allowance and 
stopped the payment of <em>per diem</em> and other allowances to provincial 
salesmen.</p>
<p>In addition, the company set as price for continued conciliation conference 
the remittance by the salemen of their collections and the return of delivery 
trucks and stocks on hand. The union replied that the strikers had not lost 
their employee status and that at any rate they were bonded. It offered though 
to deposit with the Conciliation Service of the Department of Labor the things 
demanded by the company, but the company was unyielding in its demand. Anyway, 
nothing came out of the conference. The employees gradually gave up the strike 
and the salesmen later settled their accounts and returned the property of the 
company.</p>
<p>On September 19, 1957 this case was filed in the Court of Industrial 
Relations, charging the company, together with its President and Vice President, 
with unfair labor practice. After trial, the court rendered judgment as 
follows:</p>
<p>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the Respondent and all its officers and agents 
are hereby ordered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(1) To cease and desist from:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a) refusing to bargain collectively in good faith with the Union.</p>
<p>b) refusing to bargain collectively in good faith with respect to the 
grievance of the Union by appointing its representatives to the grievance 
committee as provided for in the said agreement.</p>
<p>c) making changes in the working conditions of the salesmen who are members 
of the Union with respect to their salaries and the helper's allowance of 
provincial salesmen without complying with the requirements of Sec. 13 of 
Republic Act 875.</p></blockquote>
<p>"(2) To take the following affirmative acts which the Court finds will 
effectuate the policy of the Act:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a) to reinstate Francisco Gaddi with half back pay from March 5, 1957 to 
actual date of his reinstatement, minus whatever salaries he might have earned 
during the pendency of this case, unless he has found a substantial employment 
elsewhere. And with respect to Cresenciano Andrada, his one half back wages 
shall be from March 5, 1957 until the date he committed illegal acts in the 
picket line. Angel Dario is not entitled to reinstatement.</p>
<p>b) to reinstate salesmen Antonio Jacinto, Celestino Gualberto, Constantino 
Atienza, Elias Berroya, and Pedro del Rosario with half backwages from the date 
they have cleared their accountabilities or responsibilities with the Company, 
minus what they have earned during the pendency of the dispute unless they have 
found substantial employment elsewhere. The case of Teofilo Nunez is dismissed 
as heretofore indicated. With respect to Roberto Dijamco as also mentioned, 
there is a pending separate unfair labor practice in the Court (Case No. 
1271-ULP).</p>
<p>c) To reinstate all the strikers listed in Annex 'A' of the complaint, 
without backwages, in view of the circumstances, as explained on the subject of 
the strike, unless they have found substantial employment elsewhere during the 
pendency of this case.</p></blockquote>
<p>"In addition, respondent is hereby ordered to post a copy of this order in 
the company's bulletin board, if any or in default thereof, in any conspicuous 
place at company's premises and report to the Court as soon as possible its 
compliance."</p></blockquote>
<p>The union moved for a reconsideration of the decision, contending that the 
trial judge erred (1) in awarding only half back wages to Francisco Gaddi and 
the five salesmen, (2) in awarding no back wages to the rest of the strikers and 
(3) in denying reinstatement to Cresenciano Andrada and Angel Dario and to those 
who might have found substantially equivalent employment elsewhere. The court en 
bane affirmed the decision. Hence, this appeal.<br>The issues in this appeal 
relate to the power of the Court of Industrial Relations to order reinstatement 
and the payment of back wages in unfair labor practice cases as a means of 
effectuating the policy of the law.</p>
<p>Section 5 (c) of the Industrial Peace Act states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * If, after investigation, the Court shall be of the opinion that any 
person named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in any unfair labor 
practice, then the Court shall state its findings of fact and shall issue and 
cause to be served on such person an order requiring such person to cease and 
desist from such unfair labor practice and take such affirmative action, as will 
effectuate the policies of this Act, including (but not limited to) 
reinstatement of employees with or without back-pay and including rights of the 
employees prior to dismissal including seniority. * * *"</p></blockquote>
<p>At the outset, two types of employees involved in this case must be 
distinguished, namely, those who were discriminatorily dismissed for union 
activities and those who voluntarily went on strike. To the first class belong 
Francisco Gaddi and Cresenciano Andrada, both of whom, as earlier shown, had 
been dismissed for union activities, and the five salesmen who were virtually 
locked out by the company when they were ordered to put their trucks in the 
garage. To the second class belong those who declared a strike on March 11, 
1957, following the failure of the company-union conference to settle their 
dispute.</p>
<p>Both types of employees are entitled to reinstatement. Indeed, it is said 
that striking employees are entitled to reinstatement whether or not the strike 
was the consequence of the employer's unfair labor practice, unless, where the 
strike was not due to any unfair labor practice, the employer has hired others 
to take the place of the strikers and has promised them continued employment. 
(Teller, 2 Labor Disputes and Collective Bargaining, Sec. 371, pp. 396-397)</p>
<p>From this rule, however, must be excepted those who, although 
discriminatorily discharged, must nevertheless be denied reinstatement because 
of (1) unlawful conduct or (2) because of violence. For while the Court of 
Industrial Relations has indeed discretion in determining the remedy in case of 
unfair labor practice, its discretion is not unbounded. (Big Five Products 
Workers Union-CLP vs. Court of Industrial Relations, et al., G. R. No. L-17600, 
July 31, 1963) It cannot exercise its right beyond the point which the object of 
"effectuation" of the Act requires. It can not order the reinstatement of those 
convicted of violence upon the employer's property. (Rothenberg on Labor 
Relations, 573-574; Philippine Education Co., Inc. vs. Court of Industrial 
Relations, et al., G. R. No. L-7156, May 31, 1955; Consolidated Labor Ass'n. of 
the Phils. vs. Marsman &amp; Co., Inc., et al., G. R. No. L-17038, July 31, 
1964)</p>
<p>Such is the case of Cresenciano Andrada and Angel Dario who were found guilty 
of acts of violence consisting of hurling stones which smashed glass windows of 
the building of the company and the headlights of a car and the utterance of 
obscenities such as "putang ina."</p>
<p>But the union contends that the acts committed by Andrada and Dario were not 
so serious as to call for the forfeiture of their rights to reinstatement It is 
not for Us to judge the effect of misconduct by employees. That is primarily for 
the Court of Industrial Relations to determine. (See KLRB vs. Weissman Co., 170 
F(2d) 952). In the absence of proof of abuse of discretion on the part of the 
Court of Industrial Relations, this Court will not interfere with the exercise 
of that discretion.</p>
<p>The same thing may be said of the denial of reinstatement to those who might 
have found substantial employment elsewhere. We agree with the union that under 
the ruling of <em>Phelps Dodge</em> Corp. vs. NLRB, 313 U.S. 177, 85 L, ed. 1271 
(See also Cox and Bok, Cases on Labor Law, 250, 5th ed.), the mere fact that 
strikers or dismissed employees have found such employment elsewhere is not 
necessarily a bar to their reinstatement.<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> But it is just as time to say that the 
<em>Phelps Dodge</em> case did not rule that in any event discriminatorily 
dismissed employees must be ordered reinstated even though they have in the 
meanwhile found substantially equivalent employment somewhere else. While 
denying that employees who have obtained equivalent employment are ineligible as 
a matter of law to reinstatement, the Supreme Court of the United States at the 
same time denied also that the definition of the term "employee" can be 
disregarded by the National Labor Relations Board in exercising its powers under 
Section 10 (c) of the Wagner Act, which corresponds to Section 5 (c) of our 
Industrial Peace Act, to direct the taking of affirmative action by an employer 
to remedy unfair labor practices. According to the Court, it is for the Board in 
each case to weigh the particular facts and to determine, in the exercise of 
wise administrative discretion, whether the Act would best be effectuated by 
directing reinstatement despite the fact that the given employee has found 
equivalent employment.</p>
<p>Obviously it was after considering the facts in this case that the Court of 
Industrial Relations predicated the reinstatement of the employees concerned on 
the fact that they had not found substantially equivalent employment elsewhere. 
Thus, it made clear in the dispositive portion of its decision that it was 
ordering the taking of affirmative acts "which the Court finds will effectuate 
the policy of the Act." The union has not shown that in so doing the Court of 
Industrial Relations abused its discretion.</p>
<p>Coming now to the question of backpay, the decision under review directs the 
company "to reinstate all the strikers listed in Annex 'A' of the complaint, 
without back wages, <em>in view of the circumtances, as explained on the subject 
of the strike,</em> unless they have found substantial employment elsewhere 
during the pendency of this case." The union assails this order as erroneous. 
According to the union, it is unfair to deny backwages to the strikers after 
finding that the strike declared by them was legal because it was provoked by 
unfair labor practices of the company. Indeed a reading of the 46-page decision 
of the Court of Industrial Relations fails to yield the reason that impelled the 
court to deny backwages to the strikers.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, We believe that the denial of backpay may be justified, 
although on a different ground. For this purpose, We shall advert again to the 
distinction earlier made between discriminatorily dismissed employees and those 
who struck, albeit in protest against the company's unfair labor practice. 
Discriminatorily dismissed employees receive back pay from the date of the act 
of discrimination, that is from the day of their discharge. On this score, the 
pay from the date of the act of discriminaton, that is from the day of their 
discharge. On this score, the award of backpay to Gaddi, Andrada and the 
salesmen may be justified. The salesmen, as already stated, were practically 
locked out when they were ordered to put their trucks in the garage; they did 
not voluntarily strike. (See Macleod &amp; Co. of the Phils. vs. Progressive 
Federation of Labor, 97 Phil., 205) Hence, the award of backwages.</p>
<p>In contrast, the rest of the employees struck as a voluntary act of protest 
against what they considered unfair labor practices of the company. The stoppage 
of their work was not the direct consequence of the company's unfair labor 
practice. Hence their economic loss should not be shifted to the employer. (See 
Dinglasan vs. National Labor Union, 106 Phil., 671). As explained by the 
National Labor Relations Board in the case of <em>American Manufacturing 
</em>Co., 5 NLRB 443, "When employees voluntarily go on strike, even if in 
protest against unfair labor practices, it has been our policy not to award them 
back pay during the strike. However, when the strikers abandon the practices and 
the employer either refuses to reinstate them or imposes upon their 
reinstatement new conditions that constitute unfair labor practices, We are of 
the opinion that the considerations impelling our refusal to award back pay are 
no longer controlling. Accordingly, We hold that where, as in this case, an 
employer refuses to reinstate strikers except upon their acceptance of new 
conditions that discriminate against them because of their union membership or 
activities, the strikers who refuse to accept the conditions and are 
consequently refused reinstatement are entitled to be made whole for any losses 
of pay they may have suffered by reason of the respondent's discriminatory 
acts." (Quoted in Teller, 2 Labor Disputes and Collective Bargaining Sec. 371, 
pp. 997-998)</p>
<p>While it is true that the strikers in this case offered to return to work on 
March 14, 1957, We find that their offer was conditional. Their offer was 
predicated on the company's observance of the provisions of the collective 
bargaining agreement—the very bone of contention between the parties by reason 
of which the union walked out. To be effective so as to entitle the strikers to 
backpay, the offer must have been unconditional. The strikers must have offered 
to return to work under the same conditions under which they worked just before 
their strike so that the company's refusal would have placed on the latter the 
blame for their economic loss. But that is not the case here. Indeed the offer 
of the company to accept the strikers under the conditions obtaining before the 
strike (without prejudice of course to taking up the grievances of the strikers) 
can be considered in its favor in denying backwages to strikers. (Dinglasan vs. 
National Labor Union, G. R. No. L-14183, Nov. 28, 1959.)</p>
<p>Nor may it be said that the strikers could not have offered to return to work 
because the company dismissed them upon their failure to return to work on March 
14, 1957. For the notice given by the company was merely a "tactical" threat 
designed to break the strike and not really to discharge the striking employees. 
(Majestic Mfg. Co., et al., 64 NLRB 961; Rockwood Stove Works, 63 NLRB 1297; 
American Mfg. Co., 7 NLRB 553)</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision and resolution of the Court of Industrial Relations 
appealed from are hereby affirmed, without pronouncements as to 
costs.</p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Bautista Angelo, Paredes, Dizon, Makalintal,

<span class="style1"><sup>[1] </sup></span>The view that discriminatorily 
discharged employees who have found substantially equivalent jobs elsewhere are 
no longer entitled to reinstatement is based on Section 2(d) of the law which 
defines the term "employee" as including "'any employee and not be limited to 
the employee of a particular employer unless the Act explicitly states otherwise 
and shall include any individual whose work has ceased as consequence of, or in 
connection with, any current labor dispute or because of any unfair labor 
practice and who has not obtained any other substantially equivalent and regular 
employment." Cf. Far Eastern University vs. Court of Industrial Relations, et

<p align="center"><em>DISSENTING OPINION</em></p>
<p><strong>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</strong></p>
<p>I can not agree to the ruling laid down in the opinion in so far as it denies 
backpay to the reinstated laborers. There is no dispute that the employer was 
the first to infringe the collective bargaining agreement by refusing to 
implement its provisions, particularly by its March 1 order, and by insisting on 
it as a condition for taking back the strikers. I can not see how the objectives 
and policies of the Industrial Peace Act can be said to be promoted by placing 
the economic loss on the strikers, denying them backpay; the discouraging of 
unfair labor practices is certainly one of those policies, and the denial of 
backpay to the victims of unfair labor practices is a direct encouragement for 
the employer to continue its reprobable misconduct.</p>
<p>While the laborers technically violated the no-strike clause, the facts as 
found reveal that the employer goaded the laborers into striking, by repeatedly 
violating the collective bargaining agreement and by preventing the organization 
of the grievance committee through the Company's refusal to name its 
representatives therein.</p><em>Concepcion, J.</em>, concurs. <br><br><br>
<hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<p align="center"><strong>R E S O L U T I O N</strong></p>
<p><strong>REGALA, J.:</strong></p>
<p>The facts of this case are stated in the decision of this Court which was 
promulgated on September 30, 1964.</p>
<p>Briefly, our decision rules that as for as reinstatement is concerned, both 
employees who are discriminatorily dismissed as well as those who strike because 
of the employer's unfair labor practice are entitled to reinstatement. Excepted 
from the rule are those who, on account of violence or other misconduct during 
the strike, or who, because of subsequent employment elsewhere, must be deemed 
to have forfeited the right to reinstatement, having in view the policies of the 
Industrial Peace Act. With respect to backwages, however, we hold that only 
discriminatorily dismissed employees are entitled to back pay. Those who 
voluntarily strike, even if it be in protest against unfair labor practice, are 
not entitled to backwages unless, after giving up the strike and presenting 
themselves to the employer, the latter should refuse to reinstate them or should 
reinstate them subject to new conditions that are also discriminatory.</p>
<p>On the basis of the foregoing, we affirmed the decision of the Court of 
Industrial Relations.</p>
<p>The union has filed a motion for reconsideration. First of all, it contends 
that in the absence of good faith or similar circumstances on the part of the 
employer, the Court of Industrial Relations has no discretion to award half 
backwages only to reinstated employees. Full backpay should have been given 
instead and this Court should have ordered this in its decision, so it is 
averred.</p>
<p>To begin with, we note that this point is being raised for the first time 
only now. Section 7 of Rule 51 states that "no error which does not affect the 
jurisdiction over the subject matter will be considered unless stated in the 
assignment of errors and properly argued in the brief, save as the court, at its 
option, may notice plain errors not specified, and also clerical errors." Now, 
the fact that full back pay was not given certainly cannot be stigmatized as 
"plain error," much less a clerical one. As noted in the decision of the Court 
of Industrial Relations, the salesmen were not exactly justified in refusing to 
turn over their collections to the company. Nor is this the first case that one 
half instead of full, backwages are awarded.</p>
<p>It is also contended that those who struck in protest against the company's 
unfair labor practice should be given backwages because the company refused to 
take them back except under the conditions contained in its March 1 order. On 
this point, the decision states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In contrast, the rest of the employees struck as a voluntary act of protest 
against what they considered unfair labor practice of the company. The stoppage 
of their work was not the direct consequence of the company's unfair labor 
practice. Hence, their economic loss should not be shifted to the employer. (See 
Dinglasan vs. National Labor Union, 106 Phil.. 671). As explained by the 
National Labor Relations Board in the case of <em>American Manufacturing</em> 
Co., 5 NLRB 443, 'When employees voluntarily go on strike even if in protest 
against unfair labor practices, it has been our policy not to award them back 
pay during the strike. However, when the strikers abandon the strike and apply 
for reinstatement despite the unfair labor practice and the employer either 
refuses to reinstate them or imposes upon their reinstatement new conditions 
that constitute unfair labor practice, We are of the opinion that the 
considerations impelling our refusal to award back pay are no longer 
controlling. Accordingly, we hold that where, as in this case, an employer 
refuses to reinstate strikers except upon their acceptance of new conditions 
that discriminate against them because of their union membership or activities, 
the strikers who refuse to accept the conditions and are consequently refused 
reinstatement are entitled to be made whole for any losses of pay they may have 
suffered by reason of the respondent's discriminatory acts.' (Quoted in Teller, 
2 Labor Disputes and Collective Bargaining, Sec. 371, pp. 
997-998)"</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, it is clear that the statement of the rule that those who strike 
voluntarily—even if in protest of unfair labor practice—are entitled to backpay 
only—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"when the strikers abandon the strike and apply for reinstatement despite the 
unfair labor practice and the employer either refuses to reinstate them or 
imposes upon their reinstatement new conditions that constitute unfair labor 
practice."</p></blockquote>
<p>In insisting therefore on the company's observance of the collective 
bargaining agreement as condition for returning to work, the strikers did not in 
fact abandon their strike, because the company's non-observance of their 
agreement was precisely the reason for their strike. This is the reason why we 
said that to be entitled to back pay, the strikers must have offered to return 
to work under the same conditions just before their strike so as to place on 
the1 company the blame for the strikers' economic loss.</p>
<p>By underscoring certain portions of the decision in the <em>American 
Manufacturing</em> case, the dissenting opinion seems to imply that on the 
contrary, the voluntary strikers in this case should be given backwages. But if 
the strikers in the former case were awarded backwages, it is because their 
unconditional offer to return to work, their employer refused to take them back 
except under "new conditions that discriminate against them." These new 
conditions were that these employees should sign a new contract as new employees 
and undergo medical examination. In contrast, no such conditions were imposed by 
the company in this case.</p>
<p>If the <em>American Manufacturing</em> case is being cited, it is for the 
general principle it lays namely, that "When employees voluntarily go on strike, 
Even if in protest against unfair labor practices, it has been our policy not to 
award them back pay during the strike."</p>
<p>Now, even in the English system, with its strict adherence to precedent,<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> to distinguish one case from another held to 
be the rule is not to deny its force as a precedent. As Professor Hart puts 
it—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * whatever authoritative status a rule extracted from precedent may 
have, it is compatible with the exercise by courts that arc bound by it of the 
following two types of creative or legislative activity. On the one hand courts 
deciding a later case may reach an opposite decision to that in a precedent by 
narrowing the rule extracted from the precedent, and admitting: some exception 
to it not before considered, or, if considered, left open. This process of 
'distinguishing' the earlier case involves finding some legally relevant 
difference between it and the present case, and the class of such differences 
can never be exhaustively determined. * * *" (The Concept of Law 
131).</p></blockquote>
<p>Anent the claim that the notice given by the company to the employees was not 
a mere "tactical" threat calculated to make them go back to work, suffice it to 
say that if the strikers had anyway the right to reinstatement, no amount of 
notice of dismissal could negate that right. Any notice to that effect, 
therefore, could not be anything but a "tactical" threat.</p>
<p>Still on this point, the dissenting opinion states that without a grievance 
committee (for the failure to constitute which the company was found at fault by 
the Court of Industrial Relations) it is improbable, not to say inconceivable, 
that the laborers would "forego the right to strike without any alternative 
method to have their grievances redressed." The opinion goes on that "the 
bargaining contract is indivisible, and the employer, who was the first to 
breach it by blocking the organization of the grievances committee, has no right 
whatsoever to claim enforcement of the no-strike clause."</p>
<p>The remedy for violation of a provision of an agreement is not another 
infraction of that agreement. We still have courts open for the redress of 
grievances.</p>
<p>Finally, it is contended that Andrada and Dario should have been ordered 
reinstated, because the Court of Industrial Relations itself recognized that 
minor misdemeanor is an insufficient ground for denying reinstatement.</p>
<p>To be sure, what this Court said is that the Court of Industrial cannot order 
the reinstatement of those who are guilty of violence on the company's property 
and that whether a misconduct is serious or not is for the Court of Industrial 
Relations to determine and only in cases of abuse of discretion will this Court 
step in. In other words, this Court did not agree with Court of Industrial 
Relations observation that occasional infractions of rules brought about by the 
rising temper may not justify denial of reinstatement. And this Court also said 
that the question of whether or not those already employed elsewhere should be 
reinstated is the task of the Court of Industrial Relations and where there is 
no abuse of discretion, this Court will not interfere. Now the union says it is 
hard to show abuse of discretion. We think it rather plain that that is no 
excuse for not proving abuse of discretion. To reinstate all employees 
irrespective of whether they have found employment elsewhere would be to negate 
the injunction that the question is one of discretion to be determined if the 
order would effectuate the policies of the law.</p>

<p align="center"><em>DISSENTING OPINION</em></p>
<p><strong>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</strong></p>
<p>My vote is for the reconsideration of the decision for the reasons expressed 
in my original dissent. While there was no-strike clause in the collective 
bargaining agreement, operation of that clause was manifestly dependent on the 
constitution of the grievances committee also provided therein, for it is highly 
improbable, not to say inconceivable, that the laborers would forego the right 
to strike without any alternative method to have their grievances redressed. The 
bargaining contract is indivisible, and the employer, who was the first to 
breach it by blocking the organization of the grievances committee, has no right 
whatsoever to claim enforcement, of the no-strike clause. The employer can not 
disregard what is unfavorable to him and seek the benefit of those stipulations 
that are in his favor.</p>
<p>By the same token, I do not believe the rule of the <em>American 
Manufacturing</em> case (5/NLRB 443) on employees who voluntarily go on strike 
applies in the present case. In the proceedings before us the employees were 
practically provoked into a strike because the employer blocked any other 
reasonable way to ventilate their complaints against management. In fact, the 
decision cited really favors the granting of backpay to laborers in the present 
case, who offered to return to work and abandon the strike, but whom the 
employer refused to readmit, imposing the condition that its March 1st order be 
accepted. Said the NLRB in the case cited (at p. 467):</p>
<p>There is, therefore, no question in my mind that those laborers are entitled 
to backpay, at the very least from and after March 14, 1957.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When employees voluntarily go on strike, even if in protest against unfair 
labor practices, it has been our policy not to award them back pay during: the 
strike. However, when the strikers abandon the strike and apply for 
reinstatement despite the unfair labor practices, and the employer either 
refuses to reinstate them or imposes upon their reinstatement new conditions 
that constitute unfair labor practices, we are of the opinion that the 
considerations impelling: our refusal to award back pay are no longer 
controlling. Accordingly, we hold that where, as in this case, an employer 
refuses to reinstate striken except upon their acceptance of new conditions that 
discriminate against them because of their union membership or activities, the 
strikers who refuse to accept the conditions and are consequently refused 
reinstatement are entitled to be made whole for any losses of pay they may have 
suffered by reason of the respondent's discriminatory acts. Here the strikers 
who were refused reinstatement except on the conditions set forth by the 
respondent are entitled to reinstatement with back pay from July 27, 1937, to 
the dates on which the respondent offers them reinstatement, less any amounts 
earned by them in the1 meantime." (Italics supplied)</p></blockquote>
