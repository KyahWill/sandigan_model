				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">For a clear understanding of the issues posed by the present
petition for mandamus and certiorari with preliminary injunction, we hereunder
quote the statement of the case and the findings of fact made by the Court of
Appeals in its decision dated October 4, 1967 in CA -G. R. 35084-R, as well as
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the said decision:</p>

<blockquote>"On December 31, 1958, in <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, by virtue of a document denominated '<span class="SpellE">Kasunduan</span>', written in the vernacular and ratified before
Notary Public <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Ison</span>
of that locality, Nieves Cruz, now deceased, authorized the spouses <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> Valenzuela, and <span class="SpellE">Maximina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Liberata</span>
Santos to sell a certain parcel of land of about 44,634 square meters belonging
to her and situated in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Matatdo</span>,
barrio San <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, the identity of which is not now in
dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Amongst the salient conditions
of this authority were that the price payable to Nieves Cruz for the land would
be P1.60 per square meter and any overprice would pertain to the agents; that
Nieves Cruz would receive from said agents, by <span style="">way </span>of advance payment on account of the purchase price to be
paid by whomsoever may buy the land, the sum of P10,000.00 upon the execution
of the agreement aforesaid, and another P10,000.00 on January 5, 1959; that the
balance on the total purchase price would be payable to Nie­ves Cruz upon the
issuance of the Torrens title over the property, the <span class="SpellE">obtention</span>
of which was un­dertaken by the agents who also were bound to ad­vance the
expenses <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> in the sum of P4,000.00 which would
be deductible from the last amount due on the purchase price; and that should
the agent find no buyer by the time that Torrens title is is­sued, Nieves Cruz
reserved the right to look for a buyer herself although all sums already
received from the agents would be returned to them without interest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As confirmed by Nieves Cruz in a '<span class="SpellE">recibo</span>',
Exhibit 2, bearing the date ’­­­­­­_____ <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Enero</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> 1959', the stipulated
'advance payment (<span class="SpellE">paunang</span> <span class="SpellE">bayad</span>)'
of P20,000.00 was duly made to her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Contrary to the agreement that the balance on the purchase price would
be paid upon the issuance of the Torrens ti­tle over the land (September 9,
1960), Nieves Cruz and her children, however, collected from the agents, either
thru <span class="SpellE">Maximina</span> <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> or
thru <span class="SpellE">Salud</span> G. de Leon, daughter of <span class="SpellE">Liberata</span> Santos, various sums of money during the period
from July 3, 1959 up to September 3, 1961, all of which were duly re­ceipted
for by Nieves Cruz and/or her children and in which receipts it is expressly
stated that said amounts were '<span class="SpellE">bilang</span> <span class="SpellE">karagdagan</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">ipinagbili</span>
na­ming <span class="SpellE">lupa</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">kanila</span> (additional payments for the land we sold to them)',
Exhibits 12, 12-a to 12-z-1. These <span class="SpellE">totalled</span>
P27,198.60 which with the <span style="">P20, 000.00 </span>previously
paid amounted to P47,198. 60.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Meanwhile, proceedings to place the land under the operation
of the <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> system were ini­tiated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due season, the registration court -

Nieves Cruz of the parcel of land for which the latter was paid P22,000.00 as
partial payment thereof.' (Exhibit 4).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The judgment aforesaid having become final,
the corresponding Original Certificate of Title No. 2488 of the Registry of
Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> was, on Sep­tember 9, 1960, duly
entered and issued to the ap­plicants aforesaid, subject, amongst others, to
the limitation heretofore stated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Eventually, pursuant to a partition between Nieves Cruz and
her brother, Emilio Cruz, by vir­tue of which the entire land was subdivided
into two lots of 48,260 square meters each, Original Trans­fer of Title No.
2488 was cancelled and superseded by two new transfer certificates respectively
cover­ing the two sub-divided lots, that which pertained to Nieves Cruz, Lot A
(LRC) Psd-13106, being co­vered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 80110 is­sued
on October 3, 1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said title carried
over the annotation heretofore mentioned respecting the rights of <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> Valenzuela and <span class="SpellE">Maximina</span> <span class="SpellE">Victo­rio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Liberata</span> Santos
over the portion covered thereby.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Exhibits 6 and 6-a).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Then, on <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="9">September
 15, 1961</st1:date>, Nieves Cruz sold the property in question to Barbara <span class="SpellE">Lombos</span> Rodriguez, her <span class="SpellE">balae</span>'
because the latter's son was married to her daughter, for the sum of P
77,216.00 (Exhibit J).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In consequence,
Transfer Certificate of Title No. 80110 in the name of Nieves Cruz was can­celled
and, in lieu thereof, Transfer Certificate of Title No. 91135 was issued in the
name of Barbara <span class="SpellE">Lombos</span> Rodriguez (Exhibit I) which
likewise car­ried over the annotation respecting the rights of A <span class="SpellE">tanacio</span> Valenzuela, <span class="SpellE">Maximina</span> <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Libe­rata</span> Santos
over the property covered thereby.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Forthwith, on <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="9">September
 16, 1961</st1:date>, Nieves Cruz, through counsel, gave notice to <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> Va­lenzuela, <span class="SpellE">Maximina</span> <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Liberata</span> Santos of
her decision to rescind the original agreement here­tofore adverted to,
enclosing with said notice a Bank of America check for P 48, 338. 60, represent­ing
sums advanced by the latter which were tender­ed to be returned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span>
Valenzuela, <span class="SpellE">Maximina</span> <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Liberata</span> Santos, through counsel, balk­ed at the
attempt at rescission, denying non-com­pliance with their undertaking inasmuch
as, per agreement, the balance on the purchase price for the land was not due
until after the 1962 harvest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They,
accordingly, returned Nieves Cruz' check.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thus rebuffed, plaintiff Nieves Cruz hail­ed defendants <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> Valenzuela, <span class="SpellE">Maximina</span> <span class="SpellE">Vic­torio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Liberrta</span> Santos
before the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Court</st1:address></st1:street>
in the instant action for rescission of the '<span class="SpellE">Kasunduan</span>'
heretofore adverted to, the cancellation of the an­notation on the title to the
land respecting defendants' rights thereto, and for damages and attor­ney's
fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their return to the complaint,
defen­dants traversed the material averments thereof, contending principally
that the agreement sought to be rescinded had since been <span class="SpellE">novated</span>
by a subsequent agreement <span class="SpellE">whereunder</span> they were to buy
the proper­ty directly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> Barbara <span class="SpellE">Lombos</span>
Rodriguez on account of the sale by the plaintiff to her of the subject
property and interposed a coun­terclaim against both plaintiff and Rodriguez
for the annulment of the sale of the land to the latter, as well as the
transfer certificate of title issued in her favor consequent thereto, and the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of the land in their favor, and also for
damages and attorney's fees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Pending the proceedings below, plaintiff Nieves Cruz died and
was, accordingly, substitu­ted as such by her surviving children, to wit: <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nelo</span>, Jaime, Andres and
Amanda, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Nery</span>, and Carmen and <span class="SpellE">Arsenia</span>, both sur­named Mendoza.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In due season, the trial court - finding for plaintiff Nieves
Cruz and her buyer, Barbara <span class="SpellE">Lom­bos</span> Rodriguez, and
against defendants - rendered judgment thus -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></blockquote>

(1) Or­dering the cancellation at the back of Trans­fer Certificate of Title
No. 91135 of the Re­gister of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, stating
that the land covered thereby was sold to the defen­dants; (2) Ordering the

the prohibition against an agent buy­ing the property of his principal
entrusted to him for sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the
agreement of Nieves Cruz to sell the land directly to said appellants, her
agents ori­ginally, it cannot seriously be contended that the purchase of the
land by appellants was without the express consent of the principal Nieves
Cruz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ac­cordingly, that purchase is
beyond the coverage of the prohibition.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This case is before us for the second time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In G.R. No. L-28462, the heirs of Nieves Cruz
and the present petitioner (Barbara <span class="SpellE">Lombos</span> Rodriguez)
filed a joint petition for certiorari - as an original ac­tion under Rule 65
and, simultaneously, as an appeal under Rule 45.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the former, it sought redress against the
refusal of the respondent Court of Appeals to consider a motion for
reconsideration filed beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the latter, it sought a re­view
of the respondent Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1968" day="3" month="1">January
 3, 1968</st1:date> we denied the joint petition; the joint petition was
thereafter amended, and this amended petition we likewise denied on <st1:date year="1968" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1968</st1:date>; on <st1:date year="1968" day="20" month="2">February 20, 1968</st1:date> we denied the'
motion for reconsideration filed solely by Rodriguez.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1968</st1:date>,
Rodriguez alone filed the present petition for mandamus and certiorari.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She prays for the issuance of a writ of
preliminary injunction to restrain the respondents from enforc­ing the decision
of the Court of Appeals in CA -G. R. 35084-R and from entering into any
negotiation or transaction or otherwise exercising acts of ownership over the
parcel of land covered by trans­fer certificate of title 91135 issued by the
Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also prays that preliminary injunction
issue<span style=""> </span>to restrain the Register of
Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> from registering any documents affect­ing
the subject parcel of land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
injunction, however, was issued by us.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition in the present case, G.R. No. L-29264, while again
assailing the findings of fact and conclusions of law made by the respondent
Court, adds two new grounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first
is the allega­tion that the Land involved in CA -G. R. 35084-R has a value in
excess of P200,000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner
complains that the Court of Ap­peals should have certified the appeal to us,
pursuant to section 3 of Rule 50 in relation to section 17(5) of the Judiciary
Act of 1948,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
as she had asked the said Court to do in her supplemental motion of <st1:date year="1968" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second ground is the claim that the Court
of Appeals gravely abused its discretion in denying her <st1:date year="1968" day="14" month="5">May 14, 1968</st1:date> motion for new trial, based on
alleged newly discovered evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their answer, <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> Valenzuela, <span class="SpellE">Maxirnina</span> <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Liberata</span> Santos allege that the findings of fact made by
the Court of Appeals in its decision of October 4, 1967 are substan­tiated by
the record and the conclusions of law are supported by applicable laws and
jurisprudence, and, moreover, that these findings are no longer open to review
inasmuch as the said deci­sion has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
the period of appeal provid­ed in Rule 45 having expired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> Valenzuela
et al. also maintain that the land in litigation had a value of less than P200,
000, according to the records of the case, when their appeal from the decision
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> in civil case
6901 was perfected; that the petitioner's motion for new trial in the Court of
Appeals was filed out of time; and that the petitioner is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>
from questioning the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals in the matter of the
value of the land in controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two
grounds for the defense of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> are offered by <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> Valenzuela et al.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One is that the petitioner speculated in obtaining a favorable judgment
in the Court of Appeals by submitting herself to the juris­diction of the said
Court and she cannot now therefore be allowed to attack its jurisdiction when
the judgment turned out to be unfa­vorable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The other is that the petitioner's <span class="SpellE">laches</span> made
possible the sale in good faith by <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span>
Valenzuela et al. of the land in litigation to Emilio and Isidro Ramos, in
whose names the land is at present registered under transfer certificate of
title 229135 is­sued on September 25, 1968 by the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The heirs of Nieves Cruz filed an answer unqualifiedly ad­mitting
the basic allegations of the petition, except as to the value of the land, as
to which they are non-committal.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is our considered view that the petitioner's claim of grave
abuse by the respondent Court in denying her motion for new trial is devoid of
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not disputed that, on the
assumption that the respondent Court had jurisdiction over the appeal, the
petitioner had already lost her right to appeal from the deci­sion of <st1:date year="1967" day="4" month="10">October 4, 1967</st1:date> when the petition in G.R.
No. L-28462 was filed in January 1968.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It logically follows that the case had passed the stage for new trial on
newly discovered evidence when the petitioner filed her motion for new trial on
<st1:date year="1968" day="14" month="5">May 14, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two issues remain, to wit; (1) the value of the land in con­troversy
and (2) <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the time appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals, sec­tion
17(5) of the Judiciary Act of 1948, as amended, provided:</p>

review, revise, reverse, modify or affirm on appeal, certiorari or writ of

or brought in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Supreme
Court shall likewise have exclusive jurisdiction over all appeals in ci­vil
cases, even though the value in controversy, exclusive of interests and costs,
is two hundred thousand pesos or less, when the evidence involved in said cases

exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as provided here­in."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner would have us believe that, other than a realtor's
sworn statement dated June 14, 1968, which was filed with the respondent Court
together with her supplemental motion, there is nothing in the records that
would indicate the value of the litigated parcel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We disagree.<span style="">&nbsp;

executed by and between Nieves Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span>
Valenzuela et al. fixed the value of the land (of an area of 44, 634 square
meters) at P1. 60 per square meter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
decision (annex B) of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
dated <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="8">August 12, 1964</st1:date>
assessed the value of the land at <span style="">P3.00
</span>per square meter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision
(annex D) dated October 4, 1967 of the respondent Court of Appeals pointed out
that the considera­tion stated in the deed of sale of the land executed by
Nieves Cruz in favor of Rodriguez, the petitioner herein, is P77,216.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More­over, until <st1:date year="1968" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1968</st1:date>, no party to the cause questioned
the va­luation of P3.00 per square meter made by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records, therefore, overwhelmingly refute
the petitioner's alle­gation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also
prove that the value of the entire parcel of land had been impliedly admitted
by the parties as being below P200,000.</p>

<p class="BODY">Granting <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span>, however, that
the value of the land in controversy is in excess of P200,000, to set aside at
this stage all proceedings had before the Court of Appeals in CA -G. R. 35084­R,
and before this Court in G.R. No. L-28462, would violate all norms of justice
and equity and contravene public policy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> was pending be­fore the respondent Court during the
period from 1964 until October 4, 1967, when on the latter date it was decided
in favor of the ap­pellants and against the petitioner herein and the heirs of
Nieves Cruz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> therein did not raise the issue of juris­diction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The joint petition in G.R. No. L-28462
afforded the petitioner here­in the opportunity to question the jurisdiction of
the respondent Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, the value
of the land in controversy was not ques­tioned by the petitioners, not even in
their amended joint petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not
until <st1:date year="1968" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1968</st1:date> that
the petitioner herein filed with the respondent Court a supplemental motion
wherein she raised for the first time the issue of value and questioned the validity
of the final decision of the respondent Court on the jurisdictional ground that
the real estate involved has a value in excess of P200,000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the petitioner's present counsel became
her coun­sel only in May, 1968 provides no excuse for the petitioner's fail­ure
to exercise due diligence for over three years to discover that the land has a
value that would oust the respondent Court of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact remains that the petitioner had
allowed an unreasonable period of time to lapse before she raised the ques­tion
of value and jurisdiction, and only after and because the res­pondent Court had
decided the case against her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
doctrine of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> by <span class="SpellE">laches</span>
bars her from now questioning the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">The learned disquisition of Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span>
P. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, speaking for this Court in <span class="SpellE"><u>Serafin</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">Tijam</span>, et al.
vs. <span class="SpellE">Magdaleno</span> <span class="SpellE">Sibonghanoy</span>,
et al</u>.<u> (G.R. No. L-21450, April 15, 1968</u>), explained, in un­equivocal
terms, the reasons why, in a case like the present, a losing party cannot be permitted
to belatedly raise the issue of jurisdiction.</p>

<blockquote>"A party may be <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> or barred
from raising a question in different ways and for different reasons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus we speak of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
in <span class="SpellE">pais</span>, of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> by
deed or by record, and of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> by <span class="SpellE"><u>laches</u></span>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Laches</span>, in a general sense, is
failure or neglect, for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time, to do
that which, by exercising due dili­gence, could or should have been done
earlier; it is negligence or omission to assert a right within a reasonable
time, warranting a presumption that the party entitled to assert it either has
abandon­ed it or declined to assert it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The doctrine of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> or of 'stale
demands' is based upon grounds of public policy which re­quires, for the peace
of society, the discourage­ment of stale claims and, unlike the statute of li­mitations,
is not a mere question of time but is principally a question of the inequity or
unfairness of permitting a right or claim to be enforced or asserted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It has been held that a party can not invoke the jurisdiction
of a court to secure affirmative re­lief against his opponent and, after
obtaining or fail­ing to obtain such relief, repudiate or question that same
jurisdiction (Dean vs. Dean, 136 Or. 694, 86 A. L. R. 79). In the case just cited,
by way of ex­plaining the rule, it was further said that the ques­tion whether
the court had jurisdiction either of the subject matter of the action or of the
parties was not important in such cases because the party is barred from such
conduct <u>not because the judgment or order of the court is valid and
conclusive as an adjudication,</u> <u>but for the reason that such a practice
can not be tolerated</u> -obviously for reasons of pu­blic policy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Furthermore, it has also been held that af­ter voluntarily
submitting a cause and encountering an adverse decision on the merits, it is
too late for the loser to question the jurisdiction or power of the court
(Pease vs. <span class="SpellE">Rathbun</span>-Jones etc., 243 U. S. 273, 61 L.
Ed. 715, 37 <span class="SpellE">S.Ct</span>. 283; St. Louis etc. vs. McBride,
141 U. S. 127, 35 L. Ed. 659).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in
Lit­tleton vs. Burgess, 16 Wyo. 58, the Court said that it is not right for a
party who has affirmed and involved the jurisdiction of a court in a particular
mat­ter to secure an affirmative relief, to afterwards deny that same
jurisdiction to escape a penalty.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon this same principle is what We said in the three cases
mentioned in the resolution of the Court of Appeals of May 20, 1963 (supra) -
to the effect that we frown upon the 'undesirable prac­tice' of a party
submitting his case for decision and then accepting the judgment, only if
favorable, and attacking it for lack of jurisdiction, when ad­verse - as well
as in <span class="SpellE">Pindañgan</span> etc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Dans</span>
et al., G. R. L-14591, September 26, 1962; <span class="SpellE">Monteli­bano</span>
et al., vs. <span class="SpellE">Eacolod</span>-Murcia Milling Co., Inc., G.R.
L-15092; Young Men Labor Union etc. vs. The Court of Industrial Relations et
al., G.R. L­20307, Feb. 26, 1965; and Mejia vs. Lucas, 100 Phil. p. 277."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We do not here rule that where the pleadings or other do­cuments
in the records of a case state a value of a real estate in controversy, a party
to the cause may not show that the true va­lue thereof is more or is less than
that stated in the records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sec­tion
17(5) of the Judiciary Act of 1948 precisely allows a party to submit a sworn
statement of such higher or lower value.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is not to say, of course, that the court is bound by a party's
sworn statement, for where more than one party submit materially dif­fering
statements of value, or where a party's sworn statement conflicts with other
competent evidence, the true value is to be determined by the trial court as an
issue of fact before it.</p>

<p class="BODY">The time when the issue of the value of a real estate in
controversy is to be resolved is prior to, or simultaneously with, the approval
of the record on appeal and appeal bond, for it is upon the perfection of the
appeal that the appellate court acquires jurisdiction over the case (Rule 41,
section 9).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is at this time that a
party to the cause, be he the intended appellant or the in­tended <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, must raise the issue of value before the trial
court, for said court to allow appeal involving a question of fact either to
this Court or to the Court of Appeals, depending on its finding on the value of
the realty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failure to raise this issue
be­fore the trial court amounts to a submission of the issue solely on the
basis of the pleadings and evidence <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> and is equivalent to a
waiver of the right to present the statement under oath or to adduce the other
competent evidence referred to in section 17(b) of the Judiciary Act of 1948.</p>

<p class="BODY">A contrary rule would be disastrous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one thing, to allow a party to present
proof of value before an appellate court would be to convert the said court to
a trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For another thing, the
value of real estate may change between the perfection of an appeal and the
receipt of the records or the payment of the appellate court docket fee; hence,
it is best, for stability, to have the value determined at the precise instant
when the trial court must decide to which appellate court the appeal should be
made and not at some uncertain time thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Worse yet, to permit a party to prove before the Court of A p peals or
before us, after a decision on the merits has been rendered, that a real estate
in controversy exceeds, or does not exceed, P200, 000 in value, would be to
encourage speculation by litigants; for, a losing party can be expected to
raise the issue of value of the realty to show that it is in excess of P200,
000 if the unfavorable judgment is ren­dered by the Court of Appeals, or to
show that it does not exceed P200, 000 if the unfavorable judgment is rendered
by this Court, in an attempt to litigate the merits of the case all over again.

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the records - as of the perfection of the appeal
on August 12, 1964 - show that the litigated real estate had a value not in
excess of P200, 000, Conformably with the Ju­diciary Act of 1948, therefore,
the appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> in civil case 6901 was with­in the jurisdiction of
the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Other issues, both of fact and of law, are raised in the
pleadings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering our conclusion
that the respondent Court had jurisdiction over the appeal, it is not necessary
to discuss, much less resolve, any of those other issues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, because the petitioner and the heirs
of Nieves Cruz have hammered on the twin issues of the existence of an oral
contract of sale and of the efficacy of an oral <span class="SpellE">novatory</span>
contract of sale, a brief discus­sion of these issues would not be amiss.</p>

<p class="BODY">The agency agreement of <st1:date year="1958" day="31" month="12">December
 31, 1958</st1:date> is not im­pugned by any of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nieves Cruz, however, asserted that the
agency remained in force until she rescinded it on <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="9">Sep­tember 16, 1961</st1:date> by notice to that effect to <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> Valenzuela et al., tendering with the said notice
the return, in check, of the sum of P48, 338.60 which she had received from <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> Valen­zuela et al.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The defendants, upon the other hand, contend that the agency agreement
was <span class="SpellE">novated</span> by a contract of sale in their favor and
that the balance of the purchase price was not due un­til after the 1962
harvest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rodriguez, when <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> by <span class="SpellE">Atana­cio</span> Valenzuela
et al., denied that she was a buyer in bad faith from Nieves Cruz.</p>

<p class="BODY">The parties and the lower courts are agreed that Nieves Cruz had
received P20, 000 from <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> Valenzuela et al. by <st1:date year="1959" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1959</st1:date> and that the payment
of this total sum was in ac­cordance with the agency agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties and the lower courts, however,
are at variance on the basis or reason for the subsequent payments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner herein, the heirs of Nieves
Cruz and the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> take
the position that the payments after January 5, 1959 were received by Nieves
Cruz as partial or <span class="SpellE">instalment</span> payments of the
purchase price on the representations of <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span>
Valenzuela et al, that they had a buyer for the property from whom these
payments came, all pursuant to the agency agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondents <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span>
Valen­zuela et al., on the other hand, assert that those amounts were paid by
them, as disclosed buyers, to Nieves Cruz and her chil­dren, pursuant to a <span class="SpellE">novatory</span> verbal contract of sale entered into with Nieves
Cruz subsequent to the agency agreement and prior to the issuance of the decree
of registration of <st1:date year="1960" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1960</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus clear that the decisive issues are (a) whether or not
Nieves Cruz did agree to sell to <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> Valenzuela
et al. the litigated parcel of land sometime after <st1:date year="1959" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1959</st1:date>, and (b) whether or not the said agreement
is enforceable or can be proved under the law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fact that <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> Valenzuela et al. were
agents of Nieves Cruz under the agency agreement of De­cember 31, 1958 is not
material, for if it is true that Nieves Cruz did agree to sell to her agents
the real estate subject of the agen­cy, her consent took the transaction out of
the prohibition con­tained in article 1491(2) of the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither are articles 1874 and 1878(5) and
(12) of the Civil Code relevant, for they refer to sales made by an agent for a
principal and not to sales made by the owner personally to another, whether
that other be acting personally or through a representative.</p>

<p class="BODY">Was there a <span class="SpellE">novatory</span> oral contract to
sell entered into by Nieves Cruz in favor of <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span>
Valenzuela et al.?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In resolving this
question, the respondent Court pointed to significant facts and circumstances
sustaining an affirmative answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Cited by the Court of Appeals is the testimony of Andres <span class="SpellE">Nery</span>, a successor-in-interest of Nieves Cruz and a
substitute plaintiff upon Nieves Cruz' death, to the effect that after they had
gone to the defendants several times, they were told that the buy­er was <span class="SpellE">Salud</span> de Leon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
witness also said, according to the transcript cited by the respondent Court, that
they were paid little by little and had been paid a grand total of P48,
000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respon­dent Court likewise
adverted to the receipts (exhibits L-I2 to L-22, exhibit L-24, exhibit L-26,
and exhibits 12, 12-a to 12-z-1) signed by Nieves Cruz and/or her children and
concluded that on the faces of these receipts it is clear that the amounts
therein stated were in payment by <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> Valenzuela
et al. of the land which the reci­pients had sold to them ("<span class="SpellE">ipinagbile</span> naming <span class="SpellE">lupa</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">kanila</span>").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of in­calculable significance is the notation
in the original certificate of title and in the transfer certificate of title
in the name of Nieves Cruz which, in unambiguous language, recorded Nieves
Cruz' sale of her interest in the land to <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span>
Valenzuela et al. If that no­tation were inaccurate or false, Nieves Cruz would
not have re­mained <span class="SpellE">unprotesting</span> for over a year after
the entry of the decree of registration in July, 1960, nor would she and her
children have received 13 installment payments totaling P19, 963 during the pe­riod
from <st1:date year="1960" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1960</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1961" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1961</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Salud</span> de Leon, it should be borne in
mind, is the husband of <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span> F. de Leon and the
daughter of the defendant <span class="SpellE">Libera­ta</span> Santos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should likewise be remembered that, as
remarked by the trial court, <span class="SpellE">Salud</span> de Leon testified
that it was she who had the oral agreement with Nieves Cruz for the purchase by
<span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> Valenzuela et al. of the litigated property
and, as found by the res­pondent Court, <span class="SpellE">Salud</span> de Leon
was the representative of <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> Valenzuela et al.,
not of Nieves Cruz.</p>

<p class="BODY">We conclude, therefore, that there is substantial evidence in the
record sustaining the finding of the respondent Court that the parties to the
agency agreement subsequently entered into a new and different contract by
which the landowner, Nieves Cruz, verbally agreed to sell her interest in the
litigated real estate to <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> Valenzuela et al.</p>

<p class="BODY">A legion of receipts there are of payments of the purchase price
signed by Nieves Cruz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True, these
receipts do not state all the basic elements of a contract of sale, for they do
not expressly identify the object nor fix a price or the manner of fixing the
price.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties, however, are agreed
- at least the plaintiff has not questioned the defendants' claim to this effect
- that the object of the sale referred to in the receipts is Nieves Cruz' share
in the land she co-owned with her brother Emilio and that the price <span class="SpellE">there­for</span> is P1.60 per square meter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At all events, by failing to object to the
presentation of oral evidence to prove the sale and by accept­ing from the
defendants a total of P27,198.60 after January 5, 1959, the plaintiff thereby
ratified the oral contract, conformably with article 1405 of the Civil Code,
and removed the partly executed agreement from the operation of the Statute of
Frauds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, final­ly, the sale was
established and recognized in the land registra­tion proceedings wherein the
land court, in its decision, categori­cally stated:</p>

<blockquote>"[T]he applicant Nieves Cruz has
likewise sold her one-half (1/2) undivided share to the spouses <span class="SpellE">Ata­nacio</span> Valenzuela and <span class="SpellE">Maximina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Libe­rata</span>
Santos from whom she had received partial payment thereof in the sum of P 22,
000.00."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The pertinent certificates of title bear
the annotation of the afore­said right of <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span>
Valenzuela et al.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The final decision of
the land court - to the effect that Nieves Cruz had sold her undivided share to
<span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> Valenzuela et al. and had received a partial
payment of P22, 000 - is now beyond judicial review, and, because a land
registration case is a proceeding <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>rem</u></span>,
binds even Rod­riguez.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rodriguez nevertheless insists that despite the rescission by the
Court of Appeals of her purchase from Nieves Cruz, the said respondent Court
did not order Nieves Cruz to return the P77, 216 which she had received from
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While mutual restitu­tion follows
rescission of a contract (article 1385, Civil Code), the respondent Court
should not be blamed for omitting to order Nieves Cruz to restore what she had
received from the petitioner on account of the rescinded contract of sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, in the pleadings filed
before the trial court, Rodriguez made no claim for restitution against Nieves
Cruz or her heirs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the se­cond place,
Nieves Cruz died in the course of the proceedings below and was substituted by
her heirs who, necessarily, can be held individually liable for restitution
only to the extent that they inherited from her.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, inasmuch as rescission of the contract bet­ween
Nieves Cruz and the petitioner herein was decreed by the respondent Court, the
latter should be entitled to restitution as a matter of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is of no moment that herein petitioner did
not file any cross-claim for restitution against the plaintiff, for her answer
was directed to the defendants' claim which was in the nature of a third-party
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was neither a
co-defendant nor a co-third-party defendant with Nieves Cruz; nor were Nieves
Cruz and the herein petitioner opposing parties <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, for they
joined in maintaining the validity of their contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 4 of Rule 9, therefore, has no
application to the petitioner's right to restitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">We declare, consequently, that the estate of Nieves Cruz is
liable to Barbara <span class="SpellE">Lombos</span> Rodriguez for the return to
the latter of the sum of P77,216, <span style="">less
</span>the amount which <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> Valenzuela et al.
had deposited with the trial court in accordance with the de­cision of
respondent Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot order the
heirs of Nieves Cruz to make the refund.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As we observed above, these heirs are liable for restitution only to the
extent of their individual inherit­ance from Nieves Cruz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other actions or proceedings have to be
commenced to determine the liability accruing to each of the heirs of Nieves
Cruz.</p>

The entire discussion on the issue of value in this decision has as its frame
of reference section 17(5) of the Judiciary Act of 1948, <u>infra</u>, before
its total elimination by Republic Act 5440 which went into effect on <st1:date year="1968" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1968</st1:date>. As the law stands today,
all appeals from decisions in civil cases involving property or money claims,
regardless of the <span style="">va</span>lue or
amount in controversy, must now be taken to the Court of Appeals, provided that
such appeals do not pose only errors or questions of law. Whatever pronounce­ments
are made in this decision in reference to the said section 17(5) of the
Judiciary Act of 1948 must be taken as applicable only to appeals (similar to
the case at bar) which were perfected prior to the date of <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of Republic Act 5440</p>

It may be asked: what happens if, contrary to the express or im­plied finding
of a trial court, the Court of Appeals or this Court finds that the value of
real estate in controversy in an appeal from a trial court on matters of fact
and law or fact alone, exceeds the value of P200, 000 or does not ex­ceed such
value, as the case may be? The answer is not difficult. If the appeal is made
to the Court of Appeals, but on the basis of the records <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>,
including any sworn statement by a party to the cause or other evidence sub­mitted
before perfection of the appeal, the realty should appear to have a value in
excess of P200, 000, the Court of Appeals shall certify the appeal to the
Supreme Court pursuant to section 3 of Rule 50 - and we may or may not accede
to the certification depending on our finding on the value. However, a party
litigant may raise the issue of value in a preliminary motion or in his brief
on the basis solely of the records <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, again including
whatever sworn statement or other competent evidence of value may have been
submitted before the perfection of the appeal; and if he does that but the
Court of Appeals rules that it has juris­diction over the controversy because
of its finding that the realty has a value not in excess of P200, 000, the
finding of value is <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> by us on an original
action for mandamus or certiorari, for this factual matter is indispen­sably
involved in the issue of jurisdiction. If, on the other hand, the appeal is
made to us but, on the same basis as above, the realty should appear to have a
value not in ex­cess of P200, 000, we will remand the appeal to the Court of
Appeals, and our finding on value, though one of fact, will be binding upon the
Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">In resume, the value of real estate
the title or pos­session of which is involved or brought in question should,
for purposes of determining which appellate court has juris­diction over the
appeal, be based solely on the pleadings, sworn statement or other competent
evidence already in the records of the case at the time the appeal is
perfected.</p>
