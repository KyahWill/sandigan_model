<span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Racho</span> and the decedent,
Manuel <span class="SpellE">Racho</span>, were spouses and had five minor
children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1954" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1954</st1:date> the decedent was appointed as market
clean足er in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>,
at the rate of P660.00 per annum (P55.00 monthly) which amount he received up
to <st1:date year="1958" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1958</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1958" day="1" month="7">July
 1, 1958</st1:date>, decedent's salary was increased to P720.00 per annum
(P60.00 monthly) by virtue of a promotional appointment extended to him by the
Municipal Mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He received this amount
until <st1:date year="1960" day="6" month="1">Janua足ry 6, 1960</st1:date> when
he tendered his resignation effective <st1:date year="1960" day="7" month="7">July
 7, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Decedent was then
paid the money value of his accumulated leaves from <st1:date year="1960" day="7" month="1">January 7, 1960</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1960" day="23" month="5">May 23, 1960</st1:date> at the rate of P60.00 a month.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1960</st1:date>,
decedent died intestate at <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff then filed on <st1:date year="1960" day="9" month="12">December 9, 1960</st1:date> a claim for salary differentials
with the Regional Office of the Department of Labor which dropped the case
later on for lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Based on the foregoing facts, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, in an action brought on December 5, 1961, by
plaintiff, in her own behalf and as guardian ad <span class="SpellE">litem</span>
of her minor children, ruled that defendant Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span>
must pay P1<span class="GramE">,766.00</span> to plaintiff representing the wage
differentials and adjusted terminal leave of the decedent from December 9, 1957<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
to May 23, 1960, based on the monthly wage rate of P120.00 pursuant to the
Minimum Wage Law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant municipality immediately appealed the case to <span class="GramE">Us</span> on the sole submission that its shortage and lack of
available funds and expected revenue <u>validly exempted it from complying with
the Minimum Wage Law</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal must be dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We have already ans足wered the question posed in <u>Rivera vs. <span class="SpellE">Colago</span></u>, L-12323, <st1:date year="1961" day="24" month="2">February 24, 1961</st1:date>, wherein <span class="GramE">We</span>
ruled that lack of funds of a municipality does not excuse it from paying the
statutory minimum wages to its employees, which, after all, is a <u>mandatory
statutory obligation</u> of the municipality.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To uphold such defense of lack of available funds would render the
Minimum Wage Law futile and defeat its purpose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This also disposes of the implication appellant is trying to make that
its duty to pay minimum wages is not a statutory obligation which would command
preference in the municipal budget and appropriation ordinance.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, <span class="GramE">We</span> cannot sanction appellant's
proposition that it would eventually and gradually implement the Mini足mum Wage
Law, "if and when its revenues can afford." The law - insofar as it
affects government employees - took effect in 1952.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
It should have been implemented - or at least steps to implement it should have
been taken - right then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To excuse the
defendant municipality now would be to permit it to benefit from its
nonfeasance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would also make the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the law dependent upon the will and
initiative of said municipality without statutory sanction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant's remedy, therefore, is not to seek
an excuse from implementing the law but, as the lower court suggested, to
upgrade and improve its tax collection machinery with a view towards realizing
more revenues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or, it could for the
present forego all non-essential expenditures.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed judgment is, as it is hereby,
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
