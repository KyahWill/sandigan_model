was the basis for a motion to quash filed by the accused, now <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Yorac</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was prosecuted for frustrated murder
arising allegedly from having assaulted, attacked, and hit with a piece of wood
the offended party, for which he had been previously tried and sentenced for
slight physical injuries, his plea being one of guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The later information for frustrated murder
was based on a second medical certificate after the lapse of one week from the
former previously given by the same physician who, apparently, was much more
thorough the second time, to the effect that the victim did suffer a greater
injury than was at first ascertained.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lower court, presided by the Honorable Judge Nestor B. <span class="SpellE">Alampay</span>, considering that there was no supervening fact
that would negate the defense of double jeopardy, sustained the motion to quash
in an order of <st1:date year="1968" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The People appealed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the order complained of is fully supported
by the latest authoritative ruling of this Tribunal, People v. <span class="SpellE">Buling</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
we have to affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the brief for the People of the Philippines, it was shown that
the accused <span class="SpellE">Yorac</span> was charged with slight physical
injuries before the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>, the
offended party being a certain Lam Hock who, according to the medical
certificate issued on April 10, 1968 by a Dr. Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Zulueta</span>,
a resident physician of the Occidental <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Provincial Hospital, was confined "since April 8, 1968 up to the present
time for head injury."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Then <span class="GramE">came</span> a plea of guilty by the accused on <st1:date year="1968" day="16" month="4">April 16, 1968</st1:date> resulting in his being
penalized to suffer ten days of <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>menor</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
started serving his sentence forthwith.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1968" day="18" month="4">April 18, 1968</st1:date>,
the provincial fiscal filed <span class="GramE">an information</span>, this time
in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental,
charging the same defendant with frustrated murder arising from the same act
against the aforesaid victim Lam Hock upon another medical certificate dated <st1:date year="1968" day="17" month="4">April 17, 1968</st1:date> issued by the same Dr.
<span class="SpellE">Zulueta</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the medical certificate of <st1:date year="1968" day="17" month="4">April 17,
 1968</st1:date>, it was made to appear that the confinement of the offended
party in the hospital was the result of: "1. Contusion with lacerated
wound 4 inches <span class="SpellE">parieto­occipital</span> region scalp mid portion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">2. Cerebral concussion,
moderately severe, secondary."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, it further contained a statement that the X-ray finding did not yield
any "radiographic evidence of fracture." The healing period, barring
complications, was declared to be from eighteen to twenty-one days.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Afterwards, a motion to quash was filed by the accused on June
10, 1968 on the ground that, having been previously convicted of slight
physical injuries by the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> and
having already served the penalty imposed on him for the very same <span style="">offense, the prosecution for frustrated
murder arising out of the same act committed against the same offended party,
the crime of slight physical injuries necessarily being included in that of
frustrated murder, he would be placed in second jeopardy if indicted for the
new offense.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In its well-reasoned resolution of June 21,
1968 granting the motion to quash and ordering the dismissal of a criminal case
for frustrated murder against the accused, Judge <span class="SpellE">Alampay</span>
relied on People v. <span class="SpellE">Buling</span> which, in his opinion, was
squarely applicable as "nothing in the later medical certificate
[indicated] that a new or supervening fact had developed or arisen since the
time of the filing of the original action" against the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion for reconsideration being
unavailing, an appeal was elevated to us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As succinctly set forth
in the brief of the People of the Philippines:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The sole issue in this case is whether the defendant, who had
already been convicted of slight physical injuries before the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> for injuries inflicted upon Lam Hock, and had
served sentence <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, may be prosecuted anew for
frustrated murder for the same act committed against the same person."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The position taken by appellant is in the
affirmative but, as indicated at the outset, the controlling force of People v.
<span class="SpellE">Buling</span> would preclude us from reversing the
resolution of Judge <span class="SpellE">Alampay</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constitution, to
repeat, is quite explicit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"No
person shall be twice put in jeopardy of punishment for the same offense."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>As Justice Laurel made clear in an
address as delegate before the Constitutional Convention, such a provision
finds its origin "from the days when sanguinary punishments were
frequently resorted to by despots."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
A defendant in a criminal case should there­fore, according to him, be adjudged
either guilty or not guilty and thereafter left alone in peace, in the latter
case the State being precluded from taking an appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
It is in that sense that the right against being twice put in jeopardy is considered
as possessing many features in common with the rule of finality in civil
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the accused is given
assurance that the matter is closed, enabling him to plan his future
accordingly, protecting him from continued distress, not to mention saving both
him and the state from the expenses incident to redundant litigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is likewise the observation that this
constitutional guarantee helps to equalize the adversary capabilities of two
grossly mismatched litigants, a poor and impecunious defendant hardly in a
position to keep on shouldering the costs of a suit.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Then, as a member of the Supreme Court, Justice Laurel had the
first opportunity to give meaning to what, under the Constitution, should be
considered "the same offense." In the case of People v. <span class="SpellE">Tarok</span>, decided in 1941,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
the then comparatively new Rules of Court in its Section <span style="">9 </span>of Rule 113 speaks of a bar to
another prosecution for the offense charged after a defendant shall have been
convicted or acquitted or the case against him dismissed or otherwise
terminated without his express consent, "or for any attempt to commit the
same or frustration thereof or for any offense which necessarily includes or is
necessarily included in the offense charged in the former complaint or information."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the <span class="SpellE">Tarok</span> case, the conviction for
parricide of the accused was sought to be set aside, as previously he had been
indicted for the crime of serious physical injuries, to which he had pleaded
guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was sentenced and was actually
incarcerated by virtue of such penalty imposed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The offended party was his wife whom he hacked with a bolo, his ire
being aroused by certain remarks made by her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While he was thus serving sentence, the victim died, resulting in the
new prosecution for parricide of which he was convicted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal to this Court, it was decided, over
the dissents of the then Justice Moran and Justice Diaz that the offense of
serious physical injuries of which he was found guilty being included in parricide,
his previous conviction was a bar to such subsequent prosecution for the more
serious crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court judgment
of conviction was thus reversed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to Justice Laurel, who spoke for the Court:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"To our mind, the principle embodied in
the New Rules of Court is a clear expression of selection of rule amidst
conflicting <span class="GramE">theories.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We take the position that when we amended section 26 of General Orders
No. 58 by providing that the conviction or acquittal of the defendant or the
dismissal of the case shall be a bar to another prosecution for any offense not
only necessarily therein included but which necessarily includes the offense
charged in the former complaint or information, we meant what we have, in plain
language, stated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We certainly did not
mean to engage in the simple play of words."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a ruling was however
re-examined and set aside in <span class="SpellE">Melo</span> v. People,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
where it was held that an accused who pleaded guilty to the offense of
frustrated homicide, the offended party thereafter dying in the evening of the
same day, could not rely on a plea of double jeopardy if, as a result thereof,
the information was amended to charge him with homicide.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
As was clarified in the opinion of this Court through the then Chief Justice
Moran, one of the dissenters in the <span class="SpellE">Tarok</span> case:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"This rule of identity does not apply,
however, when the second offense was not in existence at the time of the first
prosecution, for the simple reason that in such case there is no possibility
for the accused, during the first prosecution, to be convicted for an offense
that was then inexistent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, where
the accused was charged with physical injuries and after conviction the injured
person dies, the charge for homicide against the same accused does not put him
twice in jeopardy."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Stated differently, if after the first prosecution "a new fact super­venes"
on which defendant may be held liable, resulting in altering the character of
the crime and giving rise to a new and distinct offense, "the accused
cannot be said to be in second jeopardy if indicted for the new offense."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
It is noteworthy, however, that in the <span class="SpellE">Melo</span> ruling,
there was a reiteration of what was so emphatic­ally asserted by Justice Laurel
in the <span class="SpellE">Tarok</span> case in these words:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"As the Government cannot begin with the
highest, and then go down step by step, bringing the man into jeopardy for
every dere­liction included therein, neither can it begin with the lowest and
ascend to the highest with precisely the same result."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is then the
indispensable requirement of the existence of "a new fact [which]
supervenes for which the defendant is responsible" changing the character
of the crime imputed to him and together with the facts existing previously
constituting a new and distinct offense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The conclusion reached in People v. <span class="SpellE">Buling</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">the </span>latest case in point, relied
upon by Judge <span class="SpellE">Alampay</span> in the resolution now on
appeal, war thus predictable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As set
forth in the opinion of Justice Labrador in that case, there was a medical
certification that the wounds for which the accused Buenaventura <span class="SpellE">Buling</span> was first prosecuted for less serious physical
injuries would require medical attendance from a period of from ten days to
fifteen days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He pleaded guilty and was,
on <st1:date year="1956" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1956</st1:date>,
sentenced by the Justice of the Peace of <span class="SpellE">Cabalian</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>, to one month and one day of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">arresto</span></u></span><span style=""> <u>mayor</u>. </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>He started serving his sentence on the same
day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1957" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1957</st1:date>, however, another physician examined the
offended party and with the use of an X-ray apparatus, certified that he did
suffer a fracture requiring a treat­ment of from one and one-half months to two
and one-half months, barring complications.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a result, on <st1:date year="1957" day="20" month="2">February 20,
 1957</st1:date>, <span class="GramE">an information</span> was filed against the
same accused, this time before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, charging him with serious physical injuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stood trial and was found guilty of such
an offense and sentenced to imprisonment of four months of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">arresto</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><u>mayor</u> as minimum to one year
of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">prision</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span></span>
as maximum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal to this Court, his
invocation of the defense of double jeopardy struck a responsive chord, and he
was acquitted.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The opinion of Justice
Labrador explained with clarity why the constitutional right against being put
twice in jeopardy was a bar to the second prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"If the X-ray examination discloses the existence of a fracture on <st1:date year="1957" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1957</st1:date>, that fracture must
have existed when the first examination was made on <st1:date year="1956" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1956</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is, therefore, no new or super­vening
fact that could be said to have developed or arisen since the filing of the
original action, which would justify the application of the ruling enunciated
by us in the cases of <span class="SpellE">Melo</span> vs. People and People vs. <span class="SpellE">Manolong</span>, * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
attribute the new finding of fracture, which evidently lengthened the period of
healing of the wound, to the very superficial and inconclusive examination made
on <st1:date year="1956" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1956</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had an X-ray examination [been] taken at the
time, the fracture would have certainly been disclosed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The wound causing the delay in healing was
already in existence at the time of the first examination, but said delay was
caused by the very superficial examination then made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we have stated, we find therefore that no
supervening fact had occurred which justifies the application of the rule in
the case of <span class="SpellE">Melo</span> vs. People and People vs. <span class="SpellE">Manolong</span>, for which reason we are constrained to apply the
general rule of double jeopardy."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
It is quite apparent, in the light of the foregoing, why the lower court,
submitting to the compulsion of the <span class="SpellE">Buling</span> decision,
had to sustain the motion to quash and to dismiss the information against <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Yorac</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No error could therefore be rightfully
imputed to it.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the resolution of <st1:date year="1968" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1968</st1:date> of Judge Nestor B. <span class="SpellE">Alampay</span>

This is now Section 9 of Rule 117, the original wording being retained
thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"When a defendant shall have been
convicted or acquitted, or the case against him dismissed or otherwise
terminated without the express consent of the defendant, by a court of
competent jurisdiction, upon a valid com­plaint or information or other formal
