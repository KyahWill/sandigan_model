of the First Philippine Constabulary Zone<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found the facts as follows: "(On the evening

<st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00 o'clock</st1:time>, <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span>
<span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span> was inside a store of one <span class="SpellE">Honoria</span> <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span> next to his house
on the same side of the street in the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE">Bamban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was then sitting and eating peanuts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While in that position, Mario <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> alias '<span class="SpellE">Manding</span>', who is
still at large, and the accused Carlos Fernando alias 'Bob', without any
warning, suddenly and unexpectedly fired shots with their .45 caliber pistols
at <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The duo then departed, leaving their victim sprawled outside the store.</p>

<p class="BODY">"<span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> and Fernando were members
of the <span class="SpellE">Hukbalahap</span> Organization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before going to <span class="SpellE">Bamban</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, on the evening of the incident, they were
somewhere within the jurisdiction <span style="">of </span>Angeles
City where they received instruction from one of their commanders, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Ronquillo</span> alias Commander 'Manly', to liquidate <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motive
was that the latter, while an officer of the civi­lian guards, had ordered the
killing of a relative of Commander 'Manly' and the beating up of the father of <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fernando
and <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Salonga</span></span><span style=""> went </span><span style="">to <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bamban</span></span><span style=""> </span>from </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="">Angeles</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> by walking all
along between sugar cane fields.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
the killing of <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span>, they also decamped together
following the same route.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">"The victim, <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span>, was married to <span class="SpellE">Reme­dios</span>
L. <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Two daughters were born out of their wedlock, the elder of whom is 13
years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before his death, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Laxamana</span></span><span style=""> </span>was a member of the Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span> de <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> Planters'
Asso­ciation of that province.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When his
brother-in-law, the late <span class="SpellE">Sinforoso</span> <span class="SpellE">Lomboy</span>, was the Municipal Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Bamban</span>
sometime in 1950, he became a member of the civilian guards or the Civilian
Commando Unit (CCU) in that town with the rank of captain.</p>

<p class="BODY">"That evening of <st1:date year="1961" day="30" month="3">March
 30, 1961</st1:date>, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span> came from the
Catholic church of <span class="SpellE">Bamban</span> with her elder daughter,
Bernadette, While on her way home and when the distance from her house was
about thirty meters, she heard the firing of shots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She took cover in one of the stores; and
after the firing had ceased, she went out and hurriedly proceeded to her
home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In front of the store of <span class="SpellE">Honoria</span> <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span> she saw her
husband sprawled on the ground full of blood.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was not able to come close to him because somebody held her
back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A jeep arrived where her husband
was placed, but not long thereafter, he was brought back already dead."</p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. <span class="SpellE">Honorato</span> Navarro, municipal health
officer of <span class="SpellE">Bamban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>
made the autopsy of the victim's cadaver on the <span style="">same </span><span style="">night </span>of the
murder, and per his necropsy report,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
the victim died of <span style="">"hemorrhage,
massive, secondary to GUNSHOT WOUNDS, multiple (23) in neck, chest, and back,
lumbar region, and upper and lower extremities," many of which were mortal
wounds hitting vital organs in the neck such as the carotid artery and the <span class="SpellE">vagus</span> nerve, both lungs, and the liver, kidneys and
intestines in the lumbar region.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The trial court rejected
the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> testimony at the trial that he did not
fire any shot at the victim but merely stood guard outside the store, and that
his role, after <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> had ceased firing at the
victim was to fire three shots in the air as a signal for them to depart,
thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"(T)he Court entertains a
very serious doubt on the veracity of the above-mentioned statement of the
accused because the same is contrary to what he stated when he was first
investigated by the P.C. after his apprehension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Portion of his written statement (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. F-1) reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">"The answer of the accused to the
above-quoted question No. 13 to the effect that he and <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span>
both used .45 caliber pistols in killing <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span>,
with <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> firing twelve shots and he, three shots,
conveys no other idea than that these three shots he fired were directed at the
victim and not upwards into the air.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court is inclined to believe that this statement is the one in keeping with the
truth, taking into consideration the determination of the accused <span style="">to participate in </span>the killing of <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span> and the number of gun­shot wounds found on the
latter's body."</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, the trial court further held, there was no doubt as
to the existence of conspiracy between the accused and <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span>,
as the accused actively participated in the criminal design of <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> and acted in concert with him, granting <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> that the accused merely stood guard for <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> and that <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> alone
inflicted the 23 gunshot wounds on the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court likewise rejected the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
contention that he should be punished only for the crime of rebellion as the
murder was in pursuance of the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span>' rebellion
movement, since the motive for the killing of the victim was personal, to
avenge the alleged killing of a relative of Commander Manly and the alleged
maltreatment of the father of <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span>, supposedly
ordered by the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court
further pointed out that while the victim had been <span style="">an </span>officer of the civilian guards in <span class="SpellE">Bamban</span>,
that was more than ten year ago in 1950, and the victim was an ordinary
civilian when he was shot in cold blood.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found that "(F)<span class="SpellE">rom</span>
the testimony of the accused himself on the witness stand, it clearly appears
that the firing of the shots which snuffed out the life of <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span>
was sudden and unexpected, without any risk to the assailant which might have
proceeded from the defense of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The crime, <span style="">therefore, committed by the accused is murder, qualified by
treachery," and therefore rendered the following verdict:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>'IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the Court finds the accused CARLOS
FERNANDO alias COMMANDER 'BOB' guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of
MURDER defined and <span style="">penalized under Article 248 of </span><span style="">the Revised Penal
Code, and in view </span><span style="">of the absence of any mitigating or aggravating circumstance attending
the commi­ssion of the crime, hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion
<span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></u></span><span style=""> <span style="">with the accessory penalties
prescribed by law, to indemnify the heirs </span></span><span style="">of <span class="SpellE">B<span style="">ienvenido</span></span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span> in the </span><span style="">sum </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">P6,000.00, without
subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency in view of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">nature of the principal penalty imposed, and to pay the costs."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, the accused-appellant assigns as errors the <span style="">trial court's rejection of his contentions
that his participation </span>in the <span style="">murder
was in furtherance of </span>the <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> movement and
that he should <span style="">have </span>been held <span style="">by virtue of </span>his <span class="SpellE">Huk</span>
membership to have acted under <span style="">the compulsion </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">an </span><span style="">irresistible force </span><span style="">and/or under the impulse </span><span style="">of an </span><span style="">uncontrollable fear </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">an 'equal or greater
injury'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further assigns as error the
trial court's denial </span><span style="">of his motion to dismiss the case filed </span><span style="">on November 4,
1963, after the prosecution had rested its case, on the ground </span><span style="">of double
jeopardy, </span><span style="">on the ground </span><span style="">of his pre­vious conviction on August 31,
1961 by the <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> Court in another case</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> of the crime of
simple rebellion, on his entering a plea of guilty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We
find the trial court's rulings to be in accordance with the evidence and the
law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's contention
that because he and <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> as members of the <span class="SpellE">Hukbalahap</span> organization had received from Commander Manly <span style="">the </span>order to liquidate the victim, the
murder committed by them should have been held in furtherance of and absorbed
by the crime of rebellion, and that they should have been instead charged for
rebellion, is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record is
bereft <span style="">of </span>any evidence that the
murder was committed as a necessary means to commit rebellion or in furtherance
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim had no established
connection with the government at the time.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>

<span style="">besides,
"(T)hat the kill­ing was </span><span style="">in pursuance </span><span style="">of <span style="">the </span></span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Huk</span></span><span style=""> </span>rebellion
is a matter <span style="">of mitigation <span style="">or defense that the accused has the burden
of proving clearly and satisfactorily." <span style="">Far from discharging the burden, appellant him</span>self revealed in his
<span class="SpellE">unrepudiated</span> written confessions that the kill­ing <span style="">was inspired by personal Motives </span>of
avenging the alleged kill­ing of a relative of <span style="">Commander Manly and the alleged Maltreatment </span>of <span class="SpellE">Salonga's</span> father, as ordered by the victim <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Laxamana</span></span><span style="">, and cannot be deemed absorbed </span>by <span style="">the rebellion and should be </span>separately
<span style="">pro­secuted.</span></span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> As held in <u>Hernandez,</u>

organization </span>"is <span style="">no reason
why all his acts and misdeeds should be considered in furtherance of or
absorbed by rebellion." Appellant's contention that Commander <span class="SpellE">Manly's</span> personal motive did not apply to him and that he
merely obeyed as "a mere 'soldier' </span>of the HMB" is of no <span style="">avail either in the face </span>of his
awareness of and acquiescence to the personal motivation and the void of <span style="">any </span>evidence that the <span style="">murder was necessary to the rebellion or in
furtherance thereof.</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Accused next asks the Court to "take judicial notice of the
fact that the <span class="SpellE">Hukbalahap</span> or HMB organization deal
with its members who disobey or refuse to carry out its orders in the most
severe manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A member who disobeys or
refuses to carry out its order may be liquidated or given another form of
severe punishment." On this tenuous premise, he claims that by virtue of
his <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> membership, his participation in the murder
of the victim should have been deemed to be an act under the compulsion of an
irresis­tible force and/or under the impulse of an uncontrollable fear of an
equal or greater injury as to exempt him from criminal liability.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Justice Moreland long set
the norm </span>for the application of these exempting circumstances: "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> before a force can be
considered to be irresistible one, it must produce such an effect upon the
indivi­dual that, in spite of all resistance, it reduces him to a mere ins­trument
and, as such, incapable of committing a crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It must be such that, in spite of the resistance of the person on whom
it operates, it compels his members to act and his mind to obey.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>He must act not only without will but
against will.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Such a force can
never consist in anything which springs primarily from the man him</u><u><span style="">self</span></u><span style="">; it must be a force which acts upon him from
the outside and by means of a third person.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In order that one may take advantage </span><span style="">of subdivision 10 of <span style="">article 8 and allege with success that </span>he <span style="">acted under the impulse of </span></span><span style="">an <span style="">uncontrollable
fear of an equal or greater injury, it must appear that <u>the threat which
caused the uncontrol­</u></span></span><u><span style="">lable fear related to a crime of </span></u><u><span style="">such gravity and so imminent that </span></u><u><span style="">it must safely be said that the ordinary run

Finally, as the murder here had been shown to have been committed not in
