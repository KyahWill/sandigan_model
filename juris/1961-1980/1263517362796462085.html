				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY" style="">This Court has not been reticent in its
expression of sympathy that must be accorded to claims by injured employees or
by his heirs in case of death under the Workmen's Compensation Act.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">Thereby, in this sphere, the

reminder to management that fidelity to such a policy embodied in the
fundamental law as well as to its statutory implementation re­quires a minimum
of resistance to such efforts on the part of labor to have its rights
respected, except in the event of course of a defense justified and
well-founded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seems there is a need
for a reiteration of such an admonition, if this case were typical.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be hoped that it is not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal from a decision of respondent Workmen's
Compensation Commission, petitioner La <span class="SpellE">Mallorca</span>,
notwith­standing the explicit doctrine announced by us in at least two cases to
which its attention was called in the decision now on appeal,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
would still seek to escape from its liability.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We are far from impressed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither apparently was respondent Workmen's Compensation Commission, in
according to claimant <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> <span class="SpellE">Zuñiga</span>
the award to which he was entitled under the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the decision of May 31, 1968 of the Workmen's Compen­sation
Commission, the facts, as noted therein, "duly proved by the
claimant", and what is equally decisive "<span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span>
by respondent", now petitioner before us, are summarized thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> <span class="SpellE">Zuñiga</span> was employed as a driver in the respondent company
and was paid on commission basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
entered the latter's employment in 1960 and he worked seven days a week with an
average commission of P8.00 for a day's work.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On February 10, 1964, while the claimant was driving La <span class="SpellE">Mallorca</span> Taxi No. 223 with two passengers, along the corner
of <span class="SpellE">Quitanlad</span> and Cordillera streets in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, said taxi was bumped by a jeep driven by a
certain Jesus Pinto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence,
the taxi turned turtle thrice and the claimant was rendered un­conscious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claimant was taken by the driver of the
jeep and the two passengers to the Labor Hospital for treatment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the first treatment on the day of the
accident and after taking the medicine prescribed by the Labor Hospital,
claimant felt that the medicine did not cure his suffering.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the third day, he went back to the Labor
Hospital for consultation and he <span style="">was
given </span>another prescription with the instruction that he would undergo
x-ray examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February 18, 1964,
the claimant had himself x-rayed at the National Orthopedic Hospital and the
attending physician informed him that he has a fracture in his spinal column
(first lumbar vertebra).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was <span style="">advised to lay </span>low back flat on the
floor after taking the medicine.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the physical suffering of the claimant became worse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">He
went </span>back to the <st1:place><st1:placename>National</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Orthopedic</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> and he was placed in a
plaster cast to immobilize his injury.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After one month of medical treatment and care at the <st1:place><st1:placename>National</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Orthopedic</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
he was discharged with the instruction to report to said hospital for further
observation or to get a private doctor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Aside from the medical treatment at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Labor</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> and the <st1:place><st1:placename>National</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Orthopedic</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
the claimant was also treated by private physicians.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On account of his injury, the claimant spent
P1,670.00 for medical expenses."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">1. On the above facts, it would appear fairly obvious that the
right to compensation on the part of claimant <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Zuñiga</span> was more than fully established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How did petitioner <span style="">seek </span>to avoid compliance with the plain statutory duty?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would rely on section 6 of the Workmen's
Compensation Act to the effect that an employee could elect to proceed against
a third party whom he would hold responsible for the injuries sustained, in
view of a criminal action filed against the owner of the jeep responsible for
the accident.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner would advance such an argument un­deterred by previous explicit
pronouncements of this Court to the contrary.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was not surprising at all then why respondent Workmen's Compensation
Commission could not yield assent to such a plea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the appealed decision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The contention of respondent that when
claimant filed the physical injury case against Jesus Pinto, with whom he had
an accident, claimant had elected to claim against Jesus Pinto and the monetary
settlement between them has the effect of releasing the respondent from
liability, cannot be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere
in the above-quoted section can we find or deduce that the filing of a criminal
action arising out of the injury caused by a third person as well as the
settlement of the same as an incident thereof would bar the recovery of
compensation against the employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
our consi­dered view that the settlement between Jesus Pinto and the claimant
cannot be deemed an election within the meaning of Sec. 6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in one case the Supreme Court ruled
that the filing of a criminal action does not bar recovery of a workmen's
compensation claim, and we quote:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'As to
the alleged "amicable settlement", it consists of an affidavit
wherein, for the sum of 150 pesos, <span class="SpellE">Mamador's</span> widow
promised "to forgive <span class="SpellE">Macunat</span> for the wrong
committed and not to bring him before the authorities for
prosecution".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon making such
promise - petitioner argues - she elected one of the remedies, (against the
third person) and is barred from the other remedy (against the em­ployer).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention may not be sustained, inasmuch
as <span style="">all </span>the widow promised was
to forego the offender's criminal prose­cution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She did not promise to waive the civil action for damages.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, petitioner, still unconvinced, would expect us to
reverse respondent Commission precisely for obedience to and compliance with
what we held.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is optimism carried
to excess.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is far from
warranted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The matter has been fully
considered by us, and we have reached the conclusion that the filing of a
criminal complaint is not such an election <span style="">as </span>would suffice to exempt an employer from his liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We adhere to it.</p>

<p class="BODY">What former Justice, later Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>,
said in <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span> Iron Mines Agents, Inc. v.
Workmen's Compensation Commission<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
still carry conviction:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is the
petitioner's contention that Criminal Case No. 1491 and its outcome constituted
an election by the employee (or his heirs) to sue the third person, such
election having the effect of releasing the employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, Criminal Case No. 1491 was not a
suit <u>for</u> <u>damages</u> against the third person, it being alleged,
without contradiction that the heirs did not intervene therein and have not so
far received the indemnity ordered by the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, we have already decided in Nava
vs. <span class="SpellE">Inchausti</span> Co. that the indemnity granted the
heirs in a criminal prosecution of the 'other person' does not affect the
liability of the employer to pay compensation."</p>

<p class="BODY">As a matter of fact, earlier that same year, in Martha Lumber
Mill v. <span class="SpellE">Lagradante</span>, this Court, speaking through the
then Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, had committed itself to
such a <span style="">view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "The petitioner observes that <span class="SpellE">Felicito</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagradante's</span> killers
were finally convicted in G. R. No. L-5512 of this Court and his heirs were
awarded indemnity, and cites the decision in <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span>
<span style="">vs. </span>Guido, 38 Off. <span class="SpellE">Gaz</span>., 3156, to the effect that the heirs of the deceased <u>hacienda</u>
manager, murdered by his pre­decessor who had been dismissed, were not entitled
to the benefit of the Workmen's Compensation Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the <span style="">case cited, </span>however, </span>it <span style="">was held that the deceased manager was not </span>an industrial
employee in the sense contemplated by the law, and therefore it is not
controlling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, in <span style="">Nava vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Ynchausti</span>
<span style="">Steamship </span>Co., 67 Phil. 751, it
was ruled that, although the death of the employee therein involved resulted
from a deliberate act of the killer and the latter was convicted of homicide,
the said employee died from an accident, and the <span style="">obligation of </span>the employer to compensate was unaffected by the <span style="">liability of the killer </span>to indemnify
the heirs of the deceased which <span style="">‘is </span>wholly
distinct from the obligation imposed by the Workmen's <span style="">Compensation </span>Act and the latter is in no sense subsidiary to
former.’ While in G.R. No. L-5512 it was found that the motive <span style="">for the killing of <span class="SpellE">Felicito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lagradante</span> was robbery, we cannot overlook the
admission of the petitioner, <span style="">contained </span>in
its letter dated March 24, 1951, and addressed to Ramon <span class="SpellE">Lagradante</span>,
father of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Felicito</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagradante</span>,
that 'the mastermind stated in his confession that he bore a grudge against <span class="SpellE">Felicito</span> in view of <span class="SpellE">Felicito's</span>
having re placed him in his former job, adding that it was <span class="SpellE">Felicito</span>
who was responsible for his ousting.'”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A decisive consideration, much more compelling in character
precludes acceptance of the view now pressed by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Time and time again, we have stressed that
statutes intended to benefit labor should <span style="">be accorded </span>the most hospitable scope to attain their dominant
purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereby, fidelity is manifested
to the constitutional policy embodied in the principle of social justice and
the mandate of protection to labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
cannot be made to yield <span style="">a meaning </span>that
would emasculate their terms or allow evasion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To do so could even give rise to serious constitutional questions, for
the legislative body would then be deemed to have enacted measures which,
rather than trans­late into reality such worthy constitutional objective would
frustrate it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an approach certainly
cannot find any favor with courts, if the oft-repeated doctrine that no <span style="">inter</span>pretation is allowable that would
bring doubts as to the validity of any statutory provision for repugnancy to
the fundamental law were to be, <span style="">as </span>it
should be, respected.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2. There is an even more formidable obstacle to the <span style="">success </span>of this petition to set aside
the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As noted therein: "Considering therefore
that the injury sustained by the claimant arose out of and in the course of his
employment and respondent company having failed to controvert the right of the
claimant within the ten-day period prescribed in Section 45 of the Act, the
compensability of the present claim, <span style="">its
reasonableness and validity, is now <span style="">beyond
challenge."</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The absence of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>
is fatal to any defense that peti­tioner could interpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we have held in a host <span style="">of </span><span style="">decisions</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
