CRUZ <br>Party of the Second Part <br>(On his own behalf) <br>1118 Craig St., Sampaloc Manila" </p>&nbsp; </blockquote> </blockquote> <p>It appearing from the records that only the Director of Forest Development interposes no objection thereto "subject however to the concurrence of the Solicitor General's Office and the requirements of existing and applicable forest policies, laws and regulations" (pp. 318, 323, Rec. of L-40740; pp. 1069, 1079, L-38663), this Court required the Solicitor General to comment on the same and to inform this Court if there is any objection thereto on the part of the other respondent public officials in Civil Case No. 9637 before the Manila Court of First Instance, but who are not respondents in these two cases at bar. </p><p>Conformably to the said resolution, the Solicitor General, acting thru Assistant Solicitor General Nathaniel P. de Pano, Jr. and Solicitor Leonardo I. Cruz, on March 29, 1978, submitted the following - </p><blockquote>&nbsp; <p align="center">"C O M M E N T </p>&nbsp; <p>"COME NOW the undersigned counsel, in compliance with this Honorable Court's Resolution, dated February 1, 1978, respectfully submit this comment: </p>&nbsp; <p>"1. By the instant petition, petitioner Jose C. Briones, Jr. seeks the nullification of the Court of Appeals' decision, dated January 2, 1975, in CA-G.R. No. 03196-R (Annex A of the petition). Said decision held the petitioner to have no legal standing in Civil Case No. 90327, entitled '<em>Jose E. P. Cruz, et al., Petitioners, vs. The Executive Secretary, et al., Respondents</em>', of the Court of First Instance of Manila (Branch XXVII), <em>after having been declared in default therein</em>; </p>&nbsp; <p>"2. Petitioner and the respondents Jose E. P. Cruz, Pedro B. de Jesus, P.B. de Jesus and Co., Inc. and Agusan del Sur Timber Corporation, now seek to dismiss the instant petition, on the ground that they have entered into a compromise agreement on January 27, 1978 (served upon the Office of the Solicitor General on March 20, 1978), the salient portions of which are quoted hereunder: </p>&nbsp; <p align="center">"xxx xxx xxx" </p>&nbsp; <p>"3. The instant petition, therefore, by virtue of the participation of petitioner Jose C. Briones, Jr., in the aforementioned compromise agreement, has become moot and academic and should, consequently, be dismissed; </p>&nbsp; <p>"4. It should be pointed out, however, that the said compromise agreement will have no binding effect as against the Secretary of Natural Resources, the Executive Secretary and the Director of Forest Development who are <em>not</em> parties in the instant case, nor participants in the aforesaid compromise agreement. The compromise agreement thus binds the parties thereto, exclusively, and suffices for the dismissal of the present petition. It does not, however, foreclose the Secretary of Natural Resources, and the Office of the President from asserting their rights vis-a-vis the same compromise agreement before the trial court where the main case is pending. </p>&nbsp; <p align="center">"<em>CONCLUSION</em> </p>&nbsp; <p>"The undersigned counsel express the view that the instant case, by reason of the execution of the compromise agreement which was participated in by no less than the herein petitioner, Jose C. Briones, Jr., may be dismissed for being moot and academic. </p>&nbsp; <p>"The subject compromise agreement, however, cannot, and does not, bind the Office of the President and the Secretary of Natural Resources who are <em>not</em> parties in this case, nor participants in the said compromise agreement, especially in the light of subsequent decrees and other laws relative to forest development and conservation. Thus, the dismissal of this case, based on the said compromise agreement, must be without prejudice to the rights of the Republic, as the same does not have a binding effect against the Office of the President and the Secretary of Natural Resources." </p> </blockquote> <p>Neither the Solicitor General nor the Director of Forest Development asserts that the aforesaid compromise agreement is contrary to law, public order, public policy or morals. </p><p>However, the Director of Forest Development qualifies his conformity to the compromise agreement that the same is subject to "the requirements of existing and applicable forest policies, laws and regulations." </p><p>The Solicitor General, on the other hand, stresses that the said compromise agreement should not bind the Office of the President and the Secretary of Natural Resources who are not parties in these two cases. </p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, THE COMPROMISE AGREEMENT EXECUTED ON JANUARY 27, 1978 BETWEEN PETITIONERS AND THE PRIVATE RESPONDENTS IN THESE TWO CASES IS HEREBY APPROVED, AND THE PARTIES ARE ENJOINED TO ABIDE BY AND TO COMPLY WITH THE TERMS THEREOF. </p><p>THE SAID COMPROMISE AGREEMENT SHALL NOT BIND THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE SECRETARY OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND SHALL ALWAYS BE SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE APPLICABLE FOREST LAWS, POLICIES AND REGULATIONS. </p><p>THESE TWO CASES ARE HEREBY DISMISSED, CLOSED AND TERMINATED. NO COSTS. </p><p><em>Teehankee, (Chairman), Santos, Fernandez</em>, and <em>Guerrero, JJ.</em>, concur.</p> </div>
