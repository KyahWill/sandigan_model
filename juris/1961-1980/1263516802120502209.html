				<H3>NICANOR BALTAZAR, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. SAN MIGUEL BREWERY, INC., DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal taken by San Miguel Brewery, Inc. to reverse the decision
of the Court of First Instance of Manila in Civil Case No. 32478 ordering it to
pay appellee Nicanor M. Baltazar the total amount of P1,680.00 representing his
separation pay of one (1) month and the money value - at the rate of P240.00
monthly - of six months accumulated sick leave he was entitled to.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that Baltazar was appointed salesman-in­-charge of
appellant's Dagupan warehouse on October 1, 1955 with a basic monthly pay of
P240.00, P5.00 per diem and <span style="">a </span>commission
of P.075 per case sold.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 9, 1956 sixteen regular workers at appel­lant's
Dagupan warehouse went on a strike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
the purpose of relieving the tension prevailing at the place - because it <span style="">was </span>alleged
that the unfair treatment dispensed to the employees by Baltazar was the cause
of the strike - Baltazar was recalled to appellants Manila office on October 13
of the same year <span style="">upon recommendation of
its sales supervisor </span>and industrial relations officer, who found out,
after a personal investigation, that the employees<span style="">'</span> grievance <span style="">was </span>well founded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The day
following Baltazar<span style="">'</span>s recall to
Manila the strikers returned to work voluntarily.</p>

<p class="BODY">When Baltazar reported at appellant's main office in Manila on
October 15, 1956, the latter's sales supervisor informed him that he was not to
return to Dagupan anymore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
he reported for work at the main office afore­said from October 16, 1956 until
November 2 of the same year, apparently without being given any specific work
or <span style="">assignment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From November 3, 1956 up to December 19 of
the same year, or </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">period of more than one end one-half month,
he absented himself from work without prior autho­rity from his superiors and
without advising them or any­body else of the reason for his prolonged
absence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For </span>this reason,
pursuant firstly, to existing rules and re­gulations considering ten unexcused
or unauthorized absences within <span style="">a
calendar year </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">sufficient ground for an outright dismissal
from employment, and secondly, the provisions of </span>appellant's health,
welfare end retirement plan requiring <span style="">that
sick leave, to be considered authorized or excusable, </span>must be certified
to by the company physician, appellant, <span style="">by
</span><span style="">a </span><span style="">letter dated December 31, 1956, informed Baltazar that he was dismissed
for cause effective November 30 of the same year.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Four months later, or more specifically on May 2, 1957, Baltazar
commenced the present action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
trial upon the issues arising from the parties' pleadings, the trial court
ruled that Baltazar's dismissal <span style="">was </span>justified,
and, <span style="">as a </span>consequence, dismissed
his complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For insufficiency of
evidence, the court also dismissed appellant's counterclaim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But despite the dismissal of Baltazar<span style="">'</span>s com­plaint end the finding that his
dismissal from employment <span style="">was for
cause, the trial </span>court ordered appellant to pay him <span style="">one month separation pay, plus the </span><span style="">c</span><span style="">a</span><span style="">sh </span><span style="">value
of six months accumulated sick leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
</span><span style="">We </span><span style="">are now urged to reverse this portion of the
decision upon the following grounds:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"I.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial court erred in requiring the </span>defendant-appellant
to pay separation <span style="">pay </span>after having found and declared as an established fact <span style="">that the dismissal of pla</span><span style="">i</span><span style="">ntiff-appellee
was fully justified.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"II.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court erred in awarding
plaintiff-appellee the money equivalent of an 'accumulated sick leave of six <span style="">(6) </span>months as terminal leave<span style="">'</span> despite its express findings to the
effect that (1) sick leave benefits un­der defendant-appellant<span style="">’</span><span style="">s</span> health, welfare and retirement plan may be
enjoyed only if and when the sickness is certified to by the company physician
- <span style="">a </span>requirement which was <span style="">admittedly not
complied </span>with, and (2) said benefits are ‘<span style="">non-commutative end may not therefore be commuted to </span><span style="">cash'."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found that appellee's absence for forty-eight
successive days <span style="">was </span>without permission
or authority of his superiors and, as a result, ruled that it was sufficient
cause for his dismissal in accordance with the rules and regulations of his
employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This must be deemed final,
because <span style="">Baltazar
did not appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is settled in this jurisdiction that one not employed for <span style="">a </span>definite <span style="">period is not entitled to one month notice or
to one month salary in lieu thereof if his dismissal was </span><span style="">for cause (Republic Act No. 1052; Marcaida
vs. Philippine Education Company, 53 O.G. No. 23, p. 8559).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the Marcaida case this Court, speaking
through the now Chief Justice Roberto Concepcion, said the following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"Republic Act No. 1052
</span>makes reference to termination of employment, instead of dismissal,
precisely to exclude employees separated from <span style="">the service </span><span style="">for causes attributable to their own fault.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Again, Republic Act No. 1052 is limited in its operation, to
cases of employment without definite period.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the employment is for <span style="">a </span>fixed
dura­tion, the employer may terminate it even before the expiration of the
stipulated period, should there be <span style="">a </span>substantial
<span style="">breach </span>of his obligations by <span style="">the employee; (Articles 1169, 1191 and 1198,
Civil Code of the Philippines; </span><span style="">Pabalan
</span><span style="">vs. Velez, 22 Phil. 29; Gonzales
vs. Haberer, 47 Phil. 380; Hodges vs. Gra­nada, 59 Phil. </span><span style="">429; </span><span style="">De </span><span style="">la </span><span style="">Cruz vs. Legaspi, </span><span style="">51 </span><span style="">Off. </span><span style="">Gaz. 6212) in which
event the latter is not entitled to advance notice or separation pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would, patently, be absurd to grant </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">right thereto to an employee guilty of </span><span style="">t</span><span style="">he same breach of
obligation, when the employment is without </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">definite period, as if
he were en­titled to greater protection than employees engaged for a fixed
duration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x x </span><span style="">x.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is </span><span style="">doubtful whether Congress could validly re­quire the employer to give
the separation </span><span style="">pay </span><span style="">in question </span><span style="">if the </span><span style="">employment were
terminated due to the fault of the employee.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the imposition of said obligation, under such conditions, would
expose Republic Act No. 1052 to the charge that it would con­stitute an
unreasonable restraint upon the liberty of the employer, and a deprivation of
his property without due process </span><span style="">of
law."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We rule therefore that appellee is not entitled to one month
separation pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">In connection <span style="">with the </span>question
of whether or not appellee is entitled to the cash value of six months accumulated
sick leave, it appears that while under the <span style="">last paragraph of Article 5 of appellant'</span>s<span style=""> </span>Rules a<span style="">nd </span>Re­gulations of the Health, Welfare and Retirement Plan
(Exhibit 3), unused sick <span style="">leave </span>may
be accumulated up to a maximum of six months, the same is not commutable or pay­able
in cash upon the employee's option.</p>

<p class="BODY">In our view, the only meaning and import of said rule end
regulation is that if on employee does not choose to enjoy his yearly sick
leave of thirty days, he may accumulate <span style="">such
</span><span style="">sick
leave up </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">a </span>maximum
of six months <span style="">and enjoy this six months
sick leave at the end of the sixth year but may not commute it to cash.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed <span style="">decision </span><span style="">is </span>hereby reversed, without special
pronouncement as to costs.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED">It <span style="">is </span>so ordered.</p>
