				<BR><STRONG>CASTRO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Court denies the present petition for review of the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals dated October 1, 1965 in its CPA Case No. 1438, which dismissed the appeal filed by the petitioner Surigao Electric Company, Inc. with the tax court on August 1, 1963 on the ground that it was time-barred.<br><br>In November 1961 the petitioner Surigao Electric Co., Inc., grantee of a legislative electric franchise, received a warrant of distraint and levy to enforce the collection from "Mainit Electric" of a deficiency franchise tax plus surcharge in the total amount of P718,59.&nbsp; In a letter to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the petitioner contested this warrant, stating that it did not have a franchise in Mainit, Surigao.<br><br>Thereafter the Commissioner, by letter dated April 2 1961, advised the petitioner to take up the matter with the General Auditing Office, enclosing a copy of the 4th Indorsement of the Auditor General dated November 23, 1960.&nbsp; This indorsement, indicated that the petitioner's liability for deficiency franchise tax for the period from September 1947 to June 1959 was P21,156,06, excluding surcharge.&nbsp; Subsequently, in a letter to the Auditor General dated August 2, 1962, the petitioner asked for reconsideration of the assessment, admitting liability only for the 2% franchise tax in accordance with its legislative franchise and not at the higher rate of 5% imposed by section 259 of the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended, which latter rate the Auditor General used as basis in computing the petitioner's deficiency franchise tax.<br><br>An exchange of correspondence between the petitioner, on the one hand, and the Commissioner and the Auditor General, on the other, ensued, all on the matter of the petitioner's liability for deficiency franchise tax.<br><br>The controversy culminated in a revised assessment dated April 29, 1963 (received by the petitioner on May 8, 1963) in the amount of P11,533.53, representing the petitioner' s deficiency franchise tax and surcharges thereon for the period from April 1, 1956 to June 30, 1959.&nbsp; The petitioner then requested a recomputation of the revised assessment in a letter to the Commissioner dated June 6, 1963 (sent by registered mail on June 7, 1963).&nbsp; The Commissioner, however, in a letter dated June 28, 1963 (received by the petitioner on July 16, 1963), denied the request for recomputation.<br><br>On August 1, 19 63 the petitioner appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals.&nbsp; The tax court dismissed the appeal on October 1, 1965 on the ground that the appeal was filed beyond the thirty-day period of appeal provided by section 11 of Republic Act 1125.<br><br>Hence, the present recourse.<br><br>The case at bar raises only one issue:&nbsp; whether or not the petitioner's appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals was time-barred.&nbsp; The parties disagree on which letter of the Commissioner embodies the decision or ruling appealable to the tax court.<br><br>A close reading of the numerous letters exchanged between the petitioner and the Commissioner clearly discloses that the letter of demand issued by the Commissioner on April 29, 1963 and received by the petitioner on May 8, 1963 constitutes the definite determination of the petitioner's deficiency franchise tax liability or the decision on the disputed assessment and, therefore, the decision appealable to the tax court.&nbsp; This letter of April 29, 1963 was in response to the communications of the petitioner, particularly the letter of August 2, 1962 wherein it assailed the 4th Indorsement's data and findings on its deficiency franchise tax liability computed at 5% (on the ground that its franchise precludes the imposition of a rate higher than the 2% fixed in its legislative franchise), and the letter of April 24, 1963 wherein it again questioned the assessment and requested for a recomputation (on the ground that the Government could make an assessment only for the period from May 29, 1956 to June 30, 1959).&nbsp; Thus, as early as August 2, 1962, the petitioner already disputed the assessment made by the Commissioner.<br><br>Moreover, the letter of demand dated April 29, 1963 unquestionably constitutes the final action taken by the Commissioner on the petitioner's several requests for reconsideration and recomputation.&nbsp; In this letter, the Commissioner not only in effect demanded that the petitioner pay the amount of P11,533.53 but also gave warning that in the event it failed to pay, the said Commissioner would be constrained to enforce the collection thereof by means of the remedies provided by law.&nbsp; The tenor of the letter, specifically the statement regarding the resort to legal remedies, unmistakably indicates the final nature of the determination made by the Commissioner of the petitioner's deficiency franchise tax liability.<br><br>The foregoing view accords with settled jurisprudence and this despite the fact that nothing in Republic Act 1125,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> as amended, even remotely suggests the element truly determinative of the appealability to the Court of Tax Appeals of a ruling of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.&nbsp; Thus, this Court has considered the following communications sent by the Commissioner to taxpayers as embodying rulings appealable to the tax court:&nbsp; (a) a letter which stated the result of the reinvestigation requested by the taxpayer and the consequent modification of the assessment;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> (b) a letter which denied the request of the taxpayer for the reconsideration, cancellation, or withdrawal of the original assessment;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> (c) a letter which contained a demand on the taxpayer for the payment of the revised or reduced assessment;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and (d) a letter which notified the taxpayer of a revision of previous assessments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>To sustain the petitioner's contention that the Commissioner's letter of June 28, 1963 denying its request for further amendment of the revised assessment constitutes the ruling appealable to the tax court and that the thirty-day period should, therefore, be counted from July 16, 1963, the day it received the June 28, 1963 letter would, in effect, leave solely to the petitioner's will the determination of the commencement of the statutory thirty-day period, place the petitioner -- and for that matter, any taxpayer -- in position to delay at will and on convenience the finality of a tax assessment.&nbsp; This absurd interpretation espoused by the petitioner would result in grave detriment to the interests of the Government, considering that taxes constitute its life-blood and their prompt and certain availability is an imperative need.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The revised assessment embodied in the Commissioner's letter dated April 29, 1963 being, in legal contemplation, the final ruling reviewable by the tax court, the thirty-day appeal period should be counted from May 8, 1963 (the day the petitioner received a copy of the said letter).&nbsp; From May 8, 1963 to June 7, 1938 (the day the petitioner, by registered mail, sent to the Commissioner its letter of June 6, 1963 requesting for further recomputation of the amount demanded from it) saw the lapse of thirty days.&nbsp; The June 6, 1963 request for further recomputation, partaking of a motion for reconsideration, tolled the running of the thirty-day period from June 7, 1963 (the day the petitioner sent its letter by registered mail) to July 16, 1963 (the day the petitioner received the letter of the Commissioner dated June 28, 1963 turning down its request.&nbsp; The prescriptive period commenced to run again on July 16, 1963.&nbsp; The petitioner filed its petition for review with the tax court on August 1, 1963 -- after the lapse of an additional sixteen days.&nbsp; The petition for review having been filed beyond the thirty-day period, we rule that the Court of Tax Appeals correctly dismissed the same.<br><br>The thirty-day period prescribed by section 11 of Republic Act 1125, as amended, within which a taxpayer adversely affected by a decision of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue should file his appeal with the tax court, is a jurisdictional requirement,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and the failure of a taxpayer to lodge his appeal within the prescribed period bars his appeal and renders the questioned decision final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Prescinding from all the foregoing, we deem it appropriate to state that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue should always indicate to the taxpayer in clear and unequivocal language whenever his action on an assessment questioned by a taxpayer constitutes his final determination on the disputed assessment, as contemplated by sections 7 and 11 of Republic Act 1125, as amended.&nbsp; On the basis of this indicium indubitably showing that the Commissioner's communicated action is his final decision on the contested assessment the aggrieved taxpayer would then be able to take recourse to the tax court at the opportune time.&nbsp; Without needless difficulty, the taxpayer would be able to determine when his right to appeals to the tax court accrues.&nbsp; This rule of conduct would also obviate all desire and opportunity on the part of the taxpayer to continually delay the finality of the assessment -- and, consequently, the collection of the amount demanded as taxes -- by repeated requests for recomputation and reconsideration.&nbsp; On the part of the Commissioner, this would encourage his office to conduct a careful and thorough study of every questioned assessment and render a correct and indefinite decision thereon in the first instance.&nbsp; This would also deter the Commissioner from unfairly making the taxpayer grope in the dark and speculate as to which action constitutes the decision appealable to the tax court.&nbsp; Of greater import, this rule of conduct would meet a pressing need for fair play, regularity, and orderliness in administrative action.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY,</b> the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals dated October 1, 1965 is affirmed, at petitioner's cost.<br><br><i>Makalintal, C.J., Makasiar, Esguerra,</i> and <i>Muñoz Palma, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Teehankee, J., </i>concurs in a separate opinion.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> AN ACT CREATING THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Pangasinan Transportation Co., Inc. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Blaquera, L-13101, April 29, 1960, 107 Phil. 975.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Villamin <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Court of Tax Appeals and Collector of Internal Revenue, L-11536, October 31, 1960, 109 Phil. 896;
