				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal on purely questions of law taken by the Na­tional
Waterworks and Sewerage Authority, hereinafter re­ferred to as NAWASA, from the
order issued on February 20, 1967 by the Court of Industrial Relations,
referred to here­inafter as CIR, for the former to deposit the amount of
P99,332.21 representing overtime, night time, Sunday, holi­day and basic time
salaries, within thirty days (Annex D attached to the Petition for Review), and
from the <span class="SpellE">CIR's</span> resolution, en banc dated March 13,
1967 (attached to the petition for review as Annex F) denying <span class="SpellE">NAWASA's</span> motion for reconsideration, both issued in Cases
Nos. 19-IPA, 19-IPA(1) and 19-IPA(2).</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that on January 16, 1961 the CIR issued in the
abovementioned cases an order awarding additional compensation to Engineer
Jesus <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span> and 12 others - re­ferred to in the
record as <span class="SpellE">Intervenors</span> - for work rendered in excess
of eight hours a day, as well as for work rendered at night time, etc., the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In view thereof, we are of the opinion and so hold, that the
respondent Company shall pay to the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> who
have not been paid the additional compensation of 25% of their basic salary for
services rendered in excess of the regular eight (8) hours a day, from February
6, 1956 onward, the same, benefit ef­fective on the same date, based on the
written authorizations of the General Manager of the NAWASA x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In relation to their claims for additional compen­sation for work
rendered on Sundays and legal holidays be­fore and after the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of Republic Act 1880 and also on Saturdays
after the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of said law, the CIR said the
following:</p>

<blockquote>"The <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>, in their
memorandum, wanted to include the claim for additional compensation for
services rendered on Sundays and legal holidays before and after the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of Republic Act No. 1880 and also on Saturdays
after the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the said law, contending
that Saturday becomes an off-day or day of rest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This particular claim is not covered by the
present petition, which only seeks payment of additional pay­ment for night
work and overtime pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records show
that the respondent company interposed its timely objection to the evidence
tending to establish such claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">inter­venors</span> did not file any amended petition covering the
claim for extra premium for work performed on Saturdays, Sundays end legal
holidays, contrary to their announcement made in open court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And neither was it touched by the respondent
company during the presentation of its evidence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We are, therefore, of the opinion that it will be improper
and illegal to take cognizance of and consider in this case such claim of the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To implement its provisions, the same order directed the Chief
Examiner of the CIR to make the necessary computation to determine said
additional compensation in accord­ance with its findings, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> to
proceed to the office of the National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority to
examine the payrolls and other pertinent records and to make the necessary
computation for additional compensation <u>for work on Sundays and legal
holidays</u>, distress pay, wage differentials night compensation and overtime
pay of the employees and laborers concerned in accord­ance with the findings of
the Court." (Under­lines Supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In connection with the portion of the order of January 16, 1961
quoted in the immediately preceding paragraph, We have noticed that the
petition for review under consideration has, on page three thereof and after
the words "for work", deliberately omitted the following words
"on Sundays end legal holidays, distress pay, wage differentials",
presum­ably to bolster petitioner's claim that, in the body of the order
itself, the CIR had expressed the opinion that it was improper and illegal to
take cognizance of, and consider the claim of the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>
for additional compensation for ser­vices rendered on Sundays and legal
holidays before and after the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of RA 1880
and also on Saturdays after the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of said
law in the proceedings then before it.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears further that in National Waterworks and Sewerage
Authority, Petitioner vs. NWSA Consolidated Unions and others (G. R. No.
L-18938) in which the <span class="SpellE">CIR's</span> order of <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1961</st1:date> was directly
involved, We said, inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>, the following:</p>

<blockquote>"Acting on a certification of the President of the
Philippines, the Court of Industrial Re­lations conducted a hearing on December
5, 1957 on the controversy then existing between petitioner and respondent
unions which the latter embodied in a 'Manifesto' dated December 5, 1957,
namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>implementation of the 40-Hour
Week Law (Republic Act No. 1880); alleged violations of the collective bar­gaining
agreement dated December 28, 1956 concerning 'distress pay'; minimum wage of
P5.25; promotional appointments and filling of vacancies of newly creat­ed
positions; additional compensation for night work; wage increases to some
laborers and employees; and strike duration pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition, respondent unions raised the
issue of whether the 25% addi­tional compensation for Sunday work should be
included in computing the daily wage and whether, in determining the daily wage
of a monthly salaried employee, the salary should be divided by 30 days.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On December 13, 1957, petitioner and respondent unions,
conformably to a suggestion of the Court of Industrial Relations, submitted a.
joint stipulation of facts on the issues concerning the 40-Hour Week Law,
'distress pay,' minimum wage of P5.25, filling of vacancies, night
compensation, and salary adjust­ments, reserving the right to present evidence
on matters not covered therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1957" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1957</st1:date>, respondent <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> filed a petition in interven­tion on the issue
for additional compensation for night work.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Later, however, they amended their pe­tition by including a new demand for
overtime pay in favor of Jesus <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>, Cesar
Cabrera, Feliciano <span class="SpellE">Duiguan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Remotigue</span>, and other employees re­ceiving P4,200.00
per annum or more.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On February 5, 1958, petitioner filed a motion to dismiss the
claim for overtime pay alleging that respondent Court of Industrial Relations
was without jurisdiction to pass upon the same because, as mere <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>, the latter cannot raise new issues not
litigated in the principal case, the same not being, the <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>mota</u></span> therein involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this motion the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>
filed an opposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, res­pondent
court issued an order allowing the issue to be litigated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's motion to reconsider having been
denied, it filed its answer to the pe­tition for intervention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, on <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1961</st1:date>, respondent court rendered its decision
stating substantially as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The NAWASA is an agency not performing govern­mental
functions and, therefore, <u>is liable to pay additional compensation for work
on Sundays and legal holidays</u> conformably to Commonwealth Act No. 444,
known as the Eight-Hour Labor Law, even if said days should be within the
staggered five-work days author­ized by the President; <u>the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> do not fall within the category of 'managerial
employees' as contemplated in Republic Act 2377 and so are not exempt from the
coverage of the Eight-Hour Labor Law</u>; even those <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>
attached to the General Auditing Office and the Bureau of Public Works come
within the purview of Commonwealth Act. No. 444; the computation followed by
NAWASA in computing overtime compensation is contrary to Commonwealth Act 444;
the <span class="SpellE">undertime</span> of a worker should not be set-off
against the worker in determining whether the latter has rendered service in
excess of eight hours for that day; <u>in computing the daily wage of those
employed on daily basis, the additional 25% compensation for Sunday work should
be included</u>; the computation used by the NAWASA for monthly salaried
employees, to wit, dividing the monthly basic pay by 30 is erroneous; the
minimum wage awarded by respondent court <span class="SpellE">wayback</span> on
November 25, 1950 in Case No. 359-V entitled MWD Workers Union v. Metropolitan
Water District, applies even to those who were employed long after the
promulgation of the award and even if the workers are hired only as temporary,
emergency and casual workers for a definite period and for a particular
project; the authority granted to NAWASA by the President to stagger the
working days of its workers should be limited exclu­sively to those specified
in the authorization and should not be extended to others who are not therein
specified; and under the collective bargaining agreement entered into between
the NAWASA and respondent unions on December 28, 1956, as well as under Reso­lution
No. 29, series of 1957 of the Grievance Com­mittee, even those who work outside
the sewerage chambers should be paid 25% additional compensation as 'distress
pay.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Its motion for reconsideration having been denied, NAWASA
filed the present petition for re­view raising merely questions of law."</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>It is to be noted, however, that in the case at bar it has
been stipulated that prior to the enactment of Republic Act No. 1880, providing
for the implementation of the 40-Hour Week Law, the Metropoli­tan Water
District had been paying 25% additional compensation for work on Sundays and
legal holidays to its employees and laborers by virtue of Resolution No. 47,
series of 1948, of its Board of Directors, which practice was continued by the
NAWASA when the latter took over the service.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>And in the collective latter took
bargaining agreement entered into between the NAWASA and respondent unions it
was agreed that all existing benefits enjoyed by the employees and laborers
prior to its <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> shall remain in force and
shall form part of the agreement, among which certainly is the 25% additional
compensation for work on Sundays and legal holidays theretofore enjoyed by said
laborers and employees</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may,
therefore, be said that while under Commonwealth Act No. 444 a public utility
is not required to pay additional compensation to its employees and workers for
work done on Sundays end legal holidays, there is, however, no prohibition for
it to pay such additional compensation if it voluntarily agrees to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The NAWASA committed itself to pay this
additional compensation.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>It must
pay not because of compulsion of law but be­cause of contractual obligation</u>."<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In further implementation of its order of <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1961</st1:date>, as modified by Us in G. R.
L-18938, the CIR issued on <st1:date year="1964" day="5" month="10">October 5,
 1964</st1:date> an order holding in abeyance the writ of execution issued in
connection with the former until after a complete report upon the matter had
been submitted to it, saying the following in its <span class="SpellE">dis­positive</span>
portion:</p>

<blockquote>"Consequently, the Auditing Examiner who is as­signed to these
cases is hereby directed to compute immediately all the money claims awarded by
the Court to the parties concerned, taking into consideration the decision
promulgated by the supreme Court on <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="8">August
 31, 1964</st1:date>, and forthwith submit his report to this Court for further
disposition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Clerk of Court is directed to furnish copies of said
report of examiner to the parties concerned who are given twenty (20) days
counted from the re­ceipt of a copy thereof, within which to file ob­jections,
if any.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failure to file objections there­to
within the specified period above-mentioned, said report of examiner shall be
considered approved and final for further disposition of this Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to the above decision and orders the Chief Examiner of
the CIR submitted to the latter, from time to time, a series of partial
reports, the sixth of which dated <st1:date year="1966" day="26" month="3">March
 26, 1966</st1:date> - which is the one involved in the present appeal - covers
the claims of the thirteen <span class="SpellE">Intervenors</span> with a total
money value of P99,332.21.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no
serious dis­pute as to the fact that the procedure and method of com­putation
followed by the Examiner in connection with this sixth partial report were the
same as those used and followed in connection with the five previous reports.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 19, 1966 the NAWASA filed a motion entitled "Motion
for Bill of Particulars" claiming therein that the sixth partial report
mentioned above did not specify the period covered by each claim, thus failing
to state the claims with sufficient definiteness to enable it to check the
correctness thereof, to prepare its pleadings and thereafter prepare for trial,
and prayed that the Court Examiner be di­rected to specify the period covered
by each claim and that, pending period of the desired information, the running
of the period for filing a responsive pleading be suspended.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 25, 1966 the <span class="SpellE">Intervenors</span>, Jesus <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span> and 12 others, filed a reply to the motion referred
to above, pointing out that the information sought therein was speci­fically
indicated in Appendix 1 attached to the report it­self, and prayed that the
suspension of the period for the filing of a responsive pleading be denied for
lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1966</st1:date>,
said <span class="SpellE">Intervenors</span> filed a motion for the approval of
the sixth partial report and for an order requiring the deposit in court of the
amount of P99,332.21, in view of the fact that the period of twenty days for
the submission of objections thereto had already elapsed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="3" month="6">June 3, 1966</st1:date>,
the NAWASA filed its objection to the report claiming: (1) that it was not
mathematically correct; (2) that it included Sunday and legal holiday dif­ferentials
to which <span class="SpellE">Intervenors</span> were not entitled; and (3) that
overtime services covered by the report were not sanctioned by written
authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 11, 1966 the <span class="SpellE">Intervenors</span> filed
a reply to NAWASA'S objection, praying that it be overruled having been filed
beyond the period <span class="SpellE">fied</span> by the Court, and prayed fur­ther
that the report be approved and considered final in accordance with the order
of October 5, 1964 and that the NAWASA be directed to deposit the total amount
of P99,322.21 with the CIR for its further disposition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, on <st1:date year="1967" day="20" month="2">February 20,
 1967</st1:date> the CIR issued at order approving the sixth partial report of
the Court Examiner and directing the NAWASA to deposit the amount of P99,332.21
with the Court within thirty (30) days from notice, for its further
disposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This order was affirmed by
the Court en banc on <st1:date year="1967" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1967</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">To sustain its appeal from the orders mentioned in the preceding
paragraph, petitioner now claims that the CIR erred (1) in not holding that the
filing of its "motion for bill of particulars" stayed the running of
the period for the filing of its objection to the sixth partial report of the
CIR Examiner; (2) in holding that petitioner's objection to said report was
filed out of time, and lastly, (3) in depriving it of due process when, acting
en banc, it affirmed the order of February 20, 1967.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that petitioner was served with a copy of the
sixth partial report on <st1:date year="1966" day="4" month="4">April 4, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, on the other hand, conceded that
petitioner had the right to object thereto and to be heard in connection
therewith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in this connection it is
worth remembering that the liti­gation over <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>'
claim was one of very long standing and had previously reached this Court for
adjudication of the principles involved (G. R. L-18938).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not strange, therefore, that after our
decision in the case just mentioned, the CIR, intent upon preventing any
further delay in the final disposition of <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>'
claim, issued on October 5, 1964 an order directing its Examiner to make the
necessary computations of the money claims awarded by the court; to furnish
copy of his report to the parties concerned, and gave the latter a period of
twenty (20) days counted from receipt of a copy thereof within which to file
objections against it, if any, and finally, warning the parties that failure to
file objections to the report within the specified in period, said report will
be considered approved and final for further disposition by the court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record discloses that notwithstanding the clear meaning and
intent of the order of <st1:date year="1964" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1964</st1:date>,
NAWASA, instead of filing its objections to the report a copy of which was
received by it on <st1:date year="1966" day="4" month="4">April 4, 1966</st1:date>,
took another step manifestly intended to delay the final disposition of the
claims, by filing a motion for a bill of particulars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This pleading was not only filed clearly in
violation of the order of the CIR of October 5, 1964 but was beyond doubt,
without merit, it appearing from the contents of the report and the document
thereto attached that the information NAWASA sought to obtain through a bill of
particulars was already there.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is of course true that under Rule 12 of the Rules of Court a
party against whom a complaint has been filed is entitled to compel the
plaintiff to submit a bill of parti­culars in relation to such allegations of
the latter's pleading as appear to be indefinite and uncertain, and that the
filing of the motion for the purpose suspends the running of the period for the
filing of the corresponding responsive pleading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even under this rule, however, it is doubtful
whether the filing of a motion for a bill of particulars would automatically
suspend the running of the period for the filing of the required responsive
pleading if it appears, as it does in the present case, that it was filed
manifestly for delay and was entirely without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be that as it may, it is settled that the
Rules of Court are not of strict application but merely <span class="SpellE">suppletory</span>
to the <span class="SpellE">CIR's</span> own Rules of Procedure, and when, as in
the present case, by formal order the CIR had clearly given the direction for
the filing of objections to the report under question within a definite period
to prevent the parties from resorting to dilatory tactics, We do not believe
said court erred in disregarding a pleading <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of its order end clearly intended to delay the pro­ceedings in a case which had
started almost eight years before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We,
therefore, find no merit in the First assignment of error.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of our conclusion <span class="SpellE">setforth</span>
heretofore in con­nection with the first assignment of error, no lengthy dis­cussion
need be made of the second error.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner having received a copy of the sixth partial report of the CIR
Exa­miner on April 4, 1966, and having filed its objection thereto only on June
3, 1966, it is obvious that the same was filed long after the expiration of the
twenty (20) day period given to it for the purpose in the <span class="SpellE">CIR's</span>
order of October 5, 1964.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of our views in relation to the first two
assignments of error, the third can not stand or prosper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If petitioner had no opportunity to prove the
grounds upon which it objected against the sixth partial report of the CIR
Examiner, that was entirely its own fault.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If instead of resorting to a clearly unfounded demand for the submission
of a bill of particulars it had filed its objection to said report within twenty
days after it had received a copy thereof, that would not have happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having failed to do so, the CIR was entirely
correct in proceeding to the approval of the questioned report - a step
strictly in accordance with the terms of its order of <st1:date year="1964" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1964</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, in relation to the specific grounds upon which NAWASA
objected against the Examiner's sixth partial report, the following should be
borne in mind:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(1)<span style="" times="" new="" roman="" ;="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">Nowhere in its pleading nor in its
brief submitted in the present case did NAWASA attempt to prove its con­tention
that said report: "is not mathematically correct" in any particular

vs. NWSA Consolidated Union, Jesus <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>, et al.,

we made clear, be­yond doubt that employees of such government owned and
controlled corporation, who intervened therein, were entitled to the benefits
not only of the Eight-Hour Labor Law<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>

in­curred by it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, on May

filed a motion alleging that such individuals were similarly situated as they
rendered work in excess of the regular eight-hour period, including nighttime,
having performed overtime services as well on Sundays and legal holidays and
therefore entitled to a simi­lar award in accordance with the aforesaid de­cision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The National Waterworks &amp; Sewerage
authority, hereinafter referred to as the <span class="SpellE">Na­wasa</span>,
was duly heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After which, on <st1:date year="1966" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1966</st1:date>, such a claim for
financial benefits was granted in the respective amounts of P29,640.81 for <span class="SpellE">Zurbano</span>, P9,212.78 for Domingo and P22,711.24 for <span class="SpellE">Fabregas</span>, the order being issued by the Hon. Joaquin M.
Salvador, Associate Judge of respondent Court of Industrial Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This order was sub­sequently affirmed by
respondent Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1966" day="22" month="9">September 22, 1966</st1:date>, denying a motion
for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dissatisfied with

compensation for work rendered during Sundays and legal holidays on the ground
that pre­viously respondent Court did deny such a claim and that no amount
should have been granted for work rendered in excess of eight hours a day as
there was no written authorization by petitioners general manager; and the
failure to sustain its plea of prescription of whatever claim could have been made
by the aforesaid individuals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are
satisfied that an the above facts as found by the Court of Industrial Relations

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second assigned error is equally without
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is there alleged that res­pondent
Court committed a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction,
when it awarded to <span class="SpellE">Zurbano</span>, Domingo and <span class="SpellE">Febregas</span> addi­tional compensation for work rendered during
Sundays and legal holidays considering that such a demand was denied by it in
the main case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In support of such an alleged error, peti­tioner cited in its
brief this portion of the order of January 16, 1961 of respondent Court: 'The <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>, in their Memorandum, wanted to include the
claim for additional compensa­tion for services rendered on Sundays and legal
holidays before and after the e <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of R. A.
No. 1880 and also on Saturdays after the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of the said law, contending that Saturday becomes an off-day or day of
rest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This particular claim is not
covered by the present petition, which only seeks payment of additional payment
for night work and overtime pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
records show that the respondent Company interposed its timely objection to the
evi­dence tending to establish such claim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">in­tervenors</span> did not file any amended
petition covering the claim for extra premium for work per­formed on Saturdays,
Sundays and legal holidays, contrary to their announcement made in open court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And neither was it touched by the res­pondent
Company during the presentation of its evidence.'<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a> Its very own brief, however, two
pages later, duly took note of this excerpt from the aforesaid order thus: 'It
is, therefore, our resolution that respondent NWSA should pay its employees and
laborers concerned additional com­pensation equivalent to 25% of their basic <span class="SpellE">saleries</span> or wages for work an Sundays and legal holi­days
even if the same should fall within the staggered five working days effective
on the date their working days were staggered.'<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Respondents, in their brief, could thus correctly conclude:
'The awardees are not solely the petitioners in the said cases, but all 'the
employees and laborers concerned' of the NWSA.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Obviously, a member of the NWSA Consolidated Unions, who has not
rendered work on Sundays and legal holidays, is not concerned with the benefit
in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Industrial Court did
not impose any limitation affecting the quali­fication of the intended
recipients of the award, except that they should be employees, or laborers, of
the NWSA, and must be con­cerned with the benefit in question, i.e., that they
rendered services on Sundays and legal holidays.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>
were very much concerned about the afore-stated benefit because they did
actually perform said services; so much so, that they demanded it during the
hearing and likewise in their memorandum.'<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Whatever doubt could conceivably exist should be erased if
heed be paid to what was explicitly set forth by us in our opinion in the main
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we stated there: 'It is to be
noted, however, that in the case at bar it has been stipulated that prior to
the enactment of Republic Act No. 1880, providing for the implementation of the
40-Hour Week Law, the Metropolitan Water District had been paying 25%
additional compensation far work on Sun­days and legal holidays to its
employees and laborers by virtue of Resolution No. 47, series of 1948, of its
Board of Directors, which practice was continued by the [<span class="SpellE">Nawasa</span>]
when the latter took over the service.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And in the collective bargaining agreement entered into between the [<span class="SpellE">Nawasa</span>] and respondent unions it was agreed that all
existing benefits en­joyed by the employees and laborers prior to its <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> shall remain in force and shall form part of
the agreement, among which cer­tainly is the 25% additional compensation for
work on Sundays and legal holidays theretofore enjoyed by said laborers and
employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may, therefore, be said
that while under Com­monwealth Act No. 444 public utility is not required to
pay additional compensation to its employees and workers for work done on
Sundays and legal holidays, there is, however, no prohibition for it to pay
such additional compen­sation if it voluntarily agrees to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The [<span class="SpellE">Nawasa</span>]
committed itself to pay this additional compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must pay not because of com­pulsion of law
but because of contractual obligation.'<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">9</span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It would be to defy rather to defer to the above decision,
which is the law of the case, if petitioner is to be indulged in its
unwarranted assertion that the award of additional compensa­tion for work
rendered during Sundays and legal holidays was done with grave abuse of
discretion."</blockquote>
