				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal interposed by the City and City Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> from the decision of the Court of First Instance of
<span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental (in Civil Case No. 8072), declaring
as null and void Ordinance No. 875, series of 1966, imposing graduated annual
license fees on operators of transportation companies in the City of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case commenced with the filing in court by <span class="SpellE">Netran</span>, Inc. of a complaint, challenging the authority of
the City Council of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> to enact an ordinance
(No. 875, s. 1966) imposing annual license fees on operators of public utility
vehicles in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, and praying for the
declaration of its nullity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the
defendants <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> and City Treasurer had filed
their joint answer sustaining the validity of the disputed measure, the parties
stipulated on the following facts:</p>

<blockquote>“2.<span style=""> </span>That plaintiff is the owner and operator of a
public utility duly franchised by the Public Service Commission and is actually
engaged in the business of transporting goods and passengers from <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City, <span class="SpellE">Balintawak</span>, San
Carlos City and <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span> City, <span class="SpellE">Bayawan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental and vice-versa;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style=""> </span>That plaintiff has duly secured and paid the
necessary licenses and fees for all its operating units, in the operation of
its business as a public utility, imposed by the Land Transportation Code, the
Public Service Act and other related laws;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style=""> </span>That plaintiff likewise pays a privilege
franchise tax of two percent (2%) on the gross collections as common carrier's
tax, payable monthly to the Bureau of Internal Revenue for the operation of the
said public utility as provided for by the Internal Revenue Code;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“5.<span style=""> </span>Plaintiff's motor vehicles are prohibited from
operating within the city limits of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
as defined and delimited by Ordinance No. 43, Series of 1961, of the said
defendant <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“6.<span style=""> </span>That defendant <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
thru its City Council passed an ordinance imposing an annual graduated license
fee of TPU operators or transportation companies in the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said license fee imposition being specifically
provided for by the provisions of Section 1 of the City Ordinance No. 875,
Series of 1966 of defendant <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">xxxx</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“7.<span style=""> </span>That defendant <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>
City and defendant Miguel Reynaldo have collected and are still imposing and
collecting the aforementioned graduated license fee on the herein
plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, plaintiff had paid
defendant under protest the amount of Nine Hundred Twenty (P920.00) Pesos, as
evidenced by defendant's Official Receipt No. K-1065489 dated <st1:date year="1967" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1967</st1:date>, as payment of the
said graduated license for the year 1967;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“8.<span style=""> </span>That the motor vehicles of herein plaintiff,
operated by it as a public utility, are all under the Land Transportation
Commission denomination or classification of PUB;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“9.<span style=""> </span>That there are other PUB vehicles with the same
fixed route of from <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City, <span class="SpellE">Balintawak</span>,
San Carlos City, <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span> City, <span class="SpellE">Bayawan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental and vice versa, which are not
subjected to the license fee imposition adverted to in paragraph 6 hereof, as
the operator and/or owner of said PUB motor vehicles are not residents of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> nor they have their principal place of business in <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City, nor do they maintain a garage or repair shop
at <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Based upon the foregoing stipulation of
facts, the court rendered judgment on 15 November 1967, ruling out the
authority of the City Council of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> to enact the
questioned tax measure, in view of the explicit provisions of the Land
Transportation and Traffic Code (Republic Act 4136) and the Local Autonomy Act
(Republic Act 2264), withholding from local governments the power to tax the registration,
use and operation of motor vehicles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is this decision that is the subject of the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Asserting that the enactment of Ordinance No. 875, which fixes
the rate of the annual license fee payable by operators of transportation
companies depending on the number of units owned or operated by said companies,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
comes within the general authority of the City Council of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>,
appellants invoke the city charter which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 17, <u>General powers and duties of the Council</u>.-
Except as otherwise provided by law, and subject to the conditions and
limitations thereof, the City Council shall have the following legislative
powers:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">xxxxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span class="SpellE">xxxxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">xxxxx</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"(n)<span style=""> </span>To tax motor and other vehicles, notwithstanding
the provisions to the contrary contained in section thirteen of Act Numbered
Thirty-nine hundred and ninety-two, as amended, all automobiles and trucks
belonging to the National Government or to any provincial or municipal government
and automobiles and trucks not regularly kept in the City of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>, shall be exempt from such tax." (Com. Act No.
326,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
as amended by Com. Act No. 404).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In 1950, however, Republic Act 587 was passed to amend certain
sections of the Motor Vehicle Law (Act 3992).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Among those affected was subsection (b) of Section 70,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Article 2, Chapter IV thereof, which was made to reed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No other taxes or fees than those prescribed
in this Act shall be imposed for the registration or operation or on the ownership
of any motor vehicle, or for the exercise of the profession of chauffeur, by
any municipal corporation, the provisions of any city charter to the contrary
notwithstanding: <span class="SpellE">xxxx</span>;</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">thus eliminating there from the provision
allowing the imposition of equitable insular, local or municipal property tax
upon motor vehicles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This same provision
was later on incorporated verbatim into, and became Section 59 (b) of the Land
Transportation and Traffic Code (Republic Act 4136) that took effect on <st1:date year="1964" day="20" month="6">20 June 1964</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue that this case presents for resolution by this Court,
therefore, is whether or not Section 17(a) of the City Charter of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>, empowering the council to tax motor vehicles, has
been repealed by the amendatory provision of Republic Act 587, and by Section
59(b) of Republic Act 4136.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
nothing new or novel to this question.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a 1953 case that put to test the validity of an ordinance
levying a so-called property tax on all motor vehicles operating in the City of
Manila, this Court had already ruled that Section 70(b) of Act 3992<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
constituted a limitation on the broad grant of power conferred upon the city by
its charter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, we said:</p>

<blockquote>"The ordinance in question falls under the foregoing
rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it refers to property tax
and it is fixed <u>ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span></u>, yet we cannot
reject the idea that it is merely levied on motor vehicles operating within the
City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> with the main
purpose of raising funds to be expended exclusively for the repair, maintenance
and improvement of the streets and bridges in said city.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is precisely what the Motor Vehicle Law
(Act No. 3992) intends to prevent, for the reason that, under said Act, municipal
corporations already participate in the distribution of the proceeds that are
raised for the same purpose of repairing, maintaining and improving bridges and
public highways (section 73 of the Motor Vehicle Law).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This prohibition is intended to prevent duplication
in the imposition of fees for the same purpose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is for this reason that we believe that the ordinance in question
merely imposes a license fee although under the cloak of an <u>ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span></u> tax to circumvent the prohibition above adverted
to." (Association of Customs Brokers, Inc. vs. Municipal Board, 93 Phil.
107, 111).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In a later case<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
also brought to its attention and involving a taxing ordinance passed by the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Council, this Court expressly declared the
amendatory provision of Republic Act 587 to have repealed Section 12 (c) of the
Charter of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City (Republic Act 537), an earlier
legislation that authorized the taxing or licensing or regulation by the city
of transportation business in operation in said territory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reasoning its judgment, this Court stated:</p>

<blockquote>" x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Section 17 of Republic Act No, 587 provides that 'no other taxes or fees than
those prescribed in this Act shall be imposed for the registration or
operation, or on the owner of any motor vehicle, or for the exercise of the
profession of chauffeur, by any municipal corporation, the provisions of any
city charter to the contrary notwithstanding.' Being a later enactment, it must
be deemed to have replaced the <u>pro</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>tanto</u></span>
Section 12 (c) of Republic Act No. 537, the Revised Charter of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
business of transportation comprises simply the operation of motor vehicles
defined in the Revised Motor Vehicle Law (Section 3 of Article 11) as including
'all vehicles using the public highways, if propelled by any power other than
muscular power'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To tax or impose a
license fee on the transportation business of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
is therefore to tax or impose a license fee on the operation by the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> of its vehicles, already exclusively covered by
the Revised Motor Vehicles Law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Following the foregoing ruling, it is clear that Republic Act No.
587, amending Section 70(b) of Act 3992, and Republic Act 4136, prohibiting the
imposition of the tax or fee of any kind, other than those therein provided,
upon the registration ownership or operation of motor vehicles, being later
enactments, should be construed as having repealed Section 17(a) of the Charter
of the City of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the passage by the City Council
of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> of Ordinance No. 875, series of 1966,
based on such Section 17(a) of Commonwealth Act 326, as amended, is adjudged
unauthorized, and the declaration of its nullity by the court below was proper
and justified.</p>
