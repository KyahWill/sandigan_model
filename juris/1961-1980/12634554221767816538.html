<p class="BODY">Claimant <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Rimerata</span>
worked as laboratory helper in petitioner's production department from <st1:date year="1953" day="17" month="3">March 17, 1953</st1:date> until <st1:date year="1962" day="6" month="4">April 6, 1962</st1:date> when he had to stop
working due to the fact that he was suffering from peptic ulcer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His duties, inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>,
were to prepare sugar and taste the syrup for correction in accordance with the
established standard; to weigh citric acid, sodium citrate, carbonated water, <span class="SpellE">lemolime</span> and alcohol, and to place and mix said ingredients
in an electrically operated mixing tank and then taste the mixture; to pour
acoustic soda into the bottle washing machine; to change the water analyzer in
the water tank; end carry, in a day of eight working hours, 16-54 sacks of
sugar weighing 100 lbs. each along a distance of about ten meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He worked eight hours a day, six days a week,
<span class="GramE">his</span> last wage rate being P5.85 daily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After three or four years he felt the
development of pain in his abdominal region and when on April 6, 1962 he
suffered stomach pains end vomited while working in the plant he was subjected
to immediate treatment by his employer's physician, Dr. Gil Angeles, who
diagnosed his illness as peptic ulcer, and advised his confinement at
home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As despite medical treatment until
<st1:date year="1962" day="26" month="6">June 26, 1962</st1:date> by Dr.
Angeles his condition showed no improvement, he placed himself in the hands of
Drs. Jose C. <span class="SpellE">Almeda</span> and <span class="SpellE">Clodualdo</span>
S. <span class="SpellE">Manas</span>, both of Laguna, and of Dr. Charles S. <span class="SpellE">Harn</span> of St. Luke's Hospital in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, on <st1:date year="1962" day="15" month="12">De­cember 15, 1962</st1:date> petitioner terminated his services due
to his continued illness.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the facts set forth above, the Workmen's Com­pensation
Commission rendered the appealed decision which petitioner now urges us to
reverse claiming that said Commission committed the following errors:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">"I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>That the Commission erred in finding that the claimant, <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Rimerata</span>, was disabled
for work up to <st1:date year="1965" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1965</st1:date>,
and in not holding that in the absence of any evidence, it can not be presumed
that he was disabled for work.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">II<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>That the Commission erred in not holding that the claimant has the
burden of proving that his disability for labor persisted up to January 15,
1965 or thereafter, and that the petitioner does not have the burden of showing
that such disability for labor did not persist up to the aforesaid date or
beyond thereof.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><st1:state><st1:place><span style="font-weight: normal;">Ill</span></st1:place></st1:state><span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>That the Commission erred in finding t the claimant's peptic ulcer
must have developed through the years that he was employed by the petitioner
tasting the syrup preparation and mixture of the 7-up ingredients.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">IV<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>That the Commission erred in finding that the ailment of the
claimant is com­pensable."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the third assignment of error petitioner's con­tention is that
<span class="SpellE">Rimerata's</span> peptic ulcer was not caused by nor was it
connected with his work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find this to
be untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of Ruben
Rodriguez, foreman in the production department of petitioner's factory,
corroborated by that of petitioner's Assistant Manager, Crispin Peralta, in
conjunction with that of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Harn</span> in relation to his
medical certificate Exhibit B-2, sufficiently show that the ingredients which <span class="SpellE">Rimerata</span> had to take or swallow in connection with the
discharge of his duties as petitioner's employee probably irritated the linings
of his stomach and produced or, at least, aggravated the peptic ulcer he was
found to be suffering from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this
connection, it is to be borne in mind that, for a claim to be compensable, it
is sufficient that the employee's ailment is shown to be attributable to, or
reasonably con­nected with or was aggravated by the nature and conditions of
his work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This test has been
sufficiently met in the present case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first and second assignments of error made in petitioner's
brief raise but a mere question of evidence namely, who, as between petitioner,
on the one hand, and its employee, <span class="SpellE">Rimerata</span>, on the
other, has the burden of proof in connection with the question of when the
latter was disabled for work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether it
was petitioner who had the burden of proving that <span class="SpellE">Rimerata's</span>
disability for labor did not last until January 15, 1965, or whether it was <span class="SpellE">Rimerata</span> who had the burden of proving that his disability
for labor persisted up to said date, is of no great consequence in this case,
the Commission having found as a fact that such disability lasted until January
5, 1965.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This finding being, in our
opinion, supported by substan­tial evidence in the record may not now be
reviewed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fourth and last assignment of error is merely the consequence
of the previous three and need no further discussion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision being in accordance with
law and the evidence, the same is hereby affirmed, with costs.</p>
