				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This appeal from a decision of the Court of first Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental (<span class="SpellE">Civ</span>. Case No. 7516 of that Court) was certified to us by
the Court of Appeals (Second Division) because the same involves no questions
of fact.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case had its origin in the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City, when the Diversified Credit Corporation filed
an action to compel the spouses Felipe Rosado and Luz <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span>
Rosado to vacate and restore possession of a parcel of land in the City of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> (Lot 62-B of Subdivision plan LRC-Psd-33823) that
forms part of Lot No. 62 of the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bacolod</span></span><span style=""> Cadastre,
and is covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. </span>27083 in the name of
<span style="">plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After answer, claiming that the lot </span>was
defendants' conjugal property, the Municipal Court ordered defen­dants to
surrender and vacate the land in litigation; to pay P100.00 <span style="">a month from the filing of the complaint up
to the actual vacating </span>of the premises; to pay P<span style="">50</span>0.00 attorneys' fees and costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon appeal to the Court of First Instance, the
case was submitted on the following stipulation <span style="">of </span>facts (Rec. on App., pp. 59-60):</p>

complaint before the Municipal Court which proves that plaintiff neglected the
offer;</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court of first Instance in its decision rejected the claim of
ownership advanced by Rosado, based upon the construction of a house on the
disputed lot by the conjugal partnership of the Rosado spouses, which allegedly
converted the land into conjugal property under Article 158, paragraph 2 of the
present Civil Code of the Philippines; further held that defendants were in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> to claim title in view of the letter Exhibit “C”
requesting for six (6) months within which to vacate the premises, and affirmed
the decision of the Inferior Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Defendant Felipe Rosado resorted to the Court of Appeals, and his appeal
(CA-G. R. No. 37398-R) is the one now before us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He assigns four alleged errors:</p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(a)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">The lower court erred in not
holding that Exhibit "A" is null and void, since upon the
construction of the conjugal dwelling thereon, the conjugal partnership of the
defendant-appellant Felipe Rosado and Luz <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span>
became the owner of the share of Luz <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span> in Lot No.
62-B, <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> Cadastre;</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(b)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">The trial court erred in ordering
the defendant-appellant to vacate Lot No. 62-B and in not holding that Exhibit
"A" is null and void because as the legal <span class="SpellE">usufructuary</span>
of the share of Luz <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span> Rosado in Lot 62-B, <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> Cadastre, the conjugal partnership, managed and
administered by the defendant-appellant Felipe Rosado can not be deprived of
its <span class="SpellE">usufructuary</span> rights by any contract between Luz <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span> and the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>;</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(c)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">The trial court erred in not

conjugal house constructed on </span><st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 62-B; and</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(d)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">The lower court erred in ordering
the defendant-appellant to pay attorneys' fees in the amount of five hundred
(P500.00) pesos.</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It can be seen that the key question is whether by the construc­tion
of a house on the lot owned in common by the <span class="SpellE">Jaymes</span>,
and sold by them to the appellant corporation, the land in question or a 1/13th
part of it became conjugal property.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant, husband of vendor Luz <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span>,
claims the affirmative invoking the second paragraph of Article 158 of the
Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
prescribing that:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"ART. </span>158.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Improvements, whether for utility or
adornment, made on the separate property of the spouses through advancements
from the partnership or through the industry of either the husband or the wife,
belong to the conjugal partnership.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Buildings constructed, at the expense of the partnership,
during the marriage on land belonging to one of the spouses, also pertain to
the partnership, but the value of the land shall be reimbursed to the spouse
who owns the same."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Rosado further contends that as the building of the house at the
expense of the conjugal partnership converted the 1/13 undivided share on his
wife in Lot 62-B into property of the community, the deed of sale of May 11,
1964 in favor of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> corporation was void in
so far as said 1/13 share is concerned, because his wife, Luz <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span>, had ceased to own such share from and after the
building of the house; and Rosado, as manager of the conjugal partnership, had
not participated in the sale, nor subsequently ratified the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find appellant's thesis legally untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it is a basic principle in the law of
co-ownership, both under the present Civil Code as in the Code of 1889, that no
individual co-owner can claim title to any definite portion of the land or
thing owned in <span style="">common until the
partition </span>thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prior to that
time, all that the co-owner has is an <u><span style="">ideal</span></u><span style="">, </span>or abstract, quota or proportionate
share in the entire thing owned in common by all the co-owners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The principle is emphasized by the rulings of
this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u><span style="">Lopez</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Ilustre</u></span>, 5 Phil.
567, it was held that while a co-owner has the right to freely sell and dispose
of his undivided interest, he has no right to sell a divided part of the real
estate owned in common. "If he is the owner of an undivided half of a
tract of land, he has the right to sell and convey an undivided half, but he
has no right to divide the lot into two parts, and convey the whole of one part
by metes and bounds." The doctrine was reiterated in <u><span style="">Mercado</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Liwanag</span></u></span><span style="">, </span>L-14429,
<st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1962</st1:date>, holding that
a co-owner may not convey a physical portion of the land owned in common.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in <st1:city><st1:place><u><span style="">Santos</span></u></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> </span><u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Buenconsejo</span></u></span><span style="">, </span>L-20136, <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1965</st1:date>, it was ruled that a co-owner may
not even adjudicate to himself any determinate portion of land owned in <span style="">common.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Since the share of the wife, Luz <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span>,
was at no time physically determined, it can not be validly claimed that the
house constructed by her husband was built on land belonging to her, and
Article 158 of the Civil Code can not apply.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Certainly, on her 1/13 ideal or abstract <span style="">undivided share, </span>no house could be erected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Necessarily, the claim of conversion of the <span style="">wife's </span>share from <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span>
to con­jugal in character as a result of the construction must be rejected for
lack of factual or legal basis.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is <span style="">the </span>logical
consequence of the foregoing ruling that the lower court did not err <span style="">in holding that the </span>appellant was
bound to vacate the land without reimbursement, since he knew that the land
occupied by the house did <span style="">not </span>belong
exclusively to his <span style="">wife, but to </span>the
other owners as well, and there is no proof on record that the house occupied
only 1/13th of the total area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
construction was not done in good faith.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of the Court of first Instance is
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs
against appellant Felipe Rosado.</span></p>
