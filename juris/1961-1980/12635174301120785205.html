Iloilo finding the defendants, <span class=SpellE>Rufino</span> <span

class=SpellE>Felicisimo</span> Tan, guilty as principals of the crime of murder

the sum of P6<span class=GramE>,000</span> as indemnity to the heirs of the

<p class=BODY><span class=SpellE>Rufino</span> <span class=SpellE>Gensola</span>
was the driver, while <span class=SpellE>Fidelina</span> Tan and <span
class=SpellE>Felicisimo</span> Tan were the conductors, of a passenger truck, <span
class=SpellE>Gelveson</span> No. 17 (belonging to Jose Tan, father of <span

station at <span class=SpellE>Guimbal</span>, Ilo­ilo.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They suspected Miguel <span class=SpellE>Gayanilo</span>
of having punctured the tires of the truck while it was parked in front of his <span
class=SpellE><u>carinderia</u></span> on <st1:Street><st1:address>Gerona St.</st1:address></st1:Street>,
<span class=SpellE>Guimbal</span>, on <st1:date Year="1958" Day="18" Month="11">November
 18, 1958</st1:date>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the afternoon of
the following day, November 19, in the return trip of the truck, <span
class=GramE>then</span> driven by a temporary driver, <span class=SpellE>Restituto</span>
<span class=SpellE>Gersaneva</span>, from <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Iloilo</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>City</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, Enrique <span class=SpellE>Gelario</span>
and Enrique <span class=SpellE>Gela</span> were among the passengers of the
truck.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Before the truck entered the <span
class=SpellE><u>pobla­cion</u></span> of <span class=SpellE>Guimbal</span>, it
parked on <st1:Street><st1:address>Gonzales St.</st1:address></st1:Street> to
discharge a passenger and his baggage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Enrique <span class=SpellE>Gelario</span> and Enrique <span
class=SpellE>Gela</span> overheard <span class=SpellE>Fidelina</span> Tan
mutter to herself, obviously referring to someone she did not name:<span

him.&quot; (&quot;No <span class=SpellE>aparece</span> <span class=SpellE>porque</span>

truck then continued on its way and parked in front of <span class=SpellE>Teodora</span>
<span class=SpellE>Gellicanao's</span> <span class=SpellE><u>carinderia</u></span>
on <st1:Street><st1:address>Gerona St.</st1:address></st1:Street> in the <span
class=SpellE><u>poblacion</u></span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>All the passengers got off the truck.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Enrique <span class=SpellE>Gelario</span> and Enrique <span
class=SpellE>Gela</span> crossed the street towards the <span class=SpellE><u>carinderia</u></span>
of Pedro <span class=SpellE>Genciana</span> to await another passenger truck
for their respective barrios.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <span
class=SpellE>Gelveson</span> No. 17 then left in the direction of the nearby <span
class=SpellE><u>carinderia</u></span> of <span class=SpellE>Violeta</span> <span
class=SpellE>Garin</span>, returned a short time later, and parked in front of
the <u>bodega</u> of its owner, Jose Tan.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The time was about 6:30 P.M. Miguel <span class=SpellE>Gayanilo</span>
was crossing the street from the public market in the direction of his <span
class=SpellE><u>carinderia</u></span> with <span class=SpellE>Ru­fino</span> <span
class=SpellE>Gensola</span>, holding in his right hand a stone as big as a
man's fist, following closely behind.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At
this time, <span class=SpellE>Felici­simo</span> Tan and <span class=SpellE>Fidelina</span>
Tan were standing in the middle of the street.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>After Miguel <span class=SpellE>Gayanilo</span> had crossed the middle
of the street near the two, <span class=SpellE>Fidelina</span> Tan shouted,
&quot;<span class=SpellE>Rufino</span>, strike him.&quot; Upon hearing the <span
class=GramE>shout</span> Miguel looked back and <span class=SpellE>Rufino</span>
suddenly struck him on the left face with the stone.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Felici­simo</span> then
struck Miguel with a piece of iron on the back of the head causing serious
wounds and fractured of the skull.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not
content with the two blows already given, <span class=SpellE>Fidelina</span>
struck Miguel with another piece of iron on the left forehead causing serious
wounds and fracture of the skull.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Miguel
fell to the ground near the canal along the side of the street.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Rufino</span> <span
class=SpellE>Gensola</span> immediately left for his house situated on Gonzales
St. <span class=SpellE>Felicisimo</span> and <span class=SpellE>Fidelina</span>
observed the prostrate body for a few seconds until <span class=SpellE>Fidelina</span>
muttered:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;He is already
dead.&quot; <span class=GramE>(&quot;<span class=SpellE>Ya</span> <span
class=SpellE>esta</span> <span class=SpellE>muerto</span>.&quot;)</span> The
two then left the scene of the crime.</p>

<p class=BODY>The autopsy report shows that Miguel <span class=SpellE>Gayanilo</span>
suffered lacerated wounds on the left face, serious wounds and fracture of the
skull on the back of the head, and serious wounds and fracture of the skull on
the left forehead.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Death was caused by
traumatic shock.</p>

<p class=BODY>The death of Miguel <span class=SpellE>Gayanilo</span> caused by
traumatic shock which resulted from the strong blows inflicting trauma on the
back of the head and on the left forehead, was admitted par­ticularly by the
accused <span class=SpellE>Rufino</span> <span class=SpellE>Gensola</span>, who
assumed sole res­ponsibility for the same.</p>

<p class=BODY>The lower court found the three defendants guilty as principals
of the crime of murder and rendered judgment as follows:</p>

<p class=BODY>Defendants appealed.</p>

<p class=BODY>Appellants contend that <span class=SpellE>Rufino</span> <span
class=SpellE>Gensola</span> alone inflict­ed with stone blows the serious
wounds and fractures of the skull which caused the death of Miguel <span
class=SpellE>Gayanilo</span>, but that he did so in legitimate defense of <span
class=SpellE>Fidelina</span> Tan and of himself.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The contention is unmeritorious in view of
the following considerations:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(1) The
testimony of <span class=SpellE>Rufino</span> <span class=SpellE>Gen­sola</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Fidelina</span> Tan that Miguel <span class=SpellE>Gayanilo</span>,
then drunk, an­grily demanded to know from <span class=SpellE>Fidelina</span>
why she suspected him of having punctured the tires of the truck and was about
to strike <span class=SpellE>Fidelina</span> with a stone, and that in
legitimate defense of <span class=SpellE>Fidelina</span> and of himself <span
class=SpellE>Rufino</span> picked up two stones, struck Miguel on the left face
with one stone and threw the other stone at him when he started to run away,
hitting him on the back of the head and causing him to fall and strike his fore­head
against a pile of stones, is belied by, <u>first</u>, the se­rious wounds and
fractures of the skull on the back of the head and on the left forehead of the
victim, which could have been caused only by strong blows with pieces of iron;
and, <u>second</u>, by the testimony of Dr. Juan <span class=SpellE>Encanto</span>,
who per­formed the autopsy, that he did not see any pile of stones near the
dead body of Miguel <span class=SpellE>Gayanilo</span> when he arrived at the
place in response to a call.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) The
admission of <span class=SpellE>Rufino</span> <span class=SpellE>Gen­sola</span>
that he alone was responsible for the serious wounds and fractures of the skull
inflicted upon Miguel <span class=SpellE>Gayanilo</span> in le­gitimate defense
of <span class=SpellE>Fidelina</span> Tan and of himself, has no pro­bative
value because it constitutes, in the face of contrary credible evidence for the
prosecution, an assumption by <span class=SpellE>Ru­fino</span> <span
class=SpellE>Gensola</span> of the criminal liability of <span class=SpellE>Felicisimo</span>
Tan and <span class=SpellE>Fidelina</span> Tan.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The penal law does not allow anyone to assume the criminal liability of
another.</p>

<p class=BODY>Appellants contend that the testimonies of the princi­pal
prosecution witnesses, Enrique <span class=SpellE>Gelario</span> and Enrique <span
class=SpellE>Gela</span>, are unworthy of credence because of contradictions
and un­certainties, showing that they were not present and did not witness the
commission of the crime.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The contention
is un­tenable for the following reasons: (1) <span class=GramE>The</span>
contradictions pointed out involve only the relative locations of the three <span
class=SpellE><u>carinderias</u></span> near the scene of the crime, not the
acts of com­mission of the three defendants at a distance of about seven meters
from where the two state witnesses were then stand­ing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) The uncertainties pointed out refer to
the descrip­tion of the pieces of iron used by <span class=SpellE>Felicisimo</span>
Tan and <span class=SpellE>Fidelina</span> Tan, that is, as to the size, length
and other details.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Considering that the
place was not well lighted and that there was little time to observe, accurate
description of the weapons used could not be expected three years later when
the witnesses testified.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(3) The
contention that Enrique <span class=SpellE>Gelario</span> and Enrique <span
class=SpellE>Gela</span> testified against <span class=SpellE>Felicisimo</span>
Tan and <span class=SpellE>Fidelina</span> Tan out of spite because the latter
had refused to transport the former to their respective barrios, is not well
taken.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is not natural for a person to
tes­tify under oath against his neighbor on a matter of life and death just
because of a trifling incident causing slight inconvenience.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(4) We find the testimonies of the four
defense witnesses, <span class=SpellE>Fidelina</span> Tan, <span class=SpellE>Felicisimo</span>
Tan, Elias <span class=SpellE>Gen­sola</span> and Salvador <span class=SpellE>Gayatao</span>,
that Enrique <span class=SpellE>Gelario</span> and Enrique <span class=SpellE>Gela</span>
were not present at the scene of the crime because they had already left <st1:Street><st1:address>Gerona
  St.</st1:address></st1:Street> walking to another street to await
transportation to their respective barrios, unworthy of credence.</p>

<p class=BODY>Let us now consider the criminal liability of the three
appellants.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The lower court found them
guilty as principals of the crime of murder on the assumption that there was
con­spiracy among them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We do not agree,
for the following reasons: (1) <span class=SpellE>Fidelina</span> Tan's
intention revealed by the words she muttered to herself, &quot;He does not
appear because I will kill him,&quot; was not shared by <span class=SpellE>Felicisimo</span>
Tan, who kept si­lent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Silence is not a
circumstance indicating participa­tion in the same criminal design.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With respect to <span class=SpellE>Rufino</span>
<span class=SpellE>Gensola</span>, he was not even in the truck at the
time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) When Miguel <span
class=SpellE>Gayanilo</span> was crossing <st1:Street><st1:address>Gerona St.</st1:address></st1:Street>,
it was only <span class=SpellE>Rufino</span> <span class=SpellE>Gensola</span>
who followed closely behind.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
class=SpellE>Fidelina</span> Tan and <span class=SpellE>Feli­cisimo</span> Tan
were in the middle of the street.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
words shouted by <span class=SpellE>Fidelina</span> Tan, '&quot;<span
class=SpellE>Rufino</span>, strike him,&quot; were meant as a command and did
not show previous concert of criminal design.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>(3) The blows given with pieces of iron on the back of the head and on
the left forehead by <span class=SpellE>Felicisimo</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Fi­delina</span> after <span class=SpellE>Rufino</span> had struck
with a piece of stone the left face of Miguel, do not in and by themselves show
pre­vious concert of criminal design.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Particularly when it is considered that <span class=SpellE>Rufino</span>
immediately left thereafter while <span class=SpellE>Felicisimo</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Fidelina</span> remained for a few seconds observ­ing the
prostrate body of Miguel until <span class=SpellE>Fidelina</span> muttered,
&quot;He is already dead.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>In the absence of conspiracy, the liability of the three
appellants is individual, that is, each appellant is liable only for his own
act.</p>

<p class=BODY>Appellant <span class=SpellE>Rufino</span> <span class=SpellE>Gensola</span>
is liable only for the la­cerated wounds inflicted by him on the left face of
Miguel <span class=SpellE>Gayanilo</span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Such lacerated wounds caused disfigurement (&quot;de­formity&quot;) of
the face within the meaning of Article 263(3) of the Revised Penal Code
punishable by <span class=SpellE><u>prision</u></span><u> correctional</u> in
its minimum and medium periods in relation to the Inde­terminate Sentence
Law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The offense having been committed
with treachery, the penalty should be imposed in its maximum period.</p>

<p class=BODY>Is appellant <span class=SpellE>Fidelina</span> Tan also liable
for the offense considering that she gave the command &quot;<span class=SpellE>Rufino</span>,
strike him&quot;?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The second class of
principals, according to Article 17 of the Revised Penal Code, comprises,
&quot;those who directly force or induce others to commit it (the act).&quot;
Those who direct­ly induce others to commit the act are called &quot;principals
by inducement&quot; or &quot;principals by induction,&quot; from the Spanish
&quot;<span class=SpellE>autores</span> <span class=SpellE>por</span>
induction.&quot; The word &quot;inducement&quot; comprises, in the opinion of <span
class=SpellE>Viada</span> and the Supreme Court of Spain, re­ward, promise of
reward, command, and <span class=SpellE><u>pacto</u></span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With respect to command, it must be the
moving cause of the offense.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the case
at bar, the command shouted by <span class=SpellE>Fidelina</span>, &quot;<span
class=SpellE>Rufino</span>, strike him,&quot; was not the moving cause of the
act of <span class=SpellE>Rufino</span> <span class=SpellE>Gensola</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The evidence shows that <span class=SpellE>Rufino</span>
would have commit­ted the act of his own volition, even without said words of
command.</p>

<p class=BODY>Are the appellants <span class=SpellE>Felicisimo</span> Tan and <span
class=SpellE>Fidelina</span> Tan both liable for the death of Miguel <span
class=SpellE>Gayanilo</span>?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Our
opinion is in the affirmative.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
trauma inflicted by <span class=SpellE>Felicisimo</span> and the trauma
inflicted by <span class=SpellE>Fidelina</span>, combined, produced death due
to traumatic shock.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When <span
class=SpellE>Fidelina</span> struck with a piece of iron the left forehead of
Miguel, he was not yet dead.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was only
after the trauma inflicted by <span class=SpellE>Fidelina</span> that the dying
Miguel fell to the ground and died seconds later.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is clear from the evidence that after
Miguel had fallen to the ground, <span class=SpellE>Felicisimo</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Fidelina</span> observed his prostrate body for a few seconds
until <span class=SpellE>Fidelina</span> muttered, &quot;He is al­ready
dead.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>Assuming that the trauma inflicted by <span class=SpellE>Felicisimo</span>
was by itself sufficient to produce death due to traumatic shock, should <span
class=SpellE>Fidelina</span> be also held liable considering that death could
have resulted anyway from the act of <span class=SpellE>Felicisimo</span> and
that a person cannot be killed twice?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The obvious answer is that although a dead person cannot be killed
again, a dying person can still be killed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Miguel was not dead but dying when <span class=SpellE>Fidelina</span>
struck his left forehead with a piece of iron.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Hence, the trauma inflicted by her hastened the death of Miguel from
traumatic shock made doubly severe.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She
must, therefore, be also held criminally liable for the death of the victim.</p>

<p class=BODY>Was the killing murder?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Our opinion is in the affir­mative because it was attended with the
qualifying circum­stance of <span class=SpellE><u>alevosia</u></span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was <span class=SpellE><u>alevosia</u></span>
because after <span class=SpellE>Rufino</span> suddenly struck Miguel <span
class=SpellE>Gayanilo</span> with a stone, Miguel, defenseless, was struck by <span
class=SpellE>Felicisimo</span> Tan with a piece of iron on the back of the head
and by <span class=SpellE>Fidelina</span> Tan with a piece of iron on the left
forehead.</p>

<p class=BODY><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, that part of the appealed judgment
sentencing each of the appellants <span class=SpellE>Felicisimo</span> Tan and <span
