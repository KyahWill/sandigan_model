				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from the lower court's judgment finding the accused-appellant
guilty of the crime of robbery with homicide and sentencing him to suffer the
penalty of <u>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></u>, to indemnify
the heirs of the victim, <span class="SpellE">Anacito</span> <span class="SpellE">Tragia</span>,
in the amount of P6,000.00 plus the sum of P53.00 as the value of personal belongings
and P6.00 cash which were robbed from the deceased, with costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crime was committed in the evening of <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1962</st1:date> in <span class="SpellE">sitio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Nacaalang</span>, barrio <span class="SpellE">Canlinga</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Dagami</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="21">9
 p.m.</st1:time> while the victim <span class="SpellE">Anacito</span> <span class="SpellE">Tragia</span>, his wife <span class="SpellE">Cleofe</span> <span class="SpellE">Redoña</span> and their daughter Benita <span class="SpellE">Tragia</span>,
13 years old, were asleep in the <span class="SpellE"><u>sala</u></span> of their
one-storey house, they were awakened by a noise coming from the kit­chen, which
was an extension of the house and was separated from the <span class="SpellE"><u>sala</u></span>
by a partition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Anacito</span>
stood up, lighted a lamp and with it went to the kitchen. <span class="SpellE">Cleofe</span>
and Benita who remained lying down in the <span class="SpellE"><u>sala</u></span>
then heard two gun shots, after which <span class="SpellE">Anacito</span> walked
back to the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> and laid down, apparently
wounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two men then followed him into
the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>, opened their trunks and took five pairs of
pants and threatened the women that they would also shoot them if they did not
give their money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Benita then took P6.00
from the pocket of the trousers worn by <span class="SpellE">Anacito</span> and
gave it to the robbers who then left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Anacito</span> died about three hours later that same evening of
one wound on his body above the waistline, according to the women's testimony -
no medical report having been pre­pared or submitted as to the cause of the
victim's death.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court rendered its verdict of guilty on the strength of
the testimony of the widow, <span class="SpellE">Cleofe</span>, and her daughter
Benita, that they recognized appellant as one of the robbers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal, Atty. Salvador San Juan, as
counsel <u>de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span></u>, has raised as a main issue
the sufficiency and adequacy of the evidence identifying appellant as the
culprit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our careful review of the record and of the testimony of the two
principal prosecution witnesses fails to leave that degree of moral cer­tainty
sufficient to overcome reasonable doubts favoring appellant's in­nocence and to
let the mind rest easy upon the certainty of his guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are so many unexplained gaps and
conflicts on vital details between their inadequate testimonies that even the
State, in its brief upholding the verdict, was constrained to contend that ''as
between Benita who was only 13 years old at the time of the incident and her
mother, the testimony of the latter is more reliable and accurate."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Benita, who testified on <st1:date year="1963" day="10" month="6">June
 10, 1963</st1:date>, the year following the com­mission of the crime, was
noted by the Court and the State to be ignorant and practically illiterate and
hard put to answering even simple questions of the prosecuting fiscal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She identified appellant in court as one of
the robbers, claiming to have known him "about two months" but could
not answer and gave no answer to the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span>
follow-up question of "two months from what time?"<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
In testifying on the incident as related above, she declared that appellant
"and his two companions went inside the house"; that "the companion
of the accused" shot her father at the kitchen, using a carbine;<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
that afterwards these two persons went to the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>
and threatened to shoot them also, if they would not give money, while
appellant "was walking to and fro;"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
that after these two per­sons opened their trunks and got the five pairs of
pants and the P6.00 taken from her father's trousers, they all left; that her
father "told us (herself and her mother) that he was wounded, "sat
down, and died at about twelve o'clock in the evening; and that three town
policemen went to their house the next day to investigate and found an empty
shell inside the house.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Cleofe</span>, testifying after her daughter,
likewise identified the appellant but her own testimony contradicted her
daughter's in a num­ber of major details about which neither of them could be
possibly mistaken and which contradictions, taken together with the facts and
circumstances of record supporting appellant's defense, cast serious doubt as
to their trustworthiness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cleofe</span> testified that she had known him for about two years
as they were residing in the same barrio, although her <span class="SpellE">sitio</span>
was "about 9 kilometers" away in her rough calcula­tion being far
from his place; that appellant had "only <u>one</u> (companion) because
they were only two who went up";<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
that after her husband was shot in the kitchen, he was still able to walk to
the <span class="SpellE"><u>sala</u></span>, where she and Benita had remained;
that he said nothing to them because he fell down on the floor, could not talk
anymore and was already dead;<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
that although from her own testimony, it is quite clear that since she and her
daughter remained in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>, they could not see the
intruders who shot her husband in the kitchen, <span class="SpellE">Cleofe</span>
on her part declared that "he (appellant) pulled the trigger of the
gun;"<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
she also described the gun as a carbine and stated that the police at their
investigation found one empty shell.</p>

<p class="BODY">The third and last prosecution witness presented was <span class="SpellE">Servillano</span> <span class="SpellE">Ramuite</span>, the municipal
policeman who investigated the case at the victim's house at <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Nacaalang</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This witness declared that "Benita
pointed to (him) two empty shells of a carbine gun"<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
under the house (These empty shells were the only objects presented as
evidence.) He observed that the victim's corpse had wounds, but could not tell
their location, as "(he) did not try to verify carefully."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
He then positively declared that at the investigation, "(A)<span class="SpellE">ccording</span> to Benita <span class="SpellE">Tragia</span>, <u>the
one who shot her father was the companion of <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Herlandez</span></u>,"<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
and "(T)hat <u>she suspected that the assailant was <span class="SpellE">Eu­sebio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Herlandez</span> because that person has the same curly hair</u>
with <span class="SpellE">Eu­sebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Herlandez</span>, <u>the
same height</u> and the <u>same feature of the face</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
The repeated efforts of appellant's counsel, on cross-examination to press on
this point that Benita, at the police investigation right on the day after the
killing, had not positively identified appellant as one of the robbers who
broke into their house, but that the killer of her father had similar physical
features as appellant, were inexplicably blocked <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span><u> </u>by the lower court, who three
times successively, ordered counsel to make "another question."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Defense counsel, upon asking the witness directly "what did Benita <span class="SpellE">Tragia</span> tell you behind the house when you investigated
her?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"got finally the direct admission
"<u>that the assailant who shot her father was a companion of a person who
was similar or identical to <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Herlandez</span></u>.”<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant, a married farmer with two children, and 24 years old
at the time he took the stand on December 17, 1963 to defend himself, denied
the charge against him as, untrue and attributed it to personal grudge and ill
feeling that members of the victim's family had against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He recounted that he had worked in June 1961
in a land near the house of <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Llanito</span>, a son-in-law of the deceased and married to <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span>, another daughter of the deceased; that since <span class="SpellE">Llanito's</span> ducks were destroying and eating his <span class="SpellE"><u>palay</u></span> seedlings, he reported them to the barrio
lieutenant, <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> <span class="SpellE">Maganda</span>,
who summoned the couple and required them to fence in their ducks; that in
October 1961 when appellant's <span class="SpellE">palay</span> was almost ripe,
the couple's ducks continued to go to his field and eat the <span class="SpellE">palay</span>,
and appellant struck them, killing two and catching 14 others, and turned them
over to the barrio lieutenant, <span class="SpellE">Maganda</span>; the latter
summoned the couple again and told them he would not release the ducks unless
they paid the damages which he fixed at 15 <span class="SpellE">gantas</span> and
the couple paid the same to appellant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This incident was corroborated by the barrio lieutenant,' <span class="SpellE">Maganda</span>, who further confirmed that the two families became
"enemies", because the <span class="SpellE">Llanito</span> couple
"had a sort of a grudge against <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Herlandez</span> because of the two geese which were killed."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant gave a straightforward account of his whereabouts and
activity on the day of the crime and on the following day:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>his mother, Maria <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>,
had gone to his house that day to help prepare a native pastry called <span class="SpellE"><u>lidguid</u></span> to be brought by his wife to Manila to sell
there; in the afternoon he busied himself gathering firewood and preparing the
things needed for the pastry; after he had placed the pastry for cooking, he
then laid down in the house and went to sleep; the cooking was done by his wife
and mother in the kitchen and began at around 9 p. m. and lasted up to
midnight, according to his mother who testified in corrobora­tion; appellant
never left his <span class="SpellE">hou</span> se up to the following morning;
the following morning, he told his wife and mother to go ahead to the <span class="SpellE"><u>pobla</u>­<u>cion</u></span> and to take the things to be
brought by his wife to Manila, since he had to attend to bringing the copra of <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagunzad</span> on a <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> sledge to one <span class="SpellE">Mang</span> <span class="SpellE">Asiong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After making
his delivery, he met his wife and mother at the corner store; he then noted
people going to the muni­cipal building to see something strange (as the corpse
of the deceased was brought there) and he went in also out of curiosity; after
about half an hour, as he was returning to where his wife arid mother were
waiting, Carlo <span class="SpellE">Ugat</span>, a policeman called him and told
him "that (he) was the one who shot <span class="SpellE">Anacito</span> <span class="SpellE">Tragia</span>;" appellant "told him not to be joking
because it is not only a trifle matter (sic)"<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
but <span class="SpellE">Ugat</span> brought him to the office of the chief of
police.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant further asserted that Benita <span class="SpellE">Tragia</span>
was in the office with only the two of them; that <span class="SpellE">Ugat</span>
was investigating Benita who did not say anything; and that he heard <span class="SpellE">Ugat</span> tell Benita "If the Chief of Police arrives and
you are investigated, tell him that it was <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Herlandez</span> who shot your father."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant was not cross-examined at all by the fiscal and his
testi­mony thus gains unchallenged weight, as the fiscal opted not to test it
in the crucible of cross-examination.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The recalled Benita to the witness stand in rebuttal for her only to
declare that it was not <span class="SpellE">Ugat</span> but the chief of police
who investigated her and her mother at the municipal building, and that they
identified him as he was there in the municipal building viewing the corpse.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
But Benita was not asked directly about.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Ugat's</span> al­leged instruction to her to name him
as the killer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing was even
presented by the prosecution to indicate that appellant was ever confronted by
Benita and her mother in the municipal building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More importantly, <span class="SpellE">Ugat</span>,
the policeman was not presented either to rebut the charge of appellant that
he, <span class="SpellE">Ugat</span>, was responsible for Benita's pointing to
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, when appellant's
counsel asked appellant in direct examination as to whether the police searched
his house for the stolen five trousers the following day after the incident,
appellant was prevented from answering by the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span>
objection to the question as "leading and of no materiality"<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
- giving rise to the adverse presumption that appellant's house was indeed
searched by the police, who found nothing.</p>

<p class="BODY">All the foregoing facts and circumstances:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the uncertainties and in­adequacies in the
identification of appellant by the prosecution's eyewitnesses, their
conflicting testimonies about major details about which they could not possibly
be mistaken, the improbability of <span class="SpellE">Cleofe's</span> testimony
that she saw appellant pull the trigger of the gun with Benita on the other
hand stating to the policeman investigating the case at their house right on
the day after the incident that "the assailant who shot her father was a
companion of a person who was similar or identical to <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Herlandez</span>", the utter lack of any description by
these witnesses of the one or two other companions of the assailant who broke
into their house, notwithstanding they had all the opportunity to observe and
remember their features and the rule cited by the State that victims of robbery
and violence strive to know the identity of their assailants,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
their failure to explain why they did not confront appellant with their
denunciations as the deceased's killer when they allegedly identified him in
the municipal building, the difficulty of giving credence to Benita's testimony
that all appellant did at their house was to "walk to and fro" as if
deliberately to expose himself to identification notwithstanding his being a
resident of the same barrio as theirs, the absence of any motive on the part of
appellant to commit such a dastardly act, the unlikelihood that appellant who
was gainfully and lawfully employed would rob and kill for five pairs of
trousers that were practically valueless, the prosecution's failure to rebut
appellant's accusation of fabrication of testimony against him - all these
serve to give commensurate strength to appellant's protesta­tion of his
innocence and heighten the prosecution's failure of discharging its burden of
establishing by competent and credible proof the guilt of the accused beyond
reasonable doubt.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>
