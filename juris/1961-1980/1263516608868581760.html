petitioner before us, in the Court of Industrial Relations on October 20, 1967
(Case No. 2037-MC).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purpose was
"to determine whether the Laguna College Teachers Association (LACTA) or
any other labor organization is the true and voluntary choice of the majority
of the teachers working in petitioner's establishment the sole and exclusive
bargaining representative."</p>

<p class="BODY">LACTA intervened and filed an answer on <st1:date year="1967" day="18" month="11">November 18, 1967</st1:date>, praying that the petition
for, certification election be dismissed and that it be directly certified as
sole and exclusive bargaining representative of all the <span class="GramE">teachers</span>,
excluding "those occupying supervisory and confidential positions (as)
defined and settled by jurisprudence."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner thereafter
elevated the case to the court en banc on motion for reconsideration insofar as
</span>the decision (1) authorized the inclusion of eight teachers <span style="">as </span>rank and file employees and
therefore declared them eligible to vote in the certification election and (2)
authorized (LACTA<span style=""> only one (LACTA)
instead </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">two bargaining units to be voted upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>LACTA interposed its opposition to the
motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">meantime the Bureau of Labor Relations scheduled the election for </span><st1:date year="1968" day="26" month="3"><span style="">March
 26, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">, but upon
petitioner's motion respondent Court suspended it until further orders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion for reconsideration was denied by
the Court en banc on </span><st1:date year="1968" day="5" month="4"><span style="">April </span><span style="">5, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">, and
the Director of Labor Relations thereupon reset the election for April 22.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On April 20, 1968
petitioner came to this Court on a petition for review of the orders of March
11 and April 5, seeking a modification thereof so that employees "hold­ing
supervisory and/or confidential positions<span class="GramE">...(</span>may) be
excluded from whatever appropriate bargaining unit or </span>may be finally
determined," and praying that a restraining order be issued by this Court
to stop respondents from implementing the orders appealed from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, however, while it gave due course
to the petition, did not issue the restraining order <span style="">prayed </span>for.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 26, 1968 respondent LACTA filed a motion to dismiss the
petition on two grounds, namely: "(1) appeal is (a) dilatory and not
conducive to industrial Peace; 'b) has become moot and academic, with
petitioner having actively participated in the election and is there­fore
already in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>; and (c) raises flimsy and unsubs­tantial
issues; and (2) the petition raises questions. <span class="GramE">of</span> fact
(and), aside from the agreement between petitioner and LACTA that they would
not appeal the order of the trial Court of the Court of Industrial Relations;
this Honorable Court, therefore, has no jurisdiction over the present appeal
(sic)." A supplemental motion to dismiss followed, after which <span style="">peti­</span>tioner submitted its comment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue raised in the petition refers to the <span class="SpellE">c<span style="">la</span>sification</span>
of the following employees in the rank-and-file category:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Almanzor</span>,
Eduardo R. <span class="SpellE">Lainez</span>, <span class="SpellE">Adventor</span>
C. <span class="SpellE">Neri</span>, <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Belen,
Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Briones</span>, <span class="SpellE">Olimpio</span>
Cortez, Sr., Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Pisigan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> Torres.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner claims that these eight are supervisors and therefore should <span style="">not </span><span style="">been </span>considered <span style="">as </span>eligible
to vote in the <span style="">election </span>of
appropriate bargaining unit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The issue, however, is
mainly one of fact. In his resolution thereof the trial Judge analyzed in
detail the evidence before it, both oral and documentary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The analysis </span><span style="">shows </span><span style="">that there is
substantial support for the conclusion reached, and the substantial-evidence
rule applicable to cases like the present precludes our reviewing the matter on
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">The trial </span><span style="">Judge, in his order of </span><st1:date year="1968" day="11" month="3"><span style="">March 11, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">, found as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"On the issue as to whether the eight named teachers are
supervisors or not, there is, in the first place, no evidence adduced <span style="">to </span><span style="">show that</span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Almanzor</span> is a supervisor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to <span class="SpellE">Pisigan</span>
the only evidence offered to show that he is a supervisor <span style="">is </span>Ex<span style="">hibit "R" which </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">nothing
more than his designation </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">Moderator and/or Adviser o the <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span> Lake
News, School Organ of the Students of the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="">Laguna</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">Col­lege</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">, </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="">San Pablo</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">". From this document, it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">shown that the principal functions of <span class="SpellE">Pisigan</span> are to select, by</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">competitive examinations, the students who will 'occupy the positions
of editor-in-chief, associate editor, news-in-charge, feature-in-charge,
literary-in-charge; and to tone down, or totally disapprove publication of
articles </span>which, in his opinion, are derogatory to the good name of any
person or institution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These functions
and the others enumerated in Exhibit "R" are, not within the purview
of the definition of supervisor as provided in Section 2(k) of R.A. 875.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So <span style="">is </span>the case of <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span>
Torres.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being a consultant of the
College Organ, the <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span> Lake News, <span style="">and have (sic) duties as enumerated Ex</span>hibit
"S", do not make him a supervisor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This <span style="">is
</span>specially' true when his testimony was not denied or rebutted,
disclosing that h is not an area supervisor; that there are no teachers under
him (p. 153, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. December 14, 1967); and that he
does not have the power <span style="">to </span>hire, fire, lay-off, discharge, suspend, transfer, discipline
(p. 151, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., December 14, 1967), or adjust the
grievances of, any teacher of the Laguna College (p. 152, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">t.s.n</span></span><span class="GramE"><span style="">.„</span></span><span style=""> </span><st1:date year="1967" day="14" month="12"><span style="">December 14, 1967</span></st1:date><span style="">). The case of Belen </span><span class="SpellE">Briones</span>, Cortez, Sr., <span class="SpellE">Lainez</span> and <span class="SpellE">Neri</span> are no different. Although they are <span style="">area </span>supervisors,
they do not exercise any of the attributes or functions of a supervisor as defined
in Section 2(k) of R.A. 875. To better understand <span style="">their functions, it is </span>best to know what <span class="GramE">is an
area supervisor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The word
"area" in the designation refers to a particular sub­ject, like
English, Mathematics and Phy­sics, Filipino, General Science, Biology and
Chemistry, and Social Science-History and Economics.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a fact that not one of these area
supervisors has the power <span style="">to hire or </span><span style="">fire, lay-off, suspend, dis</span>charge or
discipline the teachers under them or adjust their grievances. The power to
rate the efficiency of the teachers under them is even subject to review or
revision by the principal, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Wenceslao</span> <span class="SpellE">Retizos</span> (pp. 30 to 40, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1967" day="14" month="12"><span style="">December
 </span>14, 1967</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span style="">a matter of fact, their functions are but
recommendatory (p. 48, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. December </span>14,
1967).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <span style="">the assistant </span>principal and general super­visor admitted that
the <span style="">recommendations of the area </span><span class="GramE">supervisors,</span> are <span style="">subject
to evaluation, review and final approval by the principal, as "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> most recommendations of area
supervisors are considered with a grain of salt." </span><span class="GramE">(pp. 17 <span style="">to </span>18, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., </span><st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="12"><span class="GramE">December 27, 1967</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">.)</span> It
is <span style="">established by the evidence </span>that
even. as the <span style="">efficiency ratings given </span>by
<span class="SpellE">Lainez</span>, an area <span style="">supervisor,
is </span>(sic) based on his own observations of the teachers under him, he was
prevailed upon <span style="">by the principal </span>to
change them (p. 65, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., December 14, 1967), which
he did, and that his remarks and observations of some of the teachers under him
made in Exhibit <span style="">"G" were </span>deleted
in the copy furnished the Bureau of Private Education (pp. 82 to <span style="">84, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
December </span>14, 1967). In the case of area <span style="">supervisor </span><span class="SpellE">Neri</span>, as was admitted by
the <span style="">as­sistant
</span>principal and general supervisor, his recommendations, indeed, are
considered with a grain of salt. <span class="SpellE">Neri's</span> testimony 'is
not denied that when he recommended a teacher' to teach biology, his
recommendation was re­jected (p. 108, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
December 14, 1967); <span style="">and when he
assigned a teacher to teach Science, without so much as notifying him, the
teacher was given Arithmetic (p. 109, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
December 14, 1967). The prepara­tion of program of supervision by area
supervisors is, likewise, not indicative that they are supervisors, for, as
testified to by <span class="SpellE">Lainez</span>, which testimony is not
rebutted, it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">nothing more than the
</span><span style="">enumerations </span><span style="">of activities in the area, many<span style=""> </span>of them merely <span class="SpellE">routinary</span>,
as for instance, the checking of the formal themes, notebooks, survey of
textbooks, and regulating the number of students in a class (p. 52, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., December 14, 1967). For all the foregoing reasons,
it is believed that <span class="SpellE">Lainez</span>, Belen, <span class="SpellE">Neri</span>, <span class="SpellE">Briones</span>, Cortez, Sr.,
Torres, <span class="SpellE">Pisigan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Almanzor</span>
are not super­visors."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">What is more, in the
return-to-work agreement entered </span><span style="">into
</span><span style="">by the parties</span><span style=""> on January 4, 1968, to settle the strike declared
by LACTA on January 2, 1968, they both waived the right to appeal, except on
questions of law, from a</span><span style="">ny</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">decision
or order that might be tendered by the trial Court </span><span style="">in the case then pending, No. 2037-MC. The
question of whether the eight </span><span style="">employees
</span><span style="">aforementioned were supervisors
or belonged to the rank and file was one of fact and consequently was covered
by the waiver.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The second issue raised
in the instant petition concerns the declaration in the order of </span><st1:date year="1968" day="11" month="3"><span style="">March
 11, 1968</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>that
only one bargaining unit should represent all the <span style="">teachers </span>employed in the <st1:place><st1:placename>Laguna</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner insists that there should be two
units, one for college professors and another for high school teachers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This<span style=""> </span>is a matter that <span style="">is </span>address to the sound discretion of respondent Court, upon its
own<span style=""> consideration </span>of all the
pertinent circumstances; and unless such 'discretion has been gravely abused
there is no justification to rule otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The following rationale of <span style="">the </span><span style="">courts decision appears to be well-advised, </span>and
<span style="">the </span><span style="">allega</span><span style="">tions in the
petition do not make out a sufficient case for the review thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"On the appropriate bargaining unit, petitioner, changing its
original stand, proposed two separate units, namely, college unit' composed of
the professors and instructors in the College, and high school unit com­prising
the high school teaches. On the other hand, LACTA proposed only one unit the
employer unit composing ' of all the teachers in the entire <st1:place><st1:placename>Laguna</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype></st1:place>. From the evidence adduced,
it is believed that the factors in favor of employer unit far outweigh the
reasons for the establishment of two separate <span style="">b</span>argaining units as proposed by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not denied that college teachers are
governed by rules and regulations of the <span style="">bureau
of </span>Private Education, which are different from the rules and regulations
for high school teachers; that the high school 'depart<span style="">ment </span><span style="">of petitioner </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">organized at a different time from the college department; that the
set-up in the two </span><span style="">depart­ments </span><span style="">are different; and that the high school
teachers are paid per </span><span style="">period or </span><span style="">'subject, while the College teachers are paid
on the hourly basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it is also not
denied that these two </span>departments are under the control of only one
board <span style="">of </span>trustees; that they
are housed in one and the same build­ing (p'. 68 <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
December <span style="">8, </span>1967); that there is
but one cashier and only one registrar who himself is the ad<span style="">ministrative officer of the whole Laguna
College (pp. 68 and 70. <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., December 8, 1967).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact the function of the
Administrative Officer who is no other than </span><span class="SpellE">Wenceslao</span>
<span class="SpellE">Retizos</span> extends <span style="">even
</span>to the high school department (pp. 71-73, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
December 8; 1967).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a fact that
there are some teachers in<span style="">volved in
this case who are teaching both in the college and high school departments (pp.
69 to 70, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>,</span> December 8, 1967; pp. 28, 111
and 131, December 14, 1967), which is a <span style="">decisive
proof of the Community of interest of these teachers and which negates the
establishment of two bar</span>gaining units.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, in the pro<span style="">posed two
separate </span>bargaining units, <span style="">the
elementary teachers of the petitioner will be left out without a </span><span style="">bargaining representative. Moreover,
considering that there are only one</span>-<span style="">hundred-thirty (130) teachers in this proceedings</span><span style="">, </span><span style="">after
twelve of the teachers were </span><span style="">considered
supervisors </span><span style="">and/or holding
confidential positions, to divide the collective bargaining </span><span style="">unit into two would assuredly be dissipating </span><span style="">their strength for collective bargaining
purposes, Furthermore, the pro</span><span style="">position
would not</span> be<span style=""> conduci</span>v<span style="">e </span>to <span style="">industrial peace for the possibility is great that, with the establishment
of </span>two <span style="">bargaining units,
petitioner would be contending with two different unions vying against each
other for better benefits to gain more members."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent LACTA avers in
it answer that the certification election authorized by respondent court has <span class="SpellE">actualy</span> been held.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The instant petition, therefore, insofar as </span>it seeks to enjoin
said<span style=""> election</span> has <span style="">already become moot, </span>particularly <span style="">in </span>view of the fact that petitioner
participated therein actively, as also alleged in<span style=""> </span>the same answer and nowhere denied by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever other questions <span class="GramE"><span style="">there<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>are</span>
relative to the conduct of such election may be ventilated before respondent
Court, which has jurisdiction over the main case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In<span style=""> </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">supplemental petition filed on August 12, 1968, petitioner alleges that
respondents acted with grave abuse of discretion in ordering the </span><span style="">certification election to be </span>held on
April 22, 1968, before the <span style="">lapse of the
"ten?day period" or review of the resolution of respondent </span>Court
<span style="">dated </span>April 5, 1968, copy of
which was received by petitioners <span style="">on </span><span style="">the following April 15.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">This
new allegation deserves no</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">serious consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place it is a new </span><span style="">matter which should have been included </span><span style="">in the </span><span style="">original petition filed on </span><st1:date year="1968" day="20" month="4"><span style="">April 20, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">, wherein the prayer was that the</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">certification
election scheduled for April 22 be suspended so </span><span style="">that the matter of excluding certain employees from </span>voting <span style="">therein could first be settled. No reference
whatsoever </span>was <span style="">made to the fact
that the election, if held as thus scheduled would be premature for the reason
now advanced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">To admit the </span><span style="">supplemental petition would in effect be to authorize an appeal beyond
the 30-day <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period. Secondly, the
supplemental petition has not cited any specific rule to the </span><span style="">effect that a </span><span style="">certification election may </span><span style="">not
</span><span style="">beheld until </span>after the
expiration of 10 days from receipt by the parties of the enabling resolution of
the <st1:street><st1:address>Industrial Court</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally<span style="">,
</span>as already adverted to, petitioner took part actively in <span style="">the </span>election, and in fact challenged
the right of 59 LACTA members to vote therein, raising no objection with
respect to the others.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Regarding the allegation
that the strike staged on April 3, 1968 was illegal and hence rendered the
strikers disqualified to vote, this is a matter that properly pertains </span>to
<span style="">the ULP charge filed by petitioner
precisely questioning </span>the <span style="">legality
of said strike, but which charge, according to respondents, has up to the
present not resulted in the filing of</span> <span style="">a formal complaint by the prosecuting officers of the Court Industrial
