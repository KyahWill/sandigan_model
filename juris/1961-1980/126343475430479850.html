<blockquote>â€œx <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> that sometime in the
afternoon of Sept. 16, 1969 while he was supervising the asphalting of the
portion of the <span class="SpellE">Palta-Palanog</span> Road, <span class="SpellE">Virac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Catanduanes</span>, droplets of
hot asphalt hit his left eye which caused him to submit for a medical treatment
in the <span class="SpellE">Zantua</span> Medical Clinic, in <span class="SpellE">Virac</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Catanduanes</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"He was attended
to by Dr. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Zantua</span> for an emergency treatment
particularly the removal of the asphalt in the left eye orbital area inside the
claimant's eye.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After this
treatment, claimant was subsequently placed under the medical care of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Zantua</span> considering that the claimant had been complaining
of progressive blurring of vision in the affected eye.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Later
examinations revealed hemorrhage in the inside of the eye diagnosed as
'Vitreous Hemorrhage.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This eye injury
was complicated by a high blood pressure.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The testimony
of the claimant alone could not have any meaning at all were it not supported
by <span class="GramE">a duly</span> attested documentary evidence issued by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Zantua</span>, his attending physician (Exhibit D).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This Office
should have relied on the Physician's Report and certificate issued by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Zantua</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in order
to determine the extent of injury sustained by the claimant, this Office on
Dec. 2, 1974 (should be Oct. 2, 1974, p. 79, WCC rec.) issued an Order of
Referral of this case to Dr. Vicente Ramirez, Medical Rating Officer, Workmen's
Compensation Unit, Department of Labor, <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>
City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Ramirez submitted, in
compliance with the Order, a certification that the claimant by virtue of his
eye injury sustained while in the performance of his work which was aggravated
by a sudden rise of high blood pressure, (he) suffered a temporary total disability
for labor for three [3] months, and a permanent total disability for labor of
100% of the left eye.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"He further
certified that the claim for medical reimbursement in the amount of P5<span class="GramE">,755.00</span> should be reduced to P500.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No reason for such reduction was made.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In view of the
foregoing facts and circumstances, this Office cannot deny the claimant the benefits
granted under the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Under Section
14 of the Act, as amended, claimant is entitled to sixty per centum (60%) of
his weekly average wage which was P55.00 (P222.20 monthly salary) equals P33.00
and for 12 weeks [3 months TTD]<span class="GramE">,</span> claimant therefore
should receive the sum of P396.00 as compensation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Under Section
18 (NSD) of the same Act, claimant is further entitled to fifty per centum
[50%] of his weekly average wage which is P55.55 equals P27.77 and for 100
weeks, claimant should receive the sum of P2<span class="GramE">,777.00</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The same
claimant is further entitled to the reimbursement of medical expenses pursuant
to Section 13, in the sum of P500.00 only." <span class="GramE">(Pp. 45-47,
WCC rec.).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General filed a motion for reconsideration; but the
same was denied by the Acting Referee, who thereafter ordered the elevation of
the records of the case to the respondent Commission for review.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">8.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On December 18, 1975, the respondent Commission
rendered its questioned decision, affirming the basic factual foundation of the
claim, but reversed the award because "There is no showing x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> that he was disabled by
reason of the said injury and he did not even say if he ever went on sick
leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, he continued
working until he was compulsorily retired on <st1:date year="1969" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1969</st1:date> (p. 6, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
Aug. 17, 1974 hearing).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stopped
working not because of disability but because of age, as he reached 65 years
and retired compulsorily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">It may be true that claimant suffered an injury to his left eye,
but this did not keep him from working and, therefore, did not suffer any
diminution of his earning capacity" (pp. 39-40, WCC rec.).</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this recourse.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The reversal by the respondent Commission of the Acting Referee's
award constitutes a grave abuse of discretion, the same being in palpable and
patent disregard of the law and the controlling jurisprudence on workmen's
compensation cases, very well applicable on the set of facts clearly
established by the evidence on record, and therefore should be set aside.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><u>I<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">It must be first stated that petitioner's right to compensation
was not effectively <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> by respondent
employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Employer's Report of
Accident or Sickness filed on January 23, 1973 by respondent employer and the <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> filed on March 15, 1973 by the Solicitor
General were too late because Sections 37 and 45 of the Workmen's Compensation
Act, as amended, require them to be filed within 14 days from the occurrence,
or within 10 days from knowledge of, the injury or death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was treated by Dr. Antonio P. <span class="SpellE">Zantua</span> that same evening of <st1:date year="1969" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1969</st1:date> in his clinic in <span class="SpellE">Virac</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Catanduanes</span> when droplets of hot asphalt hit his left
eye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Zantua</span>
stated in his report that the patient had still asphalt on his left eye when he
came to his clinic for treatment (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">A, p. 131, rec.).</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Certainly, his reddish left eye due to vitreous hemorrhage must have
been noticed by his superiors when he reported for work the next three days
from <st1:date year="1969" day="16" month="9">September 16 to 19, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under existing jurisprudence, such knowledge
of his superiors of his injury, binds the respondent employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, it is not disputed that the
District Engineer of <span class="SpellE">Virac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Catanduanes</span>
advised petitioner not to file sick leave of absence by reason of his eye
injury (p. 4, rec.), from which undisputed fact WE can infer his (District
Engineer) knowledge of petitioner's injury by reason of the September 16, 1969
accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>,
the petitioner's right to compensation was not effectively <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><u>II</u></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->WE go to the merits of the claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no question that petitioner suffered
personal injury from an accident arising out of and in the course of his
employment as there is no dispute that on <u>September 16, 1969</u>,
petitioner, while at work supervising the asphalting of the <span class="SpellE">Palta-Palawig-Calolbon</span>
road, was hit in the left eye by droplets of hot asphalt which required medical
treatment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The attending physician
stated in his medical certificate dated <st1:date year="1973" day="14" month="1">January
 14, 1973</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D, p. 100, WCC rec.) <span class="GramE">that</span> he treated petitioner on <st1:date year="1969" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1969</st1:date> and cleansed his left eye, orbital
area, of asphalt; that on <st1:date year="1969" day="23" month="9">September
 23, 1969</st1:date>, petitioner complained of progressive blurring of vision
in the affected eye and the examination thereof revealed hemorrhage which was
diagnosed as "vitreous hemorrhage," and the petitioner's blood
pressure was high.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on <st1:date year="1974" day="10" month="10">October 10, 1974</st1:date>, the Compensation
Rating Medical Officer of the Department of Labor, Regional Office No. 6,
certified that the examination performed on petitioner revealed that he
suffered temporary total disability for three (3) months and permanent total
disability of the left eye (p. 64, WCC rec.).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is clear therefore that petitioner's injury from the <st1:date year="1969" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1969</st1:date> accident resulted
in his disability and subsequent loss of the use of his left eye.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The Solicitor General contends that petitioner's
injury of September 16, 1969 did not entitle him to compensation under the law
because his injury did not result in wage loss as he continued working, despite
thereof, up to his last working day on September 19, 1969, the next day,
September 20, 1969, being his 65th birthday, which is the compulsory retirement
age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Relative to this issue, it must be
stated that the benefits under the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended,
awarded by the Acting Referee to petitioner which were however disallowed by
respondent Commission were (1) <u>temporary total disability</u> for three [3]
months under Section 14; (2) permanent disability for the complete loss of the
use of the left eye under Section 18 [should be Sec. 17, par. 16, which
specifically refers to the loss of one eye]; and (3) reimbursement for medical
expenses under Section 13.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense
raised by the Solicitor General can only be considered with respect to the
claim for temporary disability benefits under Section 14 which requires that
the injury results in a wage loss; because the compensation benefits awarded <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> is for the loss or diminution of wages by reason
thereof (<span class="SpellE">Corales</span> vs. Employees Compensation
Commission, 84 SCRA 762, 767 [1978]; 88 SCRA 548 [1979]); but not to the claim
for medical benefits under Section 13 which does not observe the wage loss
factor (ibid); nor to disability benefits claim under Sections 17 and 18,
because benefits therein provided are to compensate the injured workingman for
the actual and permanent loss of a member of the body (Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span> San Pedro vs. De Leon, 56 OG 4922 [1957]; <span class="SpellE">CaÃ±ete</span> vs. Insular Lumber Co., 61 Phil. 592 [1935]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the award of the benefits
provided for by Sections 13 and 17 must be maintained as they are not adversely
affected by the <u>wage-loss requirement</u> which appears not to be present in
this case.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">3.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Petitioner is not entitled to compensation
benefits under Section 14 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended, because
by his own evidence, he continued to work up to September 19, 1969 (p. 102,
124, WCC rec.) and as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, retired the
following day, September 20, 1969, at the age of sixty-five; hence, there was
no wage loss resulting from his September 16, 1969 injury (<span class="SpellE">Corales</span>
vs. ECC, supra).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's claim that he did not work on the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> period and that the wages he received for that
period was deducted from the money value of his accumulated leave, cannot
prevail over the incontrovertible fact that he did not file the required
application for sick leave, and his service record (p. 102, WCC rec.) does not
reflect any leave for the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> period.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, pursuant to <span class="GramE">Our</span> ruling in
Hernandez vs. WCC (14 SCRA 219 [1965]), compensation payments under Section 14
cannot extend beyond compulsory retirement date of the injured employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the award for three months
temporary total disability under Section 14 of the Act, as amended, in the sum
of P396.00 cannot be maintained.</p>

P5,755.00 (p. 95, WCC rec.) was reduced to P500.00 by the Acting Referee in his
