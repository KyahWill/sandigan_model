				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals reversing one of the 
Commissioner of Customs, and decreeing the cancellation of PISC surety bond No. 
014 of the Pioneer Surety &amp; Insurance Corporation in the amount of 
P20,351.34 filed for the release of the importation in question, without 
pronouncement as to costs.
<p>The facts of the case are set forth in the decision appealed from as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"From the testimonial evidence adduced during the hearing before the Bureau 
of Customs and the documentary evidence presented before this Court upon which 
this case was submitted for decision, it appears that on August 3, 1954, a 
shipment, consisting of one hundred (100) packages of 'sotanghon' described as 
'semolina' arrived at the Port of Manila on board S.S. Henrik from Hongkong; 
that the shipment was declared under Entry No. 63019, Exhibits 'B' and '5', and 
covered by commercial invoice No. 185, dated July 31, 1954, of Yeng's Commercial 
Co., Hongkong, Exhibit 'E', Consular invoice No. 1482 of the same date, Exhibit 
'C', and Central Bank release certificate Reg. No. 6777, L/C No. 10843, dated 
August 5, 1954, Exhibits 'A' and '6', which described the shipment as 
'semolina', classified it as 'NEC-04' and assigned to it Commodity Code No. 
040802; that upon examination by the customs authorities, the importation was 
found to be 'sotanghon', which they classified as vermicelli, under Commodity 
Code No. 040804-UI, as a consequence of which it was seized; that the petitioner 
paid the assessed duties and taxes thereon; that pending the seizure 
proceedings, the importation was released to petitioner upon the filing of PISC 
Surety Bond No. 014 of the Pioneer Surety &amp; Insurance Corp. in the amount of 
P28,351.34; and that after the proceedings, the Collector of Customs for the 
Port of Manila; rendered a decision decreeing the forfeiture of the shipment in 
question for violation of Central Bank Circular No. 44 in relation to Section 
1363 (f) of the Revised Administrative Code, which decision was affirmed <i>in 
toto</i> by the respondent Commissioner of Customs in a decision rendered on 
February 25, 1956. From the last mentioned decision, the petitioner interposed 
the present appeal."</p></blockquote>
<p>The issue in this case is whether the Sotanghon shipment in question falls 
under Commodity Code No.040802-NEC or under Commodity Code No. 040804-UI both of 
the Statistical Classification of Commodities implementing Central Bank 
Circulars Nos. 44 and 45. If it falls under the first, its importation by herein 
appellee was regular and in accordance with its importation papers, but if it 
falls under the second, the result would be otherwise and the shipment would be 
subject to forfeiture.</p>
<p>The issue has already been resolved by this Court on May 30, 1960 in G. R. 
No. L-12260 (108 Phil., 312) in which case appellee herein was also the 
importer. It, was therein held that Sotanghon falls under Commodity Code No. 
040804-UI, and not under Commodity Code 040802-NEC, because it should be 
classified as "vermicelli", it being a preparation similar to "macaroni, 
spaghetti, noodle and vermicelli"-the preparations covered by Commodity Code 
040804-UI.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby reversed and the one rendered 
by the Commissioner of Customs affirmed, with costs against 
appellee.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, 
Reyes, J.B.L., Paredes, De Leon,</i> and <i>Natividad, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
