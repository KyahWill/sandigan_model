<p class="BODY">The facts, as found by the Workmen's Compensation Commission,
are:</p>

<blockquote>"A perusal of the record disclosed that claimant Nitto Itona
was formerly employed and assigned in the Promotions Department of the
respondent with a monthly salary of P570.00.  He worked from 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M., but the varied activities of his
duties de­manded of him to work overtime, more particularly in undertaking
special coverages and assignments, which unduly exposed him to the elements and
strain and stress.  Because of the
nature of his employment, claimant contracted tuberculosis sometime in
September, 1972, as shown by his x-ray examination on September 18, 1972, which
indicated that he was suffering from PTB, mode­rately advanced, with cavity
formation, bilateral, with stelectasis on the left lung.  His illness was reported to this employer,
thru the Marketing Director and was referred to the Company physician, who
extended his medication on October 31, 1972 and November 4, 1972.  Upon the declaration of martial law, respondent
was forced to stop operations and some of its em­ployees were forced to stop
work­ing.  Claimant however stopped
working because of his disability as a result of his illness.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After a careful perusal of the foregoing facts, we reject
respondent's contentions in seeking a reversal of the decision.  Respondent's allegation that the settlement
in the amount of P8,000.00 extinguished its liability under the Workmen's
Compen­sation Act is untenable.  The
amount of P8,000.00, received by the com­plainant, was in consideration of the
dismissal of a case for unfair labor practices filed by the claimant against
the respondent before the NLRC, and the record shows that this amount repre­sents
claimant's increase in salary, bonus and living allowance and was never
intended to cover compensation benefits for disability resulting from illness
contracted in the course of his employ­ment."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It appears that the claimant had filed a case for unfair labor
practice against the Manila Times Publish­ing Co., Inc. with the National Labor
Relations Commis­sion.  This unfair
labor practice case was dismissed upon payment by the Manila Times Publishing
Co., Inc. to the claimant of the amount of P8,000.00 representing claimant's
increase in salary, bonus and living allowance.  The amount did not include compensation benefits for dis­ability
resulting from illness.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention that the employer-employee relation­ship between
the Manila Times Publishing Co., Inc. and Nitto P. Itona ceased upon the
proclamation of Martial Law on September 21, 1972 is not meritorious.  Although the business of publishing
newspapers ceased with the proclamation of Martial Law, the petitioner
continued to do business as a corporation, receiving printing jobs from other
companies, leasing and renting its facilities including its buildings.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a fact that the illness of the claimant, private respondent
herein, supervened during the period of his employment.  Hence, it is presumed that the claim is
compensable.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has held:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x In a very recent case penned by Mr. Justice Claudio Tee­hankee,
this Court held: 'xxx assuming the employee's illness may be ruled out as an
occupational di­sease or that the causal link between the nature of his
employment and his ailment has been insufficiently shown, nevertheless, it is
to be presumed as mandated by Section 44 of the Work­men's Compensation Act,
that the em­ployee's illness which supervened during his employment either
arose out of, or at least aggravated by said employment and with this presumption,
the burden of proofs shifts to the employer and the employee is relieved of the
burden to show causation.  In the case
before Us, the respondent has failed to dis­charge that burden.  x x x "<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the present case the petitioner had not adduced evidence to
rebut the presumption that the claim of Nitto P. Itona is compensable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as there is no showing that the illness of the private
respondent, Nitto P. Itona, has been arrested or cured, he is entitled to the
maximum amount of P6,000.00 as disability benefit.  He is also entitled to reimburse­ment of medical expenses which
may be supported by proper receipts.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for review is denied and the
decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission sought to be reviewed is
hereby affirmed with the modification that Nitto P. Itona shall be reimbursed
such medical expenses as may be established by proper receipts.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">MAKASIAR, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur with the additional opinion that the petitioner employer
should likewise be directed to continuously provide the claimant with such medical,
surgical and hospital services as well as appliances and supplies as the nature
of his disability and the progress of his recovery may require and which will
promote his early restoration to the maximum level of his physical capacity.  It is my consistent view that the provisions
of Section 13 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended, and Article 185 of
the New Labor Code confer such right on the disabled employee, whether his
disability is temporary or permanent.  This is in compliance with the social justice guarantee of both the 1935
and 173 Constitutions and in obedience to the directive of Article 4 of the New
Labor Code that "all doubts in the implementation and interpretation of
the provisions of this Code, including its implementing rules and regulations,
shall be resolved in favor of labor", which is a re-statement of existing
jurisprudence as well as Article 1702 of the New Civil Code.  To limit such right to a temporarily
disabled employee would inflict gross injustice on those permanently disabled,
who still need to be relieved from the pain, trauma, social ostracism or
humiliation generated by such permanent disability.</p>
