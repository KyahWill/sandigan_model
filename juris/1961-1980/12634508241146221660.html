				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Six cases of hand tools, ten cases of portable elec­tric tools,
consigned to the order of shipper Dayton Price &amp; Co., Ltd., were discharged
on <st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="5">May 20, 1963</st1:date> from the
vessel SS "<span class="SpellE">Turandot</span>" and delivered to the
Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service, Bureau of Customs, then
handling <span class="SpellE">arras­tre</span> operations in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Port</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not all of the <span class="GramE">shipment were</span> delivered
by the Cus­toms <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service to the
consignee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the loss of tools valued
at P3<span class="GramE">,261.21</span>, the consignee filed a claim with its
insurer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Insurance Co. of <st1:place>North
 America</st1:place>, the insurer, paid the claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">As <span class="SpellE">subrogee</span> to the consignee, said
insurance compa­ny, on <st1:date year="1964" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1964</st1:date>,
filed before the City Court of Ma­nila a suit for the same amount, plus
attorney's fees and costs, against the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and/or Bureau of Customs and/or Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After said court decided for
the plaintiff, defendants appealed to the Court of First Instance, alleging
immunity from suit and stating that recovery, if at all due, should be thru the
filing of a claim with the Auditor General under Act No. 3083 as amended by
Com. Act No. 327.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sustaining this contention, on March 3, 1965, the Court of First
Instance issued an order dismissing the complaint on the ground that defendants
agencies of the Philippine Government have no juridical capacity to be sued;
and that the Philippine Government may only enter­tain a money claim upon
compliance with the provisions of Act No. 3083 as amended by Com. Act No. 327.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appeal from said order direct to <span class="GramE">Us</span> was
thus taken by plaintiff.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Mobil Phil. Exploration, Inc. v. Customs <span class="SpellE">Arras­tre</span>
Service, L-23139, December 17, 1966, this Court squarely ruled on the point
raised herein and held that the Bureau of Customs, acting as part of the
governmental machinery in its operation of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
service as an incident of a prime governmental function, is immune from
suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And we there pointed out that the
claim involving money should have been filed with the Auditor General un­der
Com. Act No. 327.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed order of dismissal is hereby
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
