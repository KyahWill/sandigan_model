				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class=BODY>This is a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> and
prohibition with preliminary injunction seeking to set aside or annul:  (1) the order of respondent Judge of the
Court of Agrarian Relations (9th Regional District, Branch II, Legaspi City)
dated January 16, 1971 directing the issuance of a writ of execution of its
November 6, 1970 decision in CAR Case No. 651 which is pending appeal in the
Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. No. 47314-R); (2) the order of the same respondent
Judge dated February <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>27, 1971 </span>denying
petitioner's motion for reconsideration and/or stay f execution; <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>(3) </span>the resolution of the respondent
Court of Appeals dated July 30, 1971 in its pending appealed case (CA-G.R. No.
47314-R) denying herein petitioner's urgent motion for said appellate court to
dissolve the writ of execution or otherwise maintain petitioner in peaceful
possession of the landholding in question until the judgment in CAR Case No.
651 would have become final; and (4) the resolution of the same appellate court
dated September 3, 1971 denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration.  The writ of prohibition is sought separately
to enjoin the respondent Judge from implementing his order for the issuance of
the writ of execution, as well as the respondent Provincial Sheriff of Albay
from actually enforcing said writ.</p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>On November 19, 1972,
acting upon an urgent motion of petitioner alleging that private respondents
had filed with the agrarian court a motion to have him cited for contempt of
court, We issued a temporary restraining order worded as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>&quot;NOW THEREFORE, effective immediately, and until further
orders from this <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Court, YOU </span>(respondent
Judge), your representative, assigns or any person acting upon your orders,
place or stead, are hereby enjoined from hearing and enforcing the writ of
execution dated January 16, 1971, issued in CAR Case No. <span

proceedings.&quot;<span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

him from his landholding.  </span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Petitioner </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:

introduced on the land and that his shares as tenant which had not been
delivered to him in full be completed, or its money equivalent, plus interest
and damages be paid to him.  In their
answer respondents Antonio Floranza and Leopoldo Pojol denied Sodsod's claim
that he was a tenant, asserting that he &quot;is a mere laborer hired by your
answering respondents to help in the clearing of the land for planting as your
petitioner is without any visible means of livelihood but would depend only
upon the mercy and charity of your answering respondents.&quot; After
appropriate proceedings the agrarian court rendered a decision on November 27,
1970 sustaining the landowners' position and &quot;(O)rdering the plaintiff to
immediately vacate and deliver the possession and cultivation of the land in
question to the defendants.&quot; From this decision Jesus Sodsod appealed to
the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. No. 47314-R), perfecting the appeal on January 11,
1971.  And it was during the pendency of
said appeal that the assailed orders of respondent Judge were issued.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>The issuance of the writ
for the execution of the decision in CAR Case. No. 651 pending its appeal
before the Court of Appeals is sought to be justified under section 5 of
Republic Act No. 5434, which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Land Reform Code, both of which allow execution of a decision ejecting the
tenant only after the decision has become final and executory, do not apply to
the case at bar in view of the finding of the Court of Agrarian Relations that
petitioner was not and had never been a tenant of private
respondents-landowners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>The issue in this case is not of first impression.  In Paulo <i>vs</i>. Court of Appeals, et al.
(L-33845, December 18, 1973), which is practically on all fours with the facts
of this case, We stated:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;We had previously ruled in Quilantang <i>vs</i>. Court of
Appeals (L-34212, December 13, 1972, 48 SCRA 294, 298) that section 36 of
Republic Act No. 3844, created in favor of the agricultural lessee a <i>substantive</i>
<i>right</i> to continue in the enjoyment and possession of his landholding
except when the dispossession has been authorized by the Court in a judgment
that is final and executory and that Republic Act No. 5434 on the other hand,
as its title indicates, is purely <i>procedural</i> in nature, in that it
purports to do no more than prescribe a uniform procedure for appeals from the
bodies and entities enumerated therein.  It is easily comprehensible, then, considering the adjective nature of
R.A. 5434, that section 12 of R.A. 1267, as amended, was explicity and
precisely referred to as one of the procedural provisions to be superseded by
R.A. 5434.'  In the evolvement of legislative
policy declaring share tenancy as contrary to public policy and granting to
tenants greater security and added interests of a semi-proprietary nature in
their landholdings.  We declared therein
that it is, therefore, not a mere accident in the lawmaking process that while
under R.A. 1267 a tenant's authority to stay in his landholding until the
judgment ousting him became final and executory merely formed part of the
ordinary rules of procedure in the disposition of agrarian cases, that same
authority to hold over until final judgment was withdrawn by R.A. 3844 from the
realm of procedural law and transformed into a transcendental substantive
right.  Within the context of the
environmental legislative intention directly pertinent to the issue at bar,
this Court cannot construe R.A. 5434 an adjective law, in a manner that will
upturn one of the fundamental substantive aspects of R.A. 3844, although the
latter in terms of end-results, would seemingly operate to constrict the scope
of the former.' We reaffirmed this ruling in Tiongson <i>vs</i>. Court of
Appeals (L-35059) decided only last February 27, 1973 (49 SCRA 429) where We
again stressed that under the Land Reform Code the tenants are entitled to the
enjoyment and possession of their landholdings except when their dispossession
has been authorized by the Court in a judgment that is final and
executory.&quot;<span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>The basic issue before the Court of Appeals in the appealed case
(CA-G.R. No. 47314-R) is whether or not petitioner Jesus Sodsod is a tenant of
landowners Antonio Floranza and Leopoldo Pojol.  When said appellate court sanctioned Sodsod's ouster from the
landholding in question, it prejudged without sufficient justification the very
issue of the main case submitted to it for adjudication.</p>
