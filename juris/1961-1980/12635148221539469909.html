14, res­pondent <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span> <span class="SpellE">Siok</span>
Tin in her own behalf and that of her two minor children, applied for admission<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
as temporary visitors with the Immigration Bureau stating, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that Lim <span class="SpellE">Siong</span> is
her husband; that she wanted to visit him here; that her stay will be three
months; that she has four children, two of whom are with her; that they have
never been in the Philippines before and that their stay is guaranteed by a
P24,000 cash bond posted by her husband.</p>

<p class="BODY">Later, on repeated requests, respondents' period of stay was
extended up to <st1:date year="1961" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1961</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On November 27, 1961, respondents requested<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
the Secretaries of Foreign Affairs and of Justice, respec­tively, to change
their status as temporary visitors to that of special non-immigrants under Sec.
47(a-2) of the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940, as amended, and to extend
their authorized stay until the oath-taking of their husband and father Lim <span class="SpellE">Siong</span> whose petition for naturalization had been granted on
October 14, 1961.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
This was favorably acted upon by the Foreign Affairs Se­cretary on <st1:date year="1961" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1961</st1:date>, approving
respondents' change of status as special non-immigrants <u>for a period of stay
up to </u><st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="10"><u>October 14, 1963</u></st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Secretary of Justice likewise, upon due <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>, approved the exten­sion of respondents' stay <u>up
to October 14, 1963</u> provided that the latter secure re-entry permits to <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> and maintain their cash bond with the Bureau of
Immigration.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Despite the foregoing, respondents, on <st1:date year="1961" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1961</st1:date>, still made another request to
the Commissioner of Immigration <u>for an indefinite extension</u> of their
stay in the country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commissioner
granted extension, not indefinitely as prayed for, but <u>only up to </u><st1:date year="1962" day="12" month="9"><u>September 12, 1962</u></st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1962</st1:date>,
the Commissioner of Immigration under the new administration, abrogated all
extensions of stay of temporary visitors who arrived in 1961, thru Circular No.
V-101, duly approved by the Secretary of Jus­tice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="8">August
 31, 1962</st1:date>, the Commissioner wrote Lim <span class="SpellE">Siong</span>,
respondents' husband/father who was also their guarantor, requiring respondents
to leave the country on or before <st1:date year="1962" day="12" month="9">September
 12, 1962</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On said date, however, respondents, instead of departing, filed a
petition for prohibition with prelimi­nary injunction with the Court of First
Instance of Ma­nila to prevent their arrest and deportation.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
The court, Judge <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span> presiding, on <st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="9">September 13, 1962</st1:date> gave due course to
the petition, required the Commissioner of Immi­gration to answer and issued
preliminary injunction upon a P3,000 bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Commissioner filed his answer with a motion to dissolve the
injunction on <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="9">September 24, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="17" month="11">Novem­ber
 17, 1962</st1:date>, Judge <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span> denied the
motion to dis­solve the injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1964</st1:date>,
petitioner Commissioner of Immigra­tion moved for preliminary hearing on his
special and affirmative defenses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondents counter-moved with a request to admit supplemental pleadings
alleging that on February 24, 1964, their husband/father took his oath as a
Filipino<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
and consequently, respondents minor children became Filipinos while respondent
wife acquired a vested right to prove that she could be naturalized.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court, on <st1:date year="1964" day="25" month="6">June
 25, 1964</st1:date>, admitted the supplemental pleadings over petitioner's
opposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A subsequent motion to
reconsider failed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 16, 1965, petitioner Commissioner moved for the outright
dismissal of the case or at least the dissolution of the preliminary injunction
issued upon the authority of <u>Vivo v. <span class="SpellE">Arca</span></u>,
L-21728, December 27, 1963, which ruled, principally, that the refusal of the
trial court to dissolve a preliminary injunction after the expiration of the
alien visitors' authorized stay in the country is contrary to law and
constitutes grave abuse of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon respondents' opposition, Judge <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>
denied the motion to dismiss for being without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 7, 1965, the Commissioner on Immigration instituted
the present petition for <i style="">certiorari</i>
and prohibition with preliminary injunction, questioning the orders of the
lower court dated September 13, 1962 giving due course to the petition filed
therein and issuing the writ of preliminary injunction and the order of July
25, 1965 denying petitioner's motion to dismiss or dissolve preliminary
injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">We gave due course to the petition, required respon­dents to
answer, which they did, and issued the preliminary injunction prayed for.</p>

<p class="BODY">For resolution now are the following questions:</p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Did the lower court gravely abuse its discretion
in denying petitioner's motion to dismiss or to dissolve the injunction
anchored on the precedent-setting decision of <u>Vivo v. <span class="SpellE">Arca</span></u>,
supra?</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Was petitioner's failure to file a motion for
reconsideration a fatal defect?</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">3.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Would <i style="">certiorari</i>
and prohibition be the proper remedy to question a denial of a motion to
dismiss?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The present case is akin to that of <u>Vivo v. <span class="SpellE">Clori­bel</span></u>, L-23239, <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1966</st1:date>, which arose out of practically
identical circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There,
respondents alien wife and her two minor children arrived for the first time
here in 1961 as temporary visitors and were allowed by the Secretaries of
Justice and Foreign Af­fairs to stay until <st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="6"><u>June 24, 1963</u></st1:date>, which would also be the tentative
date of oath taking of their husband/father whose naturalization had been
granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Immigration Commissioner
however limited their period of stay up to <st1:date year="1962" day="17" month="10">October 17, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, the Commissioner, thru Circular No. V-101, required them
to leave on <st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="9">September 18, 1962</st1:date>
but the order was temporarily enjoined by Judge <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>
in a prohibition case filed by respondents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="1">January 7, 1964</st1:date>,
the Commissioner moved to dissolve the preliminary injunction on the ground
that respondents’ authorized stay had incontestably expired on <st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="6">June 24, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court denied the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commissio­ner immediately filed petition
for <i style="">certiorari</i> and prohi­bition with
this Court, and there We held:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->That the refusal of the lower court to dissolve
the preliminary injunction even after the terminus of respondents' longest
authorized stay here was against the law and constitutes grave abuse of
discretion and excess of jurisdiction, as held in <u>Vivo v. <span class="SpellE">Arca</span></u>, supra.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span> should have taken note of said
precedent-setting case promulgated even before the motion to dissolve the writ
was filed and denied; </p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->That the naturalization of respondent wife's
husband, even if conceded, would not automatically make her a Filipino who can
not be deported;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">3.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->That respondents' alien children, after the
lapse of their authorized stay could no longer be said to have "lawful
residence" or be dwelling here.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Also, the requirement that they have to be schooled here refers to the
period <u>before</u> their father files the petition for naturalization;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">4.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->That appeal is not the adequate remedy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pending appeal, the aliens would be able to
unduly prolong their illegal stay here in violation of the country's immigra­tion
laws and policies;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">5.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->That a motion to reconsider was unnecessary and
would involve more delay which would further prejudice government interest; and</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->That the prohibition case before the trial court
has become <u>moot</u>, because of the expiration of the alien visitors'
longest authorized stay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
naturalization of their husband/father would not improve their position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the lower court's only jurisdiction would
be to dismiss the main case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case before Us, respondents' authorized stay here
indubitably expired after October 14, 1963 thereby rendering the prohibition
case in the lower court moot and academic; thus Judge, <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>
plainly ignored Our ruling in <u>Viva v. <span class="SpellE">Arca</span></u>, <u>supra</u>,
and, without cause, sanctioned the open and continuing violation of the
country's immigration laws and policies by allowing respondents to unduly
prolong their illegal stay here, all contrary to law and in grave abuse of
discretion; and also in view of the further delay that would ensue in the
proceedings, clearly prejudicial to the interest of the government, appeal
would not be an adequate remedy and a motion for reconsideration could be
dispensed with.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition, being meritorious, is ran­ted;
the assailed orders of September 13, 1962 and the order of July 25, 1965 are
annulled and set aside; and respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>
of the Court of First Instance of Manila or whoever has taken or will take his
place to preside in said court is hereby permanently restrained from further
taking cognizance and assuming jurisdiction over Civil Case No. 51574, except
to dismiss it for having become moot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
costs.</p>
