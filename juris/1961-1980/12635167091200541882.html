National Bank (PNB for short), sued for reinstatement, recovery of back
salaries and damages.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>The Court of First Instance of
Manila, after trial, dismissed the complaint, with costs against her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are now to resolve plaintiffs' appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Concededly, plaintiff Rizalina G. Galsim <span style="">was </span>PNB's paying teller with a monthly salary of P300 until
December 11, 1952 when her dismissal became effective.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case stemmed from facts that follow:</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 11, 1952 between 9:15 and 9:20 in the morning, one
Deogracias Pauco, a receiving teller at PNB's Cage 19, approached his
co-employee, paying teller Rizalina Galsim, inside her Cage 12.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. Galsim thought she heard Pauco borrowing
P10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her answer was that she only had P2
with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon hearing this, Pauco told <span style="">her in </span>Tagalog: "Hindi, P10,
000.00" (No, P10, 000.00).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without
inquiring into Pauco's purpose, Mrs. Galsim took one bundle of P100 bills
amounting to P10, 000 and handed it to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She just presumed that Pauco would use the money for exchange requested
by customers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After ten or fifteen
minutes waiting for Pauco to deliver to her P10, 000 in smaller denominations,
she went to Pauco's cage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did not
find him there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another teller told her
that Pauco might have merely stepped out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mrs. Galsim then checked Pauco's time card at the bundy clock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She discovered to her dismay that he did not
time in on that day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alarmed, she
decided to report the matter to Mr. Syquia, an assistant bank cashier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Syquia, however, was very busy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Mrs. </span>Galsim did not report to Mr. Maramba,
also an assistant cashier, her excuse being that Mr. Syquia would be more
understanding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was not able to talk
to Mr. Syquia until past 11:00 o'clock that morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Informed of the incident, Syquia sent an
employee and a bank guard to the house of Pauco.</p>

<p class="BODY">Shortly after 1:00 o'clock p.m., Mrs. Galsim met Pauco at a
drinking fountain in the bank's premises.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Galsim asked Pauco in Tagalog: "Pau, saan mo dinala?" (Pau,
where did you take it?). Pauco angrily answered: "Bakit, mayroon ba akong
kinuha sa iyo?" <span style="">(Why, </span>did I
take anything from you?).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She then
pleaded tearfully: "Pauco, bakit mo ako ginaganyan?" (Pauco, why are
you doing that to me?).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pauco shot back:
"Bakit, ano ang ginawa ko sa iyo? Bakit gaganyanin kita?" <span style="">(Why, </span>what
have I done to you? Why should I do that to you?).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With that, he turned his back and left.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was thus that Mrs. Galsim incurred a shortage of P10, 000 in
her cash accountability for that day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because of this, PNB Vice-President Juan D. Quintos suspended both
Galsim and Pauco on the same day, December 11.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) was called in.</p>

<p class="BODY">That same afternoon of December 11, PNB Auditor Conrado P.
Sevilla conducted an investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next
day, December 12, he made a report of his findings to the PNB board of
directors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He opined that Mrs. Galsim
was guilty of gross negligence and violation of existing regulations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bases therefor were her delay in reporting
the matter to her superiors and her failure to make Pauco sign a receipt, the
usual supporting Teller's Account Ticket, PNB General Form No. 34-B, required
under existing bank regulations, consider­ing the fact that she did not get in
due time the corresponding cash in small denominations in exchange.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Auditor Sevilla also mentioned that in a
written testimony Pauco denied having received the P10, 000 in P100 bills from
Mrs. Galsim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, Auditor Sevilla
said that there was an exchange teller for the purpose of effecting exchanges
of money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His recommendation: the two
tellers, Galsim and Pauco, be immediately suspended from the service and that
civil and/or criminal action be taken against either or both, as may be
warranted by the NBI findings,</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 1, 1953, the NBI came out with its report of the
investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The NBI noted that Mrs.
Galsim's version was the truth and that Pauco was solely to blame.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The NBI detailed the information coming from
three informants whose identities were not divulged that on the same day, December
11, 1952, Pauco lost the P10, 000 in a rigged-up black lack game in a house at
Governor Forbes Street, Sampaloc, Manila.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The NBI found that Pauco "really did 'borrow' the P10, 000.00"
from Mrs. Galsim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It recommended that
Pauco be separated from the service without prejudice to whatever steps the PNB
may deem proper to take for the recovery of the P10<span style="">, </span>000, and that Mrs.' Galsim be reinstated.</p>

<p class="BODY">A third separate investigation was conducted by PNB
Vice-President Leon Ancheta.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He filed
his memorandum with the PNB board of directors on May 24, 1954.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His conclusions were that Mrs. Galsim
contravened existing regulations and practices in the tellers' division by
delivering to Pauco P10, 000 without requiring the accomplishment and delivery
of PNB General Forms 33-B and 34-B, and that it was not customary for a paying
teller to deliver cash to a receiving teller whose principal function was to
receive deposits from depositors.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ancheta's recommendation was to dismiss, effective as of the date of
suspension, not only Pauco but also <span style="">Mrs. </span>Galsim for the latter's gross
negligence and violation of existing rules which made the loss possible.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then came PNB board of directors' Resolution 668 of June 21,
1954.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The board recognized that Mrs.
Galsim acted in good faith; that the lending of cash by one teller to another
was a prevailing practice sanctioned by the bank; but that Mrs. Galsim's fault
consisted in that she failed to have PNB Forms 33-B and 34-B accomplished as
evidence of the transfer of funds required by standing regulations; that such
failure on her part unquestionably constituted negligence; and that she was not
relieved from liability for the loss of the P10, 000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The PNB board thus dismissed Pauco from the
service and required Mrs. Galsim to resign.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It also directed the PNB Legal Depart­ment to file civil suit to recover
the P10, 000 against Galsim and/or Pauco and their sureties, if any, and to
study the feasibility of filing a criminal action against Pauco. Vice-President
Leon Ancheta wrote Mrs. Galsim on July 1, 1954.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There, he informed Mrs. Galsim of Resolution 668, and requested her to
submit her letter of resignation effective as of the date of her suspension,
without prejudice to any civil action the bank might deem proper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. Galsim did not comply.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 25, 1954, PNB sued Mrs. Galsim and her husband
Benigno C. Galsim to recover the amount of P10, 000.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
On January 12, 1955, judgment was rendered by the Court of First Instance of
Manila exonerating Mrs. Galsim from liability for the loss of the P10, 000 in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>PNB 's appeal to the Court of
Appeals<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
resulted in affirmance on May 26, 1956 of the trial court's decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals' judgment has since
become final.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on April 25, 1955, following a preliminary investigation,
Assistant City Fiscal Arsenio Alcantara of Manila lodged with the Court of
First Instance of that city a criminal information for qualified theft against <span style="">Mrs. </span>Galsim
and Pauco.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
After the Court of Appeals' judgment heretofore mentioned was rendered, Mrs.
Galsim moved in the trial court to have the criminal case against her
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rejected, she lodged a
petition for certiorari, prohibition and mandamus with prelim­inary injunction
in the Court of Appeals.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
On November 28, 1956, the Court of Appeals directed the trial court to dismiss
the criminal case against Mrs. Galsim upon the ground that the matter of the
latter's responsibility for the loss of the P10, 000 was a question finally
passed upon and resolved in her favor; and that, accordingly, the civil case
raised a prejudicial question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant
to this judgment, the trial court dismissed the criminal case on January 8,
1957.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Efforts at reinstatement exerted by plaintiff Rizalina G. Galsim
were futile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the present suit
adverted to at the start of this opinion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Is Rizalina G. Galsim entitled to be reinstated to her posi­tion
as paying teller? Her claim is that her dismissal was unwar­ranted, capricious
and arbitrary.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a PNB employee, Mrs.
Galsim is not subject to the Civil Service Law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her position in the bank cannot be said to be a public office.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Under Section 23 of PNB 's charter, Act 2612 (as amended by Acts 2747 and
2938), the bank's board of directors concededly has the right to choose its
employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, it is not shackled
by civil service limitations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This right
is com­monly referred to as the employer's right to hire and fire.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Said Section 23 reads in part:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 23.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Other</u> <u>officers</u>
<u>and</u> <u>employees</u>, <u>appointment</u> <u>and</u> <u>removal</u> - <u>Salaries</u>
- <u>Non</u>-<u>applicability</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>Civil</u> <u>Service</u>
<u>Law</u>.- All the other officers and employees of the Bank shall be
appointed and removed by the Board of Direc­tors, on recommendation of the
President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said officers and employees
shall not be subject to the Civil Service Law, and their duties and com­pensation
shall be fixed by the President with the approval of the board of directors; x
x x."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Of course, the employer's prerogative to dismiss employ­ees hired
without a definite period may be with or without cause.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
But if the manner in which such right is exercised is abusive, the employer
stands to answer to the dismissed employee for damages.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
An employer may charge an employee with a crime connected with the employee's
duties and dismiss him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been
held, however, that an employee's subsequent acquittal does not automatically
en­title him to reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
dismissal would still be proper if evidence is sufficient to show that the
employee has been guilty of a breach of trust or that the employer has ample
reason to distrust him,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
or that the employee is "guilty of acts inimical to the inte­rests of his
employer and justifying loss of confidence in him."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
An acquittal in a criminal case is not at all inconsistent with loss of
confidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A quote from <u>Philippine</u>
<u>Education</u> <u>Co</u>., <u>Inc</u>. <u>vs</u>. <u>Union</u> <u>of</u> <u>Philippine</u>
<u>Education</u> <u>Employees </u>(<u>NLU</u>), L-13778, April 29, 1960, will
illustrate this point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus -</p>

<blockquote>"The relation of employer and employee, specially where the
employee has access to the employer's property in the form of articles and
merchandise for sale, <u>necessarily</u> <u>involves</u> <u>trust</u> <u>and</u>
<u>confidence</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If said merchandise
are lost and <span style="">said </span>loss <span style="">is reasonably attributed to said employee,
and he is charged with theft, even if he is acquitted of the charge on
reasonable doubt, <u>when</u> <u>the</u> <u>employer</u> <u>has</u> <u>lost</u>
<u>its</u> <u>confidence</u> <u>in</u> <u>him</u>, <u>it</u> <u>would</u> <u>be</u>
<u>highly</u> <u>unfair</u> <u>to</u> <u>require</u> <u>said</u> <u>employer</u>
<u>to</u> <u>continue</u> <u>employing</u> <u>him</u> <u>or</u> <u>to</u> <u>reinstate</u>
<u>him</u>, for in that case, <u>the</u> <u>former</u> <u>might</u> <u>find</u>

<u>keep</u> <u>an</u> <u>eye</u> <u>on</u> <u>him</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present case, Carpio was refused
reinstatement not because of any unfair affiliation or activity or because the
company has been guilty of any unfair labor practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already stated, Carpio was convicted in
the Municipal Court and although he was acquitted on reasonable doubt in the
Court of First Instance, the company <u>had</u> <u>ample</u> <u>reason</u> <u>to</u>
<u>distrust</u> <u>him</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the
circum­stances, we cannot in conscience require the com­pany to reemploy or
reinstate </span>him."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To be stressed then is
that for a dismissal for loss of con­fidence to be warranted, there should
naturally be some basis therefor.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bearing in mind PNB's right to dismiss

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In our approach to this
problem, we are not to be shackled by the final judgment in the </span>civil <span style="">case for recovery arising out of the loss of
P10, </span>000. <span style="">To be emphasized is
that the issue in the civil case filed by PNB against Mrs. Galsim is whether or
not the latter should be made to pay to the bank the amount of P10, 000, not
her reinstatement - which plaintiff Galsim herself concedes was not in issue
therein.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> And, the Court of Appeals, in find­ing that
Mrs. Galsim was not liable for the payment of P10, 000, noted that -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x x x Anyway, the use of PNB Forms Nos. 33-B and 34-B (Exhs.

the taking of the money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We realize that
the use of said PNB forms <u>was</u> <u>most</u> <u>practical</u> <u>to</u> <u>prove</u>
<u>satisfactorily</u> <u>any delivery</u> <u>of</u> <u>money,</u> yet, in the
case at bar it is of no sequence because the result of the investigation of the
National Bureau of Investi­gation convincingly showed, even to the satisfaction
of the Board of Directors of the Bank, that really Deogracias Pauco <u>actually</u>
received P10, 000.00 in a pack of P100 bills from Rizalina G. Galsim, which
money the former lost in a gambling game."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This brings us to a determination of whether or not basis for
loss of confidence exists to justify dismissal of Mrs. Galsim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of interest here is <u>Board</u> <u>of</u> <u>Directors</u>

dismissed without due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We left
open the question of disciplinary action which was not litigated therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court in the Mella case made it
abundantly clear that: "The position of a <u>paying</u> <u>teller</u> does
not involve any confidence <u>apart</u> <u>from</u> <u>the</u> <u>fact</u> <u>that</u>
<u>he</u> <u>handles</u> <u>the</u> <u>bank's</u> <u>funds</u> and deals with
its customers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the loss of
confidence to be a ground of dismissal <u>necessarily</u> <u>is</u> <u>in</u> <u>connection</u>
with the handling of the bank's fund and his dealings with the bank's
customers."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
And, plaintiff Galsim herein - a paying teller - handles the bank's funds and
deals with its cus­tomers.</p>

<p class="BODY">A paying teller in the PNB is entrusted with considerable sums of
money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proof of this is that at the
start of banking business on December 11, 1952, the date of the incident, Mrs.
Galsim had a working amount of P86, 684.43 for which she was accountable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Handling of bank funds is a serious
matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A teller's relationship with the
bank is necessarily one of trust and confidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The teller, as trustee, is expected to
possess a high degree of fidelity to trust.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A cardinal essential in that job is utmost diligence and care in the
handling of cash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A teller cannot afford
to relax vigilance in the performance of his duties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Let us take a look at the facts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That morning of December 11, Pauco approached Mrs. Galsim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She thought he was borrowing money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told him that she only had P2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But then Pauco made it plain to her that he
needed P10, 000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She gave him the P10,
000 without as much as inquiring into Pauco's purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, she said that she <u>presumed</u>
that Pauco would use the money "for exchange as requested by
customers."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
But the NBI found that Pauco "really did 'borrow' the P10, 000.00."</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor can Mrs. Galsim give as reason that that money in P100 bills
was in exchange for smaller denominations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Common sense dictates that <span style="">if </span>such
were the purpose, considering the big amount of money involved, she should have
required from Pauco right then and there to produce the equivalent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But she did not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did not even take the precaution to
immediately follow Pauco to his cage to get back the corresponding amount in
exchange.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failing to receive from Pauco
the money in exchange upon deli­very by her to him of P10, 000, prudence
required of her at least to get some evidence that the money was with
Pauco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not that she was unfamiliar with
what was to be done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bank provided
PNB General Forms 33-B and 34-B precisely to make sure that transfers of money
from teller to teller could properly be traced.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the money was taken almost immediately after the start
of banking hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She knew that a big
sum, P10, 000, was involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She should
have been on guard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Business had just
begun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These facts should have opened
her eyes to make her inquire from Pauco why he needed that much amount of
money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She knew that Pauco was a
receiving teller whose principal function was to receive deposits from bank
depositors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She should have known, too,
that there was at the time an exchange teller in the bank whose duty was to
exchange money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That she did not inquire
from Pauco the why and wherefore of the P10, 000 is a lapse, a costly lapse
indeed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reality, there was no need
for her to turn over such a large sum.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because, in the course of business, Pauco would be receiving deposits
from time to time which he could use for exchange purposes.</p>

<p class="BODY">Her failure to obtain receipt from Pauco has had its harmful
consequences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That gave Pauco a chance
to say, when confronted shortly after delivery of the money, that he had not
gone to the bank except at past 10:00 o'clock in the morning to ask permission
from assistant cashier Maramba not to enter office that day; and <span style="">that he did not receive the said amount of
P10, 000 </span>from Mrs. <span style="">Galsim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It emboldened Pauco to pocket the P10,
000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pauco </span>could not have <span style="">had the temerity of appropriating the money,
carrying </span>it away and <span style="">gambling
with it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason being that Pauco
would have known that had the receipt been signed, there would exist conclusive
evidence against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The loss could
have been averted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Surely, it would be most unfair to compel the bank to continue
employing Mrs. Galsim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reinstatement
