dismiss, by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> in its Civil Case No. 5443, wherein appellant sought
the declaration of the nullity of the order of reconstitution of Land

notice, <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> filed a petition for reconstitution

<p class="BODY">Notice of the hearing of this petition was furnished the

dated <st1:date year="1957" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1957</st1:date>,
the court denied the motion to dismiss, on the one hand, and granted the

<p class="BODY">Appellant moved for the reconsideration of this order, but his
move was frustrated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appellees</span>
filed, on the other hand, a motion on <st1:date year="1958" day="26" month="3">March
 26, 1958</st1:date>, alleging that appellant had abandoned his right to
reimbursement of his expenses for registration and praying that a decree for the
registration of the land in their names be issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Opposition to this motion was registered by
appellant on the ground that the decision in the case had become final 30 days
after <st1:date year="1931" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1931</st1:date>,
and since <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> have slept on their rights, their
cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court overruled this opposition and
on <st1:date year="1958" day="14" month="5">May 14, 1958</st1:date>, issued an
order declaring appellant as having abandoned his right to reimbursement of his
expenses and direct­ing the issuance of the decree of registration of the
parcels of land involved in the name of said <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>,
thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Considering that the judgment rendered in this land
registration case, ordering the registration of the land applied for in the names

abandoned his right to the re­imbursement of his expenses for the registra­tion

ordering the registration of the two par­cels of land in the names of the <span class="SpellE">opposi­tors</span>, <span class="SpellE">Arcadio</span> <span class="SpellE">Narvades</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> <span class="SpellE">Narvades</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">A motion to reconsider the above order
having been denied, appellant herein pursued an appeal from the two (2)
above-quoted orders directly to this Court where the said orders were affirmed
on <st1:date year="1961" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1961</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Later, when <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> moved for the
issuance of the decree of registration and for distribution of the land to them
upon the return of the records of the case from this Court to the land
registration tribunal, appellant filed on January 13, 1962 an opposition to the
issuance of the decree, praying at the same time that the "case be
reopened to enable applicant or his heirs to present evidence" in
accordance with the order of said court dated January 28, 1932 giving him the
right to prove and recover the value of certain im­provements introduced by him
in the land in question.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Not contented with this, on April 14, 1962, appellant filed with the land
registration court a counter-petition, pray­ing for an order declaring null and
void the orders of November 21, 1957 and May 14, 1958 above-quoted, on the
grounds (1) that the land registration tribunal acquired no jurisdiction over
the petition for reconstitution in view of the failure of <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
to comply with the legal requisites for reconstitution under Section 9 of Act
3110; and (2) that the said <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> acted in bad
faith in the reconstitution case, in not apprising the court of the true and
last status of the land registration case when the records thereof were
destroyed by war, by deliberately con­cealing and not producing before the said
court an order of the land registration tribunal dated January 28, 1932,
granting the reopening of the case,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
and to which order, <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> then registered the
necessary "exception dated February 6, 1932.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At the proceedings in Land Registration Case No. 568 were at the
stage as above set forth when the present act­ion came.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under date of <st1:date year="1962" day="11" month="6">11 June 1962</st1:date>, appellant filed the complaint in Civil Case
No. 5443 of the Court of First in­stance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sur</span> which, as stated at the outset of this decision,
was dismissed by the said court on <st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="9">Septem­ber
 13, 1962</st1:date> in the order, now under review, which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"It appearing that the plaintiff, as applicant in Land
Registration Case No. 568 (R-140), filed therein on April 14, 1962, against the
<span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> there, who are the defendants in this
case, a petition in which he seeks to set aside the very same orders he now
seeks to annul and upon the identical grounds alleged by him in this action,
that the petition is still pending resolution by the Land Registration Court,
and that under section 112 of the Land Registration Act all petitions and
motions filed <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> after the original
registration shall be filed and entitled in the original case in which the
decree of registration was entered, for which reason the records of Land
Registration Case No. 568 were reconstituted in that same pro­ceeding and the
orders sought to be annulled were likewise issued therein, the motion to
dismiss is granted and this case is DISMISSED.</blockquote>

this 13th day of September, 1962.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(<span class="SpellE">Sgd</span>.) JOSE L. MOYA</blockquote>

<blockquote>Judge"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appeal from this order of dismissal was immediately taken by
appellant to the Court of Appeals; but said court, in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="2">February 16, 1965</st1:date>, certified the
appeal to this Court upon finding that "there are no issues of fact <u>qua</u>
fact".</p>

<p class="BODY">With particular reference to the proceedings in Civil Case No.
5443, the facts are, as set forth in the said resol­ution, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"This is an action for annulment of an order reconstituting
Land Registration Case 568 in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cama­rines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>. ....</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The complaint filed ..... prayed for a declaration of the
nullity of the order of reconstitution of Land Registration Case 568, the whole
reconstitution proceeding R-140, and the order to issue decree of registration
in Land Reg. Case 568; for a declaration that the records of the said case were
never properly and legally reconstituted; and for damages and costs to be
awarded in favor of the plain­tiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
complaint was premised on the pro­positions (1) that the Land Registration
tribunal acquired no jurisdiction over the petition for reconstitution, in view
of the failure of the defendants to comply with two legal requisites for
reconstitution in such cases; and (2) that the defendants acted in bad faith in
not apprising the court in the reconstitution case of the true and last status
of the registration proceeding.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In response to the complaint, the def­endants filed a motion
to dismiss the com­plaint on the grounds (1) that the complaint states no cause
of action, because the action is expressly prohibited by section 38 of Act 496;
(2) that the action is barred by prior judgment and the plaintiff is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from maintaining the same, because there is an
identity of parties and subject matter between this action, on the one hand,
and the recons­titution proceedings and the proceedings leading to the issuance
of the final decree of registration in which the basic orders were affirmed by
the Supreme Court, on the other; (3) that the court had no jurisdiction over
the subject-matter of the action, as it has no power to set aside final
judgments and orders of the Supreme Court; (4) that the action is barred by the
statute of limitations, as appears from the complaint itself, because an action
or petition for review of a decree of registration can be commenced only within
one year from the date of the entry of the decree; and (5) that there is
another action pending between the same parties and for the same cause, because
earlier the plaintiff as applicant in Land Registration case 568 (R-140) filed
a petition against the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> (def­endants)
seeking to set aside the very same orders of the court he now seeks to annul
and for the same grounds, which petition is still pending resolution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In his opposition to the motion to dis­miss, the plaintiff
contended, among other things, that the present action must take pre­cedence
over his petition in the land registra­tion case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff prayed that the court allow the
parties to enter into trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was
followed by a reply of the defendants, and then a rejoinder of the plaintiff.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Order of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, dated <st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="9">September 13, 1962</st1:date>, dismissed the
case, thus:</blockquote>

petition in which he seeks to set aside the very same orders he now seeks to

<blockquote>"There was only one hearing in the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the minutes covering the hearing
of <st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="9">September 13, 1962</st1:date>, the
case was dismissed without trial.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is apparent that there are no issues of fact <u>qua</u>
fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The five grounds in the def­endants'
motion to dismiss pose legal issues only, which issues were joined upon the
opposi­tion filed by the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
discussions of the parties in these and subsequent pleadings clearly underscore
the strictly legal nature of the controversy now on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Order dismissing the case was undoubtedly
exclusively premised on legal considerations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rather than any question of fact, the sole and central issue in this
appeal is whether or not, under the undisputed facts and circumstances gleaned
from the pleadings, annexes and records, the complaint or case was correctly
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the appeal was erroneously
brought to this Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"ACCORDINGLY, let this appeal be cer­tified, as it is hereby
certified, to the Supreme Court under the Judiciary Act of 1948, as
amended."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Now appellant comes up here with two (2) assigned errors
allegedly committed by the trial court, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"The lower Court erred:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(A) IN DISMISSING THE COMPLAINT ON THE GROUND OF PENDENCY OF
PETITION OF APRIL 14, 1962 PREDICATED ON IDENTICAL GROUNDS AS THOSE ALLEGED IN
THE COMPLAINT, AND IN NOT CONSIDERING THAT THE PRESENT ACTION IS ONE FOR LACK
OF JURISDICTION OF THE RE­CONSTITUTING COURT OVER THE SUBJECT MATTER WHICH MAY
BE RAISED AT ANY TIME AND STAGE OF THE PROCEEDING, EITHER COLLATERALLY OR
DIRECTLY;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(B) IN DISMISSING THE COMPLAINT UPON A MOTION TO DISMISS THAT
BY ITSELF IS A TRAVERSE OF THE MATERIAL FACTS ALLEGED IN THE COMPLAINT."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As can be seen, appellant's first assignment of error presents
the proposition that notwithstanding that the alleged invalidity, for want of
jurisdiction of the Land Registration Court in its case No. 568 to issue the
ques­tioned order of reconstitution due to alleged non-compliance with the
requirements of the Reconstitution Law, Republic Act 3110, has already been
raised in a petition filed in the said land registration case to declare null
and void the said order of reconstitution, the filing of said petition does not
constitute a bar to the present action, which is an ordinary civil action for
no other purpose than to secure exactly the same remedy of having the order of
recons­titution herein involved declared null and void on the identical ground
that the land registration court did not acquire jurisdiction over the matter
since there was allegedly no compliance with the requisites of the Reconstitu­tion
Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And appellant's whole argument in
support of this proposition is stated thus:</p>

<blockquote>"IS THE FILING OF THIS CASE PROPER, AND WHAT IS ITS EFFECT ON
PETITION OF <st1:date year="1962" day="14" month="4">APRIL 14, 1962</st1:date>?
Concise is necessarily appellant's answer to this question:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant had the choice, inasmuch as the
remedy is alternative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any time
before resolution by the <st1:street><st1:address>Land Re­gistration Court</st1:address></st1:street>,
he had the right to, as what he did, withdraw or abandon said petition and file
a complaint with a court of general jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's act in this regard is per­fectly
within legal bounds - not without - he respectfully submits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The minute he filed the complaint, said
petition was deemed to have been withdrawn." (P. 13, Appellant's Brief)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In other words, appellant seems to be proceeding on the theory
that there could be no conflict between the petition he has filed in Land
Registration Case No. 568 and the com­plaint he has also filed in Civil Case
No. 5443, although they involve the same parties, allege identical causes of
action, refer to the same subject matter and pray for the same relief, because
upon the filing of the complaint in the civil action, the petition in the land
registration case must be deemed to have been withdrawn.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
This theory is, of course, plainly erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Were the procedural law on the matter as simple as appellant conceives
it, the whole concept of the defense of <span class="SpellE"><u>litis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendentia</u></span> or <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of
another action would have no reason at all for being.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently, appellant is unaware of the
principle that underlies this defense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, that a party is not allowed to vex another more than once
regarding the same subject matter and for the same cause of action is a
principle founded in part in the public policy that the same matter should not
be subject of controversy in court more than once in order that possible conflicting
judg­ments may be avoided, with consequent stability in the rights and status
of persons. This defense is based on the same principle as that of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>adjudicata</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It differs from the latter only because of
the stage in which it can be invoked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
<span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>adjudicata</u></span>,
there must be a final judgment on the merits, whereas in <span class="SpellE"><u>litis</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>pendentia</u></span>, it is enough that there be another
action pending involving the same parties, subject matter and cause of
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As far as the parties themselves
are con­cerned, the <span class="SpellE">beneficient</span> effects of these
defenses are similar to the benefits that an accused in a criminal case gains
under the principle prohibiting double jeopardy, a sacred constitu­tional right
of accused persons.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant devotes a great deal of his discussion in his brief to
the question of whether or not the Land Regis­tration Court acted properly or
within its jurisdiction in Case No. 568 when it ordered the reconstitution of
the re­cords of said case, but such discussion is off-tangent here for the
simple reason that We are not called upon to rule on that issue in this
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The present appeal is from the
order of the court in Civil Case No. 5443 holding, in effect, that appellant
cannot raise the alleged invalidity of the reconstitution of the records in said
Land Registration Case No. 568 in a petition in said case and then raise it
again, while the said petition is still pending resolution, in an ordinary
civil action instituted for the same purpose, Civil Case No. 5443, which the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> dismissed. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The
only issue We have to decide here is whether or not the trial court erred in
issuing such order of dismissal on the ground of <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of another action.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Of course, appellant also raises as secondary issue that the motion to dismiss
of <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> traverses facts alleged in the
complaint, but We fail to gather from his discussion any point in support of
such contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not being properly
argued, We cannot consider the said alleged error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Section 7, Rule 51)</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Accordingly</span></b>,
We rule that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> did not err in upholding <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' defense of <span class="SpellE"><u>litis</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>pendentia</u></span> and in dismissing appellant's
complaint in Civil Case No. 5443 above-mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's recourse to this Court is
entirely pointless.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

Appellant has not assigned as error the other holding of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> that by its
nature, appellant's remedy can be filed only in the land registration case
pursuant to Section 112, Act 496.</p>

Without trying to prejudge the petition filed in Land Re­gistration Case No.
568 for the annulment of the order of reconstitution, it may not be amiss to
emphasize here that said order was appealed to this Court and it was affirmed.
(See footnote No. 3) In the light of this circumstance, it is, at least,
doubtful if even appellant's contention which is to be resolved in connection
with his said petition in said land registration case, regarding the alleged
irre­gularities in the reconstitution proceedings may still be raised at this
late hour.</p>
