				<H3>DELFIN ALBANO, PETITIONERS, VS. HON. MANUEL ARRANZ, AS JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF ISABELA, BRANCH I, AND SAMUEL REYES, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner Delfin Albano has applied for a writ of prohibition against the 
Honorable Manuel Arranz, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Isabel a, 
Branch I, praying for an order commanding said respondent to permanently desist 
from entertaining or taking any step or proceeding in connection with Case No. 
365 for mandamus, instituted by respondent Samuel F. Reyes against the 
Provincial Board of Canvassers of the Province of Isabela. Upon application and 
filing of the corresponding bond for P2,000, we issued a writ of preliminary 
injunction on December 11, 1961.
<p>For a background, the following facts can be gleaned from the record:</p>
<p>That in the last national elections held on November 14, 1961, petitioner 
Albano was the official candidate of the Nacionalista Party for the office of 
Representative for the lone congressional district of Isabel. His opponent was 
respondent Samuel Reyes, official candidate of the Liberal Party for the same 
position.</p>
<p>During the canvass of November 28, 1961 by the Provincial Board of Canvassers 
of the votes cast at the election, the representative of petitioner Albano 
questioned the returns produced by the Provincial Treasurer for Precincts 1, 4, 
5-A, 8, 8-A, 13, 14, 15 and 16 of Cabagan, Isabela; and for Precincts Nos. 4, 6, 
6-A, and 7 of Reina Mercedes, Isabela, on the ground that the said returns 
appeared with erasures on their face and showed a different number of votes cast 
for the contending candidates for Congressman, as compared with the carbon 
copies that had been furnished the representatives of the Nacionalista Party at 
the aforesaid precincts, pursuant to instructions of the Commission on 
Elections, and that in the copies submitted to the Treasurer, the alteration 
operated to the detriment of petitioner herein.</p>
<p>Discussions and altercations having ensued, with charges and countercharges, 
the canvassing of non-contested returns continued, but the controversy as to 
returns from the precincts heretofore mentioned was reported to the Commission 
on Elections; and the latter, by telegraphic order of December 6, 1961, ordered 
the suspension of the proclamation of the winning candidate until further 
orders. Complying with the order received, the provincial board of canvassers 
suspended the canvass of the votes in the questioned precincts, as well as of 
those cast in Precinct No. 10-A of Santo Tomas, Isabela, the return of which 
had been contested by respondent Reyes. The latter thereupon filed a petition 
for a writ of <i>mandamus</i> in the Court of First Instance of Isabela, Branch 
I, presided over by Judge Manuel Arranz, with the Provincial Board of Canvasers 
as lone respondents, praying that after immediate hearing, the Board of 
Canvassers be directed to forthwith canvass the disputed votes cast in the 
precincts referred to, and proclaim the winner, it being averred that the 
suspension orders of the Commission on Elections were null and void. Acting upon 
the complaint, the respondent Judge, on December 9, 1961, ordered the case set 
for hearing within five days, and on the same day, upon motion of Reyes, issued 
a preliminary injunction ordering the board of Canvassers and the Provincial 
Treasurer to refrain from bringing the questioned returns to Manila, as 
instructed by the Commission on Elections.</p>
<p>We must agree with the petitioner that the actuations of the respondent court 
are highly irregular and void for lack of jurisdiction. The suspension of the 
proclamation of the winning candidate pending an inquiry into irregularities 
brought to the attention of the Commission on Elections was well within its 
administrative jurisdiction, in view of the exclusive authority conferred upon 
it by the Constitution (Art. X), for the administration and enforcement of all 
laws relative to elections. The Commission certainly had the right to inquire 
whether or not discrepancies existed between the various copies of election 
returns for the precincts in question, and suspend the canvass in the meantime, 
so the parties could ask for a recount in case of variance. Moreover, the Court 
below could not properly pass upon the validity of the Commission's orders 
without giving it a hearing, and the Commission had not been impleaded.</p>
<p>Even assuming that the order to suspend the proclamation of the winner was in 
any way defective, the correction thereof did not lie within the authority of 
the statutory Courts of First Instance, since Article X, section 2 (<i>in 
fine</i>) expressly prescribes "that the decisions, orders, and rulings of the 
Commission shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court" and by no other 
tribunal (Luison vs. Garcia, G. R. No. L-10916, May 20, 1957). It is easy to 
realize the chaos that would ensue if the Court of First Instance of each and 
every province were to arrogate unto itself the power to disregard, suspend, or 
contradict any order of the Commission on Elections: that constitutional body 
would be speedily reduced to impotence.</p>
<p>Wherefore, and without prejudice to the right of any proper party to petition 
for a recount of the votes in the precincts involved, the writ of prohibition 
prayed for is granted, and the respondent court is ordered to permanently 
refrain from proceeding in any way with Civil Case No. 365, now pending therein, 
and from taking any action in relation thereto. Costs against respondent Samuel 
F. Reyes.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, Paredes, 
Dizon, </i>and<i> De Leon, JJ., </i>concur.
