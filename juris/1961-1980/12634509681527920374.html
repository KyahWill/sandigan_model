				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">These are two cases separately appealed to the Court of Appeals
and certified to <span class="GramE">Us</span> by said Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since both appeals involve the same parties
and issue, they are deci­ded together herein.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Yau</span> <span class="SpellE">Yue</span>
Commercial Bank Ltd. of <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>, also referred to
hereafter as <span class="SpellE">Yau</span> <span class="SpellE">Yue</span>,
agreed to sell one boat (50 feet, 30 tons) containing used U.S. Military
Surplus to one <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Merchandising Corp. for the sum
of <span style="">$8,820.27 (US), </span>and 42 cases <span style="">(62 </span>sets and 494 pieces) of <span class="SpellE">Hiranos</span> Automatic Cop Change for Cotton <span style="">Loom </span>for Calico to one <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> <span class="SpellE">Teves</span> for the sum of <span style="">$18,246.65 (US), </span>respective­ly.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said agreements were both subject to the following terms and
arrangements: (a) the purchase price should be <span style="">covered by a bank draft for the corresponding amount which should be
paid by the purchaser in exchange for the delivery of the corresponding bill of
lading to be deposited with a local bank, the <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>
&amp; Shanghai Bank of Manila; (b) upon arrival of the articles in Ma­nila the
purchaser would be notified and would have to pay the amount called for in the
corresponding demand draft, after which the bill of lading would be delivered
to said purchaser; and (c) the purchaser would present said bill of lading to
the carrier's agent, American Steamship Agencies, Inc., which would then issue
the corresponding "Permit To Deliver Imported Articles" to be
presented to the Bureau of Customs to obtain the release of the articles.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant thereto, on February <span style="">17, 1961, </span><span class="SpellE">Hirahira</span> &amp; Co., Ltd.
shipped the <span style="">42 </span>cases <span style="">(62 </span>sets and <span style="">494 </span>pieces) of <span class="SpellE">Hiranos</span> Automatic Cop.
Change for Cotton Loom for Ca­lico at Nagoya, aboard the "S.S. CELEBES
MARU", for Ma­nila, with the Kansai Steamship Co., Ltd. of Osaka, Ja­pan,
as carrier, of which the American Steamship Agencies, Inc. is the agent in the
Philippines, under a shipping agreement, Bill of Lading No. NM-1, dated <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="2">February <span style="">17,
 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>consigned
"to order of the shipper"<span class="GramE">,</span> with <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Teves</span> as the party to
be notified of the arrival of said articles.</p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, on June <span style="">3, 1961,
</span>the United States Con­tracting Officer, on behalf of Nippon Trading
Shokai for <span class="SpellE">Nishiman</span> Kaihatsu Co., Ltd. shipped the
boat containing U.S. Military Surplus at Yokohama, Japan, aboard the
"KYOJU MARU", with Sankyo <span class="SpellE">Kiun</span> Kabushiki
Kaisha of Japan as carrier, of which the American Steamship Agencies, Inc. is
the agent in the Philippines, under a shipping agree­ment, Bill of Lading No. <span style="">YM-3, </span>dated <st1:date year="1961" day="3" month="6">June <span style="">3, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>con­signed "to the order of <span class="SpellE">Yau</span> <span class="SpellE">Yue</span> Commercial Bank, Ltd. of <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>", with <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
Merchandising Corporation as the party to be notified of the arrival of said
boat.</p>

<p class="BODY">The bills of lading were indorsed to the order of <span class="SpellE">Yau</span> <span class="SpellE">Yue</span> and delivered to it by
the respective shippers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon receipt
thereof, <span class="SpellE">Yau</span> <span class="SpellE">Yue</span> drew
demand drafts toge­ther with the bills of lading against <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Merchandising Corp., through the <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> &amp; Shanghai Bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">The shipment for <span class="SpellE">Teves</span> arrived in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
on <st1:date year="1961" day="2" month="3">March 2, <span style="">1961</span></st1:date><span style="">; </span>that
of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Merchandising Corp<span class="GramE">.,</span>
arrived on <st1:date year="1961" day="10" month="6">June <span style="">10, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
<span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> &amp; Shanghai Bank notified <span class="SpellE">Teves</span> and the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Merchandising
Corporation, the "noti­fy parties" under the bills of lading, of the
arrival of the goods and requested payment of the demand drafts re­presenting
the purchase prices of the articles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
<span class="SpellE">Da­vao</span> Merchandising Corp. and <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>,
however, did not pay the respective drafts, prompting the bank in both cases <span style="">to make the corresponding protests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bank likewise returned the bills of
lading and demand drafts to <span class="SpellE">Yau</span> <span class="SpellE">Yue</span>
which indorsed both bills of lading to Domingo <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Teves</span> and <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
Merchandising Corporation, however, were able to obtain bank guaranties in
favor of the Ame­rican Steamship Agencies, Inc., as carriers' agent, to the
effect that they would surrender the original and negotiable bills of lading
duly indorsed by <span class="SpellE">Yau</span> <span class="SpellE">Yue</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on the strength of said guaranties, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Merchandising Corp. and <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>
each succeeded in securing a "Permit <span class="GramE">To</span> Deliver
Imported Articles" from the carriers' agent, which they presented to the
Bureau of Customs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In turn the latter
released to them the articles covered by the bills of lading.</p>

<p class="BODY">After being informed by the American Steamship Agen­cies that the
articles covered by the respective bills <span style="">of
lading were already delivered by them to the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
Mer­chandising Corp. and to <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>, Domingo <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> filed claims with the carriers' agent for the cost of
said articles, interests and damages.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The American Steamship Agencies, Inc., however, refused payment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Domingo <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> thereafter filed separate
complaints in the Court of First Instance of Manila against the Ameri­can
Steamship Agencies, Inc., for having allegedly wrong­fully delivered and/or
converted the goods covered by the bills of lading belonging to plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>, to the damage and prejudice of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The suit as to the <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>
shipment was filed on <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="10">October 30,
 1963</st1:date>; that referring to the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
Merchandising Corp.'s shipment was filed on <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, defendant filed motions to dismiss upon the ground
that plaintiff's causes of action have prescribed under the Carriage of Goods by
Sea Act (Com­monwealth Act No. 65), more particularly section 3(6), paragraph
4, which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"In any event, the carrier and the ship shall be discharged
from all liability in res­pect to loss or damage <u>unless suit is brought
within one year</u> after delivery of the goods or the date when the goods
should have been deli­vered."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">It
argued that the cargoes should have been delivered to the person entitled to
the delivery thereof, i.e., plain­tiff, on March 2, 1961 (<span class="SpellE">Teves</span>
shipment) and June 10, 1961 (<span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Merchandising
Corp. shipment), the respective dates of the vessels' arrival in Manila, and </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">even allowing a reasonable time (even one month) after such arrivals
within which to make delivery, still, the ac­tions commenced on October 30,
1963 and November 14, 1963, </span>respectively, were filed beyond the
prescribed period of one year.</p>

<p class="BODY">By order dated <st1:date year="1964" day="21" month="2">February
 21, 1964</st1:date>, copy of which was received by plaintiff on <st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1964</st1:date>, the lower court
presided over by the Hon. Judge Guillermo S. San­tos, dismissed the action (in
re the 42 cases [62 sets and 494 pieces] of <span class="SpellE">Hiranos</span>
Automatic Cop Change for Cot­ton Loom for <span style="">Calico) </span>on the ground of prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His motion for reconsideration dated March
20, 1964 having been denied by the lower court in its order dated June 1964,
plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is now L-25050 and refers to the <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>
shipment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, by order dated January 6, 1964, the lower
court presided over by the Hon. Jesus P. <span class="SpellE">Morfe</span> (in re
the boat<span style=""> [50</span> feet, 30 tons]
containing used U.S. Military Surplus denied the motion to dismiss on the
ground that there being no allegation in the complaint as to the date of
arrival of the cargo or the date on which it should have been delivered, the
defendant was relying on facts which are not yet in evidence such as presuming
that the cargo had arrived on a specific date and that the same had been
delivered on another specific date.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon a motion for reconsideration filed by the de­fendant on <st1:date year="1964" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1964</st1:date> and after the
parties submit­ted their memoranda of authorities and counter-authori­ties,
respectively, the lower court by an order dated <st1:date year="1964" day="20" month="2">Fe­bruary <span style="">20, </span>1964</st1:date>,
reconsidered its prior order of <st1:date year="1964" day="6" month="1">January
 6, 1964</st1:date> and dismissed plaintiff's action also on the ground of
prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this order, defendant
ap­pealed to the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
is now L-25047 and refers to the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Merchandising
Corp. shipment.</p>

<p class="BODY">At issue is a question purely of law, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did plaintiff-appellant's causes of action
prescribe under Section 3(6), paragraph 4 of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act?</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The point has already
been resolved by this Court </span>in a case involving the same parties and
parallel facts to those herein involved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">In <u>Domingo <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> v.
American Steam­ship Agencies, Inc</u>., G.R. No.</span> L-22491, <st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="1">Jan. 27, 1967</st1:date>, <span class="GramE">We</span>
held that the one-year prescriptive period under Section 3(6), paragraph 4 of
the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act does not <span style="">apply
to cases of <span class="SpellE">misdelivery</span> or </span><span style="">conversion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="">For </span><span style="">conve­nience, <span class="GramE">We</span> </span><span style="">quote the ruling therein:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The provision of law involved <span style="">in this </span>case speaks of 'loss or damage'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That there was no damage caused to the goods
which were delivered intact to <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Teves</span> who did not file any notice of damage, is admitted by
both parties in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is to be
resolved - in order to determine the ap­plicability of the prescriptive period
of one year to the case at bar - is whether or not there was 'loss' of the
goods subject matter of the complaint.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Nowhere is 'loss' defined in the Car­riage of Goods by Sea
Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, recourse must be <span style="">had </span>to the Civil Code which provides
in Article 18 thereof that, 'In matters which are governed by the Code of
Commerce and spe­cial laws, their deficiency shall be supplied by the
provisions of this Code.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Article <span style="">1189 </span>of
the Civil Code defines the word 'loss' in cases where conditions have been
imposed with the intention of suspending the efficacy of an obligation to
give.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The con­tract of carriage under
consideration entered into by and between American Steamship Agencies, Inc. and
the <span class="SpellE">Yau</span> <span class="SpellE">Yue</span> (which later on
endorsed the bill of lading covering the shipment to plaintiff herein Domingo <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>), is one involv­ing an obligation to give or to deliver
the goods 'to the order of shipper', that is, upon the presentation and
surrender of the bill of lading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
being so, said article can be ap­plied to the present controversy, more speci­fically
paragraph 2 thereof which provides that,' <span style="">.
. . </span>it is understood that a thing is lost when it perishes, or goes out
of commerce, or disappears in such a way that its existence is unknown or it
cannot be recovered.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As defined in the Civil Code and as ap­plied to Section 3(6),
paragraph <span style="">4 </span>of the Car­riage of
Goods by Sea Act, 'loss' contemplates merely a situation where no delivery at
all was made by the shipper of the goods because the same had perished, gone
out of commerce, or disappeared in such <span style="">a
</span>way that their exis­tence is unknown or they cannot be recovered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not include a situation where there
was indeed delivery - but delivery to the wrong person, or a <span class="SpellE">misdelivery</span>, as alleged in the com­plaint in this <span style="">case.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The point that matters here is that the situation is either
delivery or <span class="SpellE">misdelivery</span>, but not <span class="SpellE">nondelivery</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the goods were ei­ther rightly
delivered or <span class="SpellE">misdelivered</span>, but they were not
lost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being no loss or da­mage to
the goods, the afore-quoted provision of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act
stating that 'In any event, the carrier and the ship <span style="">shall be discharged from all liability <span style="">in </span>res­pect of loss or damage unless suit is brought within one
year after delivery of the goods or the date when the goods should have been
delivered,' does not apply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason
is not difficult to see.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said one-year
period of li­mitation is designed to meet the exigencies of maritime hazards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a case where the goods shipped were
neither lost nor damaged in tran­sit but were, on the contrary, delivered in
port to someone who claimed to be entitled thereto, the situation is different,
and the special need for the short period of limita­tion in cases of loss or
damage caused by ma­ritime perils does not obtain.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It follows that for suits predicated not upon loss or damage
but on alleged <span class="SpellE">misdelivery</span> (or conversion) of the
goods, the applicable rule on prescription is that found in the Ci­vil Code,
namely, either ten years for breach of a written contract or four years for
quasi-­<span class="SpellE">delict</span> (Arts. <span class="GramE">1144 [1],
1146, Civil Code).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The goods covered by the two shipments subject mat­ter of these
appealed cases were also delivered to the notify parties, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
Merchandising Corporation and <span class="SpellE">Her­minio</span> <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>, despite the latter's inability to present the proper
bills of lading and without the knowledge and consent of plaintiff-appellant
Domingo <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> to whom were endorsed said bills of
lading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is therefore like­wise <span class="SpellE">misdelivery</span>, not <span class="SpellE">nondelivery</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, the reci­pients of said goods <span style="">did </span>not file any complaint with de­fendant
regarding any damage to the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">No loss nor</span> damage is therefore involved <span style="">in </span>these cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And thus the prescriptive period under
Section 3(6), paragraph 4 of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act does not
apply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The applicable prescriptive
period is that found in the Ci­vil Code, namely, either ten years for breach of
a writ­ten contract or four years for quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>
(Arts. 1144[1] and 1146).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the
complaints in these appealed cases were filed two years and five months (as to <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Merchan­dising Corp. shipment) and 2 years and 8
months (as to <span class="SpellE">Teves</span> shipment), from the arrival of
the two shipments, it is clear that the causes of action have not yet pres­cribed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the orders appealed from dismissing plain­tiff's
complaints in these two cases on the ground of prescription are hereby reversed
and set aside; let said cases be remanded to the respective court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
for fur­ther proceedings.</p>
