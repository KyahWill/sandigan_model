injunction was instituted to restrain in the carrying out of the order of
demolition issued on <st1:date year="1968" day="24" month="6">24 June 1968</st1:date>
by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, Branch
IV, to enforce the judgment rendered in its Civil Case No. Q-5123.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner is the mother of the defendant in Civil Case No.
Q-5123 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>, Branch IV, en­titled
"People's <span class="SpellE">Homesite</span> &amp; Housing Corporation vs.
Joaquin <span class="SpellE">Decena</span>", for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant therein admitted plaintiff's
ownership of the subject lot (Lot 12, Block E-148, East Avenue Subdivision,
Q.C.), but claimed that he had the right to priority in the purchase of the
same from the government, being a <u>bona fide</u> occupant thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="5">15
 May 1961</st1:date>, the Court of First Instance rendered a decision against
said de­fendant the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which
reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Petition being well-taken, as prayed for, judgment is hereby
rendered ordering the defen­dant and all persons claiming under him to vacate
the premises in question and to remove his house and other constructions <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, restoring the possession thereof to the
plaintiff; to pay the plaintiff the sum of P20.00 a month from the date of
occupation until the possession of the lot in question is restored to
plaintiff, and to pay the costs."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The judgment having become final, plaintiff Philippine <span class="SpellE">Homesite</span> and Housing Corporation (PHHC for short) moved, on
<st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="3">31 March 1963</st1:date>, for the
issuance of a writ of execution, which was granted on <st1:date year="1964" day="13" month="3">13 March 1964</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The writ was served on defendant but was returned unsatisfied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a motion dated <st1:date year="1967" day="2" month="6">2 June 1967</st1:date>, plaintiff moved for the issuance of a
demolition order which was granted on <st1:date year="1967" day="15" month="6">15
 June 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court gave
defendant 10 days from receipt of its said order within which to remove his
house and vacate the land, otherwise the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City
Sheriff and/or his de­puties would demolish the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant failed to comply with the order.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In a verified motion dated <st1:date year="1967" day="15" month="6">15 June 1967</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3a</span></span></a> Marcela <span class="SpellE">Sabulao</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Decena</span>, the
petitioner herein, claiming to be in actual posses­sion of the lot in question
and its improvements, moved to quash the said<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>order of demolition on the ground, among others, that she had never been
sued and/or <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> in the complaint, nor does it
appear that she was a privy to the defendant, Joaquin <span class="SpellE">Decena</span>,
so that any judgment or order entered against her is void and of no effect
whatsoever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its Opposi­tion dated <st1:date year="1967" day="30" month="6">30 June 1967</st1:date>, plaintiff PHHC objected
to the said motion to quash, and the same was denied by the court's order of <st1:date year="1967" day="13" month="7">13 July 1967</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In an unverified motion dated 19 June 1968,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a> plaintiff PHHC again asked for the
issuance of a demolition order, alleging therein that de­fendant's house had
already been demolished early in the day of 20 July 1967, and that possession
had in fact been turned over to the plaintiff; but that in the latter part of
the day petitioner Marcela S. <span class="SpellE">Decena</span>, “either
pretending that her house had not been demolished, or having rebuilt it on the
same lot", obtained several extensions within which to voluntarily vacate
the premises, but which she failed to do.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court found the motion for demolition meritorious and well-taken,
and granted the same on <st1:date year="1968" day="24" month="6">24 June 1968</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a>
Petitioner then filed a Manifestation dated 11 July 1968<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a> averring that the house of de­fendant,
Joaquin <span class="SpellE">Decena</span>, had already been demolished by the
Sheriff pursuant to the original order, but that the house remaining therein
belonged to her, and asking the court to set aside its order of 24 June 1968,
until the final determination of Civil Case No. Q-11316, filed by her as
plaintiff-petitioner against the PHHC and one George Guerrero, <span class="SpellE">awardee</span> of the subject lot, for "Cancellation of Title
with Preliminary Injunction".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an
urgent <u>ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span></u> motion dated 22 July 1968<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span></a>,
petitioner prayed for the issuance of a <u>status quo</u> order, restraining
the sheriff from executing the <u>alias</u> writ of execution until the
resolution of the motion to set aside the same, and the motion for
reconsideration of the order of the court dismissing her petition for
injunction in Civil Case No. Q-11316 was decided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result, the court issued an order, dated
<st1:date year="1968" day="17" month="7">17 July 1968</st1:date>, directing the
Sheriff to hold in abeyance the demolition up to <st1:date year="1968" day="20" month="7">20 July 1968</st1:date> only.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8a</span></span></a> However, the judge left for abroad
before <st1:date year="1968" day="20" month="7">20 July 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, <span class="SpellE">movant</span>
resorted to this Court, allegedly because the PHHC and the Sheriff were
threatening to carry out the demolition order.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is prayed by petitioner now that (a) respondents be ordered by
this Court to desist from executing the judgment in Civil Case No. Q-5123
already adverted to for the reasons that (1) the said decision had become final
on 14 July 1961, and more than 5 years had elapsed from said date when the
demolition order was issued on 24 June 1968; and (2) petitioner was not <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> as a party to the said case; and (b) that
respondents, specifically the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Sheriff, be
immediately enjoined from carrying out the order of demolition of 24 June 1968,
upon petitioner's filing of a bond to be fixed by the court which shall answer
for damages, if any; (c) that the proceedings had in the aforesaid Civil Case
No. Q-5123 be declared null and void; and (d) that respondents be permanently
enjoined from further proceeding therein against petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We issued a restraining order on <st1:date year="1968" day="8" month="8">8 August 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent PHHC answered averring that petitioner herein, Marcela
<span class="SpellE">Sabulao</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Decena</span>, together with her son Joaquin <span class="SpellE">Decena</span>,
occupied the lot in question without the knowledge and consent of the PHHC;
that after the claim of her son had been disapproved and he had been ordered to
vacate, petitioner signified to the PHHC her intention to apply for the same
lot; that petitioner has no valid and lawful claim over the lot in question and
that the land had already been sold by the PHHC to one George Guerrero, on 24
September 1965, and it is now registered<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>in the name of the buyer, under TCT No. 97565.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>PHHC further averred that not being a party
to Civil Case No. Q-5123, PHHC vs. Joaquin <span class="SpellE">Decena</span>,
petitioner had no personality to question the vali­dity of the order of
demolition, and that she had other remedies in the ordinary course of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not deem it appropriate to discuss here the rights of peti­tioner
Marcela <span class="SpellE">Sabulao</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Decena</span> over Lot 12, Block E-148, in question, it appearing
without contradiction that there is a pending action instituted by her against
PHHC and its vendee, George Guerrero, questioning the latter's rights and seeking
cancellation of the title issued in his name (Annex "L", Petition),
and wherein the rights of herein peti­tioner can and should be
adjudicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well to note in this
connec­tion that under the Presidential directive of <st1:date year="1964" day="20" month="2">20 February 1964</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Homesite</span>
Corporation (PHHC) was directed to cancel conditional awards of PHHC lots in
the East Avenue Subdivision (<span class="SpellE">Piñahan</span> Area) "made
in favor of outsiders who are not occupants of the area in question".</p>

<p class="BODY">What clearly appears from the record and is not disputed is that
the decision of the respondent Court of First Instance in Civil Case No. Q-5123
became final on <st1:date year="1961" day="14" month="7">14 July 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More than 5 years (6 years, 11 months and 10
days to be exact) having lapsed since then on the date that the second
demolition order was issued, on 24 June 1968, the order was void, as the court <u>a
quo</u> had ceased to have jurisdiction to execute the dormant judgment upon
mere motion.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">9</span></span></a>
Under the Rules of Court, plaintiff must insti­tute a new action, not for the
purpose of re-examining and retrying issues already decided but for reviving
the judgment.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">10</span></span></a>
Under Article 1144 (3) of the New Civil Code, the action to revive prescribes
in ten years counted from the date said judgment became final,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">11</span></span></a>
which in this case was on 14 July 1961, or from the date of entry of the same.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">12</span></span></a>
However, the ten-year limitation period was interrupted on <st1:date year="1968" day="2" month="8">2 August 1968</st1:date> when the herein petition was filed,
praying, among other things, that this Court restrain respondents from
executing the judgment in Civil Case No. Q-5123<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">13</span></span></a>, and in consequence thereof, a
temporary restraining order was issued by this Court on <st1:date year="1968" day="8" month="8">8 August 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">PHHC's</span> contention that the
questioned order of <st1:date year="1968" day="24" month="6">24 June 1968</st1:date>
is valid and legal because defendant Joaquin <span class="SpellE">Decena</span>,
as well as petitioner herein, waived Section 6, Rule 39, of the New Rules of
Court, is erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been held
that failure to interpose any objection to a writ of execution issued after 5
years from final judgment does not validate the same, for the reason that the
jurisdiction of the courts is solely conferred by law and not by the express or
implied will of the parties.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">14</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>FOR THE FOREGOING REASONS</b>, the writ prayed for is granted
and the demolition order of <st1:date year="1968" day="24" month="6">24 June
 1968</st1:date> is hereby set aside; and the respondents Court of First
Instance and Sheriffs are enjoined from taking further steps toward executing
the judgment rendered in its Civil Case No. Q-5123 until and unless said
judgment is revived in accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp;
