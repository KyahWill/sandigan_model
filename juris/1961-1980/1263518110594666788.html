Court of Appeals in its CA-G. R. No. 25016-R dated July 31, 1965.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
pertinent facts are set forth in said decision </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The whole parcel of land of which the disputed portion forms
an integral part, designated as Lot No. 3092 of the Cadastral Survey of Jaro,
Iloilo and then covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 1766 of the
Register of Deeds of Iloilo, was originally owned in common by <span style="">seven persons, namely: Epifanio Gerochi, Paz
Maquiling, </span><span style="">Jose </span><span style="">Trimones, Antonio Maquiling, Maria Maquiling and Felicidad Jimenea (Exh.
A).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, Paz Maquiling acquired
by means of purchase the one-seventh portion pertaining to Maria Maquiling,
thus making her the owner of 2/7 of the entire property.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Paz Maquiling died on May 11, 1928 leaving three children:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eriberto, Car­men, and Enrique all surnamed
Gunban.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February 28, 1947, Enrique
sold his 1/3 share in the portion owned by his late mother to herein plaintiff,
Angelina Maquiling for the sum of P400.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">How­ever,
</span>this transaction was not regis­tered (Exh. B).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few years later, Angelina Maquiling was
declared insane and her brother, Carlos Maquiling was appointed by the court
guardian of her person and property (Exh. 1).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, Eriberto Gumban, Jr. on July 14, 1950, adjudicated
unto himself the entire participation of his late mother, claiming to be her
only forced heir and, in the same document executed a mortgage over the entire
2/7 portion of the late Paz Maquiling including a house of strong materials
built on it, <span style="">in
</span>favor of Monserrat J. Umadhay for and in consideration of the sum of
P3,000.00 (Exh. 1).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This transaction was
duly re­gistered and annotated on Transfer Cer­tificate of Title No. 1766.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Sheet 3, Exh. A) Upon failure of Eriberto
Gumban Jr. to redeem the portion mortgaged within the time agreed upon for its
redemption, the 2/7 share of the late Paz Maquiling was sold at public
auction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Monserrat J. Umadhay was the
highest bidder at the said auction sale and the property was adjudicated in her
favor (Exh. 4).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This sale was confirmed
by the Court of First Instance of Iloilo on January 9, 1954 (Exh. 5).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both, the. Certificate of Pub­lic Auction and
the Order in favor of Mrs. Umadhay appear at the back of T.C.T. No. 1766 (Sheet
3, Exh. A).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence <span style="">shows that Umadhay paid for the real es­tate
taxes due on the property involved for the period 1952-1953 (Exh. 4-A).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, another Transfer Certificate of Title
No. T-15522 was issued substitu­ting the name of Monserrat J. Umadhay in place
of Paz Maquiling (Exh. 1).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On July 14,
1954, the Umadhay spouses sold the aforementioned property, together with the
house of strong materials built thereon, to defendant Crisanta S. Gumban (Exh.
6) who had a n<span style="">ew </span>Transfer
Certificate of Title No. T-18274 over the said property issued, replacing
Monserrat J. Umadhay's name with hers (Exh. 4).</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Carmen Gumban's share in her mother's property was disposed of as
follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>On May 2, 1946 she sold her 1/3 share to Salvador M. Verroya for
the sum of P325.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Verroya later sold
the same portion to Carlos Maquiling who in turn sold it on September 24, 1948
to Eriberto Gumban, Jr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, Eriberto
Gumban, Jr. now owns two-thirds of his Late mother's 2/7 portion of the pro­perty
owned in common.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dispute we are
asked to resolve refers to the one-third share originally pertaining to Enrique
and which he sold to herein plaintiff who failed to register the sale in the
proper registry.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After due trial, the Court <u>a</u><span style=""> <u>quo</u> </span>rendered judgment for the
plaintiff, the diapositive portion of which reads in part as follows, to wit:</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the trial court;
upheld the validity of the deed of mortgage and subsequent foreclosure sale in
favor of the Umadhay spouses as well as the sale by the latter to Crisanta S.
Gumban; declared all these defendants as purchasers in good faith and for
value; and held that the plaintiff's cause of action was barred by laches.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals erred, although the
latter’s error, which is only partial, can afford no comfort to the
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both viewed the case from a
single perspective and failed to discern the dis­tinction between the position
of the Umadhay spouses and that of Crisanta S. Gumban.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the Umadhays the pivotal fact is that when the
deed of mortgage was executed in their favor the registered owner was still Paz
Maquiling and they relied merely on the affidavit of Eriberto Gumban, Jr. ad­judicating
Paz' entire share to himself, both the affidavit of adjudication and the
mortgage being embodied in the save instrument.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the circumstances the Umadhays could not claim conclusiveness of
what appeared on the face of the certificate of title; it was not in
Eribertot's name and his self-serving declaration that he was Paz Maquiling's
sole heir could not be availed of by them in derogation of the <span style="">share of the other
heir - Enrique Gumban - or of the latter's transferee, the petitioner herein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Mari et al., vs. Bonilla,
et al., 83 Phil. 137, re­solved a similar issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The certificate of title to the property
disputed therein was in the name of the deceased Casimiro Evangelista when his
son, Deogracias, posing as sole heir, adjudicated the property to himself and
sold it to the defendant in the case without first having the title transferred
in his name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Good faith affords protection only to purchasers for value
from the registered owner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Deogracias
Evange­lista, defendant's grantor, was not a registered owner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The land was and still is registered in the
name of Casimiro Evangelista.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In no way
does the certificate state that Deogracias owned the land; consequently defend­ants
cannot summon to their aid the theory of indefeasibility of Torrens Title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the certi­ficate and in
the circumstances of the transaction which warrant them in supposing that they
need not look beyond the title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
anything, it would have put them on their guard, cautioned them to ascertain
and verify that the vendor was the only <span style="">heir
of his father, that there was no debt, and that the latter was the sole owner
of the parcel of land."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">However, while the Umadhay spouses cannot rely on the title, the
same not being in the name of <span style="">their </span>grantor,
respondent Crisanta S. Gumban stands on a different footing altogether.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time the purchased the land the title
thereto was already <span style="">in </span>the name
of her vendors (T.C.T. 15522).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had
the right to rely on what appeared on the face of said title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in t<span style="">h</span>e<span style=""> </span>record to in­dicate
that she knew of any unregistered claims to or equities in the land pertaining
to other persons, such as that of herein petitioner, or of any other
circumstances which should put her on guard and cause her to inquire be­hind
the certificate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the Court
of Appeals, <span style="">"she took all the <span style="">necessary </span>precautions to ascertain the
true ownership of the property, having engaged the services of a lawyer for the
specific purpose and, it was only after <span style="">said
</span>counsel had assured her that everything was in <span style="">order did </span>she make the final arrangements to purchase the
property."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellate court is
conclusion that respondent Crisanta S. Gumban was a purchaser in good faith and
for value is correct, and the title she has thereby acquired is good and <span style="">indefeasible.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Wherefore</b>, modified only insofar as the ruling with
respect to respondent Umadhay spouses is concerned, the decision of the Court
of Appeals reversing that of the trial <span style="">court
is </span>affirmed, and the complaint is dismissed, without <span style="">prejudice </span>to any other relief which,
under the law, may be available to herein petitioner against Eriberto Gumban,
Jr. and/or against respondent Umadbay spouses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Costs in this instance to be recovered by respondent Cri­santa S. Gumban
against <span style="">petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
