				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal by the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
from a decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
in civil case 783 (<span class="SpellE">Jao</span> King <span class="SpellE">Yog</span>,
petitioner vs. Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
Government-<span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>) granting the peti­tion for
naturalization.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner, a Chinese citizen born on March 1, 1923 in Amoy,
China, of Chinese parents, came to the Phi­lippines on September 27, 1936, and
since then has been in continuous residence in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
save for a six-month so­journ in his birthplace with his mother and sisters,
and brief visits in 1956 and 1957 to <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> where
his wife whom he married in 1947 has resided up to the present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="GramE">couple are</span>
childless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He speaks and writes English
and the <span class="SpellE">Cebu-Visayan</span> dialect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has been employed from 1953 in the Sin <span class="SpellE">Hing</span> department store in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
receiving from 1961 to 1963 an annual salary of P3<span class="GramE">,600</span>,
which was increased to P4,800 in 1964, with free board and lodging, plus a
Christmas bonus of P1,200 in 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
paid income taxes for the years 1961, 1962 and 1963.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1960</st1:date>
he officially declared his in­tention to become a Filipino citizen; he filed
the present petition on <st1:date year="1964" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> granted his
petition on <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="1">January 4, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Government's appeal is meritorious.</p>

naturalization "must be of good moral charac­ter * * * and must have
conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner during the entire
period of his re­sidence in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in his relation with the con­stituted government as well as with the community
in which he is living." The testimony of his character witnesses, namely,
Jose B. <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> and Vicente <span class="SpellE">Panique</span>,
that he is law-abiding, an asset to the department store where he works, and a
credit to the community where he lives, falls short of this requirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> became
acquainted with the pe­titioner only in 1951, and, therefore, is not in a
position to attest to the quality of the latter's conduct during his entire
period of residence in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of facts <span class="SpellE">Delfin's</span>
acquaintance with the petitioner is so sketchy that when asked, “Do you know if
he (petitioner) has children with, his wife", he answered, "Yes, sir,
he has a child with her; that is <u>what</u> <u>I</u> <u>heard</u> from
her." The fact is that the <span class="GramE">couple are</span>
childless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And while the other character
witness, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Panique</span>, claims to have known the
petitioner since 1937, their acquaintance is superficial, derived purely from
the witness' business dealings with the department store (where the peti­tioner
is employed) which sells the products of Muller &amp; Phipps, Ltd., of which
firm the witness is an agent.</p>

meet the bare necessities of life, considering the present high cost of living
