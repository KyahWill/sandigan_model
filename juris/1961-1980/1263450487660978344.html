				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal by certiorari to review the de­cision rendered,
on <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="7">July <span style="">8, </span>1963</st1:date>, by the Court of Agra­rian Relations, Second
Regional District, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, in CAR Case No. 2204-NE '60,
relating to an action for a change of tenancy system from crop sharing to
leasehold.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>
- hereinafter referred to as tenant - <span style="">is
</span>a share tenant of the petitioner, Ma­nuel <span class="SpellE">Ibaviosa</span>
- hereinafter referred to <span style="">as </span>landowner
-on a parcel of first class <span class="SpellE">riceland</span> situated in
barrio <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, municipality of <span class="SpellE">Jaen</span>,
province of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>,
with an <span style="">area </span>of 3.75 hectares,
more or less, since the agricultural year 1957-1958, under the sharing arrange<span style="">ment of 50-50, with the tenant contributing
to the product­ion his labor, work animal, farm implements and expenses for
final harrowing, and the landowner his land and ex­penses for
transplanting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The relationship between
the parties </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">not governed by any
registered written tenancy contract.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On or about <st1:date year="1960" day="20" month="2">February 20,
 1960</st1:date>, the tenant sent a letter, by registered mail, to the
landowner, informing the latter of his (tenant's) desire to change their
tenancy relationship from share to leasehold effective with the agricultural
year 1960-1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1960" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1960</st1:date>, the land­owner's son, <span class="SpellE">Constante</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibaviosa</span>, replied to
the tenant's letter of <st1:date year="1960" day="20" month="2">February 20,
 1960</st1:date>, acknowledging receipt of the same and denying the request
contained therein regarding the change of tenancy system.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 20, 1960, the tenant filed a petition before the Court
of Agrarian Relations, Second Regional District, <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span>
City, which was docketed as CAR Case No. 2204-NE '60, praying, among others, that
judgment be rendered ordering the landowner to adopt the leasehold system of
tenancy with the tenant, effective the current agricultural year 1960-1961 and
to fix the legal rental <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> in the amount of 22 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the
case, the harvests for the agricultural years 1960-1961 up to 1962-­1963 were
temporarily liquidated by <span class="GramE">the</span> parties under a sharing
ratio of 70-30 in favor of the tenant, the said tenant having contributed all
the items of production except the land.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due hearing, the respondent agrarian court rendered a
decision on July <span style="">8, </span>1963,
approving the change in the tenancy system between the parties from share to
leasehold effective with the agricultural year 1963-1964 and fixing the rental
of the landholding at 53 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span> and 28 kilos of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> per agricultural year, consisting of the same variety
actually and usually planted on said landholding, payable immediately upon the
threshing of the harvest at the threshing site.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1963</st1:date>,
the landowner filed a motion for reconsideration of the said decision, which
motion was denied by the respondent agra­rian court on <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence the instant appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, the landowner raises <span style="">two </span>issues:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">"I<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>The lower court erred in taking jurisdiction of the instant case in
view of the <span style="">fact </span>that the
petition had been filed with­out the period required by law.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>The lower court erred in not finding Section 14 of Republic Act No.
1199 uncon­stitutional."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In support of the first
assignment of error, the landowner contends that the respondent agrarian court
did not acquire jurisdiction over the case because the notice for a change of
tenancy relationship supposedly sent by the tenant to him (landowner) was never
received by him and that he had never authorized his son <span class="SpellE">Constante</span>
<span class="SpellE">Iba­viosa</span> to reply to the letter of the tenant; that
it was not shown that <span class="SpellE">Constante</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibaviosa</span>
was acting as agent of his father (the landowner); and finally that the
tenant's petition asking for a change in tenancy relationship be­ginning with
the agricultural year 1960-1961 was not filed on time since the </span><span style="">same was only filed in </span><span style="">court on October 20, 1960 when it should have
been filed at least before May 1, 1960, considering that the agricultural year
began in the month of June </span><span style="">or </span><span style="">July, 1960, at the latest, and further,
because the law (Section 14 of Republic Act No. 1199), requires at least one
month before the agricultural year when the change shall be effected.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The landowner's
contentions are without any merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside
from the fact that the reasons advanced by the land­owner relate to questions
of fact which this Court will not now review, We find that the evidence on
record sup­ports the finding of the respondent agrarian court that the denial
of the landowner regarding the receipt of the tenant's letter of notification
does not </span><span style="">deserve </span><span style="">any cre­dence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that the </span><span style="">landowner, himself, </span><span style="">"admitted on the witness stand that his
son, <span class="SpellE">Constante</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibaviosa</span>,
had acted as his representative in dealing with the tenants,"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> including tenant <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
land­owner's admission, alone, is more than sufficient reason for the
respondent agrarian court to reject the landowner's denial of receipt of
respondent's letter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, as it </span><span style="">appears in the record, the landowner's son, <span class="SpellE">Constante</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibaviosa</span>, did not only
receive the tenant's letter of notification, but also, acting within his
authority as his father's representative with the tenants, sent a reply to
tenant <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> acknowledging receipt of the lat­ter's
letter of notification and at the same time denying the request contained
therein regarding the change of tenancy system.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, the conclusion reached by the respondent agrarian court
regarding the timeliness and validity of the tenant's exercise of his right to
change tenancy sys­tem between him and the landowner being a question of <span style="">fact should not be disturbed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">noteworthy that in
the decision of the respondent Court of Agrarian Rela­tions, the change in the
tenancy system was made effect­ive only beginning with the agricultural year
1963-1964, because as far as the harvests for the agricultural years 1960-1961
to 1962-1963 temporary liquidations were made on the 70-30 sharing basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The requirement of the law regarding notice
by the tenant to the landowner regard­ing the change of tenancy system had,
therefore, been duly complied with.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the issue regarding the constitu­tionality of
Section 14 of Republic 1199, <span class="GramE">We</span> do not consider it
necessary to dwell on this subject any more because this Court, in a long line
of decisions, has al­ready declared said section constitutional.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, </span>the decision appealed from should
