				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Original action for <i style="">mandamus</i>
to compel respondent, Hon. <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> B. Flores, as Judge
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, to issue a writ of
execution of his decision in Civil Case No. 4117 of said court, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Donato</span> Mata vs. Petra <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> de
Mariano and Julian Mariano."</p>

<p class="BODY">In said case, Mata sought to establish his alleged title to five
(5) parcels of land, located in barrio No. 32, <span class="SpellE">Caluguan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Batac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, and
more particularly described in the complaint therein, which were allegedly held
by the <span class="SpellE">Marianos</span> to guarantee a debt of P350, and to
recover the possession of said land, upon payment of the aforementioned sum to
them, as well as to secure an accounting of the products of said property, in
addition to attorney's fees and the costs. </p>

<p class="BODY">Although summoned in that case, on <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1965</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Marianos</span>
did not mail their answer therein - which was re­ceived by the Clerk of Court
and filed on <st1:date year="1965" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1965</st1:date>
- until <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1965</st1:date>,
or one day after the expiration of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
On motion of Mata, the <span class="SpellE">Marianos</span> were, accordingly,
declared in default, on <st1:date year="1965" day="18" month="11">November 18,
 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, Mata
introduced his evidence before a deputy clerk of Court, and, on <st1:date year="1966" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1966</st1:date>, the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, presided over by respondent
Judge, Hon. <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> B. Flores, rendered a decision
ordering the <span class="SpellE">Marianos</span> to return the land in question
to Mata, upon payment of P350 to them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Copy of this decision was, on <st1:date year="1966" day="27" month="1">January
 27, 1966</st1:date>, served upon the <span class="SpellE">Marianos</span>, who,
eight (8) days later, or on <st1:date year="1966" day="4" month="2">February 4,
 1966</st1:date>, moved for a reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mata filed, on <st1:date year="1966" day="19" month="2">February 19,
 1966</st1:date>, an opposition to said motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="22" month="2">February
 22, 1966</st1:date>, the court issued an order, copy of which was received by
the <span class="SpellE">Marianos</span>, on <st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1966</st1:date>, reading: "The motion for
reconsideration is hereby denied." On <st1:date year="1966" day="24" month="3">March 24, 1966</st1:date>, Mata filed an <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> motion for the issuance of a writ of
execution, upon the ground that said decision had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead
of granting the motion, Judge Flores issued, on the same date, an order of the
following tenor:</p>

<blockquote>"To make the records straight, it is the ‘<u>opposition</u> to
the defendants' motion for reconsideration' which was not considered by the
court or <u>denied</u> by the court. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> "<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The order further stated that Mata's counsel, "Atty. Santos
must answer the motion for reconsideration within ten (10) days from to-day,
otherwise the answer of the defendants, filed on <st1:date year="1965" day="15" month="11">No­vember 15, 1965</st1:date>, will be admitted by the court. "
Instead of filing said answer, on <st1:date year="1966" day="29" month="3">March
 29, 1966</st1:date>, Mata reiterated his petition for a writ of execution,
which respondent Judge denied, on <st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="3">March
 30, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, on <st1:date year="1966" day="12" month="5">May 12, 1966</st1:date>, Mata commenced the
present action for <i style="">mandamus</i>, against
respondent Judge and the <span class="SpellE">Marianos</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case hinges on whether or not the decision in said Civil
Case No. 4117 is already final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not con­tested that notice of said
decision was, on January 27, 1966, served on the <span class="SpellE">Marianos</span>;
that their motion for reconsideration was filed eight (8) days later, or on
February 4, 1966, so that, only twenty-two (22) of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period of thirty (30) days<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
to interpose an appeal were left; that notice of the order of February 22,
1966, ostensibly denying said motion for reconsideration, was re­ceived by the <span class="SpellE">Marianos</span> on February 25, 1966; and that beginning from
February 26, 1966, said period of twenty-two (22) days ex­pired on March 19,
1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, the aforementioned
decision would have been final since <st1:date year="1966" day="20" month="3">March
 20, 1966</st1:date>, and it would be the ministerial duty of respondent Judge
to grant Mata's motion for execution of <st1:date year="1966" day="24" month="3">March
 24, 1966</st1:date>, if the motion for reconsideration of the <span class="SpellE">Marianos</span> had really been denied by the order of <st1:date year="1966" day="22" month="2">February 22, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The order of <st1:date year="1966" day="24" month="3">March 24,
 1966</st1:date> indicates, however, that what respondent Judge intended to
deny, with his previous order, of <st1:date year="1966" day="22" month="2">February
 22, 1966</st1:date>, was <u>not</u> said <u>motion</u> for reconsideration of
the <span class="SpellE">Marianos</span>, but the <u>opposition</u> thereto,
filed by Mata on <st1:date year="1966" day="19" month="2">February 19, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, instead of acting upon Mata's "<u>ex</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> motion for the issuance of a writ of
execution," dated March 24, 1966, respondent Judge deemed it fit to set
"the records straight" and require Mata's counsel to answer said
motion for reconsideration within ten (10) days, with the admonition that
"otherwise the answer of the defendants x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> will be admitted by the Court."</p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with said order of March 24, 1966, two (2)
questions must be met, namely: (1) whether full faith and credence shall be
given to said order; and (2) if the answer to this question is in the affirmative,
whether the order may be given full force and effect, despite the fact that it
was issued over twenty-two (22) days after service to the <span class="SpellE">Marianos</span>
of notice of the order of February 22, 1966, ostensibly denying their motion
for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon a careful review of the record, we have no doubt that the
first question must be resolved in the affirmative, for: (1) the answer of the <span class="SpellE">Marianos</span> was filed only one (1) day late; and (2) said
answer and their motion for reconsideration satisfactorily show, not only that
the late filing of said answer was due to excusable negligence, but, also, that
the decision would probably be other than that rendered on January 22, 1966, if
the order of default were lifted and they had an opportunity to prove the allegations
of said answer, and that, in all likelihood, a grave injustice would, other­wise,
be committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the first ground, it should be noted that the
order of default was predicated upon Mata's allegation to the effect that the <span class="SpellE">Marianos</span> had been summoned on <st1:date year="1965" day="26" month="10">October 26, 1965</st1:date>, and that their answer, mailed on <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1965</st1:date>, was, therefore,
two (2) days late.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, however, the
summons took place on <st1:date year="1966" day="27" month="10">October 27,
 1966</st1:date>, so that the answer was late for one (1) day only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This late filing for one (1) day was,
moreover, due to the circumstance that the <span class="SpellE">Marianos</span>
had overlooked the fact that the month of October consists, not of 30 days, but
of 31 days.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the second ground, it appears that the complaint
herein is mainly for the recovery of five (5) lots al­legedly belonging to Mata
and said to have been mortgaged by him "before the Second World War,"
for the sum of P350, to <span class="SpellE">Joventino</span> <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>,
father of defendant Petra <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> Mariano; that <span class="SpellE">Joventino</span> <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> died sometime
after said War; that "some­time in the year 1945, before the arrival of
the American Forces of liberation," Mata expressed to <span class="SpellE">Joventino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> his (Mata’s) intention to redeem the land;
that <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> refused to allow the re­demption upon the
ground that he wanted to be paid in Philippine Money, which Mata did not have;
that in 1950, after the death of <span class="SpellE">Joventino</span> <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>, Mata sought to redeem the land from the <span class="SpellE">Marianos</span>, who were then in possession thereof; that the <span class="SpellE">Marianos</span> asked Mata to defer the redemption, to which Mata
agreed; and that, when Mata tried to redeem the property in 1958, the <span class="SpellE">Marianos</span> contested his right to do so, alleging that they
are the owners there­of.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their answer to the complaint, the <span class="SpellE">Marianos</span>,
in turn, alleged that they do not know and are not in possession of the se­cond
parcel of land described in the complaint; that the other four (4) parcels
therein described were, however, sold by Mata, way back in 1923, to <span class="SpellE">Joventino</span> <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>, pursuant to a
deed of ab­solute sale now in the possession of the <span class="SpellE">Marianos</span>;
that, upon the death of <span class="SpellE">Joventino</span> <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>,
said four (4) parcels of land were left with his only daughter, Petra <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> de Mariano, who became the absolute owner thereof by
succession; and that Mata had never tried to redeem said land, which has been
in actual possession of <span class="SpellE">Joventino</span> <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>
and the <span class="SpellE">Marianos</span>, as owners thereof, conti­nuously,
for 41 years since 1923.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision of the lower court, based upon the evidence
introduced <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> by Mata, before the
deputy Clerk of Court, on <st1:date year="1965" day="26" month="11">November
 26, 1965</st1:date>, states that the transaction between Mata and <span class="SpellE">Joventino</span> <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> <u>had not been
incorporated into a written con­tract</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Attached to the motion for reconsideration of the <span class="SpellE">Marianos</span>
is, however, an affidavit of Petra <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> Mariano
which states in part:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
that the truth is that sometime on <u>June 29, 1923</u>, the plaintiff, <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> Mata, executed a Deed of Sale covering these parcels
of lands in favor of my late father, <span class="SpellE">Joventino</span> <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>, which document was drawn <u>before the late Justice
of the Peace Felix R. <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span> of <span class="SpellE">Batac</span></u>,
<span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, and entered in his <span class="SpellE"><u>Notarial</u></span><u>
Register as Reg. No. No. 40; <span class="SpellE">Pag</span>. 96, S. of 1923</u>;
and that this do­cument was <u>Registered in the office of the Re­gister of
Deeds</u> of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, under <u>Inscription No.
5237</u>; <u>Page 215</u>; <u>Vol. XIV; File No. 5237</u>, <span class="SpellE"><u>Laoag</u></span><u>,
I. N., March 30, 1948</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>(this doc.
will be presented to the Court during the hearing);”<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The details given in this affidavit are such as to cause upon the
reader the impression, if not the conviction, that the allega­tions in the
answer and the motion for reconsideration of the <span class="SpellE">Marianos</span>
are probably true and that a serious danger of committing a grave injustice
would exist if they were denied an opportunity, at least, to introduce evidence
on their behalf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, if the claim of
Mata were true, he would still win eventually, with the particu­larity that
such damages as he may suffer in consequence of the resulting delay could be
somewhat compensated with the obligation for which the land in question is
allegedly mortgaged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other
hand, if Mata had really executed, in favor of <span class="SpellE">Joventino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cor­puz</span>, a deed of absolute sale of said land, way
back on June 29, 1923, or over 42 years prior to the institution of Civil Case
No. 4117 on October 16, 1965, the possession of <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>
and the <span class="SpellE">Marianos</span> for that period of time - which
possession was, seemingly open, public and continuous - must have been adverse
to the whole world, so that they would have acquired title to the land in
question by sale as well as by prescription, and a grave injustice would thus
be caused to them, if said reconsideration were denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was only logical and natural for respondent Judge to conclude,
upon reading said motion for reconsideration, and par­ticularly the
aforementioned affidavit of Petra <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>, as well as
the answer, dated November 12, 1965, that the court had no other course open
thereto except to give the <span class="SpellE">Marianos</span> a chance to prove
their contention.</p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, the only plausible explanation for the order of <st1:date month="2" day="22" year="1966">February 22, 1966</st1:date> – consistently with
the ordinary course of events - is that given in the order of <st1:date month="3" day="24" year="1966">March 24, 1966</st1:date>, namely: that said
order of February 22 was meant to deny, not said motion for reconsideration,
but Mata's opposition thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next question for determination is: considering that, from
February 25, 1966, when the <span class="SpellE">Marianos</span> were notified of
the erroneous order of February 22, 1966, the twenty-two (22) days that they
had to appeal from the decision expired on March 19, 1966, did respondent Judge
have, on March 24, 1966, the power to rectify said order of February 22, 1966,
in order to set "the records straight"?</p>

<p class="BODY">It is our considered view that he did have such power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, pursuant to Rule 135, Section 5, of
the Rules of Court:</p>

<blockquote>"Every court shall have power:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
x <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
<span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(g) To <u>amend</u> and control its process and orders so as to
make them <span class="SpellE">comformable</span> to law and justice;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(h) To x <span class="SpellE">x</span> restore, and supply
deficiencies in its records and proceedings."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The lapse of more than twenty-two (22) days since <st1:date month="2" day="25" year="1966">Feb­ruary 25, 1966</st1:date>, would have barred
the authority of respondent Judge to avail of the foregoing inherent power, if
the motion for reconsideration of the <span class="SpellE">Marianos</span> had <u>really</u>
been denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, such is not a fact,
for the denial of the motion in said order was apparently the product of a
misunderstanding by the stenographer who typed or transcribed the order of
respondent Judge, who, pressed by the volume of his work, must have signed the
order, either without reading it, assuming that his instructions had been
carried out, or in the belief that it referred to another case.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, "when a judgment or order is entered x <span class="SpellE">x</span> against a party in a Court of First Instance through
fraud, acci­dent, mistake, or excusable negligence" <u>of such party</u>,
he may file a petition to set aside said judgment or order, "within sixty
(60) days after the petitioner learns of the judgment, order, or other
proceeding to be set aside, and not more than six (6) months after such
judgment or order was entered x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
accom­panied with affidavits showing the fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable
negligence relied upon, and the facts constituting the petitioner's good and
substantial x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
defense."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, an affidavit showing such facts has been
filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The action taken by respondent Judge
took place within said periods of sixty (60) days and six (6) months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a relief against the mistake or excusable
negligence <u>of a party</u> may be granted by a Judge, it is obvious that he
has, not only the author­ity, but, also, the <u>duty</u> to afford such relief,
when the mistake or excusable negligence are <u>his own</u>.</p>
