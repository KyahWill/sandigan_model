				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Resurreccion de Leon, et al. filed on November 13, 1958 before the Court of 
First Instance of Rizal a complaint seeking to compel Emiliana Molo-Peckson, et 
al. to convey to the former ten parcels of land located in Pasay City with an 
area of 1,749 sq. m. upon payment of P1.00 per parcel upon the plea that said 
lots were willed or donated in 1948 to the latter by their foster parents 
Mariano Molo y Legaspi and Juana Juan with the understanding that they should 
sell them to the plaintiff under the terms above-stated.
<p>Defendants, in their answer, disclaimed any legal obligation on their part to 
sell the above properties to the plaintiffs for the nominal consideration of 
P1.00 per lot alleging that if they executed the document on which the complaint 
is predicated it was on the mistaken assumption that their foster parents had 
requested them that they donate the properties to plaintiffs for which reason 
they executed on August 9, 1956 a document revoking said donation which was 
acknowledged before Notary Public Leoncio C. Jimenez. </p>
<p>No testimonial evidence was presented by either party. Instead, both agreed 
to submit the case upon the presentation of their respective exhibits which were 
all admitted by the trial court.</p>
<p>After trial on the merits, the court <i>a quo</i> rendered on September 21, 
1960 a decision wherein it held that, under the facts established by the 
evidence, trust has been constituted by the late spouses Mariano Molo and Juana 
Juan over the ten parcels of land in question in favor of plaintiffs as 
beneficiaries and, as a consequence, concluded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Considering all the foregoing, the Court orders: </p>
<p>"1. The defendants, jointly and severally to free the said ten (10) parcels 
of land from the mortgage lien in favor of the Rehabilitation Finance 
Corporation (now Development Bank of the Philippines) and Claro Cortez, and 
thereafter to sign and execute in favor of the plaintiffs a deed of absolute 
sale of the said properties for and in consideration of TEN (P10.00) PESOS 
already deposited in Court after all conditions imposed in Exhibit A have bean 
complied with;</p>
<p>"2. That in the event the defendants shall refuse to execute and perform the 
above, they are ordered, jointly and severally, to pay the plaintiffs the value 
of said ten (10) parcels of land m question, the amount to be assessed by the 
City of Pasay City as the fair market value of the same, upon orders of the 
Court to assess said value;</p>
<p>"3. The defendants jointly and severally to pay the plaintiffs' Attorney's 
fees in the amount of P3,000.00, as defendants acted in gross and evident bad 
faith in refusing to satisfy the plaintiffs' plainly valid, just and demandable 
claim, under Article 2208 subparagraph 5 of the New Civil Code;</p>
<p>"4. The defendants to render an accounting of the fruits of said ten (10) 
parcels of land from the time plaintiffs demanded the conveyance of said parcels 
of land on August 11, 1956 as per Exhibits B and C, in accordance with the 
provisions of Article 1164, New Civil Code which provides that the creditor has 
a right to the fruit of the thing from the time the obligation to deliver it 
arises; and</p>
<p>"5. The defendants to pay the costs."</p></blockquote>
<p>Defendants took the present appeal.</p>
<p>On January 24, 1941, Mariano Molo y Legaspi died leaving a Will wherein he 
bequeathed his entire estate to his wife, Juana Juan. This will was probated in 
the Court of First Instance of Pasay City, Rizal, which was affirmed by the 
Supreme Court on November 26, 1956 (G.R. No. L-8774, 100 Phil., 344; 53 Off. 
Gaz., No. 3, p. 658) On May 11, 1948, Juana Juan in turn executed a will naming 
therein many devisees and legatees, one of whom is Guillerma San Rafael, mother 
of the plaintiffs and defendant Pilar Perez Nable. On June 7, 1948, however, 
Juana Juan executed a donation <i>inter vivos</i> in favor of Emiliana 
Molo-Peckson and Pilar Perez Nable of almost all of her entire property leaving 
only about P16,000.00 worth of property for the devisees mentioned in the wall 
Among the properties conveyed to the donees are the ten parcels of land subject 
of the present action. Juana Juan died on May 28, 1950.</p>
<p>On December 5, 1950, Emiliana Molo-Peckson and Pilar Perez Nable executed a 
document which they called "Mutual Agreement" the pertinent provisions of which 
are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That the above named parties hereby mutually agree by these presents * * * 
that the following lots should be sold at onb (1) peso each to the following 
persons and organization:</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
<p>"To—Justa de Leon and Resurreccion de Leon, several parcels of land located 
at Calle Tolentino (South of Tenorio and Kapitan Magtibay), Pasay City, share 
and share alike or half and half of ten (10) lots described in:</p>
<p>"Transfer Certificate of Title No. 28157—and allocated as follows:</p>
<p>"(a) To Justa de Leon, Five (5) Lots.</p>
<p>"(b) To Resurreccion de Leon, the remaining Five (5) Lots.</p>
<p>"That this agreement is made in conformity with the verbal wish of the late 
Don Mariano Molo y Legaspi and the late Doña Juana Francisco Juan y Molo. These 
obligations were repeatedly told to Emiliana Molo Peckson, before their death 
and that same should be fulfilled after their death."</p></blockquote>
<p>On August 9, 1956, however, the same defendants, assisted by their husbands, 
executed another document in which they revoked the so-called mutual agreement 
mentioned above, and another relating to the same subject matter, stating 
therein that the parties, "after matured and thorough study, realized that the 
above-mentioned public instruments * * * do not represent their true and correct 
interpretations of the verbal wishes of the late spouses Don Mariano Molo y 
Legaspi and Doña Juana Francisco Juan y Molo." But after the execution of this 
document, that is, on August 11, 1956, the beneficiaries Resurreccion de Leon 
and Justa de Leon, thru their counsel, demanded the conveyance to them of the 
ten parcels of land for the consideration of P1.00 per parcel as stated in the 
document of December 5, 1950. And having the defendants refused to do so, said 
beneficiaries consigned on July 8, 1957 the amount of P10.00 as the 
consideration of the ten parcels of land.</p>
<p>In this appeal, appellants assigns the following errors:</p>

<p align="center">VIII</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN NOT DIMISSING THE COMPLAINT."</p></blockquote>
<p>There is no merit in the claim that the document executed on December 5, 1950 
does not represent the true and correct interpretation by appellants of the 
verbal wish of their foster parents relative to the conveyance for a nominal 
consideration to appellees of the ten parcels of land in question considering 
the circumstances obtaining in the present case. To begin with, this document 
was executed by appellants on December 5, 1950, or about two years and six 
months from the time they acquired title to the lands by virtue of the donation 
<i>inter vivos</i> executed in their favor by their foster mother Juana Juan and 
six months after the death of the donor. There is nobody who could cajole them 
to execute it, nor is there any force that could coerce them to make the 
declaration therein expressed, except the constraining mandate of their 
conscience to comply with "the obligations repeatedly told to Emiliana Molo 
Peckson," one of appellants, before their death, epitomized in the "verbal wish 
of the late Don Mariano Molo y Legaspi and the late Doña Juana Francisco Juan y 
Molo" to convey after their death said ten parcels of land at P1.00 a parcel to 
appellees. In fact, the acknowledgment appended to the document they subscribed 
states that it was "their own free act and voluntary deed."</p>
<p>Indeed, it is to be supposed that appellants understood and comprehended the 
legal import of said document when they executed it more so when both of them 
had studied in reputable centers of learning, one being a pharmacist and the 
other a member of the bar. Moreover, they have more than ample time—the six 
months intervening between the death of the donor and the execution of the 
document—to ponder not only on the importance of the wish of their 
predecessors-in-interest but also on the propriety of putting in writing the 
mandate they have received. It is, therefore, reasonable to presume that that 
document represents the real wish of appellants' predecessors-in-interest and 
that the only thing to be determined is its real import and legal 
implications.</p>
<p>That the document represents a recognition of pre-existing trust or a 
declaration of an express trust impressed on the ten parcels of land in question 
is evident. A declaration of trust has been defined as an act by which a person 
acknowledges that the property, title to which he holds, is held by him for the 
use of another (Griffith vs. Maxfield, 51 S.W. 832, 66 Ark. 513, 521). This is 
precisely the nature of the will of the donor: to convey the titles of the land 
to appellants with the duty to hold them in trust for the appellees. Appellants 
obligingly complied with this duty by executing the document under 
consideration.</p>
<p>True it is that to establish a trust the proof must be clear, satisfactory 
and convincing. It cannot rest on vague, uncertain evidence, or on a loose, 
equivocal or indefinite declaration (In re Tuttle's Estate, 200 A. 921, 132 Pa. 
Super 356); but here the document in question clearly and unequivocally declares 
the existence of the trust even if the same was executed subsequent to the death 
of the trustor, Juana Juan, for it has been held that the right creating or 
declaring a trust need not be contemporaneous or inter-parties (Stephenson vs. 
Stephenson, 171 S.W. 2d 265, 351 Mo. 8; In re Corbin's Trust Orph., 57 York Leg. 
Rec. 201). It was even held that an express trust may be declared by a writing 
made after the legal estate has been vested in the trustee (Kurtz vs. Robinson, 
Tex. Civ. App. 256 S.W. 2d 1003). The contention, therefore, of appellants that 
the will and the donation executed by their predecessors-in-interest were 
absolute for it did not contain a hint that the lots in question will be held in 
trust by them does not merit weight because the fact that an express trust was 
created by a deed which was absolute on its face may be shown by a writing 
separate from the deed itself (Mugan vs. Wheeler, 145 S.W. 462, 241 Mo. 
376).</p>
<p>The fact that the beneficiaries were not notified of the existence of the 
trust or that the latter have not been given an opportunity to accept it, is of 
no importance, for it is not essential to the existence of a valid trust and to 
the right of the beneficiaries to enforce the same that they had knowledge 
thereof at the time of its creation (Steohr vs. Miller, 296 F. 414). Neither is 
it necessary that the beneficiary should consent to the creation of the trust 
(Wickwire-Spencer Steel Corporation vs. United Spring Mfg. Co., 142 N.E. 758, 
247 Mass. 565). In fact, it has been held that in case of a voluntary trust the 
assent of the beneficiary is not necessary to render it valid because as a 
general rule acceptance by the beneficiary is presumed (Article 1446, new Civil 
Code; Cristobal vs. Gomez, 50 Phil., 810).</p>
<p>It is true, as appellants contend, that the alleged declaration of trust was 
revoked, and having been revoked it cannot be accepted, but the attempted 
revocation did not have any legal effect. The rule is that in the absence of any 
reservation of the power to revoke a voluntary trust is irrevocable without the 
consent of the beneficiary (Allen vs. Safe Deposit and Trust Co. of Baltimore, 7 
A. 2d 180, 177 Md. 26). It cannot be revoked by the creator alone, nor by the 
trustee (Fricke vs. Weber, C.C.A. Ohio, 145 F. 2d 737; Hughes vs. C.I.R. C.C.A. 
9, 104 F. 2d 144; Ewing vs. Shannahan, 20 S.W. 1065, 113 Mo. 188). Here there is 
no such reservation.</p>
<p>Appellants contend that the lower court erred in applying the provisions of 
the new Civil Code on trust. This is correct. The express trust was constituted 
during the lifetime of the predecessor-in-interest of appellants, that is, 
before the effectivity of the new Civil Code, although the instrument 
recognizing and declaring such trust was executed on December 5, 1950, after the 
effectivity of said Code. The Civil Code of 1889 and previous laws and 
authorities on the matter, therefore, should govern the herein trust under the 
provisions of Article 2253 of the new Civil Code.</p>
<p>But the Civil Code of 1889 contains no specific provisions on trust as does 
the new Civil Code. Neither does the Code of Civil Procedure of 1901 for the 
same merely provides for the proceeding to be followed relative to trusts and 
trustees (Chapter XVIII). This silence, however, does not mean that the 
juridical institution of trust was then unknown in this jurisdiction, for the 
principles relied upon by the Supreme Court before the effectivity of the new 
Civil Code were those embodied in Anglo-American jurisprudence as derived from 
Roman and Civil Law principles (Government vs. Abadilla, 46 Phil., 42). And 
these are the same principles on which we predicate our ruling heretofore stated 
and on which we now rely for the validity of the trust in question.</p>
<p>The trial court ordered appellants to render an accounting of the fruits of 
the properties in question even if appellees did not expressly ask for it in 
their prayer for relief. We, however, believe that this is covered by the 
general prayer "for such other relief just and equitable under the premises." 
What is important is to know from what date the accounting should be made. The 
trial court ordered that the accounting be made from the time appellees demanded 
the conveyance of the ten parcels of land on August 11, 1956, in accordance with 
Article 1164 of the new Civil Code which provides that the creditor has a right 
to the fruit of the thing from the time the obligation to deliver it arises. But 
this cannot be done without first submitting proof that the conditions stated in 
the mutual agreement had been complied with. And this only happened when the 
decision of the Supreme Court in G.R. No. L-8774<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> became final and executory. The ruling of 
the trial court on this respect should therefore be modified in the sense that 
the accounting should be made from the date of the finality of said 
decision.</p>
<p>We find no error in the directive of the trial court that appellants should 
free the lands in question from the encumbrance that was created thereon by them 
in favor of the Development Bank of the Philippines and one Claro Cortez, for as 
trustees it is their duty to deliver the properties to the <i>cestui que 
trust</i> free from all liens and encumbrances.</p>
<p>To recapitulate, we hold: (1) that the document executed on December 5, 1950 
creates an express trust in favor of appellees; (2) that appellants had no right 
to revoke it without the consent of the <i>cestui que trust</i>; (3) that 
appellants must render an accounting of the fruits of the lands from the date 
the judgment rendered in G.R. No. L-8774 became final and executory; and (4) 
that appellants should free said lands from all liens and encumbrances.</p>
<p>Wherefore, with the modification as above indicated with regard to 
accounting, we hereby affirm the decision appealed from, without pronouncement 
as to costs.</p> <i>Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala, </i>and
