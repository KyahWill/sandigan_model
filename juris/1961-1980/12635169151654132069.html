				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition for a categorical interpretation of Section 4, Commonwealth
Act No. 444, as amended (otherwise known as the Eight-Hour Labor Law), or more
specifically, the correct computation <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> of
the premium pay due the monthly salaried employees for work performed on
Sundays and legal holidays, was brought to us by way of certiorari to review a
ruling<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
on the point by the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR).</p>

<p class="BODY">Said Section 4 reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 4.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>No person, firm, or corporation, business
establishment or place or center of labor shall compel an employee or laborer
to work during Sundays and legal holidays, unless he is paid an additional sum
of at least twenty-five per centum of his regular remuneration:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided, however</u>, That this
prohibition shall not apply to public utilities performing some public service
such as supplying gas, electricity, power, water, or providing means of
transportation or communication."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners were employees of respondent <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
Sugar Develop­ment Co., Inc. (PASUDECO), operator of a sugar central in <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The nature and condition of their employment<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
obliged them to work every day, including Sundays and holidays.</p>

<p class="BODY">Aggrieved by what they believed to be an unlawful failure and
unjusti­fied refusal of PASUDECO to pay their differential or premium compensation
for services duly rendered for 276 Sundays and legal holidays covered by the
period starting 1 January 1954 to 18 August 1958, and even continuously
thereafter, petitioners decided to seek judicial intervention and, accordingly,
filed on 9 May 1962 with the <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> branch of the
CIR a complaint or claim against the corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim <span class="SpellE">totalling</span>
some P15<span class="GramE">,647.68</span> in premium pay, aside from attorney's
fees in the amount of P2,000.00, was arrived at by summing up petitioners'
respective wage for 276 Sundays and holidays plus 25% thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, each petitioner was demanding
for work done not exceeding eight hours during a Sunday or legal holiday the
equivalent of his daily wage for an ordinary working day and 25% of the same,
or 125% all in all, in addition to his monthly salary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was, according to them, the connotation
of the term "premium pay" under Section 4, Commonwealth Act No. 444,
as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">PASUDECO denied the charge of non-payment of the premium pay in
its answer filed on <st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="8">27 August 1962</st1:date>
after its initial motion to dismiss the complaint was rejected by the
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Faithful compliance with the
pertinent provision of law was asserted to support its vigorous <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> of the claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="28" month="7">28 July 1966</st1:date>,
the CIR rendered a decision finding PASUDECO to have already paid over and
above the monthly salary of its employees, including petitioners', their 25%
additional compensation for Sunday and holiday work pursuant to law as well as
to a series of collective bargaining agreements between the union, of which the
latter were members, and the corporation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This practice, the court also discovered from the payrolls and other
records of the corporation, started since 1946 and was verified, confirmed, and
even commended by the examiners of the Department of Labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Holding that this 25% of petitioners'
equivalent daily wage was all that they were legally entitled to in addition to
their monthly salary, the same court, through Associate Judge Joaquin M. Salvador,
dismissed the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A subsequent motion
for reconsideration was denied <u>en banc</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners attack the <span class="SpellE">CIR's</span> finding
concerning payment thereof by <span class="GramE">respondent corporation</span>
as a "conclusion on a wrong premise".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By the same token, the successive collective bargaining agreements
secured by their union and containing provisions to the same effect are
seriously spurned for being in contravention of Section 6,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
also of Commonwealth Act No. 444, or null and void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">initio</span></u> and, therefore, of no binding effect to
them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The law is plain and unambiguous.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It directs payment for work done not exceeding eight hours during
Sundays and legal holidays by an em­ployee or laborer not falling under the
exception<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
"an additional sum of at least twenty-five per centum of his regular
remuneration".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And we already said
in one case<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
that "(t<span class="GramE">)he</span> minimum legal additional compensation
for work on Sundays and legal holidays is - 25% of the laborer's regular
remuneration".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, if said
employee or laborer regularly receives P6 a day for an eight-hour work on an
ordinary day and he is made to work for eight hours on a Sunday or legal
holiday, he is entitled to his base pay of P6 plus P1.50 (25% of P6), or a
total of P7.50.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His premium pay is
P1.50, the "twenty-five per centum of his regular remuneration" of P6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not include his base pay of P6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He gets that P6 for an eight-hour work
performed <u>any</u> day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And he gets
the extra P1.50 if such eight-hour work is rendered on a Sunday or legal
holiday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the most logical and
reasonable import of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The CIR
did not err in following it.</p>

<p class="BODY">The same signification is contrary to petitioners' contention,
given to the term "premium pay" by the Department of Labor, as may be
gleaned from the following formula<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
it devised in determining the daily wage of monthly-salaried employees, except
those employed by public utilities, working the whole year round, including
Sundays and legal holidays.</p>

<p class="BODY">Monthly salary multiplied by 12 (months) equals yearly salary;
yearly salary divided by 380.5 (days) equals daily wage.</p>

<p class="BODY">The figure 380.5 above is the sum of the 303 ordinary days of the
year and the 62 Sundays and legal holidays<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
of the same year and 15.5 (25% of 62).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Stated otherwise, the last figure 15.5 is the difference between 380.5
(theoretically, the number of days worked by the employee in one year) and 365
days (the actual number of days in a year).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is, in short, the equivalent in days of the employee's 25% premium
pay for 52 Sundays and 10 legal holidays in one year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The premium pay is <span class="GramE">not,</span>
therefore, 125% as petitioners want us to believe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, if the employee's daily wage is P6, his
total premium pay for one year is P93 (P6 times 15.5).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Com­puted in another way, with the same daily
wage, his premium pay for one Sunday or legal holiday is P1.50 (25% of P6);
multiplying P1.50 by 62 (the number of Sundays and legal holidays in one year),
we get the same amount of P93.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
the amount of premium pay to which he is entitled in one year in addition to
his fixed yearly salary.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners postulate that the monthly salary or, for that
matter, the yearly salary applies only to the ordinary working days and does
not take into account the Sundays and legal holidays found in a given calendar
month or year.</p>

<p class="BODY">The position thus taken by petitioners-appellants, that they are
entitled to 125% premium, or extra pay, for work done in each Sunday and
holiday, would only apply if it is shown that the monthly or yearly salaries
stipulated are intended to cover work on ordinary working days only or where
the nature or conditions of employment do not require work on Sundays and
holidays.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
But where, in agreeing to the monthly or yearly stipend, the parties knew, or
had reason to know, that the work would be continuous, without inter­ruption on
Sundays and holidays, then the wage earner would only be entitled to the 25%
supplement (or extra pay) provided by section 4 of the Eight-Hour Labor law, as
the regular monthly or yearly wage already covered the work done on Sundays and
holidays.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whether or not the petitioners' salaries were intended to cover
work on ordinary days only, or also included labor on Sundays and holidays, is
a question of fact for the Court of Industrial Relations to decide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since no finding has been made on the
essential point, the records should be referred back to the labor court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order under appeal is set aside and the
case ordered remanded to the Court of Industrial Relations, for further
proceedings conformably to this opinion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No costs.</p>
