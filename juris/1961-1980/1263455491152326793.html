				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On November 28, 1961, the Public Service Commission (henceforth
referred to as Commission) received Resolu­tion No. 86 of the Municipal Board
of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> City pur­<span style="">suing previous requests for reduction of electric rates </span>charged
by the <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> Electric Light &amp; Ice Plants Com­pany
(henceforth referred to as the Plant), holder of <span style="">a </span>certificate of public convenience under Case No. 59811 of the
Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resolution stated that
the pre­sent rates were too high and that the exemption from all taxes granted
to the Plant by Republic Act 2995 enables it to make such a reduction Later, at
the hearing on the audit report of the Auditor General's Office for the year
1959 (Case No. 61-7099), it was agreed that the Plant's financial statements
for 1961 should be used as basis for the proposed reduction after an
independent audit shall have been made.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Almost a year later, on
November </span>9, 1962, <span style="">Acting
Commissioner of Customs Norberto <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span> wrote the
Commission requesting for a reduction of rates charged by </span>the
Plant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Consequently, on November 26, 1962, PSC Commissioner </span>Enrique
Medina required the Plant, in Case No. 59811 <span style="">to show cause why the present rates should not be </span>reduced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the hearing held on December 13, 1962, the
present case - No. 59811 - and Case No. 61-7099 were con­solidated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Commission, in a decision dated May 3, 1963<span style=""> </span>penned by Commissioner Enrique Medina
and concurred in <span style="">by </span><span style="">Associate Commissioners Francisco Perfecto
and Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>, ordered the Plant to reduce
its rates by 10% effective June, 1963.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Plant, on December
11, 1963,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> claiming that the </span><span style="">new </span><span style="">rates were, unreasonable and confiscatory, and further more were
determined without due process of law, filed a motion </span><span style="">for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, on February 25, </span><span style="">1965, </span><span style="">the Plant filed a supplemental motion thereto.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On February 3, 1965, the

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The subsequent motions by
the Plant, the motion dated March 19, 1965 to set aside, for being allegedly
void, pro­mulgation orders </span><span style="">dated
February </span><span style="">3 </span><span style="">and March 12, 1965, </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">motion dated March
24, </span><span style="">1965, to break the tie vote,
were not set for hearing upon order of Commissioner Medina </span><span style="">who </span><span style="">believed the motions to be merely elusive efforts to prevent
enforcement of the decision dated May 3, </span>1963.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Plant, in a petition
for certiorari, prohibition </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">mandamus with preliminary injunction, seeks
before Us to set </span><span style="">aside </span><span style="">the promulgation orders of February </span>3,
<span style="">and March 12, </span><span style="">1965, </span><span style="">to enjoin the enforcement of the decision </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">May </span>3, <span style="">1963, to order
the breaking of the tie vote and </span><span style="">to
suspend </span><span style="">the period for appeal
from the decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petition raises the
following issues:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was the promulgation of the order of February
3, 1965 <span style="">denying the motion for
reconsideration </span><span style="">and the order </span>of
March 12, 1965 <span style="">denying the supplemental
motion, </span>impro­per in the absence of four <span style="">(4) </span>concurring Commissioners <span style="">as </span>required by Section <span style="">3,
</span>last paragraph, Public Service Act, <span style="">as amended?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is the enforcement of the decision of May <span style="">3, </span><span style="">1963 </span>on error?</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With regard to the
validity </span><span style="">of <span style="">the-promulgation </span></span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the February </span>3, <span style="">1965
order, it is pertinent to consider the provisions of Section </span>3, <span style="">paragraph </span><span style="">3 </span><span style="">of the Public Service
Act as amended by Republic Act 2677:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"That any motion for reconsideration of a decision or
non-interlocutory order of any commissioner or division shall be heard directly
by the Commission en bane and the concurrence of <u>at least four commissioners
shall be necessary or the promulgation</u> of a final <span style="">decision or order resolving such motion for reconsideration."
(Underscoring ours)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">This </span><span style="">provision
of law clearly provides that four (4) Com­missioners should at least concur
before a final decision or order resolving a motion for reconsideration may be
promulgated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, then, the
promulgation of the order of February 3, 1955 with a 3 to 3 vote was
improper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">It </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">not correct to argue
that there is no such thing as a tie vote the Commission and that the effect
was a <span style="">de­nial </span>of the motion for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last sentence of
the first paragraph of section 3 of the Act, as amended, provides fee the
procedure in case of <span style="">inability </span>of
the re­<span style="">quisite num</span>ber of
Commissioners to render a decision:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In the event of <span style="">a </span>tie vote among the Commissioners,
the Secretary of Justice may desig­nate such number of Judges of the Courts of
First Instance or such number of Attorneys of the legal division of the
Commission, as may be necessary, to sit temporarily as Commissioners in the
Public Service Commission."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">The
tie referred to here can only be when the Commission <span style="">sits </span>en banc and is equally divided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Commissioner Medina should not have
promulgated the order of </span><st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="2"><span style="">February 3, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, for the Commission should have tried to
resolve the im­passe and if it failed, should have referred the matter to the
Secretary of Justice for action on his part under the law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span>denial <span style="">of the supplemental motion was merely the
consequence </span>of <span style="">the denial of the
motion for reconsidera­tion which, as stated, was improper,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Regarding the enforcement
of the decision dated </span><st1:date year="1963" day="3" month="5"><span style="">May 3, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, We </span><span style="">find </span><span style="">that Commissioner
Medina was <span style="">well within his </span>authority
to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 33, last part of the
Pu­blic Service Act, as amended, provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"All orders of the Commission to continue an existing service
or prescribing rates to be charged <u>shall immediately be operative</u>; all
other orders shall become effective upon the dates specified therein."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Thus,
in one case</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> where a division of Commissioners or­dered
the increase of electric light <span style="">rates
charged </span>by the <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span>, We held that under
Section 33 of the law as amended, the Commission has no discretion to suspend </span>the
<span class="SpellE"><span style="">effec­tivity</span></span><span style=""> of the order continuing existing service or
pres­cribing rates, for only the Supreme Court may do so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style=""> the orders of February </span><span style="">3, </span><span style="">1965 and March 12, 1965 are hereby annulled and the case is remanded to
the Public Service Commission for further deliberation and, if necessary, for
reference to the Secretary of Justice under Sec. </span><span style="">3, </span><span style="">first paragraph, of
the Public Service Act, without prejudice to the immediate <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
- that </span><span style="">is,
