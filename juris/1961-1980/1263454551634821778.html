<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of plaintiff

attorney's fees."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Sometime after the filing of <span style="">its </span>complaint, plaintiff waived its claims under the eighth and
the ninth causes of action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, the case was submitted for decision upon <span style="">a </span>stipulation of facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due course, thereafter, said Court
rendered the decision above referred to.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue for resolution before us, as in the lower court, is
whether or not the provisional claims filed by or for the aforementioned
consignees, admittedly within fifteen (15) days from the respective dates of
discharge of the goods in question from the carrying <span style="">vessels followed by formal </span>claims filed beyond said period, have
complied sufficiently with the requirements of paragraph 15 of the Management
Contract between the defendants which, admittedly, is – under the circumstances
obtaining in this case - binding upon the plaintiff herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said paragraph 15 reads:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>The CONTRACTOR shall be sole­ly responsible <span style="">as an </span>independent
contractor for, and promptly pay to the steamship company, consignee,
consignor, or other interested party or parties the invoice value of each
package but which in no case shall be more than five hundred pesos (P500.00)
for each package unless the value otherwise specified or manifested, and the
corresponding <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> charges had been paid, <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>in any event the
CONTRACTOR shall be relieved and released of any and all responsibility or
liability for loss, damage, <span class="SpellE">misdelivery</span> and/or
non-delivery of goods, unless suit in the court of proper jurisdiction is
brought within a period of one (1) year from date of discharge of the goods or
from the date when the claim for the value of such goods have been rejected or
denied by the CONTRACTOR, provided that such claim shall have been filed with
the CONTRACTOR within fifteen (15) days from date of discharge of the last
package from the carrying vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span>”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Defendants submitted a negative answer upon the ground that said
provisional claims were mere form-letters, couched in general terms, stating
that the goods therein referred to had been, either short-landed, or landed in
bad order, without <span style="">a </span>statement
of the extent of the loss or damage sustained, nor of the value of the same and
without supporting documents, such as, invoices, bills of lading and packing
lists.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Defendants maintain that the aforementioned paragraph of the
management contract contemplates a claim for value fully documented, with
supporting papers, so that they could <span style="">make
</span>a reasonable appraisal of the merits of the claim and decide <span style="">to </span>approve or reject the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has <span style="">been repeatedly
held, however,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> that </span>a provisional claim describing
the importation concerned sufficiently to allow the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operator a reasonable verification of the claim, <span style="">even </span>if without a statement of the value of the goods lost or of
the d<span style="">am</span>age suffered, and without
supporting papers attached thereto, constitutes a substantial compliance with
the requirements of <span style="">the </span>aforementioned
paragraph.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The provisional <span style="">claims </span>filed in <span style="">the </span>case at bar specify the number of
the <span style="">bill of lading, the </span><span style="">name of </span>the consignee, the marks and
numbers appearing on the <span style="">goods </span>involved,
a description of said goods, the name of the carrying vessels, and the date of
arrival thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They satisfy the
aforementioned requirements.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from should be, as it is
hereby, affirmed, with costs against the defendants-appellants.</p>
