<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
principal issue in the present case revolves on the legality of the resolution
of the respondent Commission on Elections, dated December 22, 1965, which
orders the opening of the ballot boxes used in all the </span><span style="">precincts in the municipalities of <span class="SpellE">Candon</span>, Sta. Cruz and Santiago, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, during the elections of November 9, 1965 for the
purpose of retrieving <span class="SpellE">there­from</span> the corresponding
election returns, copies for the ballot box, "to enable the aggrieved
party to es­tablish discrepancy between copies of the election returns provided
by law in the aforementioned precincts for the purpose of obtaining judicial
remedy under the provisions of Section 163 of the Revised Election Code."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is the stand of the
petitioner that respondent Commission on Elections is without jurisdiction to
issue, or has acted in excess of jurisdiction in issuing, the resolution in
question, so that said resolution is null and void and should not be given
legal force and effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner
contends that under Section 157 of the Revised Election Code the Commission on
Elections has authority to order the opening of the ballot boxes "only in
connection with </span><span style="">an investigation </span><span style="">conducted
for the purpose of helping in the prosecution of any violation of the </span><span style="">election </span><span style="">laws or for purely administrative pur­pose

</span>The petitioner further contends that "the mere fact that the copies
of the returns in the precincts in question in the possession of the Liberal
Party do not tally with the returns involving the same precincts in the
possession of the Provincial Treasurer, the Commission on Elections and the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">well does not legally
support the validity of the resolution of the respondent Commission in question

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We cannot sustain the
stand of the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe that
in issuing the resolution in question the Commission on Elections simply
performed a function as authorized by the Constitution, that is, to "have
exclusive charge of the enforcement and administration of all laws relative to
the conduct of elections and x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
exercise all other functions which may be conferred upon it by law."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission has the power to decide all

J.B.L. Reyes, held as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The suspension of the proclamation of the winning candidate
pending an in­quiry into irregularities brought to the attention of the
Commission on Elections was well within its administrative jurisdiction, in
view of the exclusive autho­rity conferred upon it by the Constitution (Art. X)
for the administration and en­forcement of all laws relative to elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission certainly had the right to
inquire whether or not discrepancies existed between the various copies of
election returns for the precincts in question, and suspend the canvass in the
meantime so the parties could ask for a recount in case of variance <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">What the respondent Commission on Elections did in the case now
before Us is just what is contemplated in the <span class="SpellE">abovequoted</span>
ruling of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power of the
Commission on Elections in this respect is simply administrative and
supervisory - intended to secure the proclamation of the winning candidate
based on the true count of the votes cast.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the Commission on Elect­ions exercises this power the purpose is
not for the Commission to help a candidate win the election but to bring about
the canvass of the true results of the elections as certified by the boards of
election ins­pectors in every precinct.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The object of the canvass is to determine the result of the elections
based on the official election returns.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In order that the result of the canvass would reflect the true <span style="">expression </span>of the people's <span style="">will in </span>the choice of their <span style="">elective officials, </span>the canvass must
be based on true, genuine, correct, nay <span class="SpellE">untampered</span>,
election returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is in this
proceeding that the Commission on Elections <span style="">exercises its supervisory and administrative </span>power in the
enforcement of laws relative to the conduct of elections, by seeing to it that
the canvass is based on the elect­ion returns as actually certified by the
members of the boards of inspectors.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Once the Commission on Elections is convinced that the election returns
in the hands of the board of canvassers do not constitute the proper basis in
ascertaining the true result of the elections, it should be its concern, nay
its duty, to order the taking of such steps <span style="">as may </span>be necessary in order that the
proper basis for the canvass is obtained or made available.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The election law requires
the board of inspectors </span>to <span style="">prepare
four copies of the election return in each precinct - one to be deposited in
the ballot box, one to be delivered to municipal treasurer, one to be sent to
the provincial treasurer, and one to be sent to the Commission on
Elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of the canvass of
</span>the <span style="">election returns for
candidates for provincial or national offices, the <span style="">election </span>returns received by the provincial treasurer from the
boards of inspectors are </span>used.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It is the duty of the provincial treasurer to
turn over to the provincial board of canvassers the elect­ion returns received
by him from the boards of inspectors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
the Commission on Elections is duly informed and it so finds, in appropriate
proceedings, that the election re­turns in the hands of the provincial
treasurer are tam­pered, then the Commission should afford the candidate
adversely affected by the tampering an opportunity to show </span>that <span style="">there exist authentic copies of the same election
returns which are not tampered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
recourse may be had to </span>the <span style="">copies
received by the Commission on Elections and to the copies received by the
municipal treasurer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it is shown,
that the copies in the hands of the Commission on Elections and of the
municipal treasurer are similarly tampered as the copies in the hands of the
provincial treasurer, then it becomes evident that all the three copies of the
election returns outside the ballot box do not constitute a reliable basis for
a canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only copies left to be
checked, whether they are also tampered or not, are the ones inside the ballot
boxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the Com</span>mission
on Elections, in the exercise of its power to administer and enforce the laws
relative to the con­duct of elections, may order the opening of the ballot
boxes to ascertain whether the copy inside each ballot box is also tampered
like the three copies outside the ballot box, corresponding to each
precinct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Com­mission on Elections
may do this on its own initiative, or upon petition by the proper party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once it is found that the copy of the
election return inside the ballot box is <span class="SpellE">untampered</span>,
the Commission on Elections would then have accomplished two things,
namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) secured a basis for the
prosecution for the violation of the laws relative to elections, and (2)
afforded the party aggrieved by the alteration of the election returns outside
the ballot box a basis for a judicial recount of the votes as provided for in
Section <span style="">163 </span>of the Re­vised
Election Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the Commission on
Elections has thereby made available the proper and reliable basis for the
canvass of the votes that will lead to the proclamation by the board of
canvassers of the true winner in the elections.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In so doing the Commission on Elect­ions, as We have said, had performed
its constitutional duty of <span style="">administering
</span>and enforcing the laws relative to the conduct of elections with a view
to promoting clean and honest elections - the very purpose for which the
Commission on Elections was created by constitu­tional mandate.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case now before Us, the Commission on Elections issued the
questioned resolution "After hear­ing the arguments of the petitioner and
the opposition thereto and considering that it has been <u>clearly</u> <u>es­tablished</u>
that the copies of the election returns for the Municipal Treasurer, for the
Commission on Elect­ions and for the Provincial Treasurer for the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Sta.</st1:placename></st1:place><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cruz have uniform alteration in the entries
of the votes cast for <span style="">representative </span>showing
dif­ferent number of votes compared with the Liberal Party copies, while the
copies of the election returns for the Commission on Elections and the
Provincial Treas­urer for the municipalities of <span class="SpellE">Candon</span>
and Santiago have likewise uniform alterations and showing different num­bers
compared with the Liberal Party copies <span style="">x

Indeed, in the face of this finding by the Commission on Elections, which
indicates a clear violation of the election law, and which indicates an attempt
to procure the proclamation of the winner in the elections for representative
in the second congressional dis­trict of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> by the use of tampered election returns, can the
Commission on Elections be remiss in the performance of its duties as a
constitutional body committed with the exclusive charge of the enforcement and
administration of all laws relative to the conduct of elections?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Revised Election Code gives to the
Commission on Elections the direct and immediate supervision over provincial,
municipal and city officials designated by law to perform duties re­lative to
the conduct of <span style="">elections - </span>and
included among these officials are members of the provincial board of
canvassers.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The provincial board of canvassers is enjoined by law to canvass all the votes
cast for representative on the basis of the election returns produced by the
provincial treasurer.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The Commission on Elections has a duty to enforce this law, and it has the duty
to see to it that the election re­turns to be used for canvassing must be
genuine and authentic, not falsified or tampered with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the election returns produced by the
provincial treasurer have been shown to have been tampered, and all the other
copies outside the ballot boxes have also been shown to have been tampered or
falsified, it is cer­tainly within the power of the Commission on Elections to
issue such order as would ascertain the existence of the genuine, authentic and
<span class="SpellE">untampered</span> election ret­urns, and thus open the way
for the summary recount of the votes, in accordance with law, for the purposes
only of the canvass of the votes and the proclamation of <span style="">the </span>candidate found to have obtained
the highest number of votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case
now before Us, it is found by the Commission on Elections that no other copies
can be had except those deposited in the ballot boxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the necessity for the Commission to <span style="">order the retrieving </span>of the copies of
the election returns from the ballot boxes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>An order to this effect does not affect the right to vote or the
validity of any vote cast, so that <span style="">it
is perfectly within the power of the Commission on Elections to issue </span>such
an order in the exercise of its <span style="">exclusive
power </span>to administer and enforce the laws re­lative to the conduct of
elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would indeed <span style="">be </span>absurd to say that the Commission
on Elections has <span style="">a legal duty to
perform and at the same time it <span style="">is </span>denied
the necessary means to perform said duty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The purpose of the <span style="">Revised </span>Election Code is to protect

patently falsified. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>We cannot, and We
must not, sanc­tion the stand of petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As <span style="">We have </span></span><span style="">adverted </span><span style="">to, the Commission on Elect­ions has the power to inquire whether there
exist dis­crepancies among the various copies of the election returns.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Of all the copies prepared by the board of
inspectors the copy least susceptible to being tampered with is the one
deposited in the ballot box.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the
three copies outside the ballot boxes appear to have </span><span style="">been uniformly altered, there is no plausible
reason why the copy deposited in the ballot box may not be used to determine
whether discrepancies exist in the various copies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as the Commission on Elect­ions has </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">right to determine whether said discre­pancies exist, it must also have
the right </span>to <span style="">consult said
returns, which cannot be done unless the ballot boxes are opened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is noteworthy that the Revised Election
Code does not provide that it is the courts that have the power to order the
opening of the bal­lot box in a situation like this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Section 157 of the
Revised Election Code, on which petitioner herein </span><span style="">relies </span><span style="">in support of his stand in the present case,
authorizes the opening of the bal­lot box whenever it is the subject of </span><span style="">an official in­vestigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"The
municipal treasurer shall keep </span>the boxes unopened in his possession in a
secure place and under his responsibility for three months, unless they are the
sub­ject of an official investigation, or <span style="">a </span>competent court or tribunal shall demand them sooner, or the
competent authority shall order their preservation for a long­er time in
connection with any pending <span style="">contest or investigation."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under this section, the
ballot boxes may </span>be opened in case there <span style="">is an election contest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They may
also </span>be opened even <span style="">if there </span>is
<span style="">no election contest </span>when their
contents have to be used as evidence in the prosecution of election frauds.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, they <span style="">may
</span>be opened when they are the subject of any official investigation which
may be ordered by a competent court or other competent authority.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">The </span>"competent <span style="">authority" </span>must include <span style="">the Commission </span>on Elections which is
charged with the administration and enforcement <span style="">of the laws relative to the conduct of elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, the Commis­sion on Elections
found that it has been clearly esta</span>blished that the election returns
outside the ballot boxes, in all the precincts in the municipalities of <span class="SpellE">Candon</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>
and Sta. Cruz, have been tampered with.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is within the power of the Commission to order the investigation of
that apparent anomaly that has con­nection with the conduct of elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The investiga­tion may be in connection with
the prosecution for the violations of the election laws and at the same time to
ascertain the condition of the election returns inside the ballot boxes as
compared with the election returns outside the ballot boxes, for the same
precincts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The opening of the ballot
boxes may, therefore, be prayed for by a candidate who is prejudiced by the
apparent falsification of the election returns outside the ballot boxes, and in
ordering the opening of the ballot boxes the purpose of the Commission is not
to help a particular candidate win an election but to properly administer and
enforce the laws relative to the con­duct of elections.</p>
