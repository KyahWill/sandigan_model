Nicasio Santos of the Bustos Police Department in his presence.<br><br>Eulalia Tayao, the widow of the deceased testified how she learned of the death of her husband.&nbsp; She also said that she has 7 children by her late husband, the ages of whom range from 3 1/2 years for the youngest to 18 years for the eldest; that their source of livelihood during the lifetime of her husband was his tricycle earnings which averaged from P3.00 to P4.00 a day; that as a result of her husband's death, she incurred expenses in the amount of P3,000.00, which sum of money she only borrowed since at the time her husband died they did not have a single centavo; that the said amount she borrowed was used in purchasing a coffin worth P800.00; for the expenses for the tomb amounting to P100.00; and for expenses for the third night celebration, prayers for 9 days, "<i>patapos</i>", celebration of the 40th day of the death of her husband, on which occasions she had many guests.<br><br>Testifying in his defense, Reynaldo Juliano said that the statement which he swore to inside the cell of the municipal building of Bustos, Bulacan, was signed by him on June 17 because Pat. de Vera threatened him on June 16 that he would saw the iron bar of the cell, force him to go out of the cell, and shoot him once he was outside the cell; that the threat was made on his person by Pat. de Vera in the presence of a person whom the policeman claimed to be the Chief of Police of Bustos, but during the latter part of his direct examination he claimed that he and the police officer were the only ones present when he was thus threatened; that he was likewise boxed many times by Pat. de Vera in the abdomen until he finally lost consciousness but that nobody else, not even a detention prisoner, was present during this occasion; that he was likewise threatened on the night he was apprehended in his house by Pat. de Vera and Pat. Velasquez; that on said occasion, he was brought to a river in Tanawan, Bustos, Bulacan, which is around 150 meters from his house, where he was dumped into the river, with his hands tied at his back; that when Pat. de Vera submerged his head in the river, his stomach became distended about 3 to 4 inches because of the water he swallowed; that after coming from the river, he learned that he was being accused of the crime because upon his arrival at the municipal building, Romy de Vera pointed to him as the one who hit and struck the victim herein; that when he was being maltreated in the river, he was being made to admit that he was Perfecto Tayaoâs assailant, although he admitted that prior to the occasion in the municipal building when he was pointed to by Romy de Vera as the assailant of Perfecto Tayao he did not know of any specific reason why Pat. de Vera and Pat. Velasquez maltreated him in the river; that the statement was not read to him by Pat. de Vera before he signed the same since upon his request that he be allowed to read the same he was boxed by Pat. de Vera in the stomach and told to sign the said document so that he would not be hurt anymore; that he learned from Romy de Vera himself that he is the first cousin of Pat. de Vera, when he (witness) was being forced to confess to the commission of the crime charged; that he was not presented on June 16 before Municipal Mayor Vicente Ramos of Bustos, Bulacan, whom he knew personally and who appeared to have been the administering officer of the statement; that the persons who killed Perfecto Tayao were Romy de Vera and Antonio Soriano; that Romy de Vera implicated him in the commission of the crime simply because they were together when the incident in question happened; that on the night of June 10, 1970, he proceeded alone to the Riverside Cabaret where he found Antonio Soriano and Romy de Vera who invited him to drink beer with them; that he was able to consume four (4) bottles of beer so much so that he got drunk inside the dancing hall where he slept with his head rested on the table; that he did not know what time he woke up although he knew that Antonio Soriano and Romy de Vera carried him bodily and boarded him inside a tricycle, because according to his companions they were going home already; that he did not know personally the tricycle driver; that he slept inside the said tricycle and woke up when the tricycle was bumped; that while still seated inside the tricycle he saw from a distance of more than an arm's length Romy de Vera and Antonio Soriano hitting Perfecto Tayao; that he requested Romy de Vera and Antonio Soriano not to hit the said tricycle driver but they did not heed his request and because he was drunk he did not get off the tricycle; that when the tricycle driver fell, Antonio Soriano told him, "let us run away", to which he replied that he could not run because he was drunk and he felt dizzy; that Romy de Vera and Antonio Soriano then accompanied him home.<br><br>The evidence for the prosecution, particularly Exhibit C and the testimony of Romy de Vera, convince us that Reynaldo Juliano did participate in the killing of Perfecto Tayao.<br><br>Reynaldo's counsel argues, however, that Exhibit C is inadmissible as evidence because Reynaldo was not afforded the right to counsel during the interrogation.&nbsp; He points to the admission of Patrolman Santos that Reynaldo was not informed that he was entitled to services of a lawyer before the investigation commenced.&nbsp; Counsel invokes the 1973 Constitution and the doctrines laid down in <i>Escobedo</i> (378 U. S. 478 [1964]) and <i>Miranda</i> (384 U. S. 436 [1966]).&nbsp; But the confession was offered and admitted in evidence during the trial of the case on September 14, 1970.&nbsp; The brief is dated February 2, 1972 and its supplement is dated February 6, 1973, and at those dates the constitutional provision on the inadmissibility of confession obtained without aid of counsel had not yet been passed upon by this Court.&nbsp; However, in <i>Magtoto vs. Manguera, et al.</i>, G.R. Nos. L-37201-02, March 3, 1975, 63 SCRA 4, 12, we ruled that:&nbsp; "[T]his specific portion of this constitutional mandate has and should be given a prospective and not a retrospective effect.&nbsp; Consequently, a confession obtained from a person under investigation for the commission of an offense, who has not been informed of his right (to silence and) to counsel, is inadmissible in evidence if the same had been obtained after the effectivity of the New Constitution on January 17, 1973.&nbsp; Conversely, such confession is admissible in evidence against the accused, if the same had been obtained before the effectivity of the New Constitution, even if presented after January 17, 1973, and even if he had not been informed of his right to counsel, since no law gave the accused the right to be so informed before that date." The doctrine laid down in Manguera has been reiterated in a number of cases such as <i>People vs. Beralde</i>, G.R. No. L-32832; June 29, 1979, and is now definitive.<br><br>Reynaldo's counsel also argues that Exhibit C was extorted by force, violence and intimidation.&nbsp; He asserts that since Romy de Vera was one of the killers of Perfecto Tayao, Patrolman de Vera had a reason for shifting the blame on Reynaldo, hence the extortion of the confession.<br><br>A confession is presumed voluntary until the contrary is proved.&nbsp; (5 Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, p. 264; <i>People vs. Dorado</i>, 30 SCRA 53, 57, citing <i>U. S. vs. Zara</i>, 42 Phil. 308; <i>People vs. Cabrera</i>, 43 Phil. 64; <i>People vs. Singh</i>, 45 Phil. 676; <i>People v. Pereto</i>, G. R. No. L-20894, Dec. 29, 1967, 21 SCRA 1469).&nbsp; There is no such proof in this case.&nbsp; The lone negative testimony of Reynaldo has not overcome the presumption.&nbsp; On the contrary, the detailed nature of the confession and the identical sequence of the statement of facts and the persons involved and/or mentioned therein with that of the testimony of Romy de Vera, belies such claim.&nbsp; Reynaldo's detailed confession bolsters the prosecution's stand and bears the earmarks of voluntariness.&nbsp; (<i>People vs. Ventura</i>, G.R. No. L-32716, December 1, 1977; 80 SCRA 515).&nbsp; Moreover, the police officer who took down the confession and the Municipal Mayor of Bustos, Bulacan, before whom the questioned document was subscribed and sworn to are entitled to the presumption of regularity, short of any convincing evidence to the contrary.&nbsp; The records show that the questioned confession was in <i>Pilipino</i> and that appellant went over the document twice before he signed it.&nbsp; Also, it was shown that he was a first year student and could have easily understood its contents.&nbsp; As correctly observed by the trial court, Reynaldo's failure to report to higher authorities the alleged infliction of bodily harm upon him by the arresting/investigating police officers, particularly Patrolman de Vera; to present himself for treatment; to file the appropriate charge/charges against the responsible officers, including the Mayor; and to present the administering officer as rebuttal evidence negates his claim that force and intimidation was exerted upon him to make his confession.&nbsp; (P. 22, Decision).<br><br>The information alleges the qualifying circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation.&nbsp; But we agree with Reynaldo's counsel that these were not proved at the trial.&nbsp; As to evident premeditation, there is no direct and positive evidence that Reynaldo planned to kill Tayao.&nbsp; His confession states that the intention was to scare him only and there is no indication when this plan was definitely conceived.&nbsp; It was definitely not in Portillo, Baliwag, Bulacan, as the trial court states.&nbsp; Romy de Vera, the prosecution's star witness, did not know of any plan to kill Tayao nor of any conspiracy between Reynaldo and Antonio Soriano.&nbsp; Absent any proof as to how and when the plan to kill the victim was hatched or what time had elapsed before it was carried out, evident premeditation cannot be considered.&nbsp; (<i>People vs. Custodio</i>, 97 Phil. 698 [1955]).&nbsp; And as to treachery, there is no showing that Reynaldo and Antonio Soriano employed it when they killed Tayao.&nbsp; Reynaldo in Exhibit C said he hit the deceased on the face while all that Romy de Vera could say was that "After we passed the Poblacion and reaching near the place of the cemetery Antonio Soriano alighted and then I heard a thud and groaning and when I alighted from the tricycle I saw Reynaldo Juliano holding a piece of wood and was striking the driver of the tricycle with that piece of wood." (TSN, Sept. 11, 1970, p. 25.)<br><br>The crime committed was, therefore, homicide only.<br><br>The information also charges the following aggravating circumstances:&nbsp; nocturnity and use of superior strength.&nbsp; (Evident premeditation is also mentioned but this has already been alleged as a qualifying circumstance.) The trial court did not consider these aggravating circumstances as having been proved (for indeed there is nothing in the record to support them) but found instead as present those of craft and uninhabited place albeit with no explanation whatsoever why they were so considered.<br><br>It passes understanding how Reynaldo could have used craft in committing the crime.&nbsp; Craft involves the use of intellectual trickery or cunning on the part of the accused.&nbsp; But as will be shown later Reynaldo was practically in a stupor when the crime was committed.&nbsp; So he could not have used craft.&nbsp; But the aggravating circumstance of <i>despoblado</i> has been proved.&nbsp; For the evidence shows that the site near the Catholic cemetery was purposely chosen for the purpose of "<i>aming takutin iyong tsuper na aking sinakyan</i>." (Exh. C.)<br><br>Reynaldo's counsel claims that he is entitled to the mitigating circumstance of intoxication.&nbsp; We agree.&nbsp; Exhibit C itself shows that Reynaldo had been drinking since the early evening of June 10, 1970.&nbsp; This was confirmed by Romy de Vera and Jenet Adriatico a hostess at the Riverside Cabaret.&nbsp; The latter testified that Reynaldo had imbibed so much alcohol that he slept by resting his head on the table.&nbsp; There is no evidence that Reynaldo's intoxication was habitual or related to the intention to kill.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, we find the accused-appellant Reynaldo Juliano guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of homicide only attended by the aggravating circumstance of <i>despoblado</i> but offset by the mitigating circumstance of intoxication.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of the lower court is modified as to the principal penalty in that the accused-appellant is hereby sentenced to an indeterminate imprisonment of seven (7) years of <i>prision mayor</i>, as minimum, to fifteen (15) years of <i>reclusion temporal</i>, as maximum.&nbsp; The judgment appealed from is affirmed in all other respects.&nbsp; Costs <i>de oficio</i>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED. </b><br><br><i>Concepcion, Jr., Santos, Fernandez, Guerrero,</i> and <i>De Castro, JJ.</i>, concur. <br><i>Fernando, C.J.</i>, in the result. <br><i>Barredo, J.</i>, dissents for the same reasons given by Justice Herrera in whose opinion he concurs.<br><i>Makasiar,</i> and <i>Antonio, JJ.</i>, concur in the partial dissent of Justice Melencio-Herrera.<br><i>Aquino, J.</i>, dissents.
