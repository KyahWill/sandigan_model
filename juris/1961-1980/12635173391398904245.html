				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The power of respondent Commissioner of Civil Service to direct
the Mayor of the City of Manila, petitioner Antonio J. Villegas, to replace the
other petitioners, James Barbers, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Paralejas</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> as
station commanders of the three Manila police precincts, is challenged in this
prohi­bition proceeding filed with the Manila Court of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no dispute that petitioner, as
Mayor, by virtue of the statutory grant of authority of "immediate control
over the execu­tive functions of the different departments,"<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
could pick the police officials to be entrusted with such responsibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The choice fell on the three other
petitioners, then police captains.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent Commissioner would dispute their designation as such on the
ground of lack for each of them of "an Inspector First Class (Police
Detective Major)" eligibility.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners prevailed, the lower court being unable to locate any legal
provision to warrant such an exercise of power on the part of respondent
Commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case is before us now
on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For reasons to be more
explicitly and fully set forth, we affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition for prohibition, with preliminary injunction being
sought, was filed in the Court of First Instance of Manila on <st1:date year="1965" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the allegation as to parties, it was
set forth therein that in an endorsement of June 30, 1965, respondent
Commissioner directed that petitioners Barbers, <span class="SpellE">Paralejas</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> be replaced as station commanders of the
three police precincts of Manila, as their continued employment as such was
illegal, the eligibility required being that of an inspector first class,
allegedly not possessed by them.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The petitioner Mayor replied on <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="7">July 2,
 1965</st1:date>, asserting that he felt obliged "to disregard said
directive, it being in excess of the authority vested in [the Civil Service]
Commission." As noted in such communication:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"This Office is not aware of any
provision of law requiring that Precinct or Station Commanders should be at
least a Police or Detective Major or an Inspector First Class. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Para­graph 4, Section 23 of Republic Act No.
2260, otherwise known as the Civil Service Act of 1959, which that Commission
has invoked, contemplates positions in the competitive or classified service as
provided for in an appropriation or budget measure to which an appointment, as
the term appointment is used in Section 24 of the Civil Service Act of 1959, is
required.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obvious­ly, this provision of
law can not cover mere designations or assignments to an area of command.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, Precinct or Station Commanders in the
Manila Police Department are so designated for organizational purposes in order
to delineate their specific area of command and effect greater efficiency in
the adminis­tration of police affairs."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Commissioner of Civil Service was however adamant,
reiterating on <st1:date year="1965" day="9" month="7">July 9, 1965</st1:date>
his directive for the replace­ment of the other petitioners as station
commanders.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Then came the allegation why in this particular case respondent Com­missioner
of Civil Service acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or, at the very
least, with grave abuse of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As pointed out in the petition, the assignment or detail in this case of
the other petitioners as precinct or station commanders did not constitute "appointment
to positions in the competitive or classified service;" that such
designation or detail was exclusively within the power and jurisdiction of
petitioner Mayor under his specific power of direction, supervision and control
vested in him by the Charter and in view of his responsibility as the chief
execu­tive of the City to maintain peace and order therein; that there is no
law or civil service regulation which requires any specific civil service
eligibility for a precinct or station commander and that on the assumption that
respondent Com­missioner could determine the appropriate eligibility, the
examination for police inspectors invoked by him were suspended by order of the
President of the Philippines of March 23, 1964 insofar as the City of Manila
was concerned.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
There were other allegations to show lack or excess of juris­diction as well as
grave abuse of discretion, but enough has been said to render clear why for
petitioners the directive in question was beyond the power of respondent
Commissioner to issue.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the answer by respondent Commissioner filed on <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1965</st1:date>, the facts as set forth
were admitted, but there was an explicit denial of the grounds relied upon to
show lack or excess of jurisdiction or his acting with grave abuse of
discretion.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The stress in the affirmative and special defenses set forth was that the
assignment of petitioners Barbers, <span class="SpellE">Paralejas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> was not allowable under the Civil Service Act in
view of the fact that there were as of that time <span class="SpellE">eligibles</span>
to the position of inspector first class who could be so designated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reliance was also had, as on the original
directive of respondent Commissioner, of such designation of petitioners as not
being "in conformity with the recommendation of the U. S. Agency for International
Develop­ment to assign and shift [Manila Police Department] personnel to
positions to which they have qualified in appropriate examinations."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The decision now on appeal, promulgated on <st1:date year="1966" day="14" month="7">July 14, 1966</st1:date>, noted that respondent Commissioner
did not dispute the civil service eligibilities and training of petitioners
Barbers, <span class="SpellE">Paralejas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reference was made to the opening paragraph
of the petition wherein the following appeared:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Petitioner Capt. Barbers passed his First Grade Civil Service
(supervisor) Promotional Examination taken on March 31, 1962 with a high mark
of 80.1 per cent; he is also a law graduate (1964) and graduated as a full
scholar; he completed the Basic Course for Patrolman at the MPD training school
(1945), the Advanced Course (1946), the Detective Course (1946) as class <span class="SpellE">topnotcher</span> with an average of 96.5 per cent and the Senior
Police Refresher Course (1962) at the Philippine Army School Command, Ft. <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>; and he also trained at the International Police
Academy in Washington, D. C., the New York City Police Academy, the Pinkerton
Detective Agency in New York, the Dade County Police Department in Miami,
Florida, the U. S. Military Police School at Fort Gordon, Georgia, and the
Michigan State University Communications Seminar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Peti­tioner Capt. <span class="SpellE">Paralejas</span>
passed the civil service examination for police lieutenant in 1945 with a
rating of 77.90 per cent; he is a commerce graduate (1939) 2nd year law,
F.E.U.; he completed the supervisors 2nd In-Service Training in the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
(medalist) and the Senior Police Refresher Course (1962) at the Philippine
School Command, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Ft.</st1:placetype> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Capt. <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span>
passed the Criminal Investigation in Secret Service exa­mination (<span class="SpellE">pensionado</span>) given by the Civil Service Commission in 1947,
with an average of 83.62%; he completed the supervisors 2nd In-Service Training
in the City of Manila and the Senior Police Refresher Course (1962) at the
Philippine Army School Command, Ft. <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>,
graduating as third honor; first grade eligible under Rep. Act 1080, being a
member of the Philippine Bar."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The decision then noted that while respondent Commissioner had
ruled "that the appropriate eligibility for the position of precinct
commander is that of police inspector, first class (police major), no valid
reason has been advanced to show that such eligibility is appropriate and that
of police captain is not."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
It was likewise made clear in the decision that there was no law prescribing
that precinct commanders be police majors.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even on the assumption then that the "corrective measures"
could be supplied by respondent Commissioner if "unsatisfactory situations
are found" still the appropriate conclusion, according to the lower court,
considering "the civil service eligibilities and training of
petitioners-captains, the failure of respondent Commissioner to show
unsatisfactory situations in the assignment or designation of
petitioners-captains as precinct commanders, and the reasons stated in the
petition, [is that] respondent Commissioner has acted without or in excess of
jurisdiction and with grave abuse of dis­cretion in issuing and trying to
enforce the directive in question."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">What cannot be denied, as stressed in such decision, is the
absence of any law "which prescribes that precinct commanders be police
majors," resulting necessarily in the directive of respondent Commissioner
of Civil Service being declared null and void, the writ of prohibition thus
being the appropriate remedy, with an injunction perpetually restraining him
from the commission of the acts complained of.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question, to repeat, is one of power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is clear is that it is <st1:place><st1:placename>petitioner</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> Mayor that could so designate
the other petitioners to assume the position of station commanders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That power is his, and his alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is not required by law to share it with
respondent Commissioner, who must justify by the valid conferment of authority
the action taken by him in requiring that the City Mayor replace the other
petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Power is not to be
presumed, it must be shown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
Commissioner failed to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not
surprising therefore that the lower court ruled against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As set forth at the outset, we sustain the
lower court and affirm the judgment appealed from.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power of <st1:place><st1:placename>petitioner</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> Mayor as to who could be
designated as station commanders of the three <st1:place>Manila</st1:place>
police precincts is conceded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No dispute
as to his authority to do so exists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Charter is clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The narrow question,
therefore, is whether such designation could be frustrated by the directive of
the respondent Commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this
official to be justified in interposing a negative, he must show that an
applicable law authorizes him to do so.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is well-settled that respondent Commissioner at the most may
inquire only as to the eligibility of the person thus chosen to fill up a
vacant position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he were, then
respondent Com­missioner of Civil Service must so attest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That function being discharged, his
participation ceases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we have held in
the lead­ing case of Villanueva v. <span class="SpellE">Balallo</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
the opinion being penned by the present Chief Justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"When the appointee is qualified, as petitioner herein admittedly
is, then the Commissioner of Civil Service has no choice but to attest to the
appointment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been repeatedly held
that an appointment becomes complete upon the performance of the last act
required by law of the appointing power.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The attestation required of the Commissioner of Civil Service is merely
a check to assure compliance with the civil service laws."</p>

<p class="BODY">In this particular case, the eligibility of the other petitioners
as police captains is admitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was
duly set forth in the decision now on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>More than that, their being exceptionally well-qualified, was likewise
duly noted therein, a finding of fact binding on us as this appeal raises
purely questions of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
justification for the directive of respondent Commissioner is thus premised on
his alleged power to insist on a specific eligibility for each of the other
petitioners designated, that of "Inspector First Class (Police or
Detective Major)."</p>

<p class="BODY">In his brief, however, he can point to no express provision that
would confer on him such a power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
failure is under­standable because there is none.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the most, then, he would rely on a reading
of the Civil Service Act from which, mistakenly to our mind, he would infer
such authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to his
brief:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Said authority to fix
appropriate eligibilities being corollary to respondent's 'exclusive
jurisdiction over the approval under the Civil Service Law and rules of all appointments
including pro­motions to positions in the competitive service' and/or being an
implied power, there is therefore no need for an express provision setting
forth in black and white what eligibilities are appropriate for what
positions."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is thus an admission from respondent Commissioner himself
that his power is necessarily limited.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He would however, construe such a restricted authority expansively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would rely on an ambiguity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be a stultification of well-settled
principles of public law if from the vagueness of a statute compe­tence to act
could be predicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If such a purpose
were within the contemplation of Congress, an appropriate form of words could
have been utilized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The absence of such
language negates its existence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Commissioner would seek support for such un­tenable
view by asserting that under certain provisions of the Act,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
he is empowered to issue rules and regulations as well as to promulgate
standards, policies and guidelines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
is to rely on a frail reed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To do so is
to offend against the primacy that should be accorded a statute as contrasted
with decrees coming from the Executive Department, necessarily of lower
category.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is worse, the rules in
question are not issued by the President, but by one of his subordinates; their
binding force then is not as great.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much
less could they supersede applicable statutes, not only in what they command
but also in what they omit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not
admit of doubt that in the hierarchy of legal norms, such rules and standards
definitely occupy an inferior status.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
the statute is silent as to the existence of power, there the matter rests.</p>

<p class="BODY">Only Congress can remedy the situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not for respondent Commissioner to do
so on the flimsy allegation that he possesses authority to promulgate rules and
standards dealing specifically with the supervision, the preparation and rating
of all civil service examinations,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
the making of in­vestigation and special reports upon all matters relating to
the enforcement of the civil service law,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
the authority to pass upon all removal, separation and suspension of permanent
officers and employees in the competitive and classified service,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
and the determination of appeals instituted by any person believing himself to
be aggrieved -<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
a power which does not have the remotest connection with an exercise by peti­tioner
City Mayor of a competence exclusively lodged in him to designate the other
petitioners as precinct commanders.</p>

<p class="BODY">This conclusion has reinforcement from authoritative
pronouncements that of late have come from us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, from a 1968 decision:<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
"It would seem fairly obvious then that the law does not impose a rigid or
mechanistic formula on the appointing power, compliance with which is
inexorable and a deviation <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> fatal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Far from it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If there be adherence to the concept that public office is a public
trust, as there ought to be, the criterion should be what public welfare
demands, what satisfies public interest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For it is axiomatic that public needs could best be attended to by
officials, about whose compe­tency and ability there is no question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To that overmastering requirement, personal
ambition must of necessity yield.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dis­cretion
if not plenary, at least sufficient, should thus be granted to those entrusted
with the responsibility of administering the officers concerned, primarily the
department heads.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are in the most
favorable position to determine who can best fulfill the functions of the
office thus vacated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unless, therefore,
the law speaks in the most mandatory and peremptory tone, consider­ing all the
circumstances, there should be, as there has been, full recognition of the wide
scope of such discretionary authority.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Happily, there is nothing in the Civil Service Act, which is fittingly
concerned with protecting the rights of those in the career service, that,
rightly construed, calls for a different conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well worth repeating that the broad
authority of a department head appears indisputable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such is the policy of the law, a policy
reflected with fidelity in the decisions of this Court."</p>

<p class="BODY">Also, from Pineda v. Claudio,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
decided even more recently, the opinion coming from Justice Castro:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"For it is not enough that an aspirant
is qualified and eligible or that he is next in rank or line for promotion,
albeit by passive prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
just as necessary, in order for public administration to be dynamic and
responsive to the needs of the times, that the local executive be allowed the
choice of men of his confidence, provided they are qualified and eligible, who
in his best estimation are possessed of the requisite reputation, integrity,
knowledge ability, energy and judgment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After all, it is the local executive, more than anyone else, who is
primarily responsible for efficient governmental administration in the locality
and the effective maintenance of peace and order therein, and is directly
answerable to the people who elected him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nowhere is this more true than in the sensitive area of police
administration."</p>

<p class="BODY">While the two above cases are not squarely in point, still the
principle therein announced as to the respect to be accorded to the exercise of
the authority to appoint by the official entrusted by law to do so and the
minimum interference allowed the Com­missioner of Civil Service under his power
to inquire into the eligibility of the appointee lends further support to the
conclusion arrived at.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would appear
clear, therefore, that respondent Commissioner does not possess any statutory
authority to inter­fere with the power of <st1:place><st1:placename>petitioner</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> Mayor to make the designation
of the other petitioners.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Commissioner,
in his answer to the petition assailing his directive, would lend plausibility
to his claim that he was legally empowered to do so by this argument:
"Further­more, said assignments are not in conformity with the recom­mendation
of the U. S. Agency for International Development to assign and shift MPD
personnel to positions to which they have qualified in appropriate
examinations."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
To state such a contention is to reject it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a foundation for the challenged directive it is, to put it mildly,
far from stable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As an asserted basis to
justify what respondent did, it is far from persuasive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To put it bluntly, as a source of power, its
value is nil.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would not be easy to
imagine a plea more offensive to our sovereignty and derogatory to our dignity
as an independent nation.</p>

<p class="BODY">All governmental powers are lodged in officials of our government
both national and local.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An alien agency
at the most may be permitted to serve in an advisory capacity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can suggest, but it cannot command.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its wishes do not constitute law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our officials, therefore, are not bound to
obey.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it were otherwise, then a
posture of <span class="SpellE">subserviency</span> and mendicancy would be
sanctioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That this Court cannot
allow.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the answer of
respondent Commissioner, there was an implication that his directive finds
support in the consti­tutional provision on the Civil Service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More specifically, he did point to the requirement
that appointments in the civil service "shall be made only according to
merit and fitness, to be determined as far as practicable by competitive exami­nation."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Apparently, he had a change of mind subsequently as to such constitutional
prop, for his brief was conspicuously silent in that respect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That sober second thought had much to
recommend it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No such support is yielded
by the above consti­tutional provision to his assertion of authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Constitution on the civil service has only four brief
sections, two of which, prohibiting partisan political activities and
additional or double compensation, have clearly no relevance.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
The fourth section guarantees security of tenure, again without any bearing on
the present litigation.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
It is only the first section then, referred to above, that may conceivably
touch upon the issue involved, although in a rather remote way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it is more the expression of an ideal
than a source of authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Note that in
stressing merit and fitness, it recognized that it should "be determined
as far as practicable by competitive examination."</p>

<p class="BODY">There was no creation of a Civil Service Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No such official as a Civil Service
Commissioner was provided for.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent's position is a statutory creation, the extent of his powers
being thus limited and circumscribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
would thus be futile on his part to trace the existence of an alleged authority
to the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a matter of fact, if there are constitutional overtones to
this litigation, petitioners, not the respondents, are the beneficiaries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As they did correctly point out, not even the
President is vested with the power of control over local officials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He exercises only "general supervision *
* * as may be provided by law, * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent Civil Service Commissioner cannot be deemed then to be possessed of
a greater prerogative, being himself an official of a lower cate­gory in the
executive branch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, what the
Constitution enjoins on the President as well as all those entrusted with
executive functions is to "take care that the laws be faithfully
executed."<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
Certainly, it is a manifestation of less than fealty to such a duty if an
executive official like respondent would enforce a statutory provision not as
written but as ex­panded and enlarged by him through a process of strained
construction.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One last word.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing is better settled in the law than
that a public official exercises power not rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The government itself is merely an agency
through which the will of the state is expressed and enforced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its officers therefore are likewise agents
entrusted with the responsibility of dis­charging its functions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such there is no presumption that they are
empowered to act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There must be a
delegation of such authority, either express or implied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of a valid grant, they are
devoid of power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What they do suffers
from a fatal infirmity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That principle
cannot be sufficiently stressed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
appropriate language of Chief Justice Hughes: "It must be conceded that
departmental zeal may not be permitted to outrun the authority conferred by
statute."<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
Neither the high dignity of the office nor the righteousness of the motive then
is an acceptable substitute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise
the rule of law becomes a myth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an
eventuality, we must take all pains to avoid.</p>
