				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The basic legal question that has to be resolved in this appeal
by the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
from a lower court decision is whether or not the constitutional right against
being twice put in jeopardy<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
may be relied upon, it being shown that defendants had been proceeded against
in a pre­vious case, which was provisionally dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its invocation did suffice to call for an
adverse decision in a state action for forfeiture under Republic Act No. 1379,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
the first of the basic statutes intended to minimize, if not to put an end to,
the incidence of graft and corruption in the public service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a law, according to this Court, is criminal
or penal in character.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
While the bar against double jeopardy may therefore be invoked by a defendant,
still the lower court, as will be shown, was not sufficiently mindful of
authoritative precedents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result,
its decision is vitiated by an infirmity that calls for its reversal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint by the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
against the principal defendant, <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Agoncillo</span>, an official of the Bureau of Customs, was filed
on <st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="10">October 18, 1962</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
There was a detailed account of his total cash receipts from 1950 to 1959 and
of his disbursements during such period as well as of the properties allegedly
unlawfully acquired during such incumbency, with the ownership thereof
concealed by being recorded not only in the name of his wife but likewise of
the other defendants, his sons, <span class="SpellE">Waldemar</span> and <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Agoncillo</span>, Jr.; his
sister-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Teofista</span> <span class="SpellE">Quizon</span>;
his sister, Rosario <span class="SpellE">Agoncillo</span>; and her spouse, his
brother-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Graciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Calicdan</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The prayer was for "a writ command­ing defendants to show cause why the
above described properties, presumed <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> under Republic
Act No. 1379 to have been unlawfully acquired by defendant <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span>
M. <span class="SpellE">Agoncillo</span> as a public officer, should not be
declared property of the State; and after due proceedings, to render judgment
declaring said properties valued in the amount of P130,018.08 was un­lawfully
acquired but concealed in the names of his co-defendants, and which they may
not be able to explain as having been lawfully acquired by them, forfeited in
favor of the State; and by virtue thereof, to adjudge that said properties
shall belong to the State."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants duly filed their respective answers, denying the
unlawful acquisition of the aforesaid properties, the main special defense
being the unconstitutionality of Republic Act No. 1379 as an <u>ex</u> <u>post</u>
<u>facto</u> law and a bill of attainder.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, on March 4, 1963, defendants <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Agoncillo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lorenza</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Agoncillo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Agoncillo</span>, Jr. and <span class="SpellE">Waldemar</span> <span class="SpellE">Agoncillo</span> filed a manifestation of this tenor:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"1. That on December 10, 1962, the
above-named defendants filed an Answer in the above-entitled case; 2. That the
Answer filed by said defendants alleged grounds for a Motion to Dismiss; 3.
That in addition to the ground therein stated the following is further alleged;
(a) That the defendants are in danger of being put in jeopardy for the same
offense by reason of the <span class="SpellE">refiling</span> of the instant
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court has made a
ruling on the fact that R. A. No. 1379 is a penal law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, therefore, all the rights pertaining
to an accused in a criminal case are available to defendants charged under said
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, the defendants
will be placed in jeopardy for the same offense in that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) Civil Case No. 52002 is the same as Civil
Case No. 44686 which was dismissed pre­viously; (2) The defendants had already
pleaded in the original case in the form of an Answer; (3) That the case was
dismissed after the plaintiff failed to present evidence on the date of trial
which is considered as an adjudication on the merits."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was on the basis of the above manifestation that the decision
of the lower court of September 30, 1966, dismissing the case, was
predicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It stated that defendants
having been previously charged with a violation of Republic Act No. 1379, which
was held penal in character under a valid complaint filed with a court of
competent jurisdiction to which they had thereafter pleaded, with such case
having been dismissed without their express consent, the plea of double
jeopardy would lie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court then
felt it had "no other alterna­tive but to dismiss the instant case, the
same having been barred by the dismissal of Civil Case No. 44686."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
From this decision, the Republic, as noted, appealed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Unfortunately such a decision failed to take into account that
the complaint alleged that the 1960 previous action for forfeiture, docketed as
Civil Case No. 44686 of the Court of First Instance, Manila, was
"dismissed without prejudice * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Such an allegation was expressly admitted in the answer of defendant <span class="SpellE">Teofista</span> <span class="SpellE">Quizon</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
and of defendants <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Agoncillo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Lorenza</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Agoncillo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Agoncillo</span>, Jr., and <span class="SpellE">Waldemar</span> <span class="SpellE">Agoncillo</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
It appeared that in the previous case, the lower court judge taking note that
the Solicitor entrusted with the prosecution needed additional time for a more
thorough study of the case took such a step, the parties thus being chargeable
with knowledge that a new action could thereafter be filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such dismissal, being without prejudice, the
lower court in the present suit instituted after­wards ought not to have
sustained the claim of twice being put in jeopardy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could not have been the basis of a
favorable judgment for defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
must, as mentioned, reverse the appealed decision.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court adheres to its
pronouncement in Cabal v. <span class="SpellE">Kapunan</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Speaking through the then Associate, now Chief Justice, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>,
it was categorically held:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"As a
consequence, proceedings for forfeiture of property are deemed criminal or
penal, and, hence, the exemption of defendants in criminal case from the
obligation to be witnesses against themselves are applicable thereto."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor can there be any
difference of view as to the significance to be attached to the jeopardy clause
of the Constitution on which insistence is laid by defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The assumption is that after a trial, the
accused is either found guilty or freed of the criminal charge against
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the former, he should expiate
for his offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the latter, the law
leaves him alone to enjoy the liberty that is his by right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its solicitude for the welfare of every
human being, there is the further protection that this constitutional provision
affords.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is safeguarded from the risk
entailed by a new prosecution upon his being acquitted or convicted to follow
the express language of the Constitution or upon the case against him being
terminated in any other manner without his consent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus he is spared from the anguish and
anxiety as well as the expense unavoidable in any new indictment for that
offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The constitutional mandate is
thus a rule of finality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A single
prosecution for any offense is all the law allows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It protects an accused from harassment,
enables him to treat what had transpired as a closed chapter in his life,
either to exult in his freedom or to be resigned to whatever penalty is
imposed, and is a bar to unnecessary litigation, in itself time-consuming and
expense-producing for the state as well.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It has been referred to as "<span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span> dressed in prison grey."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
The ordeal of a criminal prosecution is inflicted only once, not whenever it
pleases the state to do so.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the peril of being twice put in jeopardy of punishment for
the same offense that the Constitution guards against, not for the same act,
except where it is punishable by law or ordinance in which case, conviction or
acquittal under either bars another prosecution thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to when such is the case, the answer as
supplied by the then Chief Justice Moran speak­ing for the Supreme Court in <span class="SpellE">Melo</span> v. People.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The rule is that "not only [must] the second offense charged [be] exactly
the same as the one alleged in the first information, but also that the two
offenses are identical."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
He went on to state:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>''There is identity
between the two offenses when the evidence to support a conviction for one
offense would be sufficient to warrant a conviction for the other."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
So the "same-evidence" test requires.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That criterion has been restated and expanded in the Rules of Court with
the express mention of "any attempt to commit the same or frustration
thereof, or for any offense which necessarily includes or is necessarily
included in the offense charged in the former complaint or information."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, the reliance
by defendants, now <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, on this constitutional
right is misplaced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true jeopardy
had attached with a valid complaint having been filed in a court of competent
jurisdiction and defendants having been thereafter arraigned and pleaded.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
It had not terminated, though.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was
neither conviction nor acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
was thereafter a dismissal without prejudice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Defendants knew, or ought to have known, that the complaint could thus
be filed again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They could have
objected; they did not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had they stood
fast on what they conceived to be their rights as defendants, things might have
been different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Matters could have
definitely ended then and there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
jeopardy clause could have been there­after appropriately invoked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dismissal would have been unconditional
in character.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
That is not however how things developed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What transpired instead was a dismissal clearly without prejudice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the very least, defendants were in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">So it has been held repeatedly by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Jaca</span> v. Blanco,<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Justice <span class="SpellE">Ozaeta</span>, who penned the opinion, after setting
forth Sec. 9 of Rule 113, now Sec. 9 of Rule 117, stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"We hold that the dismissal contemplated
in the above-quoted section of the rule is a definite or unconditional dismissal
which terminates the case, and not a dismissal without prejudice as in the
present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of any
statutory provision to the contrary, we find no reason why the court may not,
in the interest of justice, dismiss a criminal case provisionally, i.e.,
without prejudice to rein­stating it before the order becomes final or to the
subsequent filing of a new information for the same offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the accused should deem such conditional
or provisional dismissal to be unjust and prejudicial to him because he has
been deprived of his right to a speedy trial, as for instance where the case
has dragged on for an unreason­ably long time without his fault, he could and
should object to such dismissal and insist that the case be heard and decided
on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon such objection and
insistence of the accused, if the prosecution does not present its evidence and
if its failure to do so is unjustified, the court should dismiss the case for
failure to prosecute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such dismissal
would come under the purview of section 9, Rule 113."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
Then came Co Te Hue v. <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
where this Court, through Justice Bautista Angelo, after referring to People v.
Romero,<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
declared:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"There is more weighty
reason to uphold the theory of reinstatement in the present case than in that
of Romero considering the particularity that the dismissal was provisional in
character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In our opinion that is not
the dismissal contemplated by the rule that has the effect of barring a
subsequent prosecution."<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, the authoritative pronouncement in the relatively
recent case of People v. <span class="SpellE">Obsania</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
with Justice Castro as <span class="SpellE"><u>ponente</u></span>, had made clear
beyond doubt that for a dismissal to be a bar under the jeopardy clause of the
Constitution, it must have the effect of an acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The appealed order of dismissal in this case now under
consideration did not terminate the action on the merits, whereas in <span class="SpellE"><u>Cloribel</u></span> and in the other related cases the
dismissal amounted to an acquittal because the failure to prosecute presupposed
that the Government did not have a case against the accused, who, in the first
place, is presumed innocent."<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

opinion of the Chief Justice reads:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"We are not unmindful of the doctrine laid down in <span class="SpellE">Almeda</span> <i>v</i>. Perez, L-18428 (August 30, 1962), in which
the theory that, after the filing of respondents' answer to a petition for
forfeiture under Republic Act No. 1379, said petition may not be amended as to
substance pursuant to our rules of criminal procedure, was rejected by this
Court upon the ground that said forfeiture proceeding is civil in nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This doctrine refers, however, to the purely <u>procedural</u>
aspect of said proceeding, and has no bearing on the substantial rights of the
respondents therein, particularly their constitutional right against
self-incrimination." <i>Ibid</i>, p. 1067.</p>

terminated without the express consent of the defendant, by a court of
competent juris­diction, upon a valid complaint or information or other formal
charge sufficient in form and substance to sustain a conviction, and after the
defendant had pleaded to the charge, the con­viction or acquittal of the
defendant or the dismissal of the case shall be a bar to another prosecution
for the offense charged, or for any attempt to commit the same or frustration
there­of, or for any offense which necessarily includes or is necessarily
included in the offense charged in the former complaint or information."</p>
