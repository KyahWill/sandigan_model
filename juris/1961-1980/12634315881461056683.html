alleging that he is sick of PTB and Rheumatism, that the date of accident was August 10, 1973, that he stopped working on August 16, 1973 and that he orally notified on <span style="font-style: italic;">August 10, 1973</span> his employer of the fact of his sickness (p. 59, WCC rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attached to, and made an integral part of, the claim for compensation was a physician's report dated July 28, 1974 with a diagnostic finding that claimant was suffering from PTB, far advanced;

that his failure to appear at the last two (2) scheduled hearings was excusable for the reason that he received the notice of hearing two (2) days after the scheduled date of hearing and he informed the clerk of the hearing officer of this fact; that the counsel of respondent employer was likewise not present at the last scheduled hearing; that all notwithstanding, the evidence already presented was sufficient to entitle claimant of an Award; and prayed therefore that the September 29, 1975 order of dismissal be set aside and that further hearing be held or that a decision be rendered on the basis of the evidence already presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same motion, he informed the hearing officer of the fact that claimant is already dead (p. 6, WCC rec.) without however stating the date and cause of death.<o:p></o:p></span></p> <p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1975</st1:date>, the hearing officer denied the aforesaid motion, but ordered the elevation of the entire records of the case to the respondent Commission for review.</p> <p class="BODY">Thereafter or on <st1:date year="1975" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1975</st1:date>, the respondent Commission, on the basis of the evidence on record, affirmed the order of dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It held:</p> <blockquote>"Records show that claimant was employed as Switchman with the Philippine National Railways who stopped working on <st1:date year="1973" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1973</st1:date> because he filed his retirement.</blockquote> <blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1973" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1973</st1:date>, he fell ill of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Testimony, November 27, 1974, p. 2), which necessitated his confinement at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Doña</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span></st1:placename>&nbsp;

</span>The findings of PTB far advanced one year after separation from the service could no longer have any bearing with claimant's employment" (p. 3, WCC rec.).</blockquote> <p class="BODY"><span style="">Hence, this petition, which <span class="GramE">We</span> subsequently treated as a special civil action.<o:p></o:p></span></p> <p class="BODY">With the submission by the parties of their respective memoranda, the case was considered submitted for decision.</p> <p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;

The claim of the petitioner that her deceased husband was deprived of due process by the respondent Commission's hearing officer is meritorious.</p> <p class="BODY">The <st1:date year="1975" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1975</st1:date> order of dismissal of the hearing officer which charged claimant and his counsel of "repeated non-appearance" was precipitated by their failure to appear in the scheduled hearings of <st1:date style="font-style: italic;" year="1975" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1975</st1:date><span style="font-style: italic;">, </span><st1:date style="font-style: italic;" year="1975" day="20" month="8">August 20, 1975</st1:date><span style="font-style: italic;"> and </span><st1:date style="font-style: italic;" year="1975" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1975</st1:date><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span><u><o:p></o:p></u></p> <p class="BODY">In his <st1:date year="1975" day="16" month="10">October 16, 1975</st1:date> motion for reconsideration, counsel for claimant contended that his failure to appear at the aforesaid scheduled <st1:date year="1975" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1975</st1:date> hearing was excusable; because he received the notice of hearing by ordinary mail two (2) days after the scheduled date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite this explanation of counsel for claimant, the factual allegations of which were not disputed by the respondent employer which was furnished a copy of the motion, the hearing officer refused to reconsider its order of dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the WCC record does not show that indeed counsel for claimant received notice of hearing prior to the aforesaid scheduled date of hearing.</p> <p class="BODY">With respect to the <st1:date year="1975" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1975</st1:date> scheduled hearing, the claim of claimant's counsel that he was not notified thereof is not disputed; nor do the records show that he was ever furnished a notice thereof.</p> <p class="BODY">Relative to the August 20, 1975 scheduled hearing, the counsel for claimant was not again notified of the same; although his client, claimant Andres Bautista, was sent a notice; the same was received by his representative only on August 25, 1975, or five (5) days after the scheduled hearing, at which date Andres Bautista had already died (see p. 47, WCC rec.).</p> <p class="BODY"><span style="">In the light of the foregoing facts, <span class="GramE">We</span> rule that the respondent Commission gravely abused its discretion </span><span style="">in ignoring and in not passing upon the issue of denial of due process squarely presented by claimant's counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The very rules of the Commission require the giving of <span style="font-style: italic;">reasonable notice</span> of hearing to each party interested by service upon him personally or by registered mail of a copy thereof at his last known </span>post office address or if he is represented by a counsel, through the latter (Sec. 2, Rule 15, Revised Rules of the WCC, 1973), so as to ensure observance and protection of an interested party's right to a hearing (Sec. 1, Rule 15, Revised Rules of the WCC).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Patent therefore is the failure of the hearing officer to observe these rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, claimant was clearly deprived of his day in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the dismissal of the claim premised on claimant and his counsel's "repeated non-appearance" at the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> hearings cannot stand.</p> <p class="NUM">2. In passing, We noted that the hearing officer tilted his discretion in favor of the employer and to the prejudice of the laborer, the late claimant Andres Bautista, as demonstrated by his obdurate handling of claimant's excusable non-appearances at scheduled hearings, on one hand, and his mild treatment of respondent employer's repeated failure to appear at scheduled hearings and its motions for postponement, on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records clearly show that while respondent had asked for and was granted at least five (5) postponements; claimant, on the other hand, only moved for postponement once and that was even on a joint motion with respondent employer (pp. 16, 20, 21, 27, 28, 31, 44, 52, 53 &amp; 54, WCC rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This posture of the hearing officer unabated by the respondent Commission is a foul blow to the social justice clause of the Constitution and its injunction for the State to afford protection to labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed We have repeatedly reminded agencies of the government, especially labor agencies, that they are under obligation at all times to give meaning and substance to these constitutional guarantees in favor of the working man; for otherwise these constitutional safeguards would be merely a lot of "meaningless pattern."</p> <p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">II</span><u><o:p></o:p></u></p> <p class="NUM">1. The foregoing notwithstanding, it is the contention of the petitioner that the evidence on record is already sufficient as a basis for the rendition of a decision on the merits; and prays that the claim be now resolved on the basis thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances obtaining in this case, <span class="GramE">We</span> agree with petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>WE have previously ruled that on the basis of the pleadings before <span class="GramE">Us</span>, despite a technical or procedural lapse in the hearing below, We can decide a compensation claim and terminate the matter here and now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>WE reasoned out that, the law being in claimant's favor, humane reasons aimed at promoting justice and the general welfare of the workingman, justify the rendition of a decision on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The niceties and refinements of technical rules on procedure must give way to <span class="GramE">effect</span> substantial justice to the claimant (<span class="SpellE">Justo</span> vs. WCC, 75 SCRA 220, 222 [1978]).</p> <p class="NUM">2. The records of the case show that claimant Andres Bautista was employed by respondent employer since 1945 (p. 47, WCC rec.); and on August 10, 1973, or after 28 years, more or less, he was found ill of tuberculosis, by reason of which he was forced to stop working even before the compulsory age of retirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> Lopez, who submitted the supporting Physician's Report, diagnosed claimant's illness as PTB, Far Advanced; and further opined that claimant's illness of PTB was the result of the nature of his employment (p. 61, WCC rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Lopez testified at the hearing that when admitted to the hospital, claimant was semi-conscious, pale, with frequent cough and very weak and that his (Dr. Lopez) clinical impression during admission was PTB, and affirmed his statement in the Physician's Report that the nature of claimant's work caused his sickness (pp. 38-43, WCC rec.).</p> <p class="BODY">Claimant Andres Bautista testified that before his employment with the respondent employer, he was stout and healthy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The nature of his work was rigorous and the place of his work was dusty and he was constantly exposed to the elements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His duties include the loading and unloading of cargoes, operating the railroad switch, and cleaning the premises of the PNR station at <span class="SpellE">Aringay</span>, <span style="">La Union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His time schedule was from </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="14"><span style="">2:00</span></st1:time><span style=""> in the afternoon to </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="10"><span style="">10:00</span></st1:time><span style=""> in the evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first time he became sick, he consulted Dr. Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Ordoña</span>, the company physician; he notified his employer of this fact; he was confined at </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Doña</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Gregoria</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placename><span style="">Memorial</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">Hospital</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> and x-rayed by Dr. Lopez and was found suffering from PTB (pp. 47-50, WCC rec.).<o:p></o:p></span></p> <p class="BODY">The above undisputed evidence on record clearly warrants the conclusion of claimant's attending physician <span style="">that </span>his illness of tuberculosis was the result of the nature of his employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Section 2 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended, tuberculosis directly caused by employment, or either aggravated by or the result of the nature of said employment, is compensable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In numerous cases involving similar and/or substantially similar nature of work as well as conditions or circumstances of work as that of the claimant Andres Bautista, We ruled that tuberculosis is an occupational disease; hence compensable (<span class="SpellE">Justo</span> vs. WCC, 75 SCRA 220, 225 [1978]; National Development Company vs. WCC, 19 SCRA 861 [1967]; <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span> (Phil.) Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Serpo</span> &amp; WCC, 16 SCRA 77 [1966]; Manila Railroad Company vs. Perez &amp; WCC, 14 SCRA 504 [1965]; Manila Railroad Company vs. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Chavez, 120 Phil. 944, 12 SCRA 142 [1964]; <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> Transportation Company vs. Perez, 120 Phil. 767, 11 SCRA 793 [1964]; <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> vs. WCC &amp; <span class="SpellE">Gatdula</span>, 118 Phil. 358, 8 SCRA 352 [1963]; Manila Railroad Company vs. <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>, 109 Phil. 716 [1960]).</p> <p class="NUM">3. Fortifying the aforesaid conclusion of work-connection, is the well-recognized presumption of compensability, very well applicable to this case as it is undisputed that claimant's illness of tuberculosis supervened in the course of his employment -- on or before <span style="font-style: italic;">August 10, 1973</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, claimant's illness of tuberculosis is presumed compensable; and the employer assumed by force thereof the burden of showing the contrary by substantial evidence (<span class="SpellE">Abordo</span> vs. WCC &amp; PNR, L-43073, July 31, 1978; <span class="SpellE">Cañonero</span> vs. WCC, 3 PHILAJUR 236, 81 SCRA 712 [1978]; Gonzales vs. WCC, 3<span style=""> PHILAJUR 229, 81 SCRA 703 [1978]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent employer failed to discharge this burden even at this late stage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> presumption became conclusive (<span class="SpellE">Cañonero</span> vs. WCC, <u>supra</u>).<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p> <p class="NUM">4. The conclusion of the respondent Commission that "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> since claimant has already applied for retirement on August 16, 1973 and stopped working on said date, the subsequent contraction of his PTB illness on September 1, 1973 could not be attributable to his employment x <span class="SpellE">x</span>" because "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> (t<span class="GramE">)he</span> findings of PTB far advanced one year after separation from the service could not longer have any bearing with claimant's employment" is erroneous and unrealistic.</p> <p class="BODY"><span style="">Firstly, claimant's illness was discovered on August 10, 1973 (Notice of Claim or Sickness and Claim for Compensation, p. 50, WCC rec.) although claimant </span>erroneously testified in the hearing that he first got of sick of PTB on September 1, 1973 (p. 48, WCC rec.); secondly, even on the assumption that indeed, claimant's illness was discovered only on September 1, 1973 and that claimant permanently ceased working on August 16, 1973, it does not mean that claimant instantly acquired his illness of tuberculosis only on September 1, 1973 -- barely 15 days from August 16, 1973; not one year as mistakenly computed by the respondent Commission; for as We rationalized in the case of Lorenzo vs. WCC (81 SCRA 440, 441 [1978]),</p> <blockquote>"xx x By the very nature of tuberculosis, petitioner could not have suddenly and instantaneously contracted such illness during the three-day period from October 4, 1974, when the respondent company stopped its operation, to October 7, 1974, when the examination were conducted on petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tuberculosis is not an instantaneous disease; it is an imperceptible disease caused by a germ which is breathed in and feeds on the lungs or taken with food.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is medically accepted that exposure to dust and dirt is a predisposing cause of tuberculosis and tends to produce fibrosis of the lungs which weakens resistance to any latent tuberculosis infection and reactivates that infection (<span class="SpellE">Justo</span> vs. WCC, 75 SCRA 224-225 [1976]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on this specific point, the case of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Valencia</st1:place></st1:country-region> vs. WCC (72 SCRA 245 [1976]) is strikingly similar to the present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that <span style="">case, </span>claimant 'showed or established that after she stopped working on July 31, 1971, she was treated by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Evangelina</span> Gonzales from <span style="font-style: italic;">August 3, 1971</span> up to <span style="font-style: italic;">February 15, 1972</span> as per medical certificate issued to her dated January 17, 1972, and according to the physician's report, it was clearly shown that she was sick of "minimal pulmonary tuberculosis" x x.' And the Court therein ruled and pointed out that:</blockquote> <blockquote><span style="">“‘</span>x x <span class="SpellE">x</span> It is clear therefore that when Dr. Gonzales examined petitioner herein on <span style="font-style: italic;">August 3, 1971</span>, just three days after she stopped working, she was already found suffering from tuberculosis although in its minimal stage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, petitioner's ailment could not just have appeared simply on the third day of her separation.</blockquote> <blockquote>"'Tuberculosis is a chronic infection caused in humans by bacteria and initiated almost always by inhalation of infectious bacteria.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Medical authorities are agreed that the <u>incubation period </u>of tuberculosis is from <u>two (2) to ten (10) weeks</u> from the time of infection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tuberculosis in its minimal stage indicates a slight lesion without demonstrable <span class="SpellE">cavitation</span> confined to a small area of one or both lungs, the total extent of which does not exceed the equivalent of the volume of the lung tissue which lies above the 2nd <span class="SpellE">chondrosternal</span> junctions and the spine of the 4th or body of the 5th thoracic vertebra on one side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated in <span style="font-style: italic;" class="SpellE">Batangas</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> Transportation Co. vs. Perez &amp; WCC</span>, L-19522, <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1964</st1:date>, tuberculosis is not an instantaneous disease, it is an imperceptible germ disease that feeds on the lungs whose presence in the body cannot be easily discerned and its incipient stage may not be readily discovered.’"</blockquote> <p class="BODY"><span style="">Lastly, it must be clarified that although claimant Andres Bautista on August 16, 1973 applied for retirement on the ground of disability and stopped working on that date, he apparently resumed working when his retirement application was not acted upon and thereafter again filed and/or reiterated his application for retirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These account for his conflicting claims as to the exact date when he filed his application for retirement and stopped working for respondent employer (pp. 33-37, 47, 50, 59, WCC rec.; p. 1, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, those conflicting dates cannot prejudice this compensation claim as it is clear that claimant's illness supervened in the course of employment and his disability took place before the compulsory age of retirement.<o:p></o:p></span></p> <p class="NUM">4. The absence of an x-ray report cannot prejudice claimant's right to compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For We have already ruled that an x-ray report/result is not an indispensable prerequisite to compensation (Romero vs. WCC, 77 SCRA 483, 488 [1977]); and that said x-ray finding need not be attached to the Physician's Report, because it can be logically inferred from the said report that a previous x-ray examination was made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the physician could not have arrived at his diagnosis (<span class="SpellE">Landayan</span> vs. WCC, 77 SCRA 305-307 [1978]).</p> <p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: center; font-style: italic;">III</p> <p class="BODY">The claim of petitioner that there was no effective <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> of his right to compensation is likewise meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent employer had knowledge of claimant's illness as early as <st1:date style="font-style: italic;" year="1973" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1973</st1:date> or even earlier as claimant consulted respondent's employer physician the first time he was sick.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding its knowledge, respondent employer did not comply with Section 37 of the Act, as amended, (in relation to Section 45 thereof) which requires it to submit a report of accident or sickness within 14 days from disability or 10 days from knowledge thereof. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Hence, the report it submitted on <st1:date style="font-style: italic;" year="1974" day="11" month="9">September 11, 1974</st1:date><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>was too late (see pp. 56-59, WCC rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">By failing to comply with Section 37 in relation to Section 45 of the Act, as amended, respondent employer lost its right to controvert the claim.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the claim was <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All defenses available to respondent employer were thus barred.</p> <p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: center; font-style: italic;">IV</p> <p class="BODY"><span style="">The claim filed in this instant case was one for <span style="font-style: italic;">disability compensation</span><span style="font-style: italic;">;</span> but claimant died allegedly by reason of PTB (Memorandum for Petitioner, p. 30, rec.) </span>during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the claim in the Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records do not however show that the claim was ever amended so as to include a claim for death benefits; neither the exact date of the death of claimant Andres Bautista.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, <span class="GramE">We</span> limit the award to disability benefits; and under the obtaining circumstances We feel that petitioner who is the surviving spouse of claimant should be given the maximum amount allowed by law.</p> <p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, THE DECISION OF THE RESPONDENT COMMISSION IS HEREBY SET ASIDE AND RESPONDENT EMPLOYER IS HEREBY ORDERED</p> <blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>TO PAY PETITIONER THE SUM OF SIX THOUSAND (P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>) PESOS AS DISABILITY BENEFITS;</blockquote> <blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>TO REIMBURSE TO PETITIONER THE MEDICAL AND HOSPITAL EXPENSES OF THE LATE CLAIMANT, DULY SUPPORTED BY RECEIPTS;</blockquote> <blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>TO PAY COUNSEL OF PETITIONER ATTORNEY'S FEES EQUIVALENT TO 10% OF THE RECOVERABLE AMOUNT; AND</blockquote> <blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>TO PAY ADMINISTRATIVE FEES.</blockquote> <p style="font-weight: bold;" class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p> <span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>, (Chairman), Fernandez, Guerrero, De Castro,<span style="font-style: normal;"> and </span><span class="SpellE">Melencio</span>-Herrera, <span class="GramE">JJ.,</span><span style="font-style: normal;"> concur.<o:p></o:p></span></span><br> </div>
