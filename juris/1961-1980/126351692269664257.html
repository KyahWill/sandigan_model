<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="28" month="3">March 28, 1969</st1:date>,
upon motion of petitioner, <span class="GramE">We</span> issued a resolution
allowing the inclusion, as respondent, of District Judge Santiago O. <span class="SpellE">Tañada</span>, and restraining both res­pondent judges from taking
action in, or cognizance of Cri­minal Case No. V-10839 entitled "People of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Dakay</span>", and particularly from acting
on the motion for dismissal filed by the respondent City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Stripped of unnecessary details, the antecedent facts are the
following:</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 18, 1966, by Administrative Order No. 5 of the
Department of Justice, senior state prosecutor Vicente G. <span class="SpellE">Ericta</span>
was designated <u>to assist</u> the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
and the Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> city in the investigation and
prosecution of all cases involving the violation of the National Internal
Revenue Code and Tariff and Customs Code and of <span style="">all </span>such other crimes committed in
relation thereto and which may be penalized by the Revised Penal Code or by any
special law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the 27th of the sane
month he filed in the Court of First Instance of said province <span class="GramE">an information</span> against Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Dakay</span>
(Criminal Case No. <span class="GramE">V-10839) for viola­tion of Section 355 in
relation to Section 336 of the Internal Revenue Code.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This information was superseded by an amended
pleading charging the same offense filed three days later.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 1, 1966, <span class="SpellE">Dakay</span> filed a
motion to quash the information alleging firstly, that Prosecutor <span class="SpellE">Ericta</span> had no authority to conduct the preliminary
investigation of the case and to file the corresponding information against
him; secondly, that he was denied the right to <span style="">a </span>preliminary in­vestigation and, lastly, that the information
was void be­cause it charged more than one offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After hearing both parties, the court, on <st1:date year="1966" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1966</st1:date>, denied the motion but
at the same time ordered that the case be reinvestigated to give the defendant
an opportunity to be heard, cross-examine the prosecution witnesses and to
present evidence in his favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the
motions for the reconsideration of this order filed by both parties were denied
by the court, then presided by the Hon. Guillermo P. <span class="SpellE">Villasor</span>,
on <st1:date year="1966" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1966</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Dakay</span> brought up the <span style="">case
</span>to <span class="GramE">Us</span> by way of appeal (G.R. L­26380), but We <span style="">dismissed </span>the appeal on December 1 of
the same year.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter <span class="SpellE">Dakay</span>, thru counsel,
addressed a letter to the Fiscal of the city of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city> requesting him to conduct the
preliminary investigation of Criminal Case V-10839 as ordered by Judge <span class="SpellE">Villasor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that on May 24, 1966, the Secretary of Justice, thru
the then Undersecretary, issued Administrative Order No. 154 designating <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>, at the time
second Assistant Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>, to assist
the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> and the Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> city in the prosecution of all cases mentioned in the
previous administrative order designating Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Ericta</span>
for the same purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Salcedo's</span> designation thus superseded that of the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After the dismissal of <span class="SpellE">Dakay’s</span> appeal by </span><span style="">Us, </span><span style="">Special Counsel <span class="SpellE">Llenos</span> set the case against the former for
reinvestigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>When Prosecutor <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> appeared thereat and claimed authority to handle
the prosecution, his right to do so was contested by City Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Amadora</span> and special counsels <span class="SpellE">Llenos</span>
and Salazar, who claimed that <span class="SpellE">Salcedo's</span> only
authority in the premises was to <u>assist</u> them in the presentation of
evidence against the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact,
on <st1:date year="1967" day="2" month="5">May 2, 1967</st1:date>, special
counsel Salazar had issued a subpoena <span class="SpellE">duces</span> <span class="SpellE">tecum</span>, requiring him to produce all the evidence pre­sented
during the previous investigation conducted by state prosecutor <span class="SpellE">Ericta</span> on May 17-18 of the same year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Result of this controversy was an agreement
between the parties that the City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
would move the court to clarify the order for the reinvestigation of the case
and rule squarely on <span style="">who </span>should
make such reinvestigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The City
Fiscal having done so, the court, thru Judge <span class="SpellE">Villasor</span>,
is­sued the following order:</p>

<blockquote>"Considering the provision of Section 39 of the Revised City
Charter of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> (Republic Act No. 3857) that 'the
fiscal of the City shall cause to be investigated all charges of crimes,' as
well as the pertinent administra­tive order designating a State Prosecutor to
'assist the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Province and
the City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City' in this case, it is
believed that action on the motion filed by the City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> dated <span style="">May </span>18,
1967 is unnecessary for the reason that both pro­secutors, in the conduct of
the reinvestigation as ordered by this Court, shall have to comply with the
tenor of the above mentioned laws."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As the above order did not seem to decide the issue clearly,
Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>, thru the Chief Prosecutor, submit­ted
<span style="">a </span>memorandum
to the Department <span style="">of </span>Justice
suggesting that court action be taken against City Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Amadora</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Days and weeks thereafter elapsed apparently
without any action on the case, but suddenly Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>
received notice to the effect that Criminal Case No. V-10839 would be tried before
the Circuit Criminal Court of the 14th Judicial District of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
city on December 7, 9 and 10, 1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the first day, <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> appeared and asked that the
trial be postponed alleging that due to the suddenness of the notice he was not
prepared to go to trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was
granted only after the City Fiscal <span style="">of </span><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> - patently to serve a definite but undisclosed purpose
- submitted <span style="">a
</span>manifestation to the effect that the case had not passed through his
office; that no complaint had been filed with his office by the complainant for
the purpose of a preliminary investigation; that neither he nor anyone of his
assistants had signed or verified the information; that he did not have in his
possession the documentary evidence to prove the case nor did he have knowledge
of the nature of the case (Annex "P" attached to the petition).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was to be expected, invoking the <span style="">facts set </span>forth in the written
statement aforesaid, de­fendant <span class="SpellE">Dakay's</span> counsel filed
a motion for dismissal, which, however, was not decided forthwith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter the case was again called for
trial on <st1:date year="1969" day="15" month="1">January 15-17, 1969</st1:date>
on which occasion <span class="SpellE">Dakay's</span> counsel reiterated his
motion for dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same
occasion, however, Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> informed the Court
that, under a later administrative order, Secretary of Justice Juan Ponce <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span> had designated him anew to handle the investigation
and prosecution of the case of People vs. Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Dakay</span>,
(Criminal Case No. V-10839) and other related cases <u>independently of the
City Fiscal of </u><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><u>Cebu</u></span></st1:place><u>
city effective immediately and to continue until further orders</u> and that
this last administrative order superseded the other Numbered 259 of <st1:date year="1968" day="9" month="10">October 9, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statement to this effect appears not to
have been contested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon the
court, then presided by herein respondent Hon. Francisco Ro. <span class="SpellE">Cupin</span>, manifested that a resolution would be issued the
next day resolving the motion to dismiss filed by the defense, but instead of
one such resolution, he issued one (Annex "Q" attached to the
petition) in which he ordered that the case be reinvestigated by the City <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> office of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, as­sisted
by the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> pursuant to Admi­nistrative
Order <span style="">No. </span>336 dated December
26, 1968.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 22, 1969, after the office of the City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> and Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> had
apparently arrived at an understanding that the latter would only assist in the
reinvestigation of the case, respondent City Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Amadora</span>
filed a motion for the dismissal of the case (Annex "R" attached to
the petition), thereby concurring with the recommendation made by special
counsel Salazar of the city of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> in his report
dated January 21, 1969, concerning the reinvestigation of the case conducted by
him by designa­tion of the city fiscal of said city.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In relation to this motion to dismiss the
case, Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> was given time to submit a
written opposition - which pleading he filed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter the respondent judge issued on February 1, 1969 <span style="">an </span>order (Annex "U"
attached to the petition) approving the report submitted by the City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> covering the reinvestigation of the <span style="">case and, as a </span>consequence, dismissed
the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result the present
petition for certiorari and/or prohibition was filed on <st1:date year="1969" day="20" month="3">March 20, 1969</st1:date> mainly for <span style="">the </span>annulment of all the proceedings held before the respondent
Judge Francisco Ro. <span class="SpellE">Cupin</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1969" day="10" month="3"><span style="">March
 10, 1969</span></st1:date><span style=""> respondent
Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Dakay</span> filed a motion for the dismissal of the
present case upon the ground that Administrative Order No. 336 of </span><st1:date year="1968" day="28" month="12"><span style="">December
 28, 1968</span></st1:date><span style=""> issued by
the Secretary of Justice designating <span class="SpellE">Nar­ciso</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>, Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>,
to handle the investigation and prosecution of Criminal Case No. V-10839, among
others, independently of the City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
effective immediately and until further orders, had been cancelled and
superseded by Administrative Order No. 136 issued by the same Department Head
on </span><st1:date year="1969" day="8" month="4"><span style="">April 8, 1969</span></st1:date><span style="">,
expressly revoking Administrative Order No. 336.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1969" day="17" month="4"><span style="">April 17, 1969</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="GramE">We</span> required Fiscal
<span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> to comment within ten (10) days from notice
upon this motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On May 13
of the same year he submitted his comment saying, among other things, the
following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That he is not in a position to give an
intelligent comment on respondent <span class="SpellE">Dakay's</span> ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> motion to recall restraining order issued on <st1:date year="1969" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1969</st1:date>, because he has not
been furnished a copy of the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be
this as it may, it <span style="">is </span>respectfully submitted that the recall of the restraining
order, copy of which has not also been received by the undersigned, must be
based on the merits and not merely on the ground that the authority of the
undersigned to prosecute the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Dacay</span></span><span style=""> cases </span>has been revoked by
Administrative Order No. 136 dated April 8, 1969.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That by way of comment on the urgent motion to
dismiss the herein petition on the ground that the authority of the undersigned
to handle the <span class="SpellE">Dakay</span> cases has been revoked by
Administrative Order No. 136 dated April <span style="">8,
</span>1969, it <span style="">is </span>submitted that the said revocation of authority <span style="">is </span>not a
valid ground for dis­missal and that if ever the instant petition should be
dismissed, it should be dismissed on the merits and on valid grounds other than
mere revocation of the authority of the under­signed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That in view of the revocation of the
authority of the undersigned to handle the <span class="SpellE">Dakay</span>
cases by virtue of Administrative Order No. 136 dated April 8, 1969, the
undersigned <span style="">can only state by way of
final comment that during the existence of his authority to handle the <span class="SpellE">Dakay</span> cases, the undersigned handled the <span class="SpellE">Dakay</span> cases to the best of his limited ability in
accordance with the facts, the law, and jurisprudence applic­able, and in
accordance with the conscience of fair-minded men.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, inasmuch as the authority of the
undersigned has been re­voked, it is but prudent and just that the undersigned
should refrain from making any other comment, else the same might be
misunderstood as defiance of the authority and prerogative of the Secretary of
Justice in the exercise of his power to designate pro­secutors to handle cases
and to revoke such designation in accordance with what the Secretary believes
is right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To comment any further might
be misconstrued as questioning the wisdom and discretion of the Secretary of
Justice.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, with the submission of the herein comments, it <span style="">is </span>most respectfully prayed that the
undersigned be spared the painful duty of making any further comments."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The motion for dismissal
before Us could be resolved with a simple minute resolution granting or denying
it, but We have chosen instead to issue this extended resolution because of the
need to point out a situation - in our opinion anomalous and unedifying -
clearly disclosed by the facts of the case:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that of two groups of public prosecutors with different ideas about the </span><span style="">same case and </span><span style="">working at cross purposes in connection
therewith; on the one hand, special prosecutors designated by the Department of
Justice who, after due investigation, had found that there was a prima facie
case against Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Dakay</span> and, therefore, acted
accordingly, and on the other, the Office of the City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, at first persistently trying to limit the activities
of the special prosecutors to merely giving it assistance in the investigation
and prosecution of the case, and ul­timately arriving at its own conclusion
that there was no sufficient evidence to make out a prima facie case against <span class="SpellE">Dakay</span> and accordingly asking for the dismissal of the
criminal case filed against him - which the court granted in its order of
February 1, 1969.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">On
top of this, after Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> had been authorized
in the second to the <span style="">last
administrative order of the Department of Justice to continue the prosecution
of Criminal Case No.</span></span></span> V-10839 of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> against Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Dakay</span>,
independently of the City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, such
authority was suddenly withdrawn, thus in effect pulling the rug from under his
feet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not strange, therefore, that
he was noncommittal in his remarks in relation to <span class="SpellE">Dakay's</span>
motion to dismiss the present case precisely upon the ground that Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Salcedo's</span> authority to prosecute the criminal case against
him and, as a consequence, to pro­secute the present case, had been cancelled
by the Depart­ment of Justice.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The motion for dismissal,
if resolved on the merits, should be denied because the petitioner in the
present special civil action is the Republic of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> and not Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the latter <span class="GramE">who</span>
commenced it with the filing of the proper petition </span>is no <span style="">longer authorized to prosecute it, is not a
legal ground upon which to dismiss the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Solicitor General could, if he is so minded, go on with it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are, however, </span><span style="">constrained to order its dismissal because,
according to the </span>record, respondent Judge Francisco Ro. <span class="SpellE">Cupin</span>, in an order dated March 4, 1969, had held that under
the provisions of Republic Act No. 5179 creating the Circuit Cri­minal Courts,
the violation of the provisions of the In­ternal Revenue Code charged in
Criminal Case V-10839 does not come within the limited jurisdiction of the
court by him presided and, as a consequence, declared <span style="">"as </span>without any force and effect its order dated February
1, 1969 dismissing the case and hereby returns <span style="">the case to the Honor</span>able Executive Judge for raffle".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, in effect, set aside the proceedings
complained of - a circumstance that renders the present case moot and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">FOR THE REASONS ABOVE
STATED</span></b><span style="">, the present case is
dismissed, without costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
