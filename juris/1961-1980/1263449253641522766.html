				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The sole question in this appeal from a judgment of conviction by
the lower court is whether or not the appointment to and the holding of the
position of <span style="">a </span>secret agent to
the provincial governor would constitute a sufficient defense to <span style="">a </span>prosecution <span class="GramE">for</span>
the crime of illegal possession of firearm and ammunition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold that it does not.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused in this case was indicted for the above offense in an
information dated August 14, 1962 reading as follows: "The undersigned
accuses MARIO MAPA Y MA­PULONG of a violation of Section 878 in connection with
Section 2692 of the Revised Administrative Code, <span style="">as </span>amended <span style="">by </span>Commonwealth
Act No. 56 and as further amended by Republic Act No. 4, committed as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That on or about the 13th day
of August, 1962, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused did then
and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span> and unlawfully have in his
possession and under his custody and control one home-made revolver (<span class="SpellE">Paltik</span>), Cal. 22, without serial number, with six (6)
rounds of ammunition, without first having secured the necessary license or
permit <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> from the corresponding
authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Contrary
to law."</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">When the case was called
for hearing on September 3, 1963, the lower court at the outset asked the
counsel for the accused: "May counsel stipulate that the accused was found
in possession of the gun involved in this case, that he </span><span style="">has </span><span style="">neither a permit or license to possess the same and that </span><span style="">we </span><span style="">can submit </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">same on a question of law whether or not an
agent of the governor can hold a firearm without </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">permit issued by the Philippine Constabulary." After counsel
sought from the fiscal an assurance that he would not question the authenticity
of his exhibits, the understanding being that only a question of </span><span style="">law </span><span style="">would be submitted for decision, he
explicitly </span>specified <span style="">such
question to be "whether or not a secret agent is not required to get </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">license for his firearm."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the lower court
stating that the fiscal should examine the documents so that he could pass on
their authenticity, the fiscal asked the following question: "Does the
accused admit that this pistol cal. 22 revolver with six rounds of ammunition
mentioned in the information was found in his possession on August 13, 1962, in
the City of Manila without first having secured the necessary license or permit
thereof from the corresponding authority?" </span>The <span style="">accused, now the appellant, </span>answered
categorically: "Yes, <span class="GramE"><span style="">Your</span></span><span style=""> Honor."
Upon which, the lower court made a statement: "The accused admits, <span class="GramE">Yes</span>, and his counsel Atty. <span class="SpellE">Cabigao</span>
also affirms that the accused admits."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Forthwith, </span>the
fiscal <span style="">announced that he was "willing
to submit the same for decision." Counsel for the accused on his part
presented four (4) exhibits consisting of his appointment "as secret agent
of the Hon. Feliciano </span><span class="SpellE">Leviste</span>," <span style="">then Governor of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>,
dated June 2, 1962;</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> another document likewise issued by Gov. <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span> also addressed to the accused directing him to
proceed to Manila, <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City on </span><span style="">a
</span>confidential mission;<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
the oath of <span style="">office of the accused </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">such secret agent;</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> a certificate dated March 11, 1963, to the
effect</span> <span style="">that the accused "is
</span><span style="">a </span><span style="">secret agent" of </span>Gov. <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">Counsel for the accused then stated
that with the presentation of the above exhibits he was "willing to submit
the case on the question of whether or not </span><span style="">a </span>secret <span style="">agent duly appointed and qualified as such of the provincial governor
is exempt from the requirement of having </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">license of firearm." The exhibits were admitted and the parties
were given time to file their respective memoranda.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thereafter on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="11"><span style="">November
 27, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, the lower
court rendered </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">decision convicting
the </span>accused <span style="">"of the crime
of illegal possession of firearms and sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of
from one year and one day to two years and to pay the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The firearm and ammunition confiscated from
him are forfeited in favor of the Govern­ment."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The only question being
one of law, the appeal was taken to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The decision must be affirmed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The law is explicit that
except as thereafter specifi­cally allowed, "it shall be unlawful for any
person to * * * possess any firearm, detached parts of firearms or ammunition <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, or any instrument or implement used or intended
to be used in the manufacture of firearms, parts of firearms, or
ammunition."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The next section provides that
"firearms and ammunition regularly and law­fully issued to officers,
soldiers, sailors, or marines [of the Armed Forces of the Philippines], the
Philippine Constabulary, guards in the employment of the Bureau of Prisons,
municipal police, provincial governors, lieutenant governors, provincial
treasurers, municipal treasurers, municipal mayors, and guards of provincial
prisoners and jails," are not covered "when such firearms are in
possession of such officials and public servants for use in the performance of
their official duties."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The law cannot be any
clearer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No provision is made for </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">secret agent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As such he is not exempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our
task is equally clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first and
fundamental duty of courts is to apply the law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Construction and interpretation come only after it has been
demonstrated that application is impossible or inadequate without them."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The conviction of the accused must
stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be set aside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Accused however would
rely on People v. <span class="SpellE">Macarandang</span>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> where </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">secret agent was acquitted on appeal on the assumption that the
appointment "of the accused as a secret agent to assist in the maintenance
of peace and order campaigns and detection of crimes, sufficiently put him
within </span>the <span style="">cate­gory </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">'peace officer' equivalent even to a member
of the municipal police expressly covered by section 879." Such reliance </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">misplaced.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is not within the power of this Court to set aside the clear and
explicit mandate of a statutory provision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To the extent therefore that this </span>decision conflicts with what
was held in People v. <span class="SpellE">Maca­randang</span>, it no longer
speaks with authority.</p>
