<p class="BODY">On July 18, 1960 Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Dineros</span>,
acting as receiver of the La Paz Ice Plant &amp; Cold Storage Co. in Iloilo,
together with C.N. Hodges and Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Gurrea</span>, filed
an action in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo for the annulment of a
judgment rendered against the La Paz Ice Plant by the Court of First Instance
of Manila in Civil Case 39327.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Named as
defendants were Mariano C. <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>, in whose favor
judgment was rendered, and the spouses Jo­se Manuel and <span class="SpellE">Paquita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lezama</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
complaint alleged that, because of mismanagement by the <span class="SpellE">Lezamas</span>,
the La Paz Ice Plant was placed under the receivership of <span class="SpellE">Dineros</span>;
that during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the receivership, <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> brought an
action against the La Paz Ice Plant in the Court of First Instance of Manila
for the collection of P150,000, which sum he had supposedly lent to it; that
summons was served not on the receiver but on the spouses Jose Manuel and <span class="SpellE">Paquita</span> <span class="SpellE">Lezama</span>; and that, through
the collusion of the <span class="SpellE">Lezamas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>
was able to obtain judgment by default against the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was claimed that, because the summons was
served on Jose Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lezama</span> instead of on the
receiver, the Court of First Instance of Manila acquired no jurisdiction over
the La Paz Ice Plant and that, therefore, the decision of that court was void.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their answer, the defendant spouses (the herein petitioners),
while admitting that the company was placed under receiver­ship, maintained
that Jose Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lezama</span> nevertheless remained
president of the La Paz Ice Plant and that as such he had authority to receive
in behalf of the company the court summons in Civil Case 39827.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They denied entering into collusion with <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> and averred that they did not contest <span class="SpellE">Roque's</span> claim because they knew it to be a legitimate
obligation which the <st1:city><st1:place>La Paz</st1:place></st1:city> ice
Plant had incurred pur­suant to a resolution of its board of directors.</p>

<p class="BODY">Issues having been joined, the case was thereupon heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the hearing <span class="SpellE">Dineros</span>
asked the court to issue a <u>subpoena</u> to <span class="SpellE">Pa­quita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lezama</span> to testify as "a witness summoned by the
plaintiffs in accordance with the Rules of Court." The request was granted
over the objection of the petitioners who invoked the following provision of
the Rules of Court:</p>

<blockquote>“A husband cannot be examined for or against his wife without her
consent; nor a wife for or against her husband without his consent, except in a
civil case by one against the other, or in a criminal case for a crime
committed by one against the other.”<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This provision deals with two different matters which rest on
different grounds of policy:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the <u>disqualification</u>
of husband and wife to testify in each other's behalf, as well as their <u>privilege</u>
not to testify against each other.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The fundamental theory of the common law is said to be that relationship of the
spouses, not their pe­cuniary interest, is the basis of the disqualification.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed Sec­tion 20 of Rule 130 is entitled "Disqualification by reason of
. . . relationship."</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, while a welter of emotional reasons has been
offered<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
for the privilege, the "true explanation [which] is af­ter all the
simplest"<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
and which constitutes "the real and sole strength of the opposition to
abolishing the privilege," is the natu­ral repugnance in every fair-minded
person to compelling a wife or husband to be the means of the other's
condemnation and to sub­jecting the culprit to the humiliation of being condemned
by the words of his intimate life partner.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Here the request for <u>subpoena</u> indicated that <span class="SpellE">Paquita</span> <span class="SpellE">Lezama</span> was to do no more
than testify as an adverse party in the case and, indeed, in the light of the
allegations both in the complaint and in the answer, the request was apparently
one that could rea­sonably be expected to be made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the complaint charged:</p>

<blockquote>"13.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- That in obtaining the judgment by default in
Civil Case No. 39827 of the Court of First Instance of Manila against the La
Paz Ice Plant &amp; Cold Storage Co., Inc. defendants, in gross and evident bad
faith, and, in fraudulent conspiracy, made it appear that the La Paz Ice Plant
&amp; Cold Storage Co., Inc. had obtained a loan of P150,000.00 from defendant <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> thru defendant
Jose Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lezama</span> allegedly upon an authority vested
upon defendant Jose Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lezama</span> by the alleged
Board of Directors of the La Paz Ice Plant &amp; Cold Storage Co., Inc.
allegedly evidenced by the minutes of the meetings of the Board of Direc­tors
of the said corporation signed by defendant Jose Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lezama</span>
and attested to by Benjamin Luis <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> and <span class="SpellE">Paquita</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Lezama</span> and that defen­dants
spouses Jose Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lezama</span> and <span class="SpellE">Paquita</span>
B. <span class="SpellE">Lezama</span> had manipulated the books of the
corporation by making it appear that such fictitious loan was then in
existence."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">On the other hand, the answer claimed</p>

<blockquote>"13.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the herein defendants specifi­cally deny
all the allegations contained in para­graph 13 of the complaint; the truth is,
that the herein defendants have not conspired and acted in bad faith with the
plaintiff [<span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>]
in Civil Case No. 39827 of the Court of First Instance of Manila for the
rendition of the said judg­ment referred to therein; for the truth is, that the
herein defendants, in their capacities as President-Manager and Secretary of
the La Paz Ice Plant &amp; Cold Storage Co., Inc., believing as they believe
that the obligation sought to be enforced by said civil action being legitimate
and the allegations of the complaint in said Civil Case No. 39827 of the Court
of First Instance of Manila are true, they did not deem it wise to contest the
same; that the obligation of P150,000.00 of the La Paz Ice Plant &amp; Cold
Storage Co., Inc., which the defendant <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> sought to be enforced in Ci­vil Case No. 39827 of the
Court of First Instance of Manila was legitimately contracted in accord­ance
with law; that said obligation was duly entered in the books of the corporation
and that the said loan is not fictitious; that the amount realized <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> was spent for the benefit of the said cor­poration."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, while the petitioners denied the charge that the loan was
fictitious, they did not deny the allegation that it was <span class="SpellE">Paquita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lezama</span> who, as secretary of the company, signed the
minutes of the meeting at which Jose Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lezama</span>
was allegedly authorized to negotiate the loan and that it was she who,
likewise as secretary, made the entry in the books of the corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was obviously to test the truth of the assertion that the loan
transaction was above board that <span class="SpellE">Dineros</span>, the company
re­ceiver, wanted <span class="SpellE">Paquita</span> <span class="SpellE">Lezama</span>
on the witness stand, not as a spouse witness "for or against her
husband," but rather as an ad­verse party in the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is postulated that a party can make, as it were, such forays
into his opponent's position on the strength of section 6 of Rule 132 which
provides:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>Direct examination of unwilling or hostile witnesses</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- A party may interrogate any unwilling or
hostile witness by leading questions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
party may call an adverse party or an officer, director, or managing agent of a
public or pri­vate corporation or of a partnership or associa­tion which is an
adverse party, and interrogate him by leading questions and contradict and im­peach
him in all respects as if he had been called by the adverse party and the
witness thus called may be contradicted and impeached by or on behalf of the
adverse party also, and may be cross-examined by the adverse party only upon
the subject-matter of his examination in chief."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The basic issue may therefore be restated thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case where the wife is a co-defendant
in a suit charging fraud against the spouses, can the wife be compelled to
testify as an adverse party witness concerning her participation in the alleged
fraud without violating Section 20(b) of Rule 130?</p>

<p class="BODY">It is argued that the wife may be so compelled but her testimony
would be receivable only against her.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
It is even suggested that "each may testify in his or her own behalf,
although the testi­mony may inure to the benefit of the other spouse, or
against his or her own interest, although the testimony may also militate
against the other spouse."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Upon the other hand, it is insisted that compelling <span class="SpellE">Paquita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lezama</span> to testify will transgress Section 20(b) of
Rule 130, especially if her testimony will support the plaintiff's charge.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint charges "fraudulent conspiracy" on the
part of the spouses and one <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> to make it appear that the La Paz Ice Plant &amp;
Cold Storage Co., Inc. was indebted to <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The wife, <span class="SpellE">Paquita</span> <span class="SpellE">Lezama</span>, is called upon to testify as an adverse party
witness on the basis of her following participa­tion in the alleged fraudulent
scheme:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"that it was <span class="SpellE">Paquita</span> <span class="SpellE">Lezama</span> who as Secretary
of the company signed the minutes of the meet­ing during which Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lezama</span> was allegedly authorized to nego­tiate the loan and
that it was she who, likewise as Secretary, made the entry in the books of the
corporation."</p>

<p class="BODY">Evidently, <span class="SpellE">Paquita</span> <span class="SpellE">Lezama</span>
will be asked to testify on what actually transpired during the meeting and
will be asked questions on the matter of the veracity or falsity of the entry
in the books of the corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether
her testimony will turn out to be adverse or beneficial to her own interest,
the inevitable result would be to pit her against her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The interests of husband and wife in this
case are necessarily interrelated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Testimony adverse to the wife's own interests would tend to show the
existence of col­lusive fraud between the spouses and would then work havoc
upon their common defense that the loan was not fictitious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is the possibility, too, that the wife,
in order to soften her own guilt, if guilty she is, may unwittingly testify in
a manner entirely disparaging to the interests of the husband.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because of the <span class="SpellE">unexpansive</span> wording of
the rule which pro­vides merely that the wife cannot be examined "for or
against her husband without his consent," it is further argued that
"when hus­band and wife are parties to an action, there is no reason why
ei­ther may not be examined as a witness for or against himself or herself
alone," and his or her testimony could operate only against himself or
herself.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Even if such view were generally acceptable as an exception to
the rule, or even as a separate doctrine, it would be inapplica­ble in this
case where the main charge is collusive fraud between the spouses and a third
person, and the evident purpose of exami­nation of the wife is to prove that
charge.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, in those jurisdictions which allow one spouse to be
subjected to examination by the adverse party as a hostile witness when both
spouses are parties to the action, either the interests of the spouses are
separate or separable, or the spouse offered as a witness is merely a formal or
nominal party.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The final point urged upon us is that to prevent one spouse from
testifying would encourage alliance of husband and wife as an instrument of
fraud; for then what better way would there be to prevent discovery than to
make a co-conspirator in fraud immune, to the most convenient mode of discovery
available to the opposite party?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
argument overlooks the fact that Section 6 of Rule 132 is a mere concession,
for the sake of discovery, from the rule which precludes the husband or the
wife from becoming the means of the other's condemnation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said rule of discovery should therefore
not be expanded in meaning or scope as to allow exami­nation of one's spouse in
a situation where this natural repugnance obtains.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may not be amiss to state in passing that the respondent <span class="SpellE">Dineros</span> has not demonstrated that there is no evidence
available to him other than the <span class="SpellE">Lezama’s</span> testimony to
prove the charge recited in the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the resolutions appealed from are re­versed,
and this case is ordered remanded to the court of origin for further
proceedings in accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
costs.</p>

<i><u>v</u></i>. <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><u>Concepcion</u></span></st1:place></st1:city>,
31 Phil. 182 (1915) the basis of the rule is said to be the
"considerations of pu­blic policy growing out of the marital
relation." Said the Court:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"To
allow one to testify for or against the other would be to subject him or her to
great temptation to commit perjury and to en­danger the harmony and confidence
of the marital relation." At 187.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, in <u>People</u> <i><u>v</u>. </i><u>Francisco</u>,
78 Phil. 694 (1947), the Court gave as reasons for the privilege the
following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“First, identity of interest;
second, the consequent danger of perjury; third, the policy of the law which
deems it necessary to guard the security and confidences of private life even
at the risk of an occasional failure of justice, and which rejects such
evidence because its admission would lead to domestic disunion and unhappiness;
and fourth, because, where a want of domestic tranquility exists, there is
danger of punishing one spouse through the hostile testimony of the other.” At
