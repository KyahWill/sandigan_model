<p class="BODY">The case arose from a verified complaint for injunction with
prayer for preliminary injunction filed by Delta Development Cor­poration
(Delta), against the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> on <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1965</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
It is there averred that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Delta is the
owner of the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>
commercial center situated at <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
in the business of leasing portions thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The center has its own thoroughfares, pedestrian lanes, parking areas
for the benefit of customers and clients of<span style=""> </span>its lessees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> is an association of some
employees of <span class="SpellE">Sulo</span> Restaurant, a lessee of Delta.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="1">January
 8, 1965</st1:date>, <span style="">the </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style=""> sought permission from Delta to conduct
picketing activities "on the private property of plaintiff surrounding <span class="SpellE">Sulo</span> Restaurant." On January 11, Delta denied the
request because it "may be held liable for any incident that may happen in
the picket lines, since the picketing would be conducted on the private
property owned by plaintiff." Despite the denial, the </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style=""> picketed on Delta's property surrounding <span class="SpellE">Sulo</span> Restaurant on January 16 and continued to conduct said
activity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such act of the </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style=""> is <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of
the property rights of, and would cause great and irreparable injury to,
Delta.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No employer-employee relationship
exists between Delta and the Union members.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Delta then prayed that a writ of pre­liminary injunction issue and that,
after hearing, such injunction be made permanent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">As aforesaid, respondent judge issued a writ of
preliminary injunction.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <st1:place>Union</st1:place>'s
move to reconsider was denied on <st1:date year="1965" day="26" month="1">January

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1965" day="19" month="1"><span style="">January
 19, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, the </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style=""> filed a motion to dismiss on the ground, <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that the court had no jurisdiction to
try the case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Without awaiting resolution of its motion to dismiss, the Union
commenced in this Court the present original petition for certiorari on
September 18, 1965, claiming that respondent judge acted without or in excess
of his jurisdiction in issuing the injunctive writ "as no restraining
order could be validly issued against the right to picket as part of freedom of
speech"; that respondent judge issued the questioned writ "without
the benefit of a previous hearing"; that it was issued in violation of
Section 9(d) of Republic Act 875; that jurisdiction over the case rests with
the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) "for the same involves acts of
unfair labor practice under Sec. 4(a) of Republic Act 875 in connection with
Sec. 5(a) thereof"; and that there is no appeal nor any plain, speedy and
adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1965</st1:date>,
this Court issued a writ of prelim­inary injunction upon the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>'s
P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>-bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="10">October 12, 1965</st1:date>,
Delta answered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It alleged, amongst
others, that respondent judge validly issued the injunctive writ in question
because the same "never enjoined petitioner from picketing against the <span class="SpellE">Sulo</span>-D &amp; E, Inc. but only from doing their picketing on
the private property of respondent who is not in any way privy to the
relationship between <span class="SpellE">Sulo</span>-D &amp; E, Inc. and peti­tioner";
that Republic Act 875 is not applicable to the case invol­ving as it does an
action to protect Delta's property rights; that it has no labor relation or
dispute of any kind with the Union; and that the injunctive writ was issued
after due hearing on January 19, 1965.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Delta asked that the present petition be denied.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After the submission of
the parties' memoranda in lieu of oral argument, Delta moved to dismiss the
proceeding at bar on the ground that it has become moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It averred that the Union lost in the consent
election conducted by the Department of Labor on October 4, 1965 in CIR Cases
1455-MC and 1464-MC, and thereby also lost its right to picket; and that in
said election cases, a rival union - <span class="SpellE">Sulo</span> Employees
Labor Union (SELU, for short) - was certified by CIR as the exclusive
bargaining representative of all the employees of <span class="SpellE">Sulo</span>
Restaurant pursuant to <span class="SpellE">CIR's</span> order of December 23,
1965.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <st1:place>Union</st1:place> opposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It argued that the picketing was con­ducted
on or about <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1965</st1:date>,
that is, around 8 months before the consent election on <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="10">October 4, 1965</st1:date>; and that the issues that
triggered the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>'s labor strike of <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1965</st1:date> are entirely
distinct and foreign to the issues in Cases 1455-MC and 1464-MC.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition must be dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Really, the case before us has become moot and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the union struck and picketed on <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1965</st1:date>, it might have been true that
the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> commanded a majority of <span class="SpellE">Sulo's</span>
employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without need of
certification, it could, under such circumstances, conclude a collective
bargaining agreement with <span class="SpellE">Sulo</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
But it is not disputed that on <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="10">October
 4, 1965</st1:date>, i.e., shortly after this case was filed on <st1:date year="1965" day="18" month="9">September 18, 1965</st1:date>, a consent <span style="">election was held.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>,
too, is the fact that, in that consent election, SELU defeated the Union,
petitioner herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of this, SELU
was certified to the <span class="SpellE">Sulo</span> management as the
"collective bargaining representative of the employees x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> for collective bargaining
purposes as regards wages, hours of work, rates of pay and/or such other terms
and conditions of employment allowed them by law."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The consent election, it should be noted, was ordered by CIR
pursuant to the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>'s petition for direct
certification docketed as Case 1455-MC and a similar petition for certification
filed by SELU docketed as Case 1464-MC.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Verily, the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> <span class="GramE">can</span> no
longer demand collective bargaining.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For, it became the minority union.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">As matters stand, said right
properly belongs to SELU, which commands the majority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">law, the right to be the
exclusive representative of all the employees in an appropriate collective
bargaining unit is vested in the labor union "designated or selected"
for such purpose "by the majority of the employees" in the unit
concerned.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> SELU has the right as well as the obligation

grievances of all </span><span class="SpellE">Sulo</span> <span style="">employees, including employees who are members of petitioner </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style="">, regarding the "rates of pay, wages,
hours of employment, or other conditions of employment."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Indeed, petitioner </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style="">'s concerted activities designed to be
recognized as the exclusive bargaining agent of <span class="SpellE">Sulo</span></span>

appropriate objective of petitioning </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style="">'s

drawing the employer to the collective bargaining table would obviously be to
disregard the results of the consent election.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To further permit the </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style="">'s
picketing activities would be to flaunt at the will of the majority.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The outcome of a consent
election cannot be rendered meaning­less by a minority group of employees who
had themselves invoked the procedure to settle the dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those who voted in the consent election
against the labor union that was eventually certified are hidebound to the results
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Logic is with this view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By their very act of participating in the
election, they are deemed to have acquiesced to whatever is the consequence of
the election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>As <span style="">to those who did not participate in the
election, the accepted theory is </span>that <span style="">they "are presumed to assent to the expressed will of the </span>majority
