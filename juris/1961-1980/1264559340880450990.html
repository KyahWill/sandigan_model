<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner has been engaged in 
the manufacture and sale of articles made of rattan including rattan round 
pieces. On April 19, 1954, the Collector of Internal Revenue demanded of the 
petitioner the amount of P1 ,313.75 as Deficiency sales tax on round rattan 
pieces, surcharge and penalty thereon, for the period from September 4, 1951 to 
January 24, 1952. The articles were sold to foreign buyers on F. O. B. terms. On 
June 29, 1954, the Rattan Art &amp; Decorations, Inc., asked for the 
cancellation of the demand, claiming: that the transaction was considered by it 
as an export and thus free from sales tax, title to said articles passing: only 
to the buyers upon arrival in the States and after inspection. Because of the 
letter asking cancellation, a re-investigation was conducted, and on

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Based upon the report and 
re-assessment made, the Deputy Collector of Internal Revenue, on 
</span><st1:date month="6" day="22" year="1955"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 22, 
1955</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
made a demand for the payment of P87, 914.93 within 30 days from receipt of the 
letter of demand, plus P8<span class="GramE">,700.00</span> as 
penalty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Counsel for petitioner asked for 
a reconsideration and/or re-investigation, of the assessment. On 
</span><st1:date month="6" day="17" year="1958"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 17, 
1958</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, a 
modified assessment was made, demanding the payment of P77.087.28, all told. The 
motion for reconsideration and/or readjustment of the assessment was denied and 
for failure of petitioner to pay the tax liability a Warrant of <span class="SpellE">Distraint</span> and Levy, was sued out. On </span><st1:date month="8" day="7" year="1958"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 7, 
1958</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
petitioner filed with the Court of Tax Appeals a Petition for Review of the 
assessment of Deficiency Sales Tax, claiming the same to be erroneous and/or the 
liability has already prescribed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The respondent Collector of 
Internal Revenue interposed the following Special and Affirmative Defenses, to 
wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(1) That the total amount of 
F77,087.28 representing deficiency sales tax for 1949 to 1952, 25% surcharge 
thereon, fixed tax for 1952 and 1953, and penalty was assessed against 
petitioner in accordance with law;<br>(2) That the right of the respondent to 
assess and collect the tax has not yet prescribed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After trial, the parties 
submitted their memorandum, petitioner sponsoring the theory that in so far as 
the tax liability for the sales of 1949 and the first two quarters of 1960, the 
same has already prescribed; and that the assessment was erroneous, since the 
transactions were export sales which were consummated outside of the Philippines 
and therefore exempt from sales tax. Upon the other hand, respondent Collector 
of Internal Revenue took the contrary view, claiming that petitioner failed to 
prove the assertion of prescription and that the sales having been on an F. 0. 
B. term, the same have been ruled the CTA and the Supreme Court as having been 
consummated within the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. Cited in support of the second 
contention are several cases G. R. No. L-11710, Western Mindanao Lumber Dev. Co. 
vs. Coll. of Int. Rev., June 30,1958; and others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Because the assessment for 1950 
did not appear to have been itemized by quarter, so that it could not be 
determined when prescription had commenced, the CTA ordered the reopening of the 
case for the reception of evidenced regarding said aspect. The order resulted in 
the presentation of a Stipulation of Facts, where among the computation was 
shown by the quarter. On 31, 1960, the CTA rendered judgment the pertinent of 
which read: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The issues raised in this appeal 
arc (1) whether or not the sales to foreign buyers during: the period in 
question are domestic sales subject to the sales tax; (2) assuming that said 
sales are taxable, whether or not the right of the Government to assess the tax 
on sales made from 1949 to the second quarter of 1950 has prescribed; and (3) 
the legality of the imposition of the alleged penalty in the sum of P5<span class="GramE">,700.00</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

National Internal Revenue Code, manufacturers other than manufacturers of

consummated in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. * * * A sale is deemed made or

were charged to the buyers; that the freight charges were paid by the buyers at 
destination; that the shipments abroad were insured by the buyers; that in those 
cases where the shipments insured by the petitioner, the insurance policies were 
indorsed to the buyers; and that payments for said shipment a were made through 
drafts or letters of credit drawn against local banks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is clear that title to the articles sold by petitioner to the foreign buyers was

sales subject to the sales tax. * * * The fact that the price of the articles

result. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that petitioner is subject to the 
sales tax on its sales to the foreign buyers under the circumstances mentioned

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">A motion for reconsideration of 
the above judgment Presented. In said motion, counsel for petitioner invoked, 
for the first time, the amendment of Section 186 of Internal Revenue Code by 
Republic Act No. 894, where in it was provided that effective </span><st1:date month="6" day="20" year="1953"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 20, 
1953</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
shipments by manufacturers or producers, irrespective of shipping arrangements 
affecting the place of transfer of to the articles shipped, were exempted from 
sales tax. Under petitioner's contention, the deficiency sales taxes prior to 
the passage of the law (Act 894) should be condoned, by giving said law 
retroactive effect. The CTA denied the motion for reconsideration on 
</span><st1:date month="11" day="5" year="1960"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 5, 
1960</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
thus the instant appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In its brief, petitioner pointed 
three (3) errors allegedly committed by the lower court, to 
wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(1) In not holding that by virtue 
of Central Bank's Rules and Regulations the herein sales having been dollar 
transactions were, therefore, foreign sale transactions; <br>(2) In not holding 
that the herein transactions, made by and between the Rattan Art &amp; 
Decorations, Inc., and foreign buyers were foreign sales, consummated outside 
Philippine territory and hence not subject to the domestic sales tax; and 
<br>(3) In not holding Republic Act No. 894 as having retroactive 
effect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Anent the first error, the 
petitioner had failed to prove that the transactions in question were in fact 
foreign sales. While it is true that the sale was paid in dollars, this alone 
did not make it a foreign sale and exempted from the payment of the sales tax. 
The compliance with Central Bank Rules and Regulations was only necessary for 
the purposes of controlling the use of foreign exchange. At any rate, this Court 
in a number of cases, where tax liability was sought to be exempted, under the 
same defenses, ruled that they did not involve foreign sales (<span class="SpellE">Bislig</span> Lumber Co., Inc. vs. Coll. of Int. Rev., 110 Phi!., 
746 and cases cited therein).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This Court cannot also share the 
view taken by the petitioner, to the effect that the transactions in question 
were consummated outside of the territory of the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and should not be subjected to 
domestic sales tax. It has not been denied that the <span class="GramE">sale of 
the goods were</span> on F. O. B. terms; that the expenses of packing preparing 
the articles for shipment were charged to the buyers; that the freight charges 
were paid by the buyers at destination; that the shipments were insured by the 
buyers. Under these circumstances, there is no mistaking the fact that when the 
petitioner has placed the goods aboard the ship, all its rights ended there and 
the sole authority for the disposition of the shipped merchandise rested upon 
the foreign buyers. Title was transferred at that very moment. Petitioner, 
however, argues that although goods are shipped F. 0. B., the intent of the 
parties regarding the disposition of the goods shall control. We may concede the 
merit of said argument, but in the case at bar, petitioner has failed to show a 
contrary intent was contemplated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">While it is true that payment 
were made after the boat had left Philippine waters, the delay did not change 
the fact that the transactions were consummated in the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. It will be noted that the delay 
was merely caused by the preparation of the papers fur submission to the banks 
against whom the letters of credit had been drawn. Even on the supposition that 
the contracts in the involved transactions were perfected in the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">United 
States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, as claimed by the petitioner, 
still it does not follow that the passing of title should also be in the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">United 
States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. Transfer of title to the vendee 
may be made by actual or constructive delivery (Art. 1477, NCC). The delivery of 
the goods on board the carrying vessels partake of the nature of actual 
delivery, since from that time, the foreign buyers assumed the risk of loss of 
the goods and paid the insurance premiums covering them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The third and last error deals 
with the contention that Republic Act No. 894, which exempted the transactions 
at bar from liability for sales tax, should be given retroactive effect and 
extend to petitioner the benefits thereof. It must be recalled, however, that 
this is a tax case, and one who seeks exemption from payment thereof, should 
justify the exemption with the clearest legislative grant. During the period 
when petitioner was made liable for the taxes question, Republic Act No. 894 was 
not in existence. While it is true that a law creating new rights may be given 
retroactive effect, the same can only be made possible if the new right does not 
prejudice or impair any vested right. The government had already acquired such 
right in the taxes due from petitioner, when the exempting statute came to life. 
Moreover, this Court has ruled that transactions before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of Republic Act <span class="GramE">894,</span> 
cannot be given retroactive effect (<span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Lumber 
Co., Inc, vs. The Coll. of Int. Rev., 102 Phil. 116).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">IN VIEW OF ALL THE 
FOREGOING</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the
