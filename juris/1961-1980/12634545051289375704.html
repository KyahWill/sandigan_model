shafts and one pallet containing 10 cartons of auto ball bearings, consigned to
shipper's order, with Central Auto Supply, Inc., Manila as notify party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>SS "Pioneer Moon", which carried
it, arrived in Manila on June <span style="">8, </span>1964
and thereafter fully discharged the shipment in good order condition to the
Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Service of the Bureau of Customs then handling <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operations in the port afore-stated.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service failed to
deliver 28 bundles of axle shaft to the consignee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span style="">a </span>result,
Northern Assurance Co., Ltd., insurer of the shipment, paid the consignee P3<span class="GramE">,724.34</span> for the undelivered 28 bundles of axle shafts.</p>

<p class="BODY">Suit was then filed by said insurance company against the
Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
Bureau of Customs and the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service to
recover said amount as <span class="SpellE">subrogee</span> to the
consignee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was dismissed by the City
Court of Manila, on the ground of non-suability of defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appeal by plaintiff to the Court of First
Instance of Manila caused reversal of the inferior court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants were, after trial, ordered to pay
P2<span class="GramE">,274.07</span> - the C.I.F. value of the undelivered
shipment - without costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants
took the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The point at issue, whether defendants may be sued in this case,

</span>For this reason, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, instead of filing
its brief, submitted the case for decision in light of said ruling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Applying this doctrine, <span class="GramE">We</span>
hold that defendants herein may not be sued, without their consent, for directly
engaging in <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operations, necessarily incidental
