 1964</span></st1:date><span style=""> of the </span>Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> dismissing the appellant's
complaint<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
for malicious prosecution on the ground of <span style="">failure to state </span>a sufficient cause of <span style="">action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint, filed on <st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="10">October
 15, 1963</st1:date>, alleges <span style="">the </span>following
facts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff was a general
merchant engaged in buying and selling textiles and ready made clothes and an
operator of a number of department stores.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In 1959 he sold postdated checks at a discount to the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff's unpaid balance, as of <st1:date year="1960" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1960</st1:date>, amounted to
P58,381.13.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To secure payment thereof he
executed in the defendant's favor a chattel mortgage, copy of which was
attached to the complaint, covering the merchandise inventory of a department
store owned by him in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On or about May 17, 1961 the defendant <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span> foreclosed the mortgage and bad the sheriff
of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City seize and sell the merchandise, which
fetched only the sum of P6,140.81.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
July 1961 the defendant lodged a criminal complaint with the office of the City
Fiscal of Manila, charging the plaintiff with <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
under sub-section (a), paragraph 2, Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">A </span>preliminary
investigation was conducted, after which, on <st1:date year="1962" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1962</st1:date>, the Fiscal filed the corresponding information
in the Court of First Instance of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The case went to trial, and the plaintiff was acquitted on <st1:date year="1963" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the same complaint the plaintiff averred that the defendant
"knew all the time that the plaintiff...ha(d) not committed the offense of
<span class="SpellE">estafa</span>, but which malice and in gross evident bad
faith defendant filed the said criminal case...merely for the purpose of
embarrassing and harassing the plaintiff among his friends and relatives and
destroying (his) good business standing and commercial credit among his
business associates and creditors." By way of relief, the plaintiff
claimed different items of damages aggregating over P140,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="10">October 25, 1963</st1:date>
the defendant moved to dismiss on the ground that the complaint failed to state
a sufficient cause of action, to which motion the plaintiff filed an opposition
on <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="1" month="8">August 1, 1964</st1:date>,
the lower court granted the motion and dismissed the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff moved to reconsider, but was turned
down; hence the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant now submits that the dismissal was erroneous, since his
complaint made out a cause of action in the light of Article 21 of the Civil
Code,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
taken in connection with Article 2219 <span style="">(8),
</span>which mentions malicious prosecution as one of the instances in which
moral damages may be recovered.</p>

<p class="BODY">A motion to dismiss based on failure to state a cause of action
presents to the court only the question of whether or not the complaint alleges
facts which, if true, would justify the relief demanded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The veracity of such allegations is not in
issue; they are deemed hypothetically admitted for purposes of the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated otherwise, the test of sufficiency of
the cause of action is whether, admitting the facts alleged to be true, the
court could render a vali<span style="">d</span> <span style="">judgment in </span>accordance with the prayer
in the complaint.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Malicious prosecution, to be the basis of a suit, requires the
elements of malice and want of probable cause in the prosecution of an action
against the plaintiff. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>A third element
is that the defendant must himself be the prosecutor or the instigator of the
prosecution, which ended in acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These elements are <span class="SpellE">discusse</span> in the case of
Buchanan vs. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Esteban,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
thus:</p>

<blockquote>"To support an action for malicious <span style="">prosecution under </span>American law the plaintiff must prove, in the
first place, the fact of the prosecution and the fact that the defendant was
himself the prosecutor, or that be instigated its commencement, and that it
finally terminated in his acquittal, that, in bringing it, the prosecutor had <span style="">acted </span>without probable <span style="">cause, and that he was </span>actuated by
legal malice, i.e., by improper or sinister motives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These <span style="">three
elements </span>must concur; and there is no distinction between actions for
criminal prosecution and civil suits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Both classes require substantially the same essentials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Malice is essential to the maintenance of an
action for malicious <span style="">prosecution and
not merely to </span>the recovery of exemplary damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But malice alone <span style="">does not </span>make <span style="">one liable
for malicious</span> prosecution, where probable cause is shown, even where it
appears that the suit was brought for the mere purpose of vexing, harassing and
injuring his adversary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words,
malice and want of probable cause must both exist in order to justify the action."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's complaint fails to satisfy the test of
sufficiency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that it alleges
that the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> knew "that the plaintiff ha(d)
not committed <span style="">the </span>crime
(charged) "and that he acted "with malice and in gross and evident
bad faith... <span style="">&nbsp;</span>for the purpose of
embarrassing and harassing the plaintiff..."But the complaint also
contains other allegations which, objectively considered, belie this conclusion
with respect to both the elements of malice and want of probable cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These allegations are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that a preliminary investigation of the
charge of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> was conducted by the City Fiscal;
(2) that after the said investigation the plaintiff filed a motion to quash,
which the defendant opposed; (3) that more than a year thereafter, or on November
15, 1962, the Fiscal nevertheless filed an information in court, with his
certification that he had conducted the requisite preliminary investigation and
that "there is reasonable ground to believe that the offense charged has been
committed; and that the accused is guilty thereof;"<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
and (4) "that after a protracted trial, the plaintiff was acquitted of the
offense as charged...in a decision dated September 9, 1963... and promulgated
on <st1:date year="1963" day="13" month="9">September 13, 1963</st1:date>."
A copy of said decision, acquitting the plaintiff on the ground of reasonable
doubt, was also attached to the complaint as Annex "D" and hence
formed part of its allegations.</p>

<p class="BODY">The findings of fact made by the Court in its decision of
acquittal bear materially on the question of malice and want of probable
cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence, said the court,
showed that when the plaintiff executed the chattel mortgage on the stock
inventory in his store on November 29, 1960 he was the owner thereof, and
therefore made no false representation when he executed said mortgage to secure
the loan of P58,381.13 <span style="">he </span>obtained
from the defendant; but that "some weeks or months after November 29,
1960, with intent to defraud the complainant United Finance Corporation, the
accused succeeded in disposing of the whole or a part of said store and, stock
merchandise in favor of a third party, to the complainant's prejudice..."
The basis of the acquittal, according to the court, was that "deceit, to
constitute <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>, should be the efficient cause of
the <span class="SpellE">defraudation</span> and as such should either be prior
to, or simultaneous with the act of fraud," citing People vs. Fortune, 73
Phil. 407.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing facts, alleged in the complaint for malicious
prosecution either directly or by reference to its annexes, show that in filing
the criminal charge the defendant was not actuated by malice, nor was there
want of probable cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had been the
victim of deceit committed by the plaintiff, and whether or not such deceit
constituted <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> was a legal question properly
submitted first to the City Fiscal and then to the court after the necessary
preliminary investigation was conducted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The very fact that the plaintiff's acquittal was based on reasonable
doubt as to his guilt demonstrates that the defendant was justified in
submitting its grievances to the said authorities for ruling and possible
redress.</p>
