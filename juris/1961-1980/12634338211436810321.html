the efforts of the petitioner to quash the writ of execution issued to enforce
the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> final judgment that the present

that at the time the writ was served on him, he was no longer mayor of <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner invoked the principle that when
judgment is rendered against an officer of the municipal corporation who is

illegally removed, the judgment is binding upon the corporation, whether or not
the same is included as party to the action.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

 22, 1977</span></st1:date><span style="">, respondent
Court issued the Order denying the Motion to Quash Writ of Execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner thus came to this Court,
maintaining that he could no longer be required to pay the back salaries of the
private respondents because payment on his part presupposes his continuance in
office, which is not the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He contends
that it is the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="">Municipality</span></st1:placetype><span style=""> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Norzagaray</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style=""> that is liable for said payment, invoking </span><span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">Aguador</span></i></span><i><span style=""> v. <span class="SpellE">Enerio</span>,</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and </span><span class="SpellE"><i><u>Sison</u></i></span><i><u>

that he is no longer municipal mayor of <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span>,
constitutes a substantial change in the sit­uation of the parties which makes
the issuance of the writ of execution inequitable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner prays, among others, that judgment be rendered
declaring that the payment of back salaries of private respondents should be
made by the incumbent mayor and by the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, and that petitioner is no longer liable for
the payment thereof; and annulling the Order dated April 22, 1977 of respondent
court denying the motion to quash the writ of execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="24" month="5">May 24, 1977</st1:date>,
this Court required petitioner to <span class="SpellE">implead</span> the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> as party respondent and on <st1:date year="1977" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1977</st1:date>, petitioner filed an
amended petition <span class="SpellE">impleading</span> the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
and <span class="SpellE">Amando</span> Enriquez, the incumbent municipal mayor.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his amended petition, petitioner alleges that the writ of
execution is already being enforced against the personal properties of
petitioner; that such enforcement during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the instant petition would probably work injustice to petitioner; and that
petitioner stands to suffer great and irreparable injury if enforcement of the
writ is not temporarily restrained.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner, therefore, prays that the execution be stayed or a temporary
restraining order be issued pending resolution of the instant proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 1, 1977, private respondents filed their Comment
maintaining that respondent court acted correctly and committed no abuse of
discretion when it denied petitioner's motion to quash the writ of execution,
(1) it being the ministerial duty of the trial court to issue a writ for the
enforcement of a final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment; and
(2) since the personal liability of the petitioner and his co-defendant to pay
the back salaries of the private respondents as mandated in the decision sought
to be executed cannot be shifted or transferred to the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, for to do so
would be to vary the terms of a final judgment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1977" day="12" month="8">August 12, 1977</st1:date>,
this Court resolved to consider the Comment of respondents as <i>answer</i> to
the petition and required the parties to file their respective memoranda, and
thereafter the case was submitted for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue is whether or not respondent Court in denying the
Motion to Quash the Writ of Execution acted with grave abuse of discretion or
with lack or excess of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">It cannot be denied that both the judgments of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> and of the Court of Appeals categorically
state that the liability of herein petitioner is personal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, according to the trial court, "<span class="SpellE">Eufemio</span> T. Correa and <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Virgilio</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>, municipal mayor and municipal
treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
respectively, should be ordered <i>personally</i> to pay the salaries which the
plaintiffs failed to receive by reason of their illegal removal from office
until they are actually reinstated." (Italics supplied).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In affirming the decision
of the trial court, the Court of Appeals</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> ruled that "The defendants are </span><i>personally</i>
<span style="">liable jointly and severally because
they acted without justifiable cause (<span class="SpellE">Nemenzo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Sabillano</span>, Sept. 7, 1968, 25 SCRA 1)."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The jurisprudence relied
upon by the petitioner </span>in <span style="">his
effort to shift the responsibility to the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="">Municipality</span></st1:placetype><span style=""> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Norzagaray</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style=""> appears inapplicable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In </span><span class="SpellE"><i>Aguador</i></span><i>
v. <span class="SpellE">Enerio</span>, supra</i>, <span style="">cited by petitioner, the municipal mayor and the members of the
Municipal Council of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span> were specifically
ordered "to appropriate necessary amounts to </span>pay <span style="">the salary differentials for the petitioners
and also for the payment of their entire salaries from month to month, subject
naturally to the availability of funds after all statutory and subsisting
contractual obligations shall have been properly covered by adequate appropriations."
The issue raised was whether or not, after the municipal mayor, members of the
municipal council and </span><span style="">the
municipal treasurer </span><span style="">were
expressly made parties in the <i>mandamus</i> case and in the contempt
proceedings, it was necessary to include the municipality as a party, to make
the latter liable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This issue was
resolved in the negative by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case of </span><span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">Sison</span></i></span><i><span style=""> </span></i><i><span style="">v. <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span>, supra</span></i><span style="">, the trial court directed the Acting
Municipal Mayor and Acting Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Bamban</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> to reinstate <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lacanlale</span> as Acting Chief of Police, effective </span><st1:date year="1957" day="30" month="6"><span style="">June 30,
 1957</span></st1:date><span style=""> "with the
incident of payment of back salaries by the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="">Municipality</span></st1:placetype><span style=""> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bamban</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="">."

the Chief of Police, it appearing that said municipality was not <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> in the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court ruled that the fact that the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Bamban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> was not by name <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> in the case for reinstatement and back salaries
does not affect the employee's right to the payment of back salaries,
considering that the officers required by law to represent the municipality in
all suits were made parties </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">their official capacity, hence the case was
heard and decided as if the municipality had been made a party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In both cases the judgment of the Court
specifically directed the municipality to pay the back salaries.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Here, the judgment of the
trial court, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, found petitioners <span class="SpellE">Eufemio</span> T. Correa and <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> <span class="SpellE">Batacan</span> personally
liable for the payment of the salaries which the dismissed policemen failed to
