the revised Rules of Court, of a decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, in its
Criminal Case No. 1316, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of
which reads -?</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds accused POLI­CARPIO HALASAN,
guilty beyond reasonable doubt, as principal, of the special complex crime of
rob­bery in band with homicide and frustrated homicide, as defined and
penalized under Art. 294, par. 1, in relation to Art. 296 of the Revised Penal
Code, and there being no aggravating nor mitigating circumstances, hereby
imposes upon the accused to suffer the maximum penalty of DEATH; to indemnify
the heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balaobao</span>
in the amount of P6,000.00; to pay to the offended party, <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maghuyop</span>, the sum of P1,289.75, the value of the
articles and money robbed; and to pay the costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The records disclose that:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In an information dated March 4, 1959, the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> charged in said
court one <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> <span class="SpellE">Halasan</span>
together with thirteen (13) others of the crime of robbery in band with
homicide and frustrated homicide, the pertinent part of which information reads
-</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about January 16, 1959, at early dawn, in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Calian</span>, Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Margosatubig</span>,
<span style="">Provi</span>nce of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, Republic of the Philippines and within the
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with guns,
bladed weapons and clubs, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one
another, with intent to gain and with the use of force, threats, violence and
intimida­tion, went to <span style="">the </span>store
which is used as residence of <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> <span class="SpellE">Maghuyop</span>, by then and there willfully, un­lawfully and
feloniously detached and removed forcibly the wooden board of the kitchen
walling and at the same time fired their guns toward the kitchen door hit­ting
and killing instantaneously one <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balaobao</span> and wounding the store owner, <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maghuyop</span>, thereupon having successfully gained
entrance into the store by shouting at the inmates inside to open the front
door under threats and intimidation, hogtied all the occupants, and the said
accused demanded cash from the owner <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> <span class="SpellE">Maghuyop</span> and wife Angela C. <span class="SpellE">Maghuyop</span>
handed to them in the amount of One Thousand Two Hundred (P1,200.00) Pesos,
also together with the cash amount mentioned herein various merchandise and
cigarettes all valued at Eighty Nine and 75/100 (P89.75) Pesos were taken and
carried away by the accused to the damage and prejudice of the owner in the
total amount of One Thousand Two Hundred Eighty Nine and 75/100 Pesos
(P1,289.75), Philippine Currency."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Of the fourteen (14) accused charged in said information, only
four (4), namely, <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> <span class="SpellE">Halasan</span>,
Emilio <span class="SpellE">Popera</span>, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Tala­sing</span>,
and <span class="SpellE">Teotimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Montalla</span> were
apprehended, while the others remained at large and/or unidentified.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon being arraigned, the four (4) above-named accused, assisted
by the same lawyer, Ernesto O. <span class="SpellE">Organo</span>, who acted as
counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> for <span class="SpellE">Halasan</span> and as counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>
for the others, pleaded not guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, upon the Provincial <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> motion, ordered the discharge of accused <span class="SpellE">Teotimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Montalla</span> from the
information to be utilized <span style="">as state </span>witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution then proceeded with the presentation of its evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It finished with the direct examination of
state witness <span class="SpellE">Montalla</span> who narrated in detail how
appellant <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> <span class="SpellE">Hala­san</span>
("Carping") invited and later intimidated the witness into joining an
armed band of more than four men who attacked and broke into the house of <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> <span class="SpellE">Maghuyop</span>, wounded the
latter and killed <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balaobao</span>
and robbed the family, as described in the information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense began cross-examining <span class="SpellE">Montalla</span>, but before the cross-examination could be
terminated, defense counsel <span class="SpellE">Organo</span> manifested to the
court <u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> <u>quo</u> </span>that accused <span class="SpellE">Ha<span style="">la­</span>san</span> had
signified his willingness to change his former plea and that he (counsel) would
discontinue and waive further cross-exam­ination of said witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He moved, therefore, that <span class="SpellE">Halasan</span>
be allowed to withdraw his former plea of not guilty and to substi­tute <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> a plea of guilty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Provincial Fiscal did not inter­pose any objection to Attorney <span class="SpellE">Organo's</span> motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereupon, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> apprised accused <span class="SpellE">Halasan</span> of the consequences of his change of plea, the
seriousness or gravity of the offense charged against him and the possibility
of a heavy pe­nalty which might be imposed upon him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite this warning, said accused declared
in open court that he was willing to enter a plea of guilty because he really
committed the crime so that there was no use of setting up a defense; that he
considered himself a habitual delinquent because he had killed and wounded
persons in <span class="SpellE">Tudela</span>, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Occidental, killed three (3) persons in <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del
<span class="SpellE">Sur</span> and other persons in some other places which
crimes were still unsolved; that in the morning of the trial (August 24, 1960),
he stabbed a co-prisoner in the Provincial jail and his victim was hovering
between life and death; and that he wanted a death penalty to be meted against
himself in order that he may be able to prepare in the atonement of his sins.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, after finding that accused <span class="SpellE">Halasan</span> understood the import of his change of plea,
granted the defense's motion and ordered said accused to be arraigned anew.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon being re-arraigned, accused <span class="SpellE">Halasan</span>,
assisted by the same counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">oficio</span></u></span><span style="">, </span>pleaded guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defense attorney <span class="SpellE">Organo</span> then prayed the
court <u>a</u><span style=""> <u>quo</u> </span>to
exer­cise its sound discretion in considering the above plea of guilty as a
mitigating circumstance in favor of said accused, for the pur­pose of
determining the proper penalty to be imposed upon him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the Provincial Fiscal
asked that the aggravating cir­cumstance of recidivism be counted against the
accused and moved that the information be amended to allege such circumstance,
which the defense opposed for being improper.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said fiscal recommended that the maximum penalty of death be imposed on
the said accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of said plea of guilty, which the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
did not credit as a mitigating circumstance in favor of the accused, it having
been entered after the prosecution had presented its evidence <span style="">and other circumstances of this case, such as
the alleged "depravity" of the accused as confessed by him in open
court, and considering the nature of the crime (robbery in band with homicide)
charged in the information to which said accused pleaded guilty, the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> rendered its decision, dated August 24, 1960, quoted at the
beginning of this opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the
record of this case was elevated to this Court for </span>automatic <span style="">review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In this Court, counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
for said accused was appointed to represent him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said counsel alleged a lone assignment of
error in his brief, claiming that by such plea of guilty, accused is entitled
to the benefit of a mitigating circumstance and there being no aggravating
circumstance, the proper penalty which should have been imposed upon him should
be lowered by one degree (<u>reclusion</u> <u>tem­poral</u>) in accordance with
Article 61, paragraph 2, of the Revised Pe­nal Code; or, in the interest of
justice, that a new trial or reception of additional evidence be ordered to
enable this Court to arrive at a fair and impartial decision of this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, the Solicitor General, in representation of
the People, maintains that the lower court correctly imposed the proper penalty
against the accused since any person found guilty of robbery in band with
homicide is punishable with a penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>
to death which should be imposed in the maximum pe­riod; and he recommends,
therefore, that the decision under review should be affirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We agree </span>with the
lower court as well as the Solicitor General that <span style="">the plea of guilty cannot be considered as a mitigating circumstance to
benefit the accused in this case, the same (plea) having been en­tered after
the prosecution had begun presenting its evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People vs. </span>Co <span style="">Chang, 60 Phil. 293; People </span>vs. <span style="">De la Cruz, </span>63 Phil. 874; and People vs. <span class="SpellE">Lambino</span>,
103 Phil. 504).</p>

<p class="BODY">We likewise agree with the Solicitor General that the lower court
correctly imposed the proper penalty upon the said accused, since by such plea
of guilty, he is deemed to have admitted the material al­legations of the
information<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
including <span style="">any </span>aggravating circumstance
alleged therein (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Llagas</span>, G. R. Nos.
L-5015-17, <st1:date year="1957" day="31" month="5">May 31, <span style="">1957</span></st1:date><span style="">, 102 Phil. 1232 [<span class="SpellE">unrep</span>.]);
that "band" is considered as an aggravating circumstance (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Ganal</span>, 85 Phil. 743); and that this Court had already held
that -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"As the crime committed by the defendants is robbery in band
with homicide, the penalty prov­ided for by article 294, of the Revised Penal
Code, is <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> to death,
and in accordance with Republic Act 12, the penalty to be imposed upon them is
the maximum penalty, that is, death, even without the concurrence of any
aggravating circumstance." (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Valeriano</span>,
90 Phil. 15)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the claim of counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> for a new trial or taking of additional
evidence, suffice it to cite that the award thereof rests upon the sound
discretion of the court (People vs. Acosta, <u>supra</u>.) and no valid
justification is shown to grant it.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, for lack of the requisite number of votes to support the
infliction of the supreme penalty of death, the penalty next lower in degree,
that is, <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, should be
imposed upon the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, as thus modified, the decision under review
is hereby affirmed in all other respects.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With costs against accused <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> <span class="SpellE">Halasan</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
