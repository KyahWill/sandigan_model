				<H3>APOLONIO DE LOS SANTOS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. BENJAMIN V. LIMBAGA, ETC., DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>DE LEON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of Basilan 
City dismissing a petition for mandamus to compel Benjamin V. Limbaga, the 
engineer of that city, to authorize Apolonio de los Santos to construct a 
residential house on the land described in the petition.
<p>It is alleged in the petition that on November 19, 1952, Apolonio de los 
Santos applied with the respondent city engineer for a permit to construct a 
residential house on his land situated in Lamitan, Basilan City; that the 
respondent without any lawful cause refused to grant said permit; and that in 
view of this refusal, petitioner suffered damages in the amount of P18,000.</p>
<p>In his answer, the respondent, represented by the City Fiscal of Basilan, 
denied the allegations of the petition and interposed the following affirmative 
defenses; that after a fire which occurred in Lamitan that raged down a major 
portion of the market site therein, the city government approved the purchase of 
an additional area to enlarge the said site and that, incidentally, the lot 
claimed by the petitioner was included in the area; that by virtue thereof, 
expropriation proceedings had been instituted thereon, hence, the denial of the 
permit applied for by petitioner.</p>
<p>On December 5, 1958, the city fiscal moved to dismiss the petition on the 
following grounds: that mandamus will not lie since the issuance of the permit 
applied for was a discretionary and not a ministerial duty on the part of the 
city engineer; that petitioner's application for permit to construct a 
residential building, of strong material, on the lot in question had to be 
denied by the city engineer for the lot was within the area of the proposed 
market site which was already under expropriation proceedings instituted by 
Basilan City pursuant to a resolution approved by the City Council; and in view 
of the fact that on March 24, 1958, while this case was pending, petitioner 
filed an application in the name of another person (Marcial Quilaton) to 
construct a temporary movable store on the same site in question, which was 
approved and thereafter a mobile store was actually constructfed thereon and 
consequently, petitioner is deemed to have abandoned his application to 
construct the building of strong material and necessarily the remedy of mandamus 
being sought by petitioner had lost its merit.</p>
<p>On March 11, 1959, the trial court issued an order of dismissal based on the 
following grounds: that mandamus could not be granted as it was not a 
ministerial duty on the part of the city engineer to approve petitioner's 
application for construction of buildings but approval of the same needed sound 
discretion in the said engineer's exercise of his official functions; and that 
the site in question, which petitioner wanted for the construction of a building 
as per his application, has already been utilized by him for the construction 
of another building which now exists thereonâ€”an act which purports of an 
abandonment of his petition for mandamus.</p>
<p>From the order of dismissal, petitioner has appealed direct to this Court 
raising only questions of law.</p>
<p>Without touching on the various issues raised, We would say that mandamus 
cannot prosper in this case for the simple reason that, as the record shows, the 
land in question is already the subject matter of expropriation proceeding 
instituted by Basilan City pursuant to a resolution approved by the City 
Council, which proceeding is now pending in the Court of First Instance of 
Basilan. Moreover, herein petitioner has failed to exhaust the administrative 
remedies available to him. Petitioner should have first brought the matter to 
the Director of Public Works who, under the law, exercise supervision and 
control over city engineers of chartered cities (see Commonwealth Act No. 424), 
and if he was not satisfied with the Director's decision he should have appealed 
to the Secretary of Public Works and Communications. (Miguel vs, Reyes. 93 
Phil,. 542), The principle is fundamental that a party aggrieved by a decision 
of an administrative official should, before coming to court, apply for review 
of such decision by higher administrative authority (De la Torre vs. Trinidad. 
108 Phil,. 635; 58 Off, Gaz,. [23] 4398; Perez vs, City Mayor, et al,. 113 
Phil., 418), This principle rests on the presumption that the administrative 
agency, if afforded a Complete chance to pass upon the matter, will decide the 
same correctly.</p>
<p>In view hereof, the order of dismissal is hereby affirmed, with costs. So 
ordered.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, 
J. B. L., Barrera, Paredes,</i> and <i>Dizon, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
