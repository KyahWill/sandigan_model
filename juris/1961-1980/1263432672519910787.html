				<BR><STRONG>AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Magtanggol</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Gunigundo</span> (admitted to the bar in 1960 and now forty-three
years old) was the counsel of the plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 3826-M of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> V. Adriano, et al." That case was an action to
recover Lot No. 4762 of the <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> cadastre with an area <span class="GramE">of</span>
around five hectares and for an accounting of the fruits thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1974</st1:date>
respondent <span class="SpellE">Gunigundo</span> received a copy of the order in
the said case dismissing it on the grounds of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>
and prior judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August 22 or the <u>last
day</u> of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period within which to
appeal or file a motion for new trial, he filed, through an associate, a motion
for an extension of fifteen days or up to September 6 <span style="">within which </span>to <span style="">file a </span>motion
for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion was
granted but <span class="SpellE">Gunigundo</span> was not able to file the motion
for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Instead, on the <u>last day</u>, September 6, he sent by
registered mail a motion for a second extension of ten days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On September 16, the <u>last day</u> of the
second extension sought by him, he filed a motion for a third extension of
forty-eight hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion for
reconsideration was mailed on <st1:date year="1974" day="18" month="9">September
 18, 1974</st1:date>, the <u>last day</u> of the third extension.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court denied the second and third motions for extension
on the ground that the order of dismissal was already final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also denied <span class="SpellE">Gunigundo's</span>
motion for reconsideration of the orders denying his motions for extension.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Gunigundo</span> then filed in the Court of
Appeals a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> wherein he
assailed the orders denying his motions for extension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He prayed that the lower court be directed to
resolve his motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeals dismissed his petition (<span class="SpellE">Roque</span>
vs. Court of First Instance, CA-G. R. No. SP-04431, <st1:date year="1975" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1975</st1:date>). <span style="">&nbsp;</span>It applied the ruling that the filing of a
motion for extension of the period to file the record on appeal does not
suspend the period for appeal (Philippine Virginia Tobacco Administration vs.
De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Angeles, L-29736, October 31, 1974, 60 SCRA
432).</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court did not give due course to the appeal of respondent's
clients from that decision of the Court of Appeals (Resolution of March 29,
1976 in L-42879, <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> vs. Court of Appeals).</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 6, 1976, the spouses <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span>
<span class="SpellE">Roque</span> and Jose G. <span class="SpellE">Zaplan</span>,
two of the eight plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 3826-M, filed in this Court a
joint affidavit charging Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gunigundo</span> with gross
negligence in not seasonably filing the motion for reconsideration and in not
perfecting an appeal from the trial court's order of dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the submission of respondent's answer, the case was
referred to the Solicitor General for investigation, report and recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In June, 1978 or during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of
the case in the Solicitor General's office, the complaining spouses made a <u>volte-face</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They executed an affidavit of desistance
before Atty. Rosario R. <span class="SpellE">Rapanut</span>, a senior attorney in
the Citizens Legal Assistance Office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They alleged that their complaint for disbarment was due to a
misunderstanding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They affirmed that respondent
<span class="SpellE">Gunigundo</span> was not negligent in handling their case
("<span class="SpellE">walang</span> <span class="SpellE">pagkukulang</span>
at <span class="SpellE">pagpapabaya</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">kanyang</span> <span class="SpellE">tungkulin</span>").</p>

<p class="BODY">Explaining why he filed a motion for reconsideration instead of
appealing forthwith from the order of dismissal, the respondent testified that
there was vacillation among the eight plaintiffs as to whether they would
appeal; that there were no available funds to defray the expenses of an appeal
since not all of the plaintiffs were inclined to appeal; that some of the
plaintiffs wanted to his another lawyer; that when the period was about to
expire, the plaintiffs changed their mind and decided to continue with the
respondent's services and that the eldest plaintiff died and plaintiffs' desire
to appeal was communicated to the respondent only after the funeral.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The foregoing explanation
is not entirely satisfactory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not
sufficient to exculpate the respondent from the charge </span>of
negligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His filing of motions for
extension on the <u>last day</u> and sending them by registered mail (thus giving
the court insufficient time to act before the extension sought had expired) and
his omission to verify whether his second motion for exten­sion was granted are
indicative of lack of competence, diligence and fidelity in the dispatch of his
clients' business.</p>

<p class="BODY">If his clients were wavering on whether to appeal the order of
dismissal, he could have in the meantime, but within the thirty-day period,
filed his motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>The truth is that a motion to extend the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period for filing the motion for reconsideration is not authorized or is not in
order</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, it has been held that
"a motion for extension to file a petition for new trial does not stop the
running of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period for perfecting the
appeal" which is also the period for filing the motion for new trial or
reconsi­deration (Gibbs vs. Court of First Instance of Manila, 80 Phil. 160,
164).</p>

<p class="BODY">The period for filing <u>pleadings</u> and submitting the record
on appeal (not notice of appeal and appeal bond) may be extended but the thirty-day
period for appealing may not be extended for the <span style="">purpose of filing the motion for new trial or reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason for not allowing such an extension
is that it is assumed that the preparation of a motion for new trial or reconsideration
</span>would not consume much time since the case had already been tried and
the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> is supposed to be familiar with the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the thirty-day period may be extended for the
purpose of filing the record on appeal because, where the record is voluminous
or the appellant has other pressing matters to attend to, it may not be
practicable to submit the record on appeal within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, had the respondent been more conscientious or
experienced, he could have easily avoided the loss of his clients' right to
appeal by filing the motion for reconsideration within the thirty-day
period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could have even withdrawn
from the case with his clients' consent and required them to get another lawyer
to perfect their appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the fact that the complainants and their six
co-plaintiffs lost the right to appeal would not necessarily mean that they
were damaged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court's order of
dismissal <span style="">has in its favor the
presumption of validity or correctness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, an examination of that order discloses that the trial court
painstakingly studied the motion to dismiss and care­fully rationalized its
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It found that the action was
filed <u>more than forty years</u> after the disputed land was registered in
the name of defendants' predecessor-in-interest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Where a judgment became final through the fault of the lawyer who
did not appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, that fact alone is not a
sufficient ground for the losing party to recover damages from his lawyer since
the action for damages rests "on the unsubstantiated and arbitrary
supposition of the injustice of the decision which became final through the
fault and negligence" of the lawyer (<span class="SpellE">Heredia</span> vs.
Salinas, 10 Phil. 157, 162.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>See <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ventanilla</span></span><span style=""> vs. <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>, 110
Phil. 811, where the lawyer who </span>failed to perfect appeal was ordered to
pay his client two hundred pesos as nominal damages).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>In view of the foregoing</b> and considering complainants'
affidavit of desistance in this case, drastic disciplinary action against the
respondent is not warranted. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>But he is
admonished to exercise care and circumspection in attending to the affairs of
his clients.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A repetition of the same
irregularity will be treated with more severity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A copy of this decision should be attached to
respondent's personal record.</p>
