of the preliminary hearings of said case up to the Supreme Court on appeal, </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">chief counsel thereof"; that he "had actually rendered legal
services to the laborers who are subject of this present litigation [CIR Case

laborers "have voluntarily agreed to give [him], representing his
attorney's fees on contingent basis such amounts equivalent to 25% thereof
which agreement is evidenced by a Note"; and that the 25% attorney's fee
so contracted is "reasonable and proper taking into consideration the length
of services he rendered and the nature of the work actually performed by
him."</p>

above-entitled Case was already decided in their favor, <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span>
Reyes, in behalf of his co-laborers who are also Com­plainants in this Case
begged from the Undersigned Counsel herein that he reduce his attorney's fees
to Twenty-Five Per Cent (25%) only for the reason that they have to share and
satisfy also Atty. Jose Ur. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span> in the
equivalent amount of Five Per Cent (5%) although the latter's actual services
rendered was so insignificant thereof;</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">1. Petitioners press upon this <span style="">Court the view </span>that CIR is bereft of authority to adjudicate <span style="">contractual disputes over </span>attorneys'

<p class="BODY"><span style="">These arguments are

or a tail-end feature of the main case, CIR Case No. 70-ULP-Cebu, which
undoubtedly is within <span class="SpellE">CIR's</span> jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, it has been held that "once the

<blockquote>'While a court may be expressly granted the incidental powers

the necessary and usual incidental powers essential to effectuate it (In re
Stinger's Estate, 201 P. 693), and, subject to existing laws and constitutional

ten to sign the contract only <u>after</u> the receipt of the decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners, on the other hand, contend that the verbal agree­ment
entered into by the union and its officers thru its President Javier and said
two lawyers, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span> and Atty. Fernandez, is
that the 30% attorneys' fees shall be divided equally ("share and share
alike") amongst Atty. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span>, Atty. Fernandez
and <span class="SpellE">Felisberto</span> Javier, the union president.</p>

<st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city> awarded 25% attorneys'
fees to respondent Atty. Fernandez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>CIR
noted that "the active conduct and prosecution of the above-entitled case
was done by Atty. Fernandez up to the appeal in the Supreme Court," and
that petitioner Atty. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span> manifested that
"Atty. Leonardo C. Fernandez was the counsel mainly responsible for the
conduct of the case."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It noted,

<p class="NUM">3. We strike down the alleged oral agreement that the union
president should share in the attorneys' fees.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Canon 34 of Legal <span style="">Ethics
condemns this arrangement in terms clear and explicit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It </span><span style="">says:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">"No division of fees for legal services
is proper, except with another lawyer, based upon a division of service or
respon­sibility."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The union
president is not the attorney for the laborers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He may seek compensation only </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">such president.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An agreement whereby a union president is
allowed to share in attorneys' fees </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">immoral.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a contract we emphatically reject.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be justified.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">4. A contingent fee contract specifying the percentage of recovery
an attorney is to receive in a suit "should be reasonable under all the
circumstances of the case, including the risk and uncertainty of the
compensation, but should always be subject to the supervision of a court, as to
its reasonableness."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>Since then this Court has invariably fixed
counsel fees on a <u>quantum</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>meruit</u></span> basis
whenever the fees stipulated appear excessive, unconscionable, or unreasonable,
because a lawyer is primarily a court officer charged with the duty of
assisting the court in administering impartial justice between the parties, and
hence, the fees should be subject to judicial control.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor should it be ignored that sound public
policy demands that courts disregard stipulations for counsel fees, when­ever
they appear to be a source of speculative profit at the expense of the debtor
or mortgagor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>See, <span class="SpellE">Gorospe</span>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the stipulated 30% attorneys' <span style="">fee <span style="">is

</span>With the exception of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Arsenio</span></span><span style=""> </span>Reyes

were illegally and arbitrarily deprived of their just pay, these laborers
looked up to the <span style="">favorable </span>money
judgment <span style="">as a </span>serum to their
pitiful economic malaise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A thirty per
cent (30%) slice <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> immensely dilutes the
palliative ingredient of this judicial antidote.</p>

<p class="BODY">The ten complainants involved herein are mere laborers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is
</span>not far-fetched to assume that they have not reached an educational attainment
comparable to that of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span> or
respondent Fernandez who, on the other hand, are lawyers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of the inequality of the situation
between laborers and lawyers, courts should go slow in awarding huge sums by
way of attorneys' fees based solely on contracts.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
For, as in the present case, the real objective of the CIR judgment in CIR Case
No. 70-ULP-Cebu is to benefit the complainant laborers who were <span class="SpellE">unjustifiedly</span> dismissed from service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is true that laborers should not be
allowed to develop that atavistic proclivity to bite the hands that fed them,
still lawyers should not be permitted to get a lion's share of the benefits due
by reason of a worker's labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is
to be paid to the laborers is not a windfall but a product of the sweat of
their brow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contracts for legal services
between laborer and attorney should then be zealously scrutinized to the end
that a fair share of the benefits be not denied the former.</p>

<p class="NUM">5. An examination of the record of this case will readily show
that an award of twenty-five per cent (25%) attorneys' fees reasonably
compensates the whole of the legal services rendered in CIR Case No.
70-ULP-Cebu.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fee must be shared by
petitioner Atty. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span> and respondent Atty.
Fernandez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, after <span style="">all, </span>they are the counsel of record
of the complainants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Atty.
Fernandez cannot deny this fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
pleadings filed even at the early stages of the proceedings reveal the
existence of an association between said attorneys.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pleadings were filed under the name of
"Fernandez &amp; <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span>." This imports a
common effort of the two.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be
denied though that most of those pleadings up to judgment were signed for
Fernandez &amp; <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span> by respondent Fernandez.</p>

<p class="BODY">We note that a break-up in the professional tie-up between
Attorneys Fernandez and <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span> began when
petitioner Atty. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span>, on <st1:date year="1962" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1962</st1:date>, complained to CIR that
respondent Atty. Fernandez "failed to communicate with him nor to inform
him about the incidents of this case."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He there requested that he be furnished "separately copies of the
decision of the court and other pleadings and subsequent orders as well as
motions in connection with the case."</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequent pleadings filed in the case unmistakably show the widening
rift in their professional relationship.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, on <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="5">May 23, 1963</st1:date>,
a "Motion to Name and Authorize Official Computer" was filed with
CIR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day, a "Motion to
Issue Writ of Execution" was also registered in the same court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although filed under the name of "<span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span> &amp; Fernandez," these pleadings were
signed solely by petitioner Atty. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1963</st1:date>,
an "Opposition to respondent <span class="SpellE">Biscom's</span> Motion for
Reconsideration" was filed by petitioner Atty. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="9">September
 24, 1963</st1:date>, he filed a "Motion for Clarification" of the <st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="11">November 13, 1962</st1:date> judgment of CIR
regarding the basic pay of <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> Reyes and Fidel <span class="SpellE">Magtubo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="9">September 24, 1963</st1:date>, he also filed a
"Motion to Reconsider Report of Chief Examiner."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These, and other pleadings that were <span style="">filed </span>later were signed <span style="">solely by </span>petitioner Atty. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span>, not in the name of "<span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span>
&amp; Fernandez."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it was
correctly observed by CIR that a good portion of the court battle was fought by
respondent Atty. Fernandez, yet CIR cannot close its eyes <span style="">to the legal services also rendered by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For,
important and numerous, too, were his services.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And, they are not negligible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
conclusion is inevitable that petitioner Atty. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span>
must have a share in the twenty-five per cent (25%) attorneys' fees awarded
herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to how much, this is a
function pertaining to CIR.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
