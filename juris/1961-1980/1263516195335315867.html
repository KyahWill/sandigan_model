				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Challenged on appeal is the correctness of the order of the Court
of First Instance of Manila denying appellant's motion to intervene in a case
of unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The controlling facts are:</p>

<p class="BODY">Since August, 1958, defendant <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> <span class="SpellE">Dolla</span> has been the lessee of two doors of plaintiff's
building located at <st1:street><st1:address>362-364 <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
  Boulevard</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lease was on a month-to-month basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Latest rental was P1, 500 per month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant utilized the premises for her
bakery business.</p>

<p class="BODY">By a deed of sale of February 14, 1966 for P700,000.00, plaintiff
Elisa Medina Cue sold to Philippine Savings Bank (PSB, for short) the land and
building which included the premises leased by defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That deed covenanted that plaintiff was to
deliver possession of the premises sold, free from all tenants and occupants,
on or before</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1966</st1:date>,
failing which the sum of P80,000.00 retained by the bank shall be forfeited to
the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same date, <st1:date year="1966" day="14" month="2">February
 14, 1966</st1:date>, plaintiff wrote defendant advising her of the foregoing
sale to PSB and acquainting her of the conditions thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Request was there made that defendant signify
her willingness to vacate the premises before May 31, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This request was refused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff, on March 7, 1966, notified
defendant of the termination of the lease as of the end of March, 1966 and
demanded that she vacate on or before said date.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon defendant's failure to vacate, <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
suit was, by a complaint dated May 4, 1966, lodged against defendant in the
city court.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Defendant's answer, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, sought
protection of Article 1687 of the Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">The city court, on June 18, 1966, rendered judgment
"allowing the defendant to stay and continue occupying the premises for
one year from the date of this judgment and to vacate the premises after said
period, provided she <span class="SpellE">continuesto</span> pay the agreed
rentals" and "should the defendant fail to pay the agreed monthly
rentals, she will lose her right to the one year period allowed her to stay in
the premises and she shall be ordered to vacate the premises."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both parties appealed to the court of first
instance.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Before trial proceeded in the last named court came <span class="SpellE">PSB's</span> motion to intervene, to which was annexed its
complaint in intervention, both filed on November 10, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its said complaint, PSB joined in plainÂ­tiff's
prayer to eject defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But because
of the purchase price (P700,000.00) and the increased value of real estate in
general, PSB sought as reasonable compensation for the use and occupation of
the premises, P14, 000.00 per month.</p>

<p class="BODY">On defendant's opposition, the court rejected the intervention in
its order of December 15, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Advanced
by the trial court as reasons for denial are that: (1) failure to intervene in
the city court is fatal; and (2) intervention "at this stage would be
creating new issues which were not passed upon by the lower Court."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">PSB's</span> motion to reconsider failed of
its purpose; the court below denied it on February 24, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>PSB then appealed direct to this Court.</p>

<blockquote>1. There is no denying the fact that intervention was sought while
the case was on appeal, but before trial, in the court of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But would this situation bar intervention?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This brings us to the question of whether the term <u>trial</u>
mentioned in Section 2, Rule 12 of the Rules of Court encompasses trial <u>de</u>
<u>novo</u> conducted by a court of first instance in a case on appeal from the
city court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our view is that it
does.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, under Section 9, Rule 40 of
the Rules of Court, a "perfected appeal" from the city court to the
court of first instance "shall operate to vacate the judgment" of the
city court, "and the action when duly docketed in the Court of First
Instance shall stand for trial <u>de</u> <u>novo</u> upon its merits in
accordance with the regular procedure in that court, as though the same had
never been tried before and had been originally there commenced."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
This simply means that "all the proceedings had" in the city court,
"including the judgment, do not in contemplation of law exist, they having
been vacated."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
If In fact, in the court of first instance the appealed case is to be tried
without regard to the evidence presented in the inferior court, or for that
matter, the conclusions reached by the judge thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidence must be presented anew.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, it is solely on this evidence that
judgment of the court of first instance is to be predicated.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Since all the proceedings in the inferior court including the
judgment are inexistent, and trial <u>de</u> <u>novo</u> must be held, common
sense dictates that before trial in the court of first instance, PSB may be
permitted to intervene.</p>

<blockquote>2. The lower court misconceives the effect of intervention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such intervention will not, contrary to its
view, change the nature of the cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Intervenor</span> merely joined hands with
plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff's cause of action,
namely, that of ejectment, is there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
remains the same - even with the intervention.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is defendant's insistent plea, however, that the amount
demanded as reasonable compensation cannot be increased from P1, 500 per month
as sought by plaintiff, to P14, 000 per month as asked by <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
PSB.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Mapua</u></span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>vs</u>. <u>Suburban</u> <u>Theaters</u>, <u>Inc</u>.,
87 Phil. 358, is a sufficient answer to defendant's contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, plaintiff was allowed to increase the
amount of damages it prayed for in the inferior court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this, because the cause of action remains
the same - that of <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>, and the money claim is
"merely an incident to and flows from the cause of action" litigated
in the inferior court.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
It will not avail defendant any to say that in <span class="SpellE"><u>Mapua</u></span>,
it was plaintiff, not an <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>, who was
authorized to increase the amount of damages averred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The point is that such increase by a party
can be made without in any way affecting the cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It bears remembering that in <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> it is not the amount of rentals or damages for
occupancy that confers jurisdiction on the inferior court but the nature of the
action.</p>

<p class="BODY">No one may quibble over the existence of the court's discretion
on whether to admit or reject intervention.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
But such discretion is not unlimited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
we assess the bank's position:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>its
desire to obtain prompt possession of the premises to construct a branch office
therein, its investment thereon, and the prejudice it will suffer by a delay in
the delivery of the premises under its deed of sale, we reach the conclusion
that the discretion of the trial court had not been here prudently exercised.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>CONFORMABLY TO THE FOREGOING</b>, the order of the court below
of December 15, 1966 refusing intervention of the Philippine Savings Bank, and
that of February 24, 1967 denying said bank's motion for reconsideration, are
hereby reversed and set aside; and said court is hereby directed to allow the
intervention of the said bank and to admit its complaint in intervention.</p>
