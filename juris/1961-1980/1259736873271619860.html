				<BR><BR><div align=""><div align="justify"><br><p>This case was filed by the appellees to recover from the appellants the 
possession and ownership of two parcels of land, one situated in Kananga, Leyte, 
and another one in Ormoc City. After hearing, the Court of First Instance of 
Leyte rendered judgment declaring appellees the owners of the land. From that 
judgment appellants appealed to the Court of Appeals but the latter Court 
certified the case to us as the facts are not in dispute and the issues raised 
are question of law.</p>
<p>The two lots in question, Lot No. 10375 and Lot No. 7924 of the Ormoc 
Cadastre, were conjugal properties of appellee Marciana Villocino and Bartolome 
Rodriguez, now deceased. Without the knowledge of his wife, Rodriguez sold on 
August 7, 1951 one half of Lot No. 10375 and on December 20, 1951 the whole of 
Lot No. 7924 to the appellant Pedro Doyon. He sold two other lots to Emilia 
Conui Vda. de Aviles, also without the knowledge of his wife. Rodriguez made the 
sales even as his wife and son, the other appellee herein, Protasio Rodriguez, 
were seeking in Civil Case No. 549 of the Leyte Court of First Instance a change 
of administration of the conjugal partnership.</p>
<p>In its decision in Civil Case No. 549, the court found that the husband, who 
was living with a concubine, had sold four parcels of land without the knowledge 
and consent of his wife and, for this reason, placed all properties of the 
conjugal partnership under the latter&gt;s administration. Later, these lots 
were to be included in the order of execution but, on motion of appellant Doyon 
and Emilia Conui Vda. de Aviles, the other vendee, the court excluded the lots 
from execution. On September 6, 1957, appellant Doyon sold Lot No. 7924 to the 
other appellant, Atty. Cleto P. Evangelista, who represented him in Civil Case 
No. 549.</p>
<p>On June 30, 1959, appellees filed this case against appellant Doyon to 
recover the possession and ownership of the lots in question. Appellant 
Evangelista intervened, claiming ownership of Lot No. 7924. In declaring 
appellees owners of the land, the court said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is to be noted that when the late Bartolome Rodriguez sold the two 
parcels of land, the consent of the wife, Marciana Villocino, had not been 
secured so that pursuant to Article 166 of the new Civil Code, the sale of the 
defendant (Doyon) is null and void<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup>; 
consequently the sale by the defendant to the intervenor ^Evangelista^ has no 
force and effect."</p></blockquote>
<p>Appellants contend that since the lots in this case were acquired by appellee 
Villocino and her late husband before the effectivity of the new Civil Code, the 
sales in this case should be governed by the provisions of the Spanish Civil 
Code. It is then urged that, under article 1413 of the latter Code, the husband 
has the power to alienate property of the conjugal partnership even without the 
consent of his wife.</p>
<p>Indeed, article 166 of the new Civil Code provides that—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Unless the wife has been declared a <i>non compos mentis</i> or a 
spendthrift, or is under civil interdiction or is confined in a leprosarium, the 
husband cannot alienate or encumber any real property of the conjugal 
partnership without the wife's consent. If she refuses unreasonably to give her 
consent, the court may compel her to grant the same.</p>
<p>"This article shall not apply to property acquired by the conjugal 
partnership before the effective date of this Code."</p></blockquote>
<p>while the Spanish Civil Code provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ART. 1413. In addition to his powers as manager the husband may for valuable 
consideration alienate and encumber the property of the conjugal partnership 
without the consent of the wife.</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, no alienation or agreement which the husband may make with 
respect to such property in contravention of this code or in fraud of the wife 
shall prejudice her or her heirs."</p></blockquote>
<p>But while we agree with appellants that the consent of the wife (appellee 
Villocino) was not necessary for the validity of her husband's sale because the 
lots sold had been acquired by the couple before August 30, 1950 when the new 
Code took effect (Tabunan<i> v</i>. Marigmen, 101 Phil. 288 [1957], it is 
nevertheless true that even under the former law the husband's power to alienate 
properties of the conjugal partnership is not without limitation. (Simbre 
<i>v</i>. Agustin, 55 O.G. 5016 [1958]; Liguez <i>v</i>. Court of Appeals, 54 
O.G. 4261 [1957]. See also Harden <i>v</i>. Peña, 87 Phil. 609 [1950] For one 
thing, such power, as we have seen, cannot be exercised to the prejudice of the 
wife or her heirs. What is more, alienations made without the knowledge of the 
wife are presumed to be in fraud of her. (Simbre <i>v</i>. Agustin, 
<i>supra</i>; <i>Tabunan v. Marigmen</i>, <i>supra</i>) For, as conjugal 
properties belong equally to husband and wife, any alienation made by the 
husband without the consent of his wife prejudices her in so far as it includes 
a part or the whole of the wife's half and is, to that extent, invalid. (Baello 
<i>v</i>. Villanueva, 54 Phil. 213 [1930])</p>
<p>Indeed, in Civil Case No. 549 of the Court of First Instance of Leyte, the 
administration of the conjugal partnership was transferred to appellee Villocino 
precisely because the court found that the late Bartolome Rodriguez had 
fraudulently disposed of conjugal properties (among which were the lots in 
question) without the knowledge and consent of his wife. Thus, in the decision 
in that case, the court said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Es evidente que el marido Bartolome Rodriguez ha abusado de los poderes que 
tenia como administrador de los bienes de la sociedad de gananciales al disponer 
de cuatro parcelas gananciales sin conocimiento ni consentimiento de mujer y 
gastar para su propio beneficio exclusivamente de las cantidades recibidas como 
precio de venta. De permitir que Bartolome Rodriguez continua siendo 
administrador, podria continuar disponiendo de todas las propiedades de la 
socieded conyugal en perjuicio de su esposa."</p></blockquote>
<p>This excerpt from the decision in Civil Case No. 549 should likewise answer 
appellants' contention that the present case was filed as an action for recovery 
of possession and ownership, not for the annulment of sale, and that the issue 
of fraud was never put in issue by the pleadings. The parties to this case 
entered into a stipulation of facts in which they asked the trial court to 
consider among other things, the decision in Civil Case No. 549. The above 
quotation from the decision in that case clearly shows that fraud against the 
wife was in issue. Moreover, as this Court once said, "It may be that the 
recovery of title and possession of the lot was the ultimate objective of 
plaintiffs, but to attain that goal, they must need first travel over the road 
of relief on the ground of fraud." (Rone <em>v</em>. Claro, 91 Phil. 250, 253 
[1952]) We therefore hold that the sale of Lots No. 10375 (1/2) and 7924 to 
appellant Doyon and the subsequent transfer of Lot No. 7924 by appellant Doyon 
to appellant Evangelista are invalid to the extent that the rights of appellee 
Villocino to one half are affected. Since any prejudice to the wife can be 
determined only after the liquidation of the conjugal partnership, the sales in 
question should be deemed subject to such contingency which should be noted in 
the corresponding certificate of title, (Baello <i>v</i>. Villanueva, 
<i>supra</i>; Tabunan <i>v</i>. Marigmen, <i>supra</i>) The Court is aware that 
only one half of Lot No, 10375 had been sold and that in all probability the 
wife'8 share has not been affected but considering that the other lot (Lot No. 
7924) is unregistered, it is believed that the annotation of the condition on 
the certificate of title covering Lot No. 10375 is necessary to compensate for 
the lack of registration of the other lot.</p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, with the modification that the invalidity of the sales to 
appellants shall be deemed subject to the outcome of the liquidation of the 
oonjugal partnership and that, in the meantime, this condition should be noted 
in the certificate of title covering Lot No. 10375, the decision appealed from 
is affirmed, with costs against appellants.</p><i>Concepcion, C.J., Reyes,
