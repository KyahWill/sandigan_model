of the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission in RO6-WCU Case No.
129100 which reversed the award made by the Acting Labor Referee in favor of
the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">Salvador Flores, the deceased husband of the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Dulce</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Flores, was first
employed by respondent <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> South Express, Inc.,
(formerly known as <span class="SpellE">Alatco</span>) way back in 1952.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the course of his employment, he occupied
different positions, such as driver, driver-conductor, dispatcher, checker and
later on, as line inspector for which he received a monthly salary of
P321.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1970, Salvador Flores, got
sick of <u>cardio respiratory arrest</u> due to<u> myocardial infarction,
bronchial asthma</u> and <u>acute <span class="SpellE">broncho</span>-pneumonia</u>
for which he was treated and confined at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Briola</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in <span class="SpellE">Daet</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>
Norte.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a few weeks, he was able to
return to his work but on an off and on basis.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1972" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1972</st1:date>
respondent <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> terminated <st1:place>Flores</st1:place>'
employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="7" month="7">July 7, 1974</st1:date>, <st1:place>Flores</st1:place>'
ailments recurred until he finally died on <st1:date year="1974" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
due time his widow, the petitioner herein, filed a claim for death benefits,
for herself and in behalf of her minor children, Salvador, Oscar, <span class="SpellE">Salvio</span>, Sally, Salve and Sandy, all surnamed Flores.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She attached to the said claim the
physician's report and her affidavit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> did not controvert the
claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But notwithstanding the non-<span class="SpellE">controversion</span> of the claim, the Acting Labor Referee
conducted a hearing of the petition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>During the hearing, although allowed to cross-examine the witnesses for
the claimants, counsel for respondent <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>
waived the presentation of any evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="18" month="8">August 18, 1975</st1:date>,
the Acting Labor Referee rendered an award, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which, reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, AWARD is hereby rendered in favor of the claimants
and the respondent is hereby ordered to pay the following:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 63pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the claimants, thru this Office, the sum
of SIX THOUSAND (P6,000.00) PESOS by way of compensation, plus TWO HUNDRED
(P200.00) PESOS as reimbursement for burial ex<span style="">penses;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 63pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the widow, thru this Office, the further
sum of FIFTY THREE &amp; 60/100 (P53.60) PESOS as reimbursement for medical exÂ­penses;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 63pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Atty. Jose B. Corral, <span class="SpellE">Daet</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte, the sum of P300.00 as attorney's
fee;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 63pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To this office, the sum of P61.00 as office
fee, pursuant to Section 55 of the law."</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>
moved to reconsider the award made by the Acting Labor Referee but the motion
for reconsideration was denied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly the record of the case was elevated to the respondent
Commission for review.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1976</st1:date>,
the respondent Commission reversed the award made by the Acting Labor Referee
in favor of petitioner on the ground that the petitioner has failed to
establish the causal connection between the deceased's employment with that of
his alleged ailments and his subsequent death.</p>

<p class="BODY">We disagree.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sufficiently established by the evidence is the fact that the
deceased became sick of <u>cardio respiratory arrest</u> due to <u>myocardial
infarction, bronchial asthma</u> and <u>acute bronchopneumonia</u> in 1970
while he was still in the employ of respondent <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same ailments recurred on <st1:date year="1974" day="7" month="7">July 7, 1974</st1:date> causing his death on <st1:date year="1974" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a well settled rule that once an
ailment has supervened in the course of one's employment, there exists a <span class="SpellE">rebuttable</span> presumption that the same arose out or was at
least aggravated by such employment and the burden to overthrow such
presumption shifts to the employer.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The claimant is thus relieved from the burden of showing
causation.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Under the circumstances, the claimant need not prove his case to the point of
demonstration for it is only sufficient to show that the hypothesis upon which
he bases his claim is probable.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, "the precise medical cause of the illness is not legally
significant, as long as the illness supervened in the course of
employment."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, the respondent Republic failed to discharge the burden of
overthrowing the said presumption established by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not even bother to controvert the
claim of the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such absence
of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> is indeed fatal to any defense that
the employer may interpose<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
and the same constitutes a constructive admission of the compensability of the
claim.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is claimed by respondent <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>
that the claim of petitioner is out of time because under Section 8 of the
Workmen's Compensation Act,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
the death of an employee is compensable if the same occurs within two years from
the date he contracted the sickness or received the injury as provided in
Section 2 thereof<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
which caused his death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at
bar, respondent <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> points out Salvador Flores
contracted his ailments in 1970 while his death <span class="SpellE">occured</span>
on <st1:date year="1974" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners should have filed their claim
within two (2) years from 1970.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>Central</u>
<span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span> Don Pedro vs. De Leon<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court already held that the two-year period should be counted from the
date the disease or illness becomes compensable or from the time the employeeâs
sickness renders him physically disabled to do the work, thus rejecting a
literal interpretaÂ­tion of the wording of the law that the two-year period
should be reckoned with from the time the sickness is contracted or the injury is
caused resulting in death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same view
was subsequently adopted in <u>International Oil Factory vs. <span class="SpellE">Doria</span>, et al</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
It was shown during the hearing before the Acting Labor Referee that the
deceased had occasionally suffered from his ailment which started in 1970 and
which persisted until the respondent <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>
terminated his services on <st1:date year="1972" day="30" month="9">September
 30, 1972</st1:date> due to the condition of his health.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the hearing respondent <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>
did not bother to present any evidence to the contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True, counsel for respondent <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> had caused certain exhibits to be marked but he
did not submit the same formally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
only after the Acting Labor Referee had granted the award that respondent <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> showed interest in opposing the claim by filing a
motion for reconsideration, appeal and/or review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its main thrust in its motion for
reconsideration is that the death of the deceased is not compensable because he
did not become disabled while he was under its employ and that his ailment was
contracted after he was already separated from the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True it is that in support of its motion for
reconsideration, respondent <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> attached
thereto an alleged deed of quitclaim signed by the deceased, Salvador Flores;
the letter of the President of the respondent <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>
dated September 30, 1972 terminating the services of Salvador Flores; the
separation pay voucher; and the letter dated July 7, 1973 of Salvador Flores to
the General Manager of respondent <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> seeking
reinstatement to his former position as line inspector.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, said documents can be of no
evidentiary value as the same were not at all formally presented during the
hearing of the case before the Acting Labor Referee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is claimed by respondent <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
that it has, through counsel filed a motion asking for five days from <st1:date year="1975" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1975</st1:date>, to submit its evidence
by way of written affidavits together with the documents already marked during
the trial of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said motion was
granted by the Acting Labor Referee in his Order dated <st1:date year="1975" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1975</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
However, counsel for respondent <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> failed to
submit the evidence mentioned in said motion within the five-day period granted
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, for all legal intents and
purposes, no evidence has been presented by respondent <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>
and the documents marked during the hearing and attached to the motion for
reconsideÂ­ration, appeal and/or review cannot be considered at all; and, We
have no other alternative but to consider the case strictly in accordance with
the evidence formally submitted and admitted during the hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since according to the evidence on record the
deceased was separated from the service of the respondent <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>
on <st1:date year="1972" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1972</st1:date> due
to ill-health, said date should be considered as the time the sickness of the
deceased has rendered him physically disabled to work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he died therefore on <st1:date year="1974" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1974</st1:date> from the same ailments,
it is obvious that his death occurred within the two-year period from the time
he became disabled to work.</p>
