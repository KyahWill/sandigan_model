and the Bureau of Customs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff appealed from the order of dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The first question
regarding the suability of </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="">de</span>fendants</st1:placename> <st1:placetype><span style="">Republic</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> </span>of the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> </span>and the Bureau of Customs has been
squarely passed upon and resolved in the <u>Mobil</u> case, supra.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As We held therein, the Bureau of Cus<span style="">toms, in operating </span><span style="">the</span><span style=""> </span>arrastre <span style="">service </span>itself,
does so in the performance <span style="">of </span><span style="">a <span style="">necessary incident </span></span><span style="">to </span>the <span style="">prime governmental function </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">taxation,
and, </span><span style="">as
</span><span style="">such</span>,<span style=""> </span><span style="">is not suable for </span><span style="">alleged </span>losses resulting there<span style="">from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="">A</span></u><span style=""> </span></span><u><span style="">fortiori</span></u><span style=""> </span>neither is the Republic suable for<span style=""> said activity of the Bureau of Customs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant<span style=""> </span> would </span>however next take issue with the
statement in the <u>Mobil</u> case that plaintiff therein should have filed its
claim thru the Auditor General, it being for money, under <span style="">the </span>provisions of <span style="">Co</span>mmonwea<span style="">l</span><span style="">th </span><span style="">Act 327.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is now urged that the claims for that may be filed with the Auditor
General under said law, in relation to Act No. 3083, are only those accounts
subject to liquidation by an arithmetical computation and only where the
liability of the Government </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">not
In issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant cites Compañia
General de Tabacos v. French, </span><span style="">39
</span><span style="">Phil. 34.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The principle recognized in the <u>Compañia General de Tabacos</u>
case, supra, was that a money claim for damages the amount of which cannot be
readily determined from vouchers, reports or other means within reach of
accounting officers, but calls for the application of judgment and discretion
upon the measure of damages, is not within the competence of<span style=""> </span>the Auditor General to decide<span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In
the present case, the amount of the claim is alre<span style="">a</span>dy fixed and is readily determ<span style="">i</span>nable from the bills of lading and other shipping papers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, such <span style="">a </span>claim should be addressed to the
Auditor General.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither did said case, <u>Compañia General de Tabacos</u> hold<span style=""> </span>that<span style=""> </span>where the liability of the Government is in issue, the claim
cannot be filed with the Auditor General.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is precisely for the Auditor General to determine whether the claim
is tenable or not, and if not to deny the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">The real issue in said <u>Tabacalera</u> case was whether the
Auditor General (then Insular Auditor) may offset against a specific,
liquidated and undisputed debt of the Government, an unliquidated claim for
damages in favor of the Government against the creditor; and the ruling stated
that he not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such ruling does not apply
to bar a case, like the present, where no question of offset is involved, but
simply that, of allowing or disallowing a specific and liquidated claim against
the Go­vernment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather, it in effect
sustains the power of the Auditor General to take cognizance of such a claim,
for if the <span style="">same
</span>be found in order and allowable, the <u>amount</u> recoverable is fixed
and liquidated, as determined or readily determinable from papers and invoices
available to him, instead of being subject to his dis­cretion, as would be the
case in an unliquidated claim for damages.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Stated otherwise, where
the <u>existence</u> of a <u>specific</u> and <u>fixed debt</u> is the issue,
the Auditor General has po­wer to act on the claim; but when not only the <u>existence</u>
but also the, amount of an <u>unfixed and undetermined debt</u> is involved,
said official has no competence to consider such a claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The present case is of the first kind, the
assertion of the existence of a specific and fixed indebtedness on the part of
the Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should therefore be
lodged with the Auditor General.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed order <span style="">of </span>dismissal is here­by
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
