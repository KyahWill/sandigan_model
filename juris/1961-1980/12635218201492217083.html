THE HON. JOSE L. GONZALEZ, IN HIS CAPACITY AS MUNICIPAL JUDGE OF SURIGAO, SURIGAO DEL NORTE, THE

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On August 30, 1965 Rosario R. Calderon filed with the municipal
court of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>
del Norte, presided by Judge Jose L. Gonzalez (hereinafter referred to as the
respondent judge), a criminal complaint<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
for serious physical injuries through reckless imprudence against Dr. Jose G. <span class="SpellE">Geotina</span> (hereinafter referred to as the petitioner) and <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Kierulf</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After conducting the requisite preliminary
examination, the respondent judge dismissed the criminal action as to <span class="SpellE">Kierulf</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
he ordered the arrest of the peti­tioner, fixing the bond for his provisional
liberty at P300.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1965</st1:date>
the petitioner filed a motion to disqualify the respondent judge from hearing
the criminal case, alleging as ground <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> the
relationship of the latter to the complainant Calderon within the sixth civil
degree by affinity - a disqualification explicitly spelled out in section 1 of
Rule 137 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
section pertinently states:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Disqualification
of judges</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- No judge or judicial
officer shall sit in any case ... in which he is related to either party within
the sixth degree of consanguinity or affinity... com­puted according to the
rules of the civil law..."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner established the relationship of the complainant
Calderon to the respondent judge thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The husband of Calderon and the respondent judge have common great
grandparents - Juan Gon­zalez and Ramona Rodriguez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Juan and Ramona Gonzalez begot two children -
<span class="SpellE">Pantaleona</span> and Simon.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Pantaleona</span> married Luis Calderon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The spouses Luis and <span class="SpellE">Pantaleona</span>
begot a son whom they also named Luis.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The son Luis married Rosario <span class="SpellE">Zerda</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Luis and Rosario Calderon begot a son, <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>, who married another Rosario, the complainant in
the criminal action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand,
Simon Gonzalez married <span class="SpellE">Geronima</span> Samson.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The spouses Simon and <span class="SpellE">Geronima</span>
begot a son, Ricardo, who married <span class="SpellE">Visitacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The couple,
Ricardo and <span class="SpellE">Visitacion</span> Gonzalez, begot a son - Jose,
the respondent judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">The motion for disqualification, opposed by the respondent
provincial fiscal, was denied by the respondent judge upon the ground that he
bears no relationship either to the plaintiff, the People of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
or to the defendant, Dr. Jose G. <span class="SpellE">Geotina</span> (petitioner
and appellant herein) - the only parties he considers as litigants in the
criminal case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent judge also
considered the complainant Calderon as a mere witness in the criminal action,
not a party within the contemplation of section 1 of Rule 137.</p>

<p class="BODY">Twice, on <st1:date year="1965" day="6" month="11">November 6,
 1965</st1:date> and on <st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1966</st1:date>,
the petitioner moved for reconsideration of the order denying his motion for
disqualification, to no avail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So the
petitioner, on April 4, 1966, filed with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del Norte a petition for prohibition with
preliminary injunction, seeking (1) the annulment of the orders denying his
motion for disqualifi­cation and motions for reconsideration, and (2) the
issuance of an order directing the respondent judge to cease and desist from
trying the criminal action.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="12" month="4">April 12, 1966</st1:date>
the respondent provincial fiscal moved for the dismissal of the petition,
alleging as ground <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> lack of cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1966</st1:date>
the Court of First Instance issued an order dismissing the petition, holding
that</p>

<blockquote>“... the provisions of Sec. 2, Rule 137 of the New Rules of Court,
are clear and specific to the effect that no appeal shall be taken of the
determina­tion of the Judge affected in favor of his competency until after the
case has been decided by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is,
therefore, clear that up to this moment the petitioner cannot and should not
have filed this case in this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
should await the decision of the municipal Judge who has resolved in favor of
his com­petency to try said criminal case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is only in the event that the municipal Judge renders a decision of
conviction when the counsel should take the necessary steps to protect his
client."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1966</st1:date>
the court <u>a quo</u> rejected the petitioner's motion for reconsideration of <st1:date year="1966" day="7" month="5">May 7, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Resolution of the central issue posed by the present appeal
requires a determination of whether the petitioner (the defendant in the
criminal complaint) may avail of a special civil action for prohibition to restrain
the respondent judge, allegedly disqualified to sit in the case, from hearing
the criminal action, independently of the remedy of appeal provided for by
section 2 of Rule 137 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner specifically imputes error to the court <u>a quo</u>
in the latter's (1) treating his petition for prohibition as an appeal from the
orders of the respondent judge denying his motion for disqualification and
subsequent motions for reconsideration, and (2) applying section 2 of Rule 137
as basis for dismissing his peti­tion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioner argues that the lower court failed to regard the special
civil action for prohibition as the proper remedy in the case at bar,
considering that the respondent judge, despite his disqualification, insisted
on hearing the criminal case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
insistence, according to the petitioner, constitutes grave abuse of discretion
amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioner adds that appeal in this instance is not a speedy and
adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the respondents rest their case solely on the
provisions of section 2 of Rule 137.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They contend that appeal after final judgment in the criminal action is
the proper remedy available to the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">It thus behooves us to inquire into the coverage and intend­ment
of sections 1 and 2 of Rule 137 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<blockquote>Section 1 reads:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SECTION 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Disqualification
of judges</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- No judge or judicial
officer shall sit in any case in which he, or his wife or child, is <span class="SpellE">pecuniarily</span> interested as heir, legatee, creditor or
otherwise, or in which he is related to either party within the sixth degree of
consanguinity or affinity, or to counsel within the fourth degree, computed
according to the rules of the civil law, or in which he has been executor,
administrator, guardian, trustee or counsel, or in which he has presided in any
inferior court when his ruling or decision is the subject of review, without
the written consent of all parties in interest, signed by them and entered upon
the record.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A judge may, in the exercise of his sound discretion,
disqualify himself from sitting in a case, for just or valid reasons other than
those mentioned above."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Section 2 provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Objection
that judge disqualified, how made and effect</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- If it be claimed that an official is
disqualified from sitting as above pro­vided, the party objecting to his
competency may, in writing, file with the official his objection, stating the
grounds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, and the official shall thereupon
proceed with the trial, or withdraw <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, in
accordance with his determination of the question of his disqualification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His deci­sion shall be forthwith made in
writing and filed with the other papers in the case, but no appeal or stay
shall be allowed from, or by reason of, his decision in favor of his own
competency, until after final judgment in the case."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The intendment of section 1 is incontestably that a judge,
sitting in a case, must at all times be wholly free, disinterested, impartial
and independent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Elementary due process
requires a hearing before an impartial and disinterested tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A judge has both the duty of rendering a just
decision and the duty of doing it in a manner completely free from suspicion as
to its fairness and as to his integrity.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
To effect this intendment fully, section 1 enumerates the grounds for the
disqualification of a judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first paragraph of section 1 refers exclusively to legal
grounds for challenging a judge's competency.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The second paragraph thereof authorizes a judge to inhibit himself
voluntarily, in the absence of any challenge from either party, on good, sound
or ethical grounds,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
or for just and valid reasons other than those mentioned in the first
paragraph.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same second paragraph
leaves the matter of disqualification to the sound discretion of the judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 2 prescribes the procedure to be followed by a litigant
seeking the disqualification of a judge based on any of the grounds enumerated
in section 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 2 purports to
protect the judge who falls within the compass of any of the prohibitory
provisions of section 1 from any misunderstanding as to his judicial actua­tions.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, the section requires the objection to be stated in writing, with the
ground <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> stated therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same sec­tion then requires the judge to
make a determination of his com­petency, and to proceed with the trial of the
case or to withdraw <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, in accordance with
such determination.</p>

<p class="BODY">If a party objects to the qualification of a judge based on the
ground of relationship to a party to the case within the prohibited degree and
the challenged judge denies such relationship and rules in favor of his own
competency, then the judge has no recourse but to proceed with the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such an event, section 2 allows no appeal
from or stay of the determination of the judge in favor of his competency until
after final judgment in the main case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This rule allowing a challenged judge to continue to try a case as well
applies in those instances when a party objects to the judge's competency on
circumstances not constitutive of legal grounds for disqualification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>rationale</u> for the rule is that a
judge is duty bound not to sit in the trial of a given case if legally dis­qualified,
and to proceed with the trial and decision of the case if not legally
disqualified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"He cannot shirk the
responsibility without the risk of being called upon to account for his derelic­tion."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The remedy of the aggrieved party, in the first case, consists of a challenge
against the determination made by the judge of his competency in the appeal
from the principal case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the latter
case, where a judge, not legally disqualified under the first paragraph of
section 1, does not inhibit himself, the aggrieved party still has a right to
relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it appears that the aggrieved
party was the victim of an unfair and partial trial be­cause of the judge's
bias or prejudice, this Court will not hesitate to order a new trial, if
necessary, in the interest of justice.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The prohibitory provision embodied in section 2 against an appeal
from or stay of the proceedings undoubtedly applies in all civil cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For in the said cases, the party aggrieved,
in his appeal to the proper court from the final judgment rendered in the main
case, may raise the question of the correctness of the determination by the
judge of his competency to sit in the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In criminal cases, the same rule applies where the accused seeks the
disqualification of the judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this
case, the accused, in the event of his conviction, has the opportunity to
question the judge's ruling on his competency in his appeal from the decision
on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the event of his
acquittal, the accused has no cause for complaint against the judge's ruling of
non-disqualifi­cation.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Where, however, the prosecution or the offended party seeks the
judge's disqualification, the restriction finds no appli­cation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For where the judge decides in favor of his
own com­petency, proceeds to try the case, and renders a verdict of acquittal,
the prosecution or offended party has neither the right to appeal nor any
plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law to have the
ruling of the judge on the motion seeking his disqualification reviewed on
appeal,"... since no appeal from the judgment of acquittal could possibly
be taken by the prosecu­tion by virtue of the double jeopardy provision of the
Constitution."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, resort to the extraordinary remedies or special civil actions of
prohibition and <i>certiorari</i> constitutes the only means available to the
prosecution or the offended party for the review by a superior court of the
judge's denial of the motion seeking his disqualification on existing and valid
legal grounds.</p>

<p class="BODY">Reverting now to the case at bar, one circumstance stands out and
commands our attention:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the legal
ground for the respondent judge's disqualification is indubitable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent judge makes no denial
whatsoever of his relationship within the sixth degree of affinity to the
complainant Calderon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On record remains
the petitioner's uncontested claim of admission on the part of the respondent
judge of his relationship to the complainant Calderon within the prohibited
degree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of disputing the
petitioner's averment of his relationship to the complainant Calderon, the
respondent judge, in his order dated October 28, 1965, denying the petitioner's
motion to disqualify, evaded the vital question and instead ruled on the
inapplicability of section 1 on the ground that he bears no relationship to
either the People of the Philippines, the plaintiff, or Dr. Jose G. <span class="SpellE">Geotina</span>, the accused (petitioner and appellant herein) -
the only parties he considers as litigants in the criminal action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On record, therefore, the respondent judge's
relationship to the complainant Calderon within the prohibited degree is, we
repeat, indubitable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent judge's observation regarding the inappli­cability
of section 1 of Rule 137 on the ground that he bears no relationship to either
the People of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the plaintiff, or the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Geotina</span>, the
accused, completely ignores the interest of the complainant Calderon in the
criminal prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A crime
constitutes a public offense against the State; for this reason, section 1 of
Rule 110 of the Rules of Court directs the commencement of all criminal actions
in the name of the People of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But a crime also constitutes an offense
against the aggrieved or offended party; for this reason, section 15 of Rule
110 allows the intervention of the offended party in the pro­secution of the
offense, subject to the exceptions provided therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right of the offended party to exact
civil liability arising from the offense finds express recognition in our laws
and jurisprudence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the respondent judge's interpretation of the phrase
"either party" as used in section 1 of Rule 137 - limiting the
reference solely to either the plaintiff or the defendant in a criminal action
- defies elementary logic and common sense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No section of the Rules of Court, no article of the Revised Penal Code
and the Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
excludes the aggrieved person as a party to a criminal action. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>On the other hand, several sections<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Rules of Court and two provisions<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Revised Penal Code and the Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
recognize the offended party as a party to the criminal action.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record of the case at bar also reveals that the respondent
judge, despite his relationship to the complainant Calderon within the
prohibited degree and the protestations of the petitioner, adamantly refused to
inhibit himself from proceeding with the criminal action and insisted on
sitting in judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection,
we observe that section 1 of Rule 137 allows a judge, although disqualified on
the grounds enumerated therein, to sit in a case, but only upon the written
consent of all the parties in interest, signed by them and entered upon the
record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This exception, we believe,
applies without regard to the <span class="SpellE">indubitability</span> of the
legal ground for the dis­qualification of a judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, although the proscribed relation­ship
exists, if the parties, with knowledge of the ground for the disqualification,
waive their objection to the competency of the judge by authorizing him in
writing to proceed with the case, then the judge, armed with such written
consent, is free to try the litigation before him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The refusal of the respondent judge to disqualify himself and his
insistence to hear the criminal case in the face of the express prohibition
contained in section 1 of Rule 137, to our mind, constitute grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Strict compliance with the stringent rule on
disqualification on account of relationship between the judge and one of the
parties serves not only to protect the rights of the parties and assure an
impartial administration of justice but also to prevent erosion of the people's
confidence in the judiciary.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering, therefore, the <span class="SpellE">indubitability</span>
of the relationship between the respondent judge and the complainant Calderon
within the proscribed degree, the refusal of the said respondent to withdraw
from the criminal case despite the objection persistently interposed by the
petitioner to his competency, and the all-important principle of maintenance of
the confidence of the people in the impar­tiality of the administration of
justice, we believe that the resort by the petitioner to the special civil
action of prohibition to restrain the respondent judge from proceeding with the
criminal action is appropriate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold
that the prohibitory provision against an appeal from or a stay of the
proceedings contained in section 2 of Rule 137 does not operate to bar an
accused person, in proper cases, from availing of the special civil action of
prohibition before superior courts for determination, ahead of the judgment on
the merits, of whether the challenged judge committed grave abuse of discretion
amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in refusing to disqualify himself.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, we must set aright certain inaccurate concepts
articulated by the petitioner regarding the viability and nature of a
disqualified judge's decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioner claims that the disqualification of a judge renders him without jurisdiction
and, consequently, his judgment in the action before him is a nullity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To our mind, the disqualification of a judge
does not necessarily render his judgment null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither section 1 nor section 2 of Rule 137
so states.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The disqualification of the
person called upon to preside over a specific case does not divest his court of
jurisdiction over the subject-matter of or the persons of the parties to the
said case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At most, the disqualification
strikes only at the authority of the challenged judge to preside over the trial
of the specific case and therein to exercise the jurisdiction of the
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Important is the distinction
between the jurisdiction of the court and the authority of the judge called
upon to exercise such juris­diction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
judge may be disqualified to try, sit in or act in a specific case, but his
disqualification does not destroy the juris­diction of the court which he
presides.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, if subsequently the
judgment of a disqualified judge should be set aside as null and void by a
higher court, the nullity stems not from the court's lack of jurisdiction but
from the absence of authority on the part of the disqualified judge to try the
given case.</p>

<p class="BODY">We therefore hold that the respondent judge is without authority
to preside over the criminal case in question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Section 1, in commanding him to withdraw from the case herein involved,
necessarily divests him of all authority to act in any judicial capa­city in
connection therewith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We further hold
that where the disqualifying fact is indubitable and the parties to the case
make no waiver of such disqualification, as in the case at bar, sec. 1
forthwith completely strips the judge of authority to proceed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All his acts in the premises are without
authority of law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, judgment is hereby rendered setting aside (1)
the order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>
del Norte dismissing the petition for prohibition, and (2) the orders of the
respondent judge denying the motion for his disqualification and subsequent
motions for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
respondent judge is hereby ordered to refrain permanently from taking further
action in criminal case 5042.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
pronouncement as to costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Let a copy of this decision be forwarded to the Honorable, the
Secretary of Justice.</p>
