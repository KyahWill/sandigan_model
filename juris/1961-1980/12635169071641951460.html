Corpora</span><span style="">tion and Pastor D. Ago
from the order of the Court of First Instance of Manila dated November 13, 1962
in Civil Case No. 38157 entitled "<span class="SpellE">Lianga</span> Bay
Logging Co., Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span>,
et al." dismissing their </span><span class="GramE"><span style="">counterclaims</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">filed there­</span><span style="">i</span><span style="">n.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On October 17, 1958 <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Lianga</span> Bay Logging Co., Inc. filed an action for damages
with the above-named court, with a prayer for the issuance of <span style="">a </span>writ of
preliminary in­junction, against appellant <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span>,
the licensee of an ad­joining lumber concession, alleging in its complaint that
<span style="">on or about September 28, 1958 <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span> had entered its lumber concession, constructed a
logging road, felled logs within </span><span style="">said </span><span style="">concession and carted them away, thereby
causing <span class="SpellE">appel­lee</span> to suffer damages in the sum of
P10,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the filing of a bond in
the amount of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, the court </span><span style="">issued the writ
prayed for.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="12" day="2" year="1958">December 2, 1958</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Lansang</span> filed a motion to dis­solve the aforesaid
writ and to dismiss the complaint, with <span style="">a </span>claim for damages, alleging, among other
things, that the lower court had no jurisdiction over the action because <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had failed to exhaust all administrative remedies
available to him, invoking our ruling in <span class="SpellE">Mauricia</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> Villanueva, et al. vs.
Montano A. Ortiz, et al. <span style="">(G. R</span><span style="">. No</span>.
L-11412, <st1:date month="5" day="28" year="1958"><span style="">May </span>28, 1958</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Appellee</span></span><span style=""> opposed the motion on the ground that the
ruling relied upon referred to a controversy between two duly licensed
adjoining timber <span class="SpellE">concessioners</span>, whereas the present <span style="">case </span>involved unauthorized logging
operations by one without any license nor title over the timber concession
affected by his acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion having
been denied, <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span> took the matter to <span class="GramE">Us</span> by certiorari and prohibition </span><span style="">(G. </span><span style="">R. No. L-14944) but
his petition was dismissed on </span><st1:date month="1" day="27" year="1959"><span style="">January 27, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span> filed his answer to the
complaint denying the material allegations thereof, with a counterclaim for
damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On April 4, 1959, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, with previous leave of court, filed an amended
complaint to include as parties defendants in the action the other appellants
herein, namely, Pastor D. Ago and Ago Timber Corporation, on the ground that,
as actual operators of <span class="SpellE">Lansang's</span> timber concession or
in col­laboration with the latter, they were likewise responsible for the
illegal logging operations complained of.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A motion to dismiss the amended complaint
filed by said appellants on the grounds of (a) improper venue and (b) <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of Civil Case No. 73 of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> entitled "Pastor D. Ago vs. <span class="SpellE">Lianga</span> Bay Logging Co., Inc., et al." was denied, and <span style="">a special </span>civil action for
prohibition filed assailing the order of denial was dismissed by the Court of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This order was subsequently
affirmed by <span class="GramE">Us</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">result, appellants Ago and Ago Timber Corporation filed their answer to
the amended complaint, with a counterclaim for damages, alleging that</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">they had never entered any portion of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> timber concession nor committed the illegal acts
complained; that they never operated or logged in <span class="SpellE">Lansang's</span>
timber concession at any time prior to January 19, 1960 when the eastern part
of </span><span style="">said concession was
transferred to Ago Timber Corporation under Ordinary Timber License No.
1323-'60; that since that date, it had begun logging operations within its
forest concession with the <span class="SpellE">Agusan-Surigao</span> Provincial
boundary line as the common boundary line between their concession and that of <span class="SpellE">Lianga</span> Bay Logging Co., Inc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For failure of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to appear on the date set for the trial, despite
due notice thereof, the court, on September 17, 1962, dismissed the complaint
and set the date for the hearing to be held in relation to appel­lants'
counterclaims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span>
motion for reconsidera­tion and new trial was denied by the court, and an
appeal from the order dismissing the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
complaint was taken by it to the Court of Appeals where it is now pending
resolution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Meanwhile, on October 16,
1962, during the trial of appellant’s counterclaims, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
asked for leave to file a motion to dismiss said counterclaims on the follow­ing
grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that appellants had not
exhausted all admi­nistrative remedies before filing the same; that there were
two other actions pending between the same parties involving the same subject
matter, and that some of the allegations made in the Counterclaim were
premature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter the court issued an
order suspending further proceedings on the counterclaims and allowing <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to file a motion to dismiss the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date month="10" day="19" year="1962"><span style="">October 19, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed
said motion based on the grounds men­tioned heretofore, and over appellants'
opposition, the lower court issued the appealed order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In spite of the many assignments of error submitted in
defendants-appellants brief, the only issue to be re­solved is whether the
counterclaims interposed by them (<span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span>, Pastor Ago and Ago Timber Corporation) were
correctly dismissed by the trial court upon the grounds set forth in the
appealed order of dismissal, name­ly:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that the subject matter of the dismissed counterclaims are involved in
and covered by the issues litigated in two prior civil actions involving the
same parties:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Civil Case No. 1416 of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> and Civil Case No. 815 of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, and were also being litigated
administratively before the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Let us start with the
administrative case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The main question between
the parties herein is undoubtedly who amongst them is entitled to conduct log­ging
operations within the area of a certain lumber con­cession mentioned and
described in the record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears in
this connection that pursuant to Sections 5 and 6 of Forestry Administrative
Order No. 62 the <span class="SpellE">Lianga</span> Bay Logging Co., Inc<span class="GramE">.,</span> filed </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">complaint against the Ago Timber Cor­poration
charging the latter with encroachment upon the area covered by its Timber
License Agreement No. 49.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A similar
complaint had been filed earlier by the </span><span style="">same </span><span style="">party against appellant <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lansang</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After the corresponding
investigation the Director of Forestry rendered a decision upholding the
boundary of <span class="SpellE">ap­pellee's</span> timber concession as set
forth in the aforesaid Timber License Agreement No. 49.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant Ago Timber Cor­poration alone
appealed to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, an appeal still
pending at the time the present </span><span style="">case </span><span style="">was submitted for decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span> did not
take </span><span style="">a similar </span><span style="">appeal, the decision of the Director of Forestry became final as against
him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In essence the litigation
between the parties herein is a boundary dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To determine which of them is </span><span style="">en</span><span style="">titled to recover damages from the other; to decide who is entitled to
eject the other from the disputed <span class="GramE">area,</span> this boundary
dispute must first be resolved by the competent authority before whom it </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">pending prior to the filing of the dismissed counterclaims.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With respect to the two
civil actions between the same parties and involving the same issue as the one
raised in the dismissed counterclaims, the following are pertinent con­siderations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In Civil Case No. 1416 of
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> herein seeks to
recover damages from appellants Pastor Ago and Ago Timber Corporation mainly
upon the ground that, without any right whatsoever and by means of force and
intimidation, they had stopped its logging operations inside the timber
concession covered by its Timber License Agreement No. 49.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This area from which said operations were
allegedly suspended is adversely claimed by said defendants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It has been alleged, and it has not been sufficiently <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>, that the disputed area involved in Civil Case
No. 1416 is the same as that involved in the administrative case pending in the
Department of Agriculture and Natural <span style="">Resources.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither is it disputed that this civil action
was still pending in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> when the dismissed counterclaims were filed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, in relation to the second case, it appears
that appellant Ago Timber Corporation had filed a complaint for forcible entry
in the Justice of the Peace Court of Bah-Bah, <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>
against herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> claiming <span style="">that the latter had encroached upon the
forest concession of said </span>corporation covered <span style="">by Ordinary Timber </span>License <span style="">No.
1323-60 issued in its favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
corporation, of course, also sought to recover damages for such encroachment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Appellee</span></span><span style=""> herein (defendant in said case for forcible
entry) moved to dismiss the complaint, and said motion was granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view thereof, Ago Timber Corporation
appealed to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>
where the case was docketed as Civil Case No. 815 still pending at the time the
dismissed counterclaims were interposed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The damages claimed in this Civil Case No. 815 appear to be the same
involved in the dismissed counterclaims.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, <span class="GramE">We</span> find that
the trial <span style="">court committed no error in </span><span style="">dismissing the </span><span style="">counterclaims </span><span style="">interposed
by defendants-appellants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">WHEREFORE</b><span style="">, the order appealed from is hereby affirmed,
with costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
