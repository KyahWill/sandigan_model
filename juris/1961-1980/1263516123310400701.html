<p class="BODY"><span style="">The day after the </span><span style="">elections, </span><span style="">Cornell, the Liberal Party candidate, asked the Commission on Elections
(<span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>) to an­nul the elections in </span><span style="">precincts 1, 2, </span><span style="">3, 13, 14, and 15 on the ground of fraud and
terrorism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He charged that followers of </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Tagoranao</span></span><span style="">, a <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> </span><span style="">Party candidate, fired their </span><span style="">guns </span><span style="">and, in the ensuing confusion, </span><span style="">seized </span><span style="">the ballots,
filled </span><span style="">them up for <span class="SpellE">Tagoranao</span>, and dropped them in the ballot box.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting on this petition, the </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Comelec</span></span><span style=""> ordered the board of can­vassers of <span class="SpellE">Marantao</span> to suspend the canvass and proclamation of the
winning candidates until the matter could </span><span style="">be investi­gated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the same
time it </span><span style="">wired the municipal
treasurer to report compliance with this order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Both telegrams were sent
on November 22, but the board of canvassers just the same met on that day in </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="">Camp</span></st1:placetype><span style=""> </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Keithley</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style=""> in </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Marawi</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> and proclaimed <span class="SpellE">Tagoranao</span>
mayor-elect of <span class="SpellE">Marantao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When apprised, therefore of this action of
the board, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, on </span><st1:date year="1967" day="2" month="12"><span style="">December
 2, 1967</span></st1:date><span style="">, annulled
the proclamation of <span class="SpellE">Tagoranao</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On December 12, <span class="SpellE">Mangondato</span>, another
candidate of the <span class="SpellE">Na­cionalista</span> Party, asked the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> (1) to annul permanently <span class="SpellE">Tagoranao's</span>
proclamation on the ground that it was made in violation of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> restraining order, (2) to order the rejection of
the returns from precincts 1, 2,13, and 14 as "obviously
manufactured," and (3) to declare him elected mayor of <span class="SpellE">Marantao</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Tagoranao</span> entered his appearance and asked the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> to throw out <span class="SpellE">Mangondato's</span>
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He contended that <span class="SpellE">Mangondato</span> had earlier filed in the Court of First In­stance
of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> an action
for the annulment of the returns in question and that to permit him to maintain
his action would actually be to allow him to split a single cause of
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also argued that the frauds
and terrorism which <span class="SpellE">Mangondato</span> had denounced as
having attended the election in the precincts in question could be the subject
only of an elec­tion protest.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 20 Cornell in turn filed a petition with the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> in which he asked that the board of canvassers be
or­dered to reject the returns from <span class="SpellE">precinctss</span> 1 and
13.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly to him the returns were
not signed by LP inspectors, and the counting of votes was made by the board of
inspectors at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Keithley</span></st1:placename></st1:place> on November 20,
instead of in the polling place on the day of the election (November 14, 1967)
as provided in the Revised Election Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In passing, it may be stated here that while denominated
"supplemental," the petition was ac­tually an amendment of Cornell's
original petition filed on November 14, for now he limited his prayer for
exclusion to the returns from precincts 1 and 13 <span style="">(he </span>originally asked for the exclusion of the returns from 4 other
precincts), and changed the basis of his action from fraud and terrorism to the
fact that the counting of votes was held at a place and on a day other than
those specified by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his answer, <span class="SpellE">Tagoranao</span> denied that the signatures of the LP inspectors
were forged and claimed that counting of votes was made in <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Keithley</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
after the elections, in line with a practice adopted <span style="">since </span>1951 to prevent a repetition of the infamous 1949 elections
in <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 3, 1968 the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> rendered
a decision, af­firming its original order of December 2, 1967 voiding <span class="SpellE">Tago­ranao's</span> proclamation, and denying Cornell's petition
for the rejection of the returns from precincts 1 and 13, <span style="">even </span>as <span style="">it </span>granted <span class="SpellE">Mangondato's</span> petition by
ordering the canvassing board to exclude the return from precinct 2 as
"obviously manufac­tured."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The result was virtually
to signal the proclamation of <span class="SpellE">hangondato</span>, as the
rejection of the return from precinct </span><span style="">would mean a loss of 366 votes for <span class="SpellE">Tagoranao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus what began as an effort to turn the
tide, as it were, in favor of Cote Cornell ended in the virtual proclamation of
another candidate, <span class="SpellE">Hadji</span> <span class="SpellE">Mangata</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mangondato</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The observation</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> has once been made </span><span style="">that any enemy of
the common enemy is, if not necessarily a friend, at </span><span style="">least a potential ally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is so only to the ex­tent that the
parties remain in </span><u><span style="">status</span></u><span style=""> <u>quo</u>. </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span style="">For as
this case amply demonstrates, upon the fall of the erstwhile common ene­my, his
position is taken over by the once potential ally.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Accordingly, <span class="SpellE">Tagoranao</span> </span><span style="">moved for </span><span style="">a reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On January 8,
in a move obviously intended to block <span class="SpellE">Mangondato's</span>
proclamation, Cornell for his part asked for the suspension of the </span><span style="">proceedings,
claiming that he had filed on </span><st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="10"><span style="">October </span><span style="">31, 1967</span></st1:date><span style=""> with the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> a
petition for the annulment of the re­gistry list of voters, and that the issue
posed </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">his petition was a prejudicial </span><span style="">question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Curiously </span><span style="">enough, he moved, the </span><span style="">following day, for the reconsideration of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> decision insofar as it refused to order the
rejection of the returns from precincts 1 and </span><span style="">13 and ordered the </span><span style="">exclusion of </span><span style="">the re­turn from precinct 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
January 23, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> denied the motions for </span><span style="">reconsideration </span><span style="">filed by <span class="SpellE">Tagoranao</span>
and Cornell, and on January 29 it declared that the motion to hold </span><span style="">action </span><span style="">in abeyance must be deemed to have </span><span style="">likewise </span><span style="">been denied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Both Cornell and <span class="SpellE">Tagoranao</span> have come to this
Court on </span><span style="">petitions for <u>certiorari</u>, prohibition and </span><span style="">mandamus.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In L-28598, Cornell
charges the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> with neglect of duty </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">not ordering the rejection of the returns from pre­cincts 1, 2, 5, 13,
14, 15, 17, 18</span><span style="">, </span><span style="">19, and 20.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to him the votes cast </span><span style="">in those </span><span style="">precincts were
based on the registry list whose nullification he had sought </span><span style="">even before the election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While conceding that the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
has no power </span><span style="">to decide questions
</span><span style="">involving </span><span style="">the right to vote, Cornell ne­vertheless
argues that without </span><span style="">valid
registration </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">votes </span><span style="">cast </span><span style="">are "void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span>" </span><span style="">so that </span><span style="">"in legal contemplation, </span><span style="">there are no votes cast, hence, the COMELEC </span><span style="">will not be annulling a vote for none has
been cast."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This </span><span style="">is nothing but sophistry, to dispose of </span><span style="">which it should be sufficient to quote what
this Court said in <span class="SpellE"><u>Nacionalista</u></span> <u>Party</u> <u>v</u>.

tribunals alone, as in fact it is, then the incidental power to determine the
validity or nullity of the votes must perforce be deemed impliedly withheld
from any other body or tribunal such as the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Still
it is claimed that the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> </span><span style="">should have ordered the returns from
precincts 1 and 13 <span style="">excluded from

votes by the board of inspectors was held at Camp <span class="SpellE">Keithley</span>
in <span class="SpellE">Marawi</span> City (some 9 kilometers from the polling
places) and on a day (November 20) after the election, contrary to the
provisions of the Election Code.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Whether
the returns in question are spurious is a question that should have been laid

<blockquote>"It requires no great effort to
understand that ex­ternal circumstances may occasionally compel the transfer of
the ballot boxes and inspectors to places of safety in order to avoid
frustration of the popular will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where
political passions run rife, and armed persons are running loose, adequate
protection can not be afforded to the election officers in each and every
precinct, because law officers would be <span style="">spread

be not only extreme idolatry of <span style="">the

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It
is finally contended that the <span class="SpellE">Camelec</span> gravely abused </span>its
discretion in rejecting the return <span style="">from
precinct 2 as "obviously manufactured."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A similar claim is made by Nap <span class="SpellE">Tagoranao</span> in his </span>petition in G.R. No. L-28590.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We shall take up both <span style="">arguments </span>jointly since they raise the same issue, but before we
do <span style="">so, we
shall dispose of the other point raised in </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Tagoranao's</span></span><span style=""> petition, namely, that the filing </span><span style="">of <span class="SpellE">Mangondato's</span> election protest in the Court of </span><span style="">First In­</span><span style="">stance divested the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
of its jurisdiction over this </span>case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The election case, however, has since been dismis­sed by the lower court
upon motion of <span class="SpellE">Mangondato</span>, not to mention <span style="">the fact that </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Mangondato's</span></span><span style=""> petition before </span>the
<span style="">Co </span><span style="">melee was filed earlier on December </span>12
than his protest in the lower court which was filed only two days after, on De­cember
14.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What <span style="">is </span>more, as this Court recently held,
where the proclamation itself is illegal the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
may still as­sume jurisdiction notwithstanding the filing of an election <span style="">protest.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">And now to the common
issue raised by Cornell and <span class="SpellE">Tago<span style="">ranao</span></span></span>, namely, that the return from precinct 2

the return in question, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">“/I/</span><span style="">t
has been established thru the investigation of Commission attorneys sent to <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> that </span>there
were frauds and terrorism, shooting and explo­sion of dynamite in the area
where this polling place <span style="">is </span>located.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The official
ballots intended to <span style="">be used </span><span style="">in said precinct
were snatched and taken away by the followers of mayoralty candidate <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> <span class="SpellE">Tagoranao</span>, were accomplished
outside of the polling places by these men (Annex 'A-E, petition of <span class="SpellE">M<span style="">a</span>ngondato</span>),
and were </span><span style="">later on </span>stuffed <span style="">and placed </span><span style="">inside a kerosene can which was used as a ballot box in lieu </span>of the
ballot box supplied by the Commission.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no evidence to show that the use of <span style="">the kerosene can was </span><span style="">with prior approval of </span><span style="">the Commission or any of its authorized
representatives </span>nor was it later confirmed by the Com­mission.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In Precinct 2 there are 259 registered voters (see certified
list of names, Annexes '1' '1-1,1 '1-2', petition of <span class="SpellE">Mangondato</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records of the Commission show that <span style="">4 </span>pads or a total of 450 bal<span style="">lots were issued to Precinct 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears, however, that 570 official
ballots were actually found inside the kerosene can, thus, even if all the 450
ballots in Precinct 2 were used there </span><span style="">would still be an excess of 120 ballots
inside </span><span style="">the kerosene can.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The returns itself show that mayoralty
candidates <span class="SpellE">Cota</span> Cornell obtained 11 </span><span style="">votes; <span class="SpellE">Palao</span> Mama - 10 votes; <span class="SpellE">Mangata</span> <span class="SpellE">Mangonda­to</span> - 2 votes; and <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> <span class="SpellE">Tagoranao</span> - 366 votes, or a total </span><span style="">389 </span><span style="">valid ballots cast for the office of the
Mayor alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, </span><span style="">even if all the 259 registered voters of
Precinct 2 voted, there would still be 130 more votes cast and counted in Pre­cinct
2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And furthermore, even if all the 259
registered voters of Precinct 2 voted for <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> <span class="SpellE">Ta­goranao</span> only, still the 366 votes received by <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> <span class="SpellE">Tagoranao</span> is 107 more votes
than the total number of </span><span style="">registered voters for </span><span style="">Precinct 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not only
statistically improbable, this is impossible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One look at the election returns for Precinct 2 and the falsity of the
same will stare at you in the </span><span style="">face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
is even no need, in this case, to </span><span style="">go behind the <span class="SpellE">returnsto</span> prove its falsity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everything considered - the incidents before,
during and after the voting in Precinct 2, the face of the returns itself, the
only justifiable conclu­sion would be that the returns corresponding to this
precinct is an obviously manufactured return."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The election return of Precinct 2 is blank with respect to
the data on the number of voters who regis­tered and number of voters who actually
voted, as well <span style="">as on the data on the

used in the voting, although, the plebiscite return of Precinct 2 prepared by
the same Board of Inspectors states that the number of voters who registered is
</span>375 <span style="">and the same number of
voters voted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of </span>375
<span style="">as the number of voters registered in
the precinct, there are still more votes credited to candidates for mayor, </span>because,
as stated in the decision of the Commission on January 3, 1968 a total of 389

and Peres are <span class="SpellE">Nacionalistas</span> and two, namely - <span class="SpellE">Katigbak</span> and Rodrigo are Liberals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No <span style="">more
convin­</span>cing proof than this <span style="">could
</span>be produced to prove that this </span><span style="">election </span><span style="">return is manufactured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it is indeed statistically improbable
that the al­</span><span style="">leged 375 registered voters, claimed to have all </span><span style="">voted, should one and all equally </span><span style="">and in the </span><span style="">same manner vote for three <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
candidates and two Liberal candidates for senator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is con­trary to all records and <span style="">experience in elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>And then, there <span style="">are nine </span>candidates, including <span class="SpellE">Asaas</span> <span class="SpellE">Usman</span>, who <span style="">received votes </span>ranging from 300 </span><span style="">to 375, or a tots </span><span style="">number of <span style="">votes credited for </span></span><span style="">these nine candidates of 3,265.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the maximum total number of votes that
could be cast by the 375 voters, </span><span style="">assuming
</span><span style="">that all
of </span><span style="">them </span><span style="">voted and that each
of them cast his vote </span><span style="">for eight candi</span><span style="">dates for senators, will be only 3,000 </span><span style="">votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">But here, the total
number of votes credited for the aforesaid nine candidates for senator is
3,265, thereby producing an excess of 265 votes credited for senator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The foregoing facts appearing on the face of
said election return itself show that the election return is </span><span style="">obviously
manufactured."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">What we said in <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Demafiles</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><u>v</u>.
<u><span style="">Commission</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">on</span></u><span style=""> <u>Elections</u></span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> is here applicable with equal propriety and
vigor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The return </span>in <span style="">this case shows nothing on </span>its <span style="">face from which the </span>canvassers might
conclude that it does not speak the truth.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is only <span style="">when it is compared with the certification of the election reg</span><span style="">ister, or </span><span style="">with the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
record of the number of ballots issued to precinct 2, or with the plebiscite
return that a discrepancy appears.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, the defect is not ap­parent and therefore the </span><span style="">return is by no means "obviously ma­</span><span style="">nufactured" --
if "manufactured" it is -- so as to justify its exclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not to belittle the claim that more
votes were cast than there were voters.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Perhaps that is true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span><span style="">point simply is that this question should be
threshed out in an election protest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has heretofore held that a canvassing board may apply
to the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> for authority to use another <span style="">copy </span>of an election return where the
one before it is falsified<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
or where it is so incomplete that the number of votes cast for each candidate
cannot be determined.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
But here the <span style="">problem </span>is not that
posed by a return that does not speak the truth but, possibly, if we are to
believe <span class="SpellE">Mangondato</span>, that presented by ballots which
have been fraudulently dropped in the ballot box and there commingled with the
genuine ones.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For all that we know a
count of the ballots will confirm the <span style="">statement in </span><span style="">the return that 366 votes were actually cast for <span class="SpellE">Tagoranao</span>
in precinct 2, in which event the integrity of the return will have been
established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether the 366 votes were
cast through fraud and </span><span style="">other irregularities, </span><span style="">as both <span class="SpellE">Mangondato</span> and Cornell claim and as
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> found, is altogether a different mat­ter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That question would require proof and,
necessarily, time, which the need for the prompt proclamation of elected offi­cials
would not permit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, to reject the return, as <span class="SpellE">Mangondato</span>
urges, would be to disfranchise voters.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It bears strong em­phasis to state here that canvassing boards must
exercise "extreme caution" in rejecting returns and the may do so
only when the returns are palpably irregular.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>
