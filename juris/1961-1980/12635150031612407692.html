				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Andres <span class="SpellE">Lapitan</span> has appealed directly to
this Court against an order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, dismissing, for lack of jurisdiction, his complaint
for rescission and damages against <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> Scandia,
Inc., of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> and General
Engineering Co. of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Lapitan's</span> complaint in the court below
averred that in April 17, 1963 he purchased from Scandia, Inc., through its <span class="SpellE">subdealer</span> in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City, General
Engineering Co., one ABC Diesel Engine, of 16 horse power, for P3,735.00, paid
in cash; that he bought the engine for running a rice and corn mill at <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>; that
defendants had warranted and assured him that all spare parts for said engine
are kept in stock in their stores, enabling him to avoid loss due to long
periods of waiting, and that defendants would replace any part of the engine
that might break within twelve months after delivery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff further charged that on June 28,
1963, the cam mocker arm of the engine broke due to faulty material and
workmanship, and it stopped functioning that the sellers were unable to send a
replacement until August 29, 1963; that barely six days after replacement the
new part broke again due to faulty casting and poor material, so he (<span class="SpellE">Lapitan</span>) notified the sellers and demanded rescission of
the contract of sale; that he sought return of the price and damages but
defendants did not pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He, therefore,
prayed (1) for rescission of the contract; (2) reimbursement of the price; (3)
recovery of P4,000.00 actual damages plus attorneys fees; (4) recovery of such
moral and exemplary damages as the court deems just and equitable; and (5)
costs and other proper relief.</p>

<p class="BODY">After filing answers disclaiming liability, Scandia, Inc., moved
to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the total amount claimed was only
P8,735.00, and was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the municipal court
under Republic Act 3828, amending the judiciary Act by increasing the
jurisdiction of municipal courts to civil cases involving P10,000.00 or less.</p>

<p class="BODY">After argument, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> dismissed the action ­for lack of jurisdiction,
invoking Cruz vs. Judge B. Tan, 48 O.G. 1320, 87 Phil. 627.</p>

<p class="BODY">Unable to obtain reconsideration, <span class="SpellE">Lapitan</span>
appealed directly to this Court arguing (1) that rescission was incapable of
pecuniary estimation, and (2) that as he claimed moral and exemplary damages,
besides the price of P3,735.00 P4,000.00 actual damages, and P1,000.00
attorneys' fees, the value of his demand exceeded the jurisdiction of the
municipal court.</p>

<p class="BODY">A review of the jurisprudence of this Court indicates that in
determining<span style=""> </span>whether an action is
one the subject matter of which is not capable of pecuniary estimation, this
Court has adopted the criterion of first ascertaining the nature of the
principal action or remedy sought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it
is primarily for the recovery of sum of money, the claim is considered capable
of pecuniary estimation, and whether jurisdiction is in the municipal courts or
in the courts of first instance would depend on the amount of the claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, where the basic issue something other
than the right to recover a sum of money, or where the money claim is purely
incidental to, or a consequence of, the principal relief sought like in suits
to have the defendant perform his part of the contract (specific performance)
and in actions for support, or for annulment of a judgment or to foreclose a
mortgage,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court has considered such actions as cases where the subject of the
litigation may not be estimated in terms of money, and are cognizable
exclusively by courts of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The rationale of the rules plainly that the second class cases, besides
the determination of damages, demand an inquiry into other factors which the
law has deemed to be more within the competence of courts of first instance,
which were the lowest courts of record at the time that the first organic laws
of the Judiciary were enacted al­locating jurisdiction (Act 136 of the
Philippine Commission of June 11, 1901).</p>

<p class="BODY">Actions for specific performance of contracts have been expressly
pronounced to be exclusively cognizable by courts of first instance:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>De Jesus vs. Judge Garcia, L-26816, <st1:date year="1967" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1967</st1:date>; Manufacturers'
Distributors, Inc. vs. Yu <span class="SpellE">Siu</span> <span class="SpellE">Liong</span>,
L-21285, <st1:date year="1966" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And no cogent reason appears, and none is
here advanced by the parties, why an action for rescission (or resolution)
should be differently treated, a "rescission" being a counterpart, so
to speak, of "specific performance".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In both cases, the court would certainly have to undertake an
investigation into facts that would justify one act or the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No award for damages may be had in an action
for rescission without first con<span style="">ducting
an inquiry into matters which would justify the setting aside of a </span>contract,
in the same manner that courts of first instance would have to make <span style="">findings of fact and law in actions not
capable of pecuniary estimation expressly </span>held to be so by this Court,
arising from issues like those raised in <span class="SpellE">Arroz</span> <span class="SpellE">Alojado</span>, et al., L-22153, March 31, 1967 (the legality or
illegality of the conveyance sought for and the determination of the validity
of the money deposit made); De <span class="SpellE">Ursua</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Pelayo</span>, L-13285, April 18, 1950 (validity of a judgment); <span class="SpellE">Bunayog</span> v. Tunas, L-12707, December 23, 1959 (validity of a
mortgage); <span class="SpellE">Baito</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>,
L-13105, August 25, 1960 (the relations of the parties, the right to support
created by the relation, etc., in actions for support); De Rivera, et al. v. <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>, L-15159, September 30, 1963 (the validity or
nullity of documents upon which claims are predicated).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Issues of the same nature may be raised by a
party against whom an action for rescission has been brought, or by the
plaintiff himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, therefore,
difficult to see why a prayer for damages in an action for rescission should be
taken as the basis for concluding such action as one capable of pecuniary
estimation a prayer which must be included in the main action if plaintiff is
to be compen­sated for what he may have suffered as a result of the breach
committed by defendant, and not later on precluded from recovering damages by
the rule again splitting a cause of action and discouraging multiplicity of
suits.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, where the money claim is prayed for as an <u>alternative</u>
relief to specific performance, an equivalence is implied that permits the
jurisdiction to be allocated by the amount of the money claim (Cruz vs. Tan, 87
Phil. 627).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But no such equivalence can
be deduced in the case at bar, where the money award can be considered only if
the rescission is first granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, rule that the subject matter of actions for
rescission of contracts are not capable of pecuniary estimation, and that the
court below erred in declining to entertain appellant's action for lack of
jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed order of dismissal is reversed and
set aside, and the case is ordered remanded to the court of origin for further
proceedings conformable to this opinion.<span style="">&nbsp;
