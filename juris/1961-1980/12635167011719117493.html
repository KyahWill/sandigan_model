				<BR><STRONG>CAPISTRANO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this appeal by <i>certiorari</i> from an order of respondent
Court of Industrial Relations dated <st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="10">October
 28, 1963</st1:date>, thereafter affirmed by respondent Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>,
petitioner Alhambra Industries, Inc. seeks to set aside the aforesaid order and
to compel the respondent Court to hear and receive evidence on its
manifestation and motion of <st1:date year="1963" day="9" month="10">October 9,
 <span style="">1963</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedents of this case go back to April <span style="">3, </span>1962, when respondent Court found
petitioner's predeces­sor, Alhambra Cigar and Cigarette Factory Co., guilty of
unfair labor practice and ordered the reinstatement by it or its successor,
petitioner Alhambra Industries, Inc. be­ing such successor, to reinstate
Emiliano Averilla, Maglayon Pangan, Alfredo Roy, Ricardo Bernardino and Juliana
Lapasaran to their former positions or to substantially equivalent positions in
such corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This order was
affirmed by the respondent Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> on <st1:date year="1962" day="26" month="5">May 26,1962</st1:date>, and this Court dismissed a petition
for certiorari seeking its reversal in our resolution of <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="7">July 24, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Un­til now, however, there has been no such reinstatement.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition itself explains why.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="6" month="7">July <span style="">6, </span>1962</st1:date>, the respondent Union, Kapisanan Ng Mga
Manggagawa Sa <st1:city><st1:place>Al­<span style="">hambra</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> (PAFLU) </span>filed a motion for execution
of said order of <st1:date year="1962" day="3" month="4">April 3, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An opposition was filed by petitioner's predecessor
Alhambra Cigar &amp; Cigarette Manufacturing Co., on the ground that it had
ceased to do business since <st1:date year="1962" day="12" month="1">Ja­nuary
 12, <span style="">1962</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>on account of the expiration of its
corpo­rate life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="5">May <span style="">30, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>respondent Court issued an or­der
holding that while Alhambra Cigar &amp; Cigarette Manufac­turing Co. could no
longer be held liable, petitioner Al­hambra Industries, Inc., as successor,
should be held liable for both the reinstatement and back wages in accordance
with the order of <st1:date year="1962" day="3" month="4">April <span style="">3, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Not
in conformity with the above order, petitioner sought in a petition to have
this Court re­view the order, but in our resolution of <st1:date year="1963" day="10" month="9">September 10, <span style="">1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>we dismissed the petition for
certiorari with preliminary in­junction.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is against such a background that the motion of res­pondent <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
for reinstatement and to compute back wages filed on <st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="10">October <span style="">4, 1963</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>should be viewed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The final and executory character of the
order of <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="5">May <span style="">30, 1963</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>was
stressed therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Five days later,
petitioner Alhambra Industries, Inc., as respondent, continued its stubborn
refusal to comply with such final and executory order by filing with respondent
Court two pleadings entitled Opposition to Motion for Reinstatement and to
Compute Backwages and Manifestation and Motion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first would pray that the Court hold in abeyance the consi­deration
of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>'s motion for reinstatement, and the second
would seek a hearing to enable it to present evidence why it should be exempted
from such reinstatement and the pay­ment of back wages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its reason is set forth in its petition
before us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"On October <span style="">9, 1963, </span>the
herein petitioner filed a 'Manifestation and Motion', a certified copy of which
is hereto attached as Annex 'L' hereof, wherein it represented that it can
reinstate only Juliana Lapasaran in a position equivalent to the one she had at
the Alhambra Cigar &amp; Cigarette Manufacturing Com­pany, but cannot reinstate
Alfredo Roy, Maglayon Pa­ngan, Emiliano Averilla and Ricardo Bernardino, for
the reason that the Alhambra Cigar &amp; Cigarette Manu­facturing Co. itself,
and then the petitioner, at the start of its operations, which was in January, <span style="">1962, </span>made innovations in some of the
working or­ganizations formerly under the Alhambra Cigar &amp; Cigarette
Manufacturing Co., which affected their former positions by abolishing them for
legitimate business reasons as explained in said pleading, An­nex 'L' hereof,
and there are no substantially equi­valent positions for them to occupy, <u><span style="">and praying that the Honorable Court conduct
hearings at which<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the petitioner will
introduce evidence in support<span style="">&nbsp; </span>of these
allegations</span></u><span style="">, </span>and that
after such hearings, the petitioner be declared exempted from reinstating and
paying the back wages of the aforesaid employees."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the above pleadings, respondent Court issued its order of <st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="10">October <span style="">28,1963</span></st1:date><span style=""> which </span>is now on appeal before <span style="">us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Its </span>dispositive portion reads thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Wherefore, the Motion for Reinstatement and to Compute
Backwages is hereby granted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, let a writ of execution for the reinstatement of Messrs.
Maglayon Pangan, Al­fredo Roy, Emiliano Averilla, Ricardo Bernar­dino and
Juliana Lapasaran, be immediately is­sued, in accordance with the Order of <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="5">May <span style="">30,
 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The Chief Examiner of the Court is
here­by ordered to proceed to the Alhambra Indus­tries, Inc., to compute the
back wages and Christmas bonus due complainants under previous orders of the
court and thereafter to submit a report thereof."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The challenged order of respondent court narrated the previous
incidents that have transpired in this at­tempt of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
to have the employees reinstated as well as paid their back wages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"It will be recalled that upon finality of the original
decision of this <span style="">Court, after </span>the
same was unanimously affirmed by the Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>, then by the
Supreme Court, the issue of execution was brought before this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents then claimed that the order of
reinstatement with full back wages can not be executed and/or enforced against
both the old Alhambra Cigar and Cigarette Mfg. Co. and the new Alhambra
Industries, Inc., the former's corporate life having expired under the
Corporation Law and the latter, on ground of due process of law, it being not a
party to the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainants can not
be reinstated, respondent maintained.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After due hearing and the presentation of evidence, both oral
and documentary, the Court ruled on May <span style="">30,
1963, </span>that the Alham­bra Industries, Inc. is liable for the unfair labor
practice committed by the Alhambra Cigar and Cigarette Mfg. Co. and
consequently should be responsible for the reinstatement and the back wages of
the complainants from January 13, <span style="">1962 </span>up
to their actual reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was
affirmed by the Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> in its resolution of <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="8">August <span style="">23,
 1963</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>and by
the Supreme Court in its resolutions <span style="">a </span>September 10 and <span style="">28, 1963, </span>denying respondents' appeal by certiorari and the
motion for reconsideration, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, said order is now <span style="">final </span>and
executory and the Court has no alternative, but to exe­cute the same, by
ordering immediate reinstate­ment of complainants and the computation of their
back wages.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Court likewise justified its inability to grant the
motion of petitioner and to postpone further the execution of the final order
of <st1:date year="1963" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1963</st1:date> for reinstate­ment
and back wages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"This Court can not now entertain the objec­tion of
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would amount to reopening
the issue of reinstatement which has already been decided and is now closed and
terminated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Sup­reme Court ruled in
Rattan Art vs. Rattan Art Union, G.R.No.L-6466, May 21, 1954, that a proceeding
may be reopened <u>only upon grounds coming into existence after the order was
rendered by the CIR</u>, but not upon grounds which had already been directly
or implied litigated and decided by said court, <u>nor upon grounds available
to the parties of the former </u><u><span style="">proceedings
</span>and not availed of </u><u><span style="">by </span>any of them</u>. (Underscoring sup­plied).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Clearly, from the Motion and Manifestation and the records of
the case, the grounds now rais­ed by respondent against the reinstatement of
the four complainants were existing and available, even during the trial of the
merits of the case, and more so, at the time when the issue of reinstatement
was squarely under consideration by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They could and should have been raised during those times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is rather too late now."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal from the above-mentioned order, peti­tioner would
raise as the basic issue:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"May the
Respond­ent Court, upon direct resort to it by an employer, va­lidly refuse to
receive evidence on the allegation that the employees which it had ordered to
be reinstated, can­not be reinstated, because their former positions have been
abolished <span style="">for
</span><u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> reasons, and there are no substantially
equivalent positions for them to occupy; <span style="">and
</span>so bypass the determination of this fact and arbit­rarily overrule this
proposition?"</p>

<p class="BODY">Whatever merit such an issue may intrinsically pos­sess, we are
not called upon to resolve it in this peti­tion, as there is a finding of fact
by respondent Court evident from the above narration that the grounds raised by
petitioner against such reinstatement were already in existence and available
even during the trial of the me­rits of the case and therefore under the ruling
in Rattan Art vs. Rattan Art Employees Union<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
may no longer be availe<span style="">d of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It is now too
well-settled to need any citation of authorities that the findings of fact of
respondent Court, if supported by substantial evidence, are binding on us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we held in a resent decision:<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
"In the more familiar terminology, only on a showing of clear and grave
abuse of discretion are we justified in disturbing its findings of fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it has been uniformly and uninterruptedly
held from Manila Electric Company vs. National Labor Union, a 1940 decision,
the opinion being rendered by Justice Laurel, to Philippine Educational
Institution vs. MLQSEA Faculty Association, decided late last year."</p>

<p class="BODY">It follows then that the appealed order is in accord­<span style="">ance </span>with law and cannot be
disturbed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is another
consideration that likewise sustains the conclusion arrived at by respondent
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the very same National Water­works
and Sewerage Authority decision above-cited, as well as in the case of Sanchez
vs. The Preserver Shoe Company,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
we have stressed the importance of the principle of the law <span style="">of </span>the case, especially in labor
litigations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the Sanchez case, we
said the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It does not
admit of doubt <span style="">that </span>with
reference to our final judgment in labor matters, which insofar as the back
wages due the aggrieved workingmen could require further actions from
respondent Court, the law of the case does not apply solely to what is embodied
in our decision but to its implementation carried out in fealty to what has
been by us decreed." Considering that the petition itself admits that as
of April 3, 1962, the predecessor company had already been found guilty of
unfair labor practice and that petitioner as successor company did try in vain,
its petition with us having been dismissed, to avoid the effects of such an
order, this persistence in refusing to abide by such a final judgment, in
effect twice affirmed by us, would clearly show a disregard of the principle of
the law of the case.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span>have another
reason for not sustaining the appeal of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The basic theory of the Industrial Peace Act
is to recognize the right to self-organization to enable labor unions to
bargain collectively and to avoid unfair labor practices on the part of labor
and management in order to attain industrial democracy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sooner then an inquiry is made into
alleged unfair labor practices and the sooner it is stopped, the better for
harmonious labor-management relations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To discourage each party from committing such unfair labor practices,
sanctions are provided for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here,
management was at fault, and petitioner, as the successor, can be compelled to
reinstate and to pay back wages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
order dates back to <st1:date year="1962" day="3" month="4">April <span style="">3, </span>1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That order until now has not been complied
with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If we reopen the case to allow
petitioner to introduce evidence with respondent Court to show why it has not
complied with the order of reinstate­ment, we shall in effect be rendering
futile the rights of labor and frustrating the policies of the Industrial Peace
Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the circumstances
disclosed, we cannot and should not do so.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this petition for certiorari is denied, and the
appealed order of <st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="10">October 28, <span style="">1963</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>of the Court of Industrial Relations,
