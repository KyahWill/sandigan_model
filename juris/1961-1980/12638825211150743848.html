				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">From a judgment of acquitting an accused in a criminal case, respondent
City Judge <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Constantino</span>
of Branch XII, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> had to face
an administrative complaint for grave abuse of discretion from Rodrigo Cortez,
the aggrieved party in a case for slight physical injuries against one <span class="SpellE">Cerilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Regala</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an eleven-page decision of acquittal,
respondent Judge explained in some detail why the version of they accused <span class="SpellE">Regala</span> as to how the fist fight resulting in the injuries
inflicted arose, was more credible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Pitted against the
testimony of the complainant, the Court finds the story of the accused to be
the more credible version.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Witness
Cortez insists that he was not drunk, but his own medical certificate (Exhibit
'A') states that he had alcoholic breath (Exhibit 'A-1') <span class="GramE">which,</span>
belies his claim that he had only a small sip of hard drinks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court is thus persuaded that he stayed
longer than five minutes with his friend Ricardo San Diego who invited him for
a drink.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His testimony that he waited
two hours to get that short ride from <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span></st1:place></st1:city>
to the PWU bears a closer look.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>San
  Diego</st1:place></st1:city> was not presented to support the alleged five
minutes-only drink with complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
earlier statement that he did not drink at the eatery near the PWU* * *, he
contradicted on rebuttal as he testified that he did take a small quantity of
alcohol in that restaurant at the back of PWU * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A five-minute sip of liquor would not be
enough to register a positive finding of alcoholic breath when examined several
hours later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was found to have
alcoholic breath, because he had imbibed such quantity of liquor sufficient to
put him in that condition where the outward manifestation is seen in a person
when he is <span class="GramE">tipsy</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The legs become shaky and he is no longer firm in his steps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His reflexes are generally slow and he is
prone to be clumsy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A misstep resulting
in a stumble or falling down is very likely.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He is not yet intoxicated or dead drunk, as more commonly known, because
if he is at this stage, he can no longer move on his own unaided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was in this inebriated state when he hailed
the <span class="SpellE">Blumentritt</span>-bound <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
and while on board, he was exhibiting the signs of a person who was going to
vomit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Emphasis is placed on Cortez's
condition, because it was the root cause of the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had he been sober, the accused would have
normally and easily alighted from the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> which
is being done everyday by thousands of front seat <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
passengers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But because a co-passenger
has absorbed so much alcohol as to adversely affect his movement and his
thinking, a misunderstanding arose on the trivial matter of alighting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this point, it is a touch-and-go situation
on the question of credibility of the protagonists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant would say that he was simultaneously
pushed and boxed as he was not quick to alight in order to give way to the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter maintains that
complainant slipped while alighting.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Angered because of his fall which he blames on the accused, he took a
punch at him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A fist fight ensued as the
accused retaliated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant, in
the condition that he was, naturally got the worse of the fisticuffs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cortez claims that the beating he received
was the result of mauling by <span class="SpellE">Regala</span> and 2 alleged
bystanders who aided the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
was denied by <span class="SpellE">Regala</span> and it appear[s] in the records
that he was indeed alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crime
report (Exhibit 'D'), which embodies the complaint of Cortez, does not make
mention of any confederate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
information did not say that accused was in company with others when the
alleged offense was committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
it was raining hard that evening and it was not likely that a mere and innocent
bystander would join the fray just for the fun of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Verily, people usually [avoid] and [shy] away
from trouble.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, those who are
drunk are avoided and kept at a distance by sober men and so, it is hard to
believe that the accused would deliberately pick on the complainant and
[engage] him in a fist fight, except to defend himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the above facts and circumstances, the
Court can find no clear guilt in the accused."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The verdict, as noted, was one of acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the above excerpt of the assailed
decision, it is quite evident why the administrative, complaint for grave abuse
of discretion lacks legal foundation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
Acting Judicial Consultant Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Relova</span>
recommended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree.</p>

<p class="BODY">It certainly would be less than fair if a judge, who had so
meticulously examined the evidence and had so carefully prepared a decision
explaining why he came to the conclusion he did, could be found liable for
grave abuse of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is another
one of those instances where the leading In re <span class="SpellE">Horilleno</span>
decision<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
of Justice Malcolm finds application.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent can in no wise be held to have laid himself open to the
accusation that his act was corrupt or "inspired by an intention to
violate the law, or [was] in persistent disregard of well-known legal
rules."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><i>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the administrative complaint against respondent
Manila City Judge <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Constantino</span>
