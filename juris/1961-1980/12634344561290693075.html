allegedly out of their marriage, namely, <span class="SpellE">Si</span> <span class="SpellE">Beng</span>, <span class="SpellE">Si</span> Son and <span class="SpellE">Si</span> Luna, and were still minors at the time of the filing on
<st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="11">November 20, 1962</st1:date> with the
trial court of the petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="28" month="8">August 28, 1961</st1:date>,
these <span class="GramE">minors,</span> duly provided with certificates of registration

properly documented, arrived in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and sought admission, claiming to be the children of petitioner Benito <span class="SpellE">Sichangco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An
investigation was conducted by the Board of Special Inquiry No. 1 of the Bureau
of Immigration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After hearing, the said
Board of Special Inquiry No. 1 rendered a decision on <st1:date year="1961" day="11" month="9">September 11, 1961</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

as citizens thereof, being the children of the peti­tioner herein, who is a
Filipino (<span class="SpellE">photostatic</span> copy of said decision was
attached to the petition as Annex B).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, the said decision was sub­mitted to the then members of
the Board of Commissioners, composed of Deputy Commissioner Felix <span class="SpellE">Talabis</span>, who "noted" the decision on <st1:date year="1961" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1961</st1:date>; Deputy
Commissioner Francisco de la Rosa, who "noted" the decision on <st1:date year="1961" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1961</st1:date>; and Acting

 3, 1961</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 3, 1961, the minor children of petitioner Benito <span class="SpellE">Sichangco</span> were issued by the Bureau of Immigration
Identification Certificates Nos. 16632 (for <span class="SpellE">Si</span> <span class="SpellE">Beng</span>), 16636 (for <span class="SpellE">Si</span> Son) and
16637 (for <span class="SpellE">Si</span> Luna), <span class="SpellE">photostatic</span>
copies of which are attached to the petition as Annexes C, D and E.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 24, 1962, then Secretary of Justice Jose W. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> issued Memorandum Order No. 9, wherein he found
"that for the past several years, the Board of Commissioners of
Immigration has not met collectively to discuss and deliberate on the cases
coming before it," for which reason he set aside "all decisions
purporting to have been rendered by the Board of Commissioners on appeal from,
or on review <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span>
of, decisions of the Boards of Special Inquiry," and directed the Board of
Commissioners "to review in accordance with Section 27(b) of Commonwealth
Act No. 613, as amended, all decisions of the Boards of Special Inquiry
admitting entry of aliens into this country and give preference to all cases
where entry has been permitted on the ground that the entrant is a citizen of
the Philippines, following the principle laid down in Section 30 of
Commonwealth Act No. 613, as amended, that 'the burden of proof shall be upon
such alien to establish that he is not subject to exclusion' x <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to Memorandum Order No. 9, a committee composed of Legal
Officer <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Yaptiangco</span>,
Jr., and Immigration Officers <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Almeda</span> and Benjamin de Mesa examined the pretended right of
the said minors as alleged children of petitioner to admission, and thereafter
forwarded its findings to the Commissioner <span style="">of Immigration (pp. 12-14, Appellant's Brief), recommend­ing the
exclusion of said minors, the revocation of the order declaring <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> Te or Benito <span class="SpellE">Sichangco</span> a
Filipino citizen, and the filing of deportation proceedings against him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">More than a year after the issuance on October 3, 1961 of their <span style="">identification certificates, </span>the
minors herein received, by ordinary mail, on October 26, 1962, a letter from
the respondent Board of Commissioners composed of Acting Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Martiniano</span> P. Vivo, Deputy Commissioners <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> Gaston and <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Rañola</span> (now deceased), containing its decision dated
September 4, 1962 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. E), which reversed the
decision rendered by the previous Board of Commissioners, dated <st1:date year="1961" day="11" month="9">September 11, 1961</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C) <span class="GramE">and</span> ordered the said
minors' exclusion from the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, petitioner Benito <span class="SpellE">Sichangco</span>, in
behalf of the minors <span class="SpellE">Si</span> <span class="SpellE">Beng</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Si</span> Son and <span class="SpellE">Si</span> Luna, filed a
petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction on <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="11">November 20, 1962</st1:date> before the Court of First
Instance of Manila, to annul the decision of the Board of Commissioners of
Immigration excluding the above-named minors from the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. E).</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 20, 1962, the same date as the filing of the
petition, the trial court issued <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">parte</span></u></span> a writ of preliminary
injunction upon the filing of a bond in the sum of P3,000.00 by petitioner,
restraining the petitioner from enforcing or executing its decision or
otherwise excluding and/or deporting the above-named minors from the
Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said writ was effectively
served on the respondent on <st1:date year="1962" day="26" month="11">November
 26, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, a decision was
entered on August 25, 1964, declaring the decision of the respondent Board of
Commissioners dated September 4, 1962, reversing the decision of the previous
Board of Commissioners dated September 11, 1961, to have been rendered on
October 26, 1962, more than a year from the first decision, and therefore
illegal and null and void, and the injunction earlier issued was made
permanent, with costs against respondent Board.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Hence,
this appeal by the respondent Board.</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Board of Commissioners of Immigration was, and still is,
under the supervision and control of the Department of Justice (see Republic Act
No. 997; Art. V, Part XXI, Reorganization of the Executive Branch of the
National Government, February, 1972).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
virtue of his power of control, the Secretary of Justice can modify, nullify or
set aside the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry on September 11, 1961,
as well as the act of "noting" of the said decision by the then
members of the Board of Commissioners, namely, Deputy Commissioner Felix <span class="SpellE">Talabis</span> on Septem­ber 21, 1961, Deputy Commissioner
Francisco de la Rosa on September 28, 1961, and Acting Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Noche</span> on October 3, 1961
[Sec. 79(c), Rev. Adm. Code; <span class="SpellE">Mondano</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Silvosa</span>, 97 Phil. 143, 146-8; Hebron vs. Reyes, 104 Phil.

Public Works and Communications, L-27861, Oct. 31, 1969, 30 SCRA 134].</p>

<p class="BODY">The Department Head can even directly exercise the powers of the
chief of the bureau or office under <span style="">him
pursuant to Section 37, Act No. 4007, which provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The provisions of the existing law to the contrary
notwithstanding, whenever a specific power, authority, duty, function, or
activity is entrusted to a chief of bureau, office, division or service, the
same shall be understood as also conferred upon the proper Depart­ment Head who
shall have authority to act directly in pursuance thereof, or to review, modify
or revoke any decision or action of said chief of bureau, office, division, or
service." <span class="GramE">(Cited in <span class="SpellE">Mondano</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Silvosa</span>, <u>supra</u>, p. 148).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, then Secretary of Justice Jose W. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>
validly issued on January 24, 1962, Memorandum Order No. 9, setting aside all
decisions purporting to have been rendered by the Board of Commissioners (see <span class="SpellE">Arocha</span> vs. Vivo, L-24844, Oct. 26, 1967, 21 SCRA 532,
540-541).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This principle suffices to
dispose of this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the individual action of the members of the previous
Board of Commissioners in "noting" the decision of the Board of
Special Inquiry on different dates was not a valid decision of <span class="SpellE">affirm­ance</span> by the said Board of Commissioners in the
exercise of its power of review <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> under Section 27(b) of Commonwealth Act No.
613, as amended, otherwise known as the Immigration Act of 1940.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 27(b) of the Immigration Act reads:</p>

<blockquote>"(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A board of special inquiry shall have
authority <span style="">[1] </span>to determine
whether an alien seeking to enter or land in the Philippines shall be allowed
to enter or land or shall be excluded, and <span style="">[2] </span>to make its findings and recommendations in all the cases
provided for in section twenty-nine of this Act wherein the Commissioner of
Immigration may admit an alien who is otherwise inadmissible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this purpose, <span style="">the board or any member thereof, may administer oaths and take evidence
and in case of necessity may issue subpoena and/or subpoena <span class="SpellE"><u>duces</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>tecum</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The hear­ing of all cases brought before a board of special inquiry
shall be conducted under rules of procedure to be prescribed by the
Commissioner of Immigra­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The
decision of any two members of the board shall prevail and shall be final
unless reversed on appeal by the Board of Commissioners as hereafter stated,
or, in the absence of an appeal, unless reversed by the Board of Commissioners
after a review by it</u>, <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span><u> of the entire proceedings within one year

inquiry shall at once proceed to deliberate and decide on the merits
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision shall be
promulgated, and the findings and recommendation, in proper cases, submitted
not later than two days from the date of the deliberation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should the board of special inquiry need more
time to make a written decision of findings and recommendation in view of the
nature of the case, the chairman thereof shall report the case to the
Commissioner of Immigration who may grant an extension of time if he considers
it necessary" (underscoring supplied).</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent-appellant correctly stated that the word
"noted" simply meant that the members of the Board of Commissioners
had taken cognizance of the existence of the decision of the Board of Special
Inquiry No. 1, dated September 11, 1961; that a mere notation does not
constitute an exercise of its <span style="">powers of
review, <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span>
pursuant to Section </span><span style="">27(b) </span><span style="">of Commonwealth Act No. 613, as amended; and
that a decision of the Board of Commissioners, requires a judicious review and
deliberation by said Board as a body, of the proceedings, the evidence and the
law involved, the formulation of findings of facts and conclusion of law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In a case having a similar factual situation entitled <span class="SpellE">Arocha</span> vs. Vivo <span style="">(L-24844,
</span>Oct. 26, 1967, 21 <span style="">SCRA 532,
540-541), </span>in dismissing a similar contention by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
therein as untenable, this Court cited three reasons that negate <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> contention, the first two of which can apply in
the instant case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court said thus:</p>

<blockquote>"First, even disregarding the ambiguity of the term 'Noted,'
the former Immigration Commissioners appeared to have acted individually in
this particular instance and not as a Board.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is shown by the different dates affixed to their signatures that they
did not actually meet to discuss and vote on the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was officially made of record <span style="">by </span>the Secretary of Justice in his
Memo­randum Order No. 9, on <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="1">January <span style="">24, </span>1962</st1:date>, wherein he
stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'that for the past several
years, the Board of Commissioners of Immigration <u>has not met collectively</u>
to discuss and deli­berate in the cases coming before it x x.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>Individual action by members of a board plainly renders
nugatory the purpose of its constitution as a Board</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Legislature organized the Board of
Commissioners precisely in order that they should deliberate collec­tively and
in order that their views <span style="">and </span>ideas
should be exchanged and examined before reaching a conclusion (See Ryan vs. <span class="SpellE">Humphrise</span>, LRA 1915F 1047).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This process is of the essence of a board's action, save where otherwise
provided by law and the salutary effects of the rule would be lost were the
members to act individually, without benefit of discussion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Underscoring supplied).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The powers and duties of boards and commissions may not be
exercised by the individual members separately.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their acts are official only when done by the members con­vened in
session, upon a con­currence of at least a majority and with at least a quorum
present.' <span class="GramE">(42 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>. 389, sec.
74).</span></p>

<p class="2Q">'Where the action needed is not of the individuals com­posing a
board but of the official body, the members must be together and act in their
official capacity, and the action should appear on the records of the board.' <span class="GramE">(Penn. R. Co. vs. Montgomery Co. Pass.</span> <span class="GramE">R. </span><st1:place><span class="GramE">Co.</span></st1:place><span class="GramE">, 167 P 2d 62, 27 LRA
766).</span></p>

<p class="2Q">'Where a duty is entrusted to a board, composed of different
individuals, that board can act officially only as such, in con­vened session,
with the members, or a quorum thereof, present.' (State vs. Kelly, 21 ALR 156).</p>

<blockquote>"Secondly, in consonance with the fore­going principles, the
aforementioned Memo­randum Order of the Secretary of Justice, issued in the
exercise of his powers of control and supervision as Depart­ment Head (Adm.
Code, Sec. <span style="">79[c]), </span>expressly
declares that --</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 0in;">"'x x the public interest so
requiring, it is hereby ordered that all decisions purporting to have been ren­dered
by the Board of Commis­sioners on appeal from or on review <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>propio</u></span> of deci­sions of the Board of Special
Inquiry, are set aside.'</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">and</span> this
nullification included the alleged 1961 decision which the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
now invokes and upon which he relies."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, there was no decision rendered by the previous Board of
Commissioners dated September 11, 1961 that could have been reversed by the
respondent Board of Commissioners, as found by the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To the same effect is the
ruling of the court in the fairly recent case of Commissioner of Immigration
vs. Garcia (L-28082, June 28, 1974, 57 SCRA 603, 613).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court stated thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The decisive issue is whether the ruling of the Board of
Commis­sioners, <span style="">as </span>strengthened by Antonio <span class="SpellE">Caoile's</span>
testimony, should prevail over the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry
which was 'noted' by Deputy Commissioner De la Rosa and <span class="SpellE">Talabis</span>
but disapproved by Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first Board of Commissioners did not meet
collectively to discuss and deliberate on the decision of the Board of Special <span class="GramE">Inquiry,</span> its action was set aside by Memorandum Order No. 9
of the Secretary of Justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Individual
action by the members of the Board of Commissioners renders nugatory the
purpose of its constitution as a board (<span class="SpellE">Arocha</span> vs. <span style="">Vivo</span><span style="">, </span><u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">)."</span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the same case, the Court had occasion to clarify statements
made by it in the earlier case of Commissioner of Immigration vs. Fernandez
(L-22696, May 29, 1964, 11 SCRA 184), which had been heavily relied upon by the
lower court in its decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever
was declared by the lower court, relying on the statements of the Supreme Court
in the latter case, has been watered down by the decision in the case of
Commissioner of Immigration vs. Garcia, <u>supra</u>, considering that the two
cases arose from the same facts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Relevant portions of the Garcia case are <span class="SpellE">hereinbelow</span>
quoted:</p>

<blockquote>"One ground relied upon by the Court of Appeals in granting the
peti­tion for <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u> is the pronouncement of this Court in
the 1964 bail incident (Commissioner of Immigration vs. Fernandez, <u>supra</u>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was intimated in that case that it was
improper for the new Board of Commissioners to have set aside the decision of
the Board of Special Inquiry after the two Deputy Commissioners had 'noted'
that decision and, thereby, affirmed it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"What this Court said in the bail incident regarding the
finality of the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry was an <u>obiter</u> <u>dictum</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>ratio</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>deci­dendi</u></span>
of the decision in the bail incident, which was a <i>certiorari</i> and
prohibition case, was that the Court of Appeals did not abuse, much less
gravely abuse its discretion" in granting bail to <span class="SpellE">Teban</span>
<span class="SpellE">Caoile</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
<i>certiorari</i> did not lie.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The finality of the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry
was not the primary issue in the bail incident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was the Court of Appeals that was called upon to rule first on that
issue in the light of the evidence presented in the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That issue was not foreclosed <span style="">by </span>the decision in the bail
incident."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Section 27(b) of Commonwealth Act No. 613, as amended, states
that the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry "shall prevail and shall
be final unless reversed on appeal by the Board of Commis­sioners as hereafter
stated, or, in the absence of an appeal, unless reversed by the Board of Commis­sioners
after a review by it, <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span>
of the entire proceedings within one year from the promul­gation of said
decision." Otherwise stated, within a period of one year from
promulgation, the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry can be reversed by
the Board of Commissioners acting <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> on review, in the absence of an appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Absent a reversal, the decision of the Board
of Special Inquiry prevails and becomes final after the lapse of one year from
its promulgation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Board of Commissioners rendered on <st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1962</st1:date> its decision
reversing that of the Board of Special Inquiry No. 1 dated <st1:date year="1961" day="11" month="9">September 11, 1961</st1:date>, well within the one-year
period required by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower
court's declaration that the respondent Board of Commissioners' decision was <span class="GramE">antedated,</span> stems from a wrong appreciation of the facts.</p>

<p class="BODY">As urged by respondent Board of Commissioners, the trial court erred
in finding that the decision of the respondent Board of Commissioners dated <st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1962</st1:date> was not rendered on
that date, but only on <st1:date year="1962" day="26" month="10">October 26,
 1962</st1:date>, the date of mailing of said decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent correctly pointed out that the
petitioner himself intro­duced in evidence a copy of the decision of the Board
of Commissioners which was dated <st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="9">September
 4, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law presumes
that official duty has been regularly performed; that a writing is truly dated
(Sec. 5[m], [u]<span style="">, </span>Rule 131, Rules
of Court).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No contrary evidence was
adduced by petitioner indicating another date of rendition of the decision of
the Board of Commissioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the
presumptions are not rebutted (pp. 45-46, appellant's brief).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the copy of the decision of the Board of
Commissioners dated <st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1962</st1:date>
was sent by mail to the petitioner's minor children herein only on <st1:date year="1962" day="26" month="10">October 26, 1962</st1:date>, and received by
the said minors on the same date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
fact, however, does not work to vitiate said decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that the Immigration Law requires is that
the decision of reversal of the Board of Commissioners be promulgated within
one year from the rendition of the decision of the Board of Special
Inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notice of said decision of reversal
may be sent even after the one-year period has elapsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <span class="SpellE">Neria</span>
vs. Commissioner of Immigration (L-24800, May 27, 1968, 23 SCRA 807, citing <span class="SpellE">Arocha</span> vs. Vivo, <u>supra</u>), the Supreme Court ruled
that "the operative date of the Commissioners' action is that when the
resolution (of exclusion) <u>was noted and adopted by them as a Board</u>,
regardless of the date when the decision <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>extenso</u></span>
was prepared, written and signed," and with more reason, as in this case,
regardless of the date when such decision is mailed, "because the decision
<u>in <span class="SpellE">extenso</span></u> must relate back to the day the
resolution to exclude was actually adopted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Necessarily, the extended opinion had to be posterior to the day when
the Commissioners voted and resolved to reverse the findings of the Board of
Special Inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Secretary's
certificate shows that the Board of Immigration Commissioners acted upon not
less than eight Immigration cases (including that of the <span class="SpellE">Gatcha­lians</span>)
on July 6, 1962; and it was of course impracti­cable to prepare and sign fully
reasoned decisions in all these cases."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Supreme Court, in many cases, had issued brief resolutions or
decisions with the additional reservation to prepare an extended resolution or
decision by employing the phrase "without prejudice to an extended
opinion."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the most recent case of Go Yu <span class="SpellE">Tak</span> <span class="SpellE">Wai</span> vs. Vivo, et al. (L-22257, <st1:date year="1977" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1977</st1:date>, 77 SCRA 55, 59-61, WE reiterated:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"<u>Issue</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The legal question in this appeal is
whether, for purposes of sec­tion 27(b) of the Immigration Law, a resolution of
the Commissioners which reversed the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry
and which was adopted within one year from the promulgation of the said
decision is sufficient or whether it is necessary that the Commis­sioners'
written decision in amplification of the resolution of reversal or containing
their findings, be promulgated within the said one-year period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That question is not new.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"<u>Ruling</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- This Court had already held that 'the
operative date of the Commissioners' action is that when the resolution of
exclusion was voted and resolved to reverse the findings of the Board of
Special Inquiry' (<span class="SpellE">Arocha</span> vs. Vivo, L-24844, and Vivo
vs. <span class="SpellE">Arca</span>, L-24853, both decided on October 26, 1967,
and reported in 21 SCRA 532, 538, per Justice J.B.L. Reyes; <span class="SpellE">Neria</span>
vs. Commissioner of Immigration, L-24800, May 27, 1968, 23 SCRA 806, 815; Go Oh
vs. Vivo, L-24898, March 31, 1971, 28 SCRA 228, 238).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Consequently, the Commissioners were justified in using <st1:date year="1963" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1963</st1:date> as the date of their
written <span style="">decision </span>although it was
actually prepared or drafted on <st1:date year="1963" day="13" month="8">August
 13, 1963</st1:date> and was mailed to Go Yu <span class="SpellE">Tak</span> <span class="SpellE">Wai</span> on <st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="8">August 27,
 1963</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">H-3).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The decision (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> A or H) related back to the date when the
Commissioners deliberated on the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry and
voted or resolved to reverse it or to exclude Go Yu <span class="SpellE">Tak</span>
<span class="SpellE">Wai</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Section 27(b) specifies that as a rule the decision of the
Board of Special Inquiry 'shall be promulgated and the findings and
recommendations, in proper cases, submitted not later than two days from the
date of the deliberation.' The absence of such a requirement with respect to
the decision of the Board of Commis­sioners supports the view that such
decision need not be promulgated within the one-year period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It suffices that the Commissioners should
review the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry and deli­berate upon it
within one year from the promulgation of the Board of Special Inquiry's
decision and that the minutes of their deliberation should reflect the action
which they took within the said statutory period.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Moreover, as noted by the Soli­citor General, section 27(c)
expressly requires that the decision of the Commissioners in case of <u>an
appeal</u> from the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry, excluding an alien,
should 'be put in writing and promulgated not less than seven days from the
time the case is submitted for deci­sion.' In contrast, no such require­ment is
provided for in section 27(b) with respect to the Commissioner's decision in
case they <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span>
review the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The trial court erred in holding that under section 27(b) a
written decision should be signed and promul­gated by the Commissioners within
one year from the promulgation of the deci­sion of the Board of Special
Inquiry."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In a long string of cases, the Supreme Court has consistently
adhered to the rule that decisions of administrative officers are not to be
disturbed by the courts except when the former have acted without or in excess
of their jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in the case of <span class="SpellE">Deluao</span>
vs. Casteel (L-21906, Dec. 24, 1968, 26 SCRA 475, 496, citing <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span> vs. Ago, et al., L-15414, June <span style="">30, 1960) </span>and <span class="SpellE">Ganitano</span> vs. Secretary
of Agriculture and Natural Resources, et al. (L-21167, March 31, <span style="">1966), </span>the Supreme Court held that:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> It is a well-recognized prin­ciple
that purely administrative and discretionary functions may not be interfered
with by the courts (<span class="SpellE">Coloso</span> vs. Board of Accountancy,
G.R. No. L-5750, <st1:date year="1953" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1953</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In general, <span style="">courts have no supervising power over the proceedings and actions of
the administrative departments of the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is generally true with respect to acts
involving the exercise of judgment or discretion, and findings of fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(54 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>.
558-559) Findings of fact by an administrative board or official, following a
hearing, are binding upon the courts and will not be disturbed except where the
board or official has gone beyond his statutory authority, exercised
unconstitutional powers or clearly acted arbitrarily and without regard to his
duty or with grave abuse of discretion." <span class="GramE">(See also Singh
vs. Board of Commissioners, L-11015, Feb. 25, 1961).</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It was therefore incumbent upon the
petitioner herein to show that the respondent Board of Commissioners had acted
without or in excess of their jurisdiction or with grave abuse of
discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner failed to do
so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, re­spondent Board
has fully elucidated the factual basis of the decision of reversal dated <st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Board showed that the decision of
the Board of Special Inquiry warranted a reversal for being evi­dently
erroneous (see appellant's brief, pp. 40-44).</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Board of Commissioners likewise insists with
reason that the trial court erred in making permanent the writ of preliminary
injunction restraining the respondent from "enforcing or executing its
decision <span class="GramE">. .</span> <span class="GramE">or</span> otherwise
excluding and/or deport­ing the minors <span class="SpellE">Si</span> <span class="SpellE">Beng</span>, <span class="SpellE">Si</span> Son and <span class="SpellE">Si</span> Luna from the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>."
It is well settled that writs of pro­hibition should be allowed only upon a
showing of lack or excess of jurisdiction or of authority or grave abuse of
discretion on the part of a tribunal, corporation, board or person exercising
function judicial or ministerial, and there is no appeal or any other plain,
speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law (Section 2, Rule 65,
New Rules of Court).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason for the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> rule has been stated in the case of <span class="SpellE">Solidum</span> vs. Hernandez (L-16570, Feb. 28, 1963, 7 SCRA 320,
325) wherein the Supreme Court declared that:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> In
the exercise of discre­tion, inferior tribunals, corporations, boards or
persons should be allowed some latitude of independence, a freedom of movement
and judgment consistent with the trust reposed on them by law or regulation to
mediate over specific <span style="">disputes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If every act or ruling of them were to be
subjected to the scru­tiny and re-examination of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">superior tribunal,
and, in every instance must be reconciled with the views of the reviewing body,
then the administration of justice will greatly be hampered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The discretion of lower tribunals will then
be but </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">word, not </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">reality.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thus, We have always adhered to the standard that for grave
abuse of discretion to prosper <span style="">as a </span>ground for prohibition, it must be
first demon­strated that there was such a capri­cious and whimsical exercise of
judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction (<span class="SpellE">Abad</span>
Santos v. Province of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, 67 Phil. 480; <span class="SpellE">Bibby</span> de Padilla v. <span class="SpellE">Ho­rilleno</span>,
60 Phil. 511; <span class="SpellE">Alafriz</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Nable</span>,
72 Phil. 278).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, <span class="GramE">We</span> have ruled that there is 'excess of jurisdiction' where
the court has jurisdiction but has transcended the same or acted without any
statutory authority (Leung Ben v. O'Brien, 38 Phil. 182; Salvador Campos y <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cia</span></span><span style=""> </span>v. Del Rosario, 41 Phil. 45).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, prohibition ought to be
issued only after the reviewing tribunal shall have convinced itself that the
lower court has exercised its power 'in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason
of passion or personal hostility, and it must be so patent and gross as to
amount to an evasion or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to
act in contemplation of law (<span class="SpellE">Tavera</span>-Luna, Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Nable</span>, 67 Phil. 340)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The same rule was restated in the case of
<span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> vs. CA (L-21022, Feb. 27, 1965, 13 SCRA 366).</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the extraordinary remedy of prohibition cannot be
resorted to where the petitioner, as in this case, has an adequate remedy in
the ordinary course of law by way of appeal in due time (see <span class="SpellE">Solidum</span> vs. <span style="">Hernandez,
and <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> vs. CA, supra).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As aptly ruled </span><span style="">in the case of De <span class="SpellE">Bisschop</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Galang</span> (L-18365, May 31, 1963, 8 SCRA 244, 248-9):<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> Prohibition is not favored by
the Courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The writ should issue with
caution, and only in cases of extreme necessity -- which condition does not
obtain in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More­over, it will
issue only if there is no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy (Section 2,
Rule 67, <span class="GramE">Rules</span> of Court).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has already ruled that 'the use of
<u><span style="">habeas</span></u><span style=""> <u>corpus</u> </span>to test the legality of
aliens' confinement <span style="">and proposed
expulsion from the Philip­pines is now a settled practice' (Lao Tang Bun v. <span class="SpellE">Fabre</span>, 81 Phil. 682, 683).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is because </span><u><span style="">habeas</span></u><span style=""> <u>corpus</u>, </span><span style="">aside from being thorough and complete,
affords prompt relief from unlawful imprisonment of any kind, and under all
circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It reaches the facts
affecting jurisdiction, or want of power, by the most direct method, and at
once releases the applicant from restraint when it is shown to be unauthorized
(cf. People ex <span class="SpellE">rel</span>. Living­ston v. Wyatt, 186 N.Y.
383; 79 N.E. 330).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it has already
been held by a long line of American decisions that the existence of this
adequate remedy by </span><u><span style="">habeas</span></u><span style=""> <u>corpus</u></span><span style=""> will bar the issuance of a writ of prohibition."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Anent the costs taxed against the respondent Board of
Commissioners, since the latter is a government agency in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
sued in its official capacity, it is <span style="">the
</span>Philippine Government itself that was in effect sued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, Section 1, Rule 142, of the New
<span style="">Rules of Court <span class="GramE">apply</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said rule states in part:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"No costs shall be allowed against the
Republic of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> unless otherwise provided by law." No
such law exists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it was erroneous
for the trial court to have taxed costs against the respondent Board of
Commissioners of Immigration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE <span style="">DISSENTING</span>
OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">The established facts in the record are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">The three minor children born in China of the marriage of Benito
Sichangco, a Filipino citizen, and his wife, arrived in the Philippines on
August 28, 1961.  Duly provided with
certificates of registration and identity issued by the Philippine Consulate at
Hongkong, properly documented, they sought admission as petitioner's children.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the corresponding investigation and hearing, the Board of
Special Inquiry rendered its decision on <u>September 11, 1961</u> ad­mitting
the minors into the Philippines as citizens thereof, being <span style="">the children of petitioner.  On or about <u>October 26, 1962</u>, the
minors received by ordinary mail a letter from respondent Board of Com­missioners
enclosing copy of its <u>motu proprio</u> decision <u>dated</u> <u>Septem­ber
4, 1962</u> reversing the September 11, 1961 decision of admission of the Board
of Special Inquiry as confirmed by the previous Board of Commissioners, and
instead ordering their exclusion from the Philippines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon a petition for prohibition by petitioner on behalf of his
three minor children and after trial, the lower court rendered its judgment of
August 11, 1964, finding that respondent Board's adverse decision dated
September 4, 1962 "was <u>rendered on October 26, 1962</u> which was <u>more
than one year</u> from the first decision.  Consequently, it is declared illegal, null and void."</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court, appraising the evidence, found that respond­ent
Board's adverse decision dated September 4, 1962 "was <u>ante-dated</u>,
based on the ground that had that decision been rendered on Septem­ber 4, 1962,
the copy to the petitioner should have been mailed im­mediately
thereafter.  But since the copy of such
decision was only <span style="">mailed on October 26,
1962, as shown by Exhibit E-2, which was not contested or denied by the
respondents, strong presumption exists in favor of the petitioner that such
decision was rendered not on Septem­ber 4, 1962, but only on October 26,
1962.  At any rate, it is not the date
of the decision that counts but the date when copy was <u>officially recorded</u>
and <u>copy furnished</u> the party."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The lower court further
cited <u>several instances</u> where respondend board had <u>ante-dated</u> its
adverse decisions of reversal so as to make it appear that they were rendered
and promulgated within the jurisdictional one-year period, thus:  "The Court also takes judicial notice
that the decisions of the same Commissioners of Immigra­tion had been <u>ante-dated</u>
in the case which was tried before this Court (Civil Case No. 54882, entitled <u>Go
Yu Tak Wai vs. Hon. Martiniano Vivo</u>), which is now elevated to the higher
court, because in that case it was found out that the decision was <u>ante-dated</u>
as proven by the fact that it was <u>officially filed on record much later</u>
than the date of such decision.  This
incident also happened in the case of <u>Chua Kian @ Chua Quian vs. Martiniano
Vivo, et al</u>., Civil Case No. 51870, decided by Hon. Francisco Arca, Branch
I of this Court, a certified copy of which was presented as Exhibit F, where it
was found by the Honorable Judge that the decision of the said Commis­sioner of
Immigration was <u>ante-dated</u>.  Again in the case of <u>Com­missioner of Immigration vs. Hon. F.
Fernandez, et al</u>., G. R. No. L-22696, decided by Honorable Justice Jose Ma.
Paredes on May 29, 1964, the same incident happened.  The decision of the Commissioner of Immigration was <u>found by
the Honorable Supreme Court that it was also ante-dated</u>.  The pertinent part of the Supreme Court
decision is quoted as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>'The actuation of the new Board of Commissioners in reviewing a
decision already passed upon by its predecessor Board, may breed chaos in the
Bureau of Immigration.  If sanctioned,
without any legal and plausible grounds, it may lead to <span style="">an insecurity of status already established by a pre­vious Board.  If by a whimsical stroke of fate, two </span>or
three Boards of Commissioners are constituted <span style="">within the span of one year, and each wanted to exer­cise the right to
review already deliberated and de­cided cases, where will persons similarly situated,
as Teban Caoili, be?  Let us
ponder.  An <u>arbitrary, abusive and
indiscriminate</u> exercise of the right to </span>review, even if granted by
law, will obliterate the <span style="">right of an
individual to <u>due process</u> -- a <u>destructive blow to the rule of law</u>.'
(Decision of the Hon. Su­preme Court, May 29, 1964)."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUM">  <b><span style="">I.</span></b><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fundamental
issue at bar is one of <u>fact</u> assuming that this Court could review the
findings of fact of the trial court in this appeal directly from the trial
court, <u>viz</u>, whether the trial court correctly found on the basis of the
evidence that respondent board's adverse decision was <u>ante-dated</u> as of
September 4, 1962 so as to make it appear that it was rendered within the
one-year jurisdic­tional period which lapsed on September 11, 1962 and at the
very least that respondent board failed to establish that it did act within
said one-year period on the one hand <u>or</u> whether on the other hand, as
stated in the opinion of my esteemed colleague, Mr. Justice Makasiar,
"(T)he lower court's declaration ... stems from a wrong appreciation of
the facts." (at page 9).</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue is decisive, because as likewise stated by Mr. Justice
Makasiar in his opinion (at page 9):  "(S)ection 27(b) of Com­monwealth Act No. 613, as amended, states
that the decision of the <u>Board of Special Inquiry</u> 'shall prevail and
shall be <u>final</u> unless reversed on appeal by the Board of Commissioners
as hereafter stated, or, in the absence of an appeal, unless reversed by the
Board of Com­missioners after a review by it, <u>motu proprio</u> of the entire
proceed­ings <u>within one year</u> from the <u>promulgation</u> of said
decision.' Other­wise stated, <u>within a period of one year from promulgation</u>,
the deci­sion of the Board of Special Inquiry can be reversed by the Board of
Commissioners acting <u>motu proprio</u> on review, in the absence of an
appeal.  <u>Absent a reversal</u>, the
decision of the <u>Board of Special In­quiry</u> prevails and becomes <u>final</u>
after the lapse of <u>one year</u> from its <u>promulgation</u>."
(emphasis supplied).</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court's finding of fact is fully supported by the
evidence of record.  As correctly found
by the trial court, <u>no evidence</u> whatever was <u>presented by respondent
board</u> to show that it had ever voted or taken action on September 4, 1962
and that such action was duly <u>record­ed and entered</u> in the minutes of
the proceedings on said date within the one-year mandatory period, which was to
form the basis of its written decision backdated September 4, 1962 which was
sent by ordinary mail together with a letter signed by Pio S. Noche, secretary,
dated September 4, 1962, much later only on <u>October 26, 1962</u>, Exhibit
E-1, and the envelope marked Exhibit E-2, which shows that such letter was <u>mailed
only on October 26, 1962</u>.  October
26, 1962 was in fact <u>45 days after</u> the lapse of the jurisdictional
one-year period on <u>September 11, 1962</u> and the notoriety of the practice
in government offices and agencies of ante-dating their communications and
actions is only too well known.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is <u>worse</u>, is that the printed certification dated
Septem­ber 4, 1962 but issued on <u>March 4, 1965</u> (bearing a date even
after the date of respondent board's brief dated <u>February 26, 1965</u> but
filed with this Court actually on <u>March 16, 1965</u>) <u>purportedly</u> to
be "sgd." by Mr. Pio S. Noche, secretary of respondent board (who
previously as Acting Deputy Commissioner had <u>confirmed</u> the Board of
Special Inquiry's de­cision of admission of September 11, 1961) and purporting
to show that respondent board had voted for exclusion on September 4, 1962 as a
prop for giving the decision the same date, notwithstanding that it was
promulgated by ordinary mail only on <u>October 26, 1962, 45 days after</u> the
lapse of the jurisdictional one-year <span style="">period,
</span>so as to invoke the Arocha ruling that "the decision <u>in extenso</u>
must relate back to the day the re­solution to exclude was actually
adopted" is <u>NOT</u> <u>a part of the evidence of record</u>.  It was <u>never presented as evidence</u> to
the trial court (and it could <u>not</u> have been so presented, because it was
<u>issued by </u><u><span style="">Mr. </span>Noche </u><u><span style="">only on March 4, 1965</span></u><span style="">, <u>long after</u> the <u>trial and decision</u>
of the <u>court below</u>).  Said
certification of Mr. Noche was <u>belatedly submitted</u> only for the <u>first
time</u> in this Appeal as <u>Annex 3 of respondent board's brief</u> (at page
68 thereof) in <u>printed</u> form, and <u>without the actual signature</u> of
Mr. Noche.  <u>Neither Mr. Noche</u> nor
any <u>member</u> of respondent board <u>was ever presented at the hearing</u>,
much less to authenticate said certification which shows on its face that it
was is­sued only on <u>March 4, 1965</u> <u>during</u> the pendency of <u>this
appeal</u>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Verily petitioner-appellee has cause to complain in his brief
that "(I)f, as claimed by respondent Board, this document has existed
since September 4, 1962, why is it being presented for the <u>first time</u>
only in <u>this appeal</u>?  No
explanation has been given as to why this important, not to say decisive
document has not been offered in evidence in the court below.  <span style="">Of </span>course,
there is one explanation -- and that is, that it did not exist at all prior to
the trial of this case, and the production of this document at this late stage
of this case, is but another brazen attempt to justify what the trial court
found to be 'the <span style="">practice </span>of <u>changing
or reversing</u> decision <u>after</u> it has elapsed for one year' and which
the trial judge described as 'not only condemnable but also <u>illegal
bordering</u> on <u>falsification</u>.'"</p>

<p class="BODY">Said purported certification has patently <u>NO</u> <u>probative</u>
<u>value</u>.  It does <u>not</u> form
part of the record of the case.  <u>NO</u>
authentic or signed copy was ever identified or submitted or admitted as an exhi­bit
or as part of the record at the trial.  A <u>plain</u>, <u>simple</u> <u>printed</u> copy (<u>without</u>
signature nor authentication) and by its face issued only on <u>March 4, 1965</u>
long <u>after</u> the trial and decision below and during the <u>appeal</u>
proceedings in <u>this</u> Court was merely <u>attached</u> to appellant's
brief as Annex "3" thereof.  This is <u>bogus</u> evidence.  And for the <span style="">ma­jority </span>to
reverse the appealed decision on the basis of such legally non-existent
evidence is rank denial of substantive due process and a gross violation of the
cardinal rule that only matters duly submitted in evidence or of which the
courts may take judicial notice shall be considered in the determination of a
case.</p>

of Peo. vs. Sumilang, 77 Phil. 764, 767) <u>within</u> the statutory one-year
period.</p>

<p class="BODY">I had set forth this view in <u>Go Yu Tak Twai vs. Vivo</u>, 77
SCRA 55 (1977) which was concurred in by the late Mr. Chief Justice Castro and
Mr. Justice Antonio, with Mr. Justice Barredo filing a similar opinion.  This case really does <u>not</u> constitute
authority for the ma­jority decision's ruling (as cited on pages 10-12 thereof)
for the Court was split six to four without reaching the required 8-vote
majority either way and the lower court's decision declaring the board's
decision <u>in extenso</u> as null and void for having been issued beyond the <span style="">statutory one-year period was legally deemed <u>affirmed</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I stressed therein that "<u>(P)ublic policy and due process</u>
but­tress such a construction.  Where
the alien has appealed from an adverse decision or a dissenting special inquiry
board member has appealed a favorable decision, the applicant for admission
knows as mandated by the law that a <u>final decision</u> must be handed down <u>within
seven days</u> from submittal of the appeal for decision.  Where there has been no appeal and the Board
of Commissioners conducts a review <u>motu proprio</u> of which the applicant
is likely unaware, both public policy and due process demand that where <u>no
adverse decision is promulgated</u> within the <u>statutory one-year period of
finality</u>, the deci­sion of the special inquiry board shall have become
final and beyond the Commissioners' authority to reverse or set aside
thereafter.  (Otherwise, such one-year
period would be an elastic rather than a fixed period and would have no
meaning, as in this case where the appellee would have been ordered excluded by
a decision of reversal promulgated <u>five months after</u> the lapse of the
one-year period.)"</p>

<p class="BODY">I further submitted therein that "(S)uch a view is certainly
in consonance with the law's policy of a definite date of fixed <u>finality</u>
of the special inquiry board's decision -- be it of inclusion or exclu­sion of
an alien -- and to <u>reduce to the minimum</u> any opportunity or occasion for
<u>anomalies and irregularities</u> in the admission or exclu­sion of aliens
and applicants for admission under the procedures for appeal or review <u>motu
proprio</u> established by the Act.  In <u>Neria
vs. Commissioner of Immigration</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a> the Court
through the now Chief Justice<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a> precisely
noted a deliberate <u>ante-dating</u> by <u>six days</u> of the Board of
Commissioners' action of reversal <u>motu proprio</u> of the spe­cial inquiry
board's admission and declared the decision of reversal <u>null and void</u>,
ruling that 'the said decision of the Board of Immigra­tion Commissioners, and
the warrant of exclusion issued on the strength of such decision, are
therefore, as correctly found by the lower court, null and void, for '<u>lack
of jurisdiction</u>', since the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry No. 1
by that time had already become final.'"</p>

<p class="BODY">Prescinding from the foregoing, what is vital and indispensable
then, under prevailing jurisprudence, specially where the Board of
Commissioners conducts <u>motu proprio</u> a review of the Special Inquiry
Board's decision of admission <u>within</u> the concededly jurisdictional and
mandatory period of <u>one year</u> from <u>promulgation</u> of the Special In­quiry
Board's decision is that the Commissioners' adverse vote and action must be
within said one-year period and must be duly <u>promulgated</u>, i.e. recorded
and entered in the minutes of the proceedings (following the <u>Arocha</u>
ruling).  Here, the record is NIL
insofar as any such action of the Commissioners is concerned.  All that we have is their decision obviously
<u>ante-dated</u> to September 4, 1962 but nothing <span style="">to show that they had <u>in fact acted upon and voted</u> in their <u>motu
proprio</u> review on <u>September 4, 1962</u>.  To cite the impugned decision itself (which was sent out by
ordinary mail only 45 days on October 26, 1962) as proof of the very <u>factum
probandum</u> is to beg the question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In <u>Neria vs.
Commissioner of Immigration</u>, <u>supra</u>, the Court through the late Chief
Justice Fred Ruiz Castro stressed the necessity of such <u>promulgation</u> of
the boards' actions, as indeed the Immigration Act stresses that such actions
and decisions must be <u>promulgated</u>, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"According to the Solicitor General, the correct date of
promulgation is September 4, 1961, be­cause under the Immigration Rules and
Regulations, the decision of a Board of Special Inquiry 'shall be <span style="">rendered in writing,' and under section 27
(b), <u>supra</u>, the written decision 'shall be <u>promulgated</u>'</span><span style="">; </span><span style="">that the words 'rendition' (from 'rendered') and 'promulgation' (from
'promulgated') connote two separate and distinct acts required to be
accomplished by the Board of Spe­cial Inquiry, for rendition is the date when a
judge signs his decision and files it with the clerk of court, whereas <u>promulgation</u>
is the date when such decision is <u>published</u>, <u>officially announced</u>,
is <u>made known to the public</u>, or <u>de</u>­<u>livered to the clerk of
court for filing</u>, <u>coupled with no­tice to the parties or to their
counsel</u>; and that in this </span><span style="">case,
rendition was accomplished on August 2, 1961 when the Board of Special Inquiry
No. 1 concluded its hearing on the petitioner's case (I.C. 61-2312-C),
deliberated thereon, voted for his admission into the Philippines and rendered
its written decision, and promulgation was accomplished on September 4, 1961
when the petitioner was </span><u><span style="">actually
notified</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">of the decision, copy of which was received
by his counsel.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"No amount of hair-splitting in regard to the words 'rendition'
and 'promulgation' would convey different meanings.  This Court defined promulgation as 'the <u>de</u><u><span style="">livery</span></u> of the decision to the
Clerk of Court <u><span style="">for filing and
publication</span></u><span style="">'.  </span>The word 'promulgate' was viewed by
the majority in <u><span style="">People vs. Dinglasan</span></u><span style=""> </span>(77 Phil. 764) as the entry made by
the clerk of a judgment or order in the book of entries of judgments made by
said clerk.</blockquote>

<blockquote>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As <span style="">it </span>was on
August 8, 1962 when the Board of Immigration Commissioners as a body
deliberated on and voted for the reversal of the decision of the Board of
Special Inquiry No. <span style="">1, </span>the
review <u><span style="">motu pro</span>prio</u> was
effected 6 days beyond the one-year period fixed by section 27 (b), <u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">.  </span>The said decision of
the Board of Immigration Commissioners, and the warrant of exclusion issued on
the strength of such decision, are therefore, as correctly found by the lower
court, <u>null and void</u>, for 'lack of jurisdiction,' since the decision of
the Board of Special Inquiry No. 1 by that time had already become
'final.'"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">I vote, therefore, for affirmance of the appealed decision.</p>
