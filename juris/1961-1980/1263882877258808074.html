<p class="BODY">The submission of the petitioner that termination of employment
by reason of economy to prevent closure of business is analogous to
"closing or cessation of operation of the establishment or
enterprise" provided in Section 1 (a) of Republic Act No. 1787 has no
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is now set­tled that the just
cause for terminating an employment with­out a definite period is the closing
or cessation of the operation of the establishment or enterprise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus this Court has held that:</p>

<blockquote>"True, appellant's film ex­change business where appellees
worked was closed as of February 28, 1962 but what the law consi­ders as just
cause for terminating an employment without a definite period is the closing or
cessation of operation of the establishment or enterprise of the employer, and
not merely the closing or cessation of operation of any particular di­vision or
department of the employer's business.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To sustain appellant's contention in this regard would amount to reading
this into the law - something which we are not ready to do, considering its
adverse effects upon the rights of the employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it must be so, let the law say it
clearly."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals found that the cases cited by the petitioner
are not applicable to the instant case because:</p>

<blockquote>"Resolving first the appeal of the defendant it is argued by
said appellant that the trial court erred in holding that the termina­tion of
employment of plaintiffs could not be justified as an analo­gous just cause for
terminating employment under Republic Act No. 1787.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, defendant-appellant takes issues
with the interpretation made by the said trial court in making the
defendant-appellant com­pany liable under the provisions of Republic Act 1787,
particular­ly <span style="">in </span>holding that
the reason for terminating plaintiffs-appellants' employment cannot be made analogous
to 'closing or cessation of operation' under par. (a).</blockquote>

<blockquote>In support of the contention, defendant-appellant cited the case of
Amador Capiral vs. Manila Elec­tric Co., Inc., et al., G. R. No. L-15721,
promulgated by the Supreme Court on December 27, 1963, interpreting the
application of sub­-paragraph (f) of Section of Re­public Act 1787 in relation
to said sub-paragraph (a) thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
said case, the Supreme Court in declining to apply the benefits of Republic Act
1787 to the plaintiff herein whose position as news photographer had been
abolished, sustained the view of the Meralco that it was more economical to
engage the services of an outside photographer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The case of Union of Philippine Education Employees vs. Philippine
Education Co., Inc., G. R. No. L-7161, May 19, 1955, of the Supreme Court was
also cited.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is observed that the facts in the first cited decision by the
defendant-appellant (Capiral vs. Manila Electric Co., et al) as well as the
second case of Union of Phil­ippine Education Employees vs. Phil­ippine
Education Co., Inc.), and the third, the Philippine Sheet Metal Workers's Union
(CLU) vs. Court of Industrial Relations, et al.) are not the same as the facts
of the instant case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case at bar, the
plaintiffs have rendered services to the defendant company for not less than
twenty years and <span style="">in </span>the case of
Jose Lechago, he had served the com­pany for thirty five years as of the time
they were dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also ap­pears
that the department to which the plaintiffs were connected have not been
abolished and that defendant company is still existing with a labor force of
1,500.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, while in the Capiral case
the position of news photographer was abolished, in this particular case the
position was not abolished but only the persons occupying the positions were
dis­missed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, Mr. Ettisber­ger
of the defendant company, gave as a cause of the dismissal of plaintiffs the
fact that the com­pany adopted a policy of modernizing and mechanizing the
operations of the company thus necessitating the reduction in the labor
force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not subscribe to the view
that this purpose is one of the analo­gous causes mentioned under sub­-paragraph
f (1) of Republic Act 1787, justifying the dismissal of an employee, We can
glean from the records that plaintiffs in this par­ticular case have spent the
best years of their lives in the service of the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precisely, one of the purposes behind the
enactment of the termination pay law is to afford protection to this kind of
employees against the unbridled right of the employer to dismiss his
employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At least, Republic Act 1787
extends this gratification or separation pay to employees who have been
unjustly dismissed from the service."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As correctly stated by the Court of Appeals, "In case of
doubt all labor legislation x x x x shall be construed in favor of the safety
and decent living for the laborer."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The submission of the petitioner that assuming that Republic Act
No. 1787 is applicable to the case at bar, only those services of the private
respondent after June 21, 1957 when the law took effect should be considered
because the said law partakes of a penalty and should not be given retroactive
effect deserves scant consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">That Republic Act No. 1787 utilized years of service does not mean
retroactive application of the law if the time previous to June 21, 1957 were
included.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, Republic Act No.
1787 was enacted in the exercise of the police power of the State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it may be given retroactive
effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has explained that:</p>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner further contends that in applying
the law, only those services of private respondents after June 21, 1957 should
be reckoned in the computation of their termination pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, so petitioner avers, a contrary
interpretation would have the effect of giving the law retroactive application.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This theory is short of being compelling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right of employees to separation pay in
the case before us attached after, not before, June 21, 1957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How separation pay is to be computed lies
within the permis­sible prerogatives of Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Con­gress considered the number of years of
service of an employee as the basis in determining the amount to be paid as
separation pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could have fixed a
different criterion. That it utilized years of service does not mean
retroactive application of the law if the time previous to June 21, 1957 were
included.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The determination of the
amount is to be made after said date when right to separation pay was granted
to dismissed employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There should
thus be no room for the notion that the law has been applied retroactively in
this case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>More to this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An idea
difficult to pigeonhole is that Republic Act 1787 was enacted in the exercise
of the police power of the State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And,
legislative acts or <span style="">measures </span>enacted
pursuant to the police power of the State may have retroactive effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What needs stressing is the fact that in this
case, at the time of the passage of Republic Act 1787, an employer-employee
relationship existed between petitioner and private res­pondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dismissal was effected after said law came
into being.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the law, termination pay
must be given said employees."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The assertion that the petitioner "being an American
Company, went out of business after the Island of Negros was over-run by the
Japanese x x x" is challenged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accord­ing to the respondents, "The records will show that the Pe­titioner
Company was in continuous operation even during the Japanese enemy occupation
period from 1942 to 1945, under its own corporate name although temporarily administered
by the enemy occupation forces."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
The employment of the private respondents was not deemed terminated by the
alleged fact that the petitioner went out of business.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals did not commit the errors assigned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, it should be made clear that the
modification of the Court of Appeals of the decision appealed from should not
apply to the plaintiff Marcos Dictado who was separated on November 27, 1956
before the passage of Republic Act 1787 and who had received as compensation from
the company the sum of P303.75.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision sought to be reviewed <span style="">is </span>hereby affirmed except as to the
plaintiff Marcos Dictado who as stated above was separated before the passage of

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">MUÑOZ PALMA, <i>J.</i>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the affirmance of the decision of the Court of
Appeals with modification.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The separation of private
respondents from the service of petitioner-company is <u>without just cause</u>
for the reason that as found by the trial court and respondent appellate court,
the dismissal was due to the company's "policy of modernizing and
mechanizing its opera­tion thus necessitating the reduction of its labor
force," which cannot be considered as analogous to "closing or
cessation of operation" under Section 1, Paragraph 1 (a) of R.A. 1787.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, the first assigned error of petitioner company is without merit.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the second assignment
of error, petitioner contends that the Court of Appeals erred in allowing
respondent employees to recover termination pay, and in any event in awarding
such pay computed on the basis of the full period of their employment in the
company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In brief, petitioner submits
that R.A. 1787 is not to be applied in the instant case, and if applied at all,
the law should cover <u>only</u> the period of services rendered by private
respondents <u>after June 21, 1957</u>, the date of ef­fectivity of R.A. 1787.</p>

<p class="BODY">I am of the view that petitioner's submittal is meritorious
insofar as the case of private respondent Marcos Dictado is concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to paragraph 3 of the "Agreed Statement of
Facts" (see page 2 of main Opinion), Marcos Dictado was <u>separated</u>
from the service of petitioner company on <u>November 27, 1956</u>, that is, <u>before
the effectivity of R.A. 1787</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
being the case, the law applicable is the Termination Pay Law, R.A. 1052, which
required only <u>one month</u> advance notice before separation without just
cause, and in the absence of such notice the employee concerned was entitled to
<u>only one month separation pay</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thus, in <u>Mapua
Institute of Technology vs. Manalo</u>, per Labrador, J., where the Court
applying R.A. 1787 ruled that the respondent employee Manalo whose services
were terminated without just cause was entitled to five months notice before
his services could be terminated and awarded him P2,500.00 as termination pay
based on his monthly salary of P500.00, on motion of petitioner <u>Mapua
Institute</u> to the effect that R.A. 1052 is the law to be applied <u>inasmuch
as the employee was separated from the service before the effectivity of R.A.
1787</u>, the Court reconsidered and modified its decision and reduced the <u>five
months to one month separation pay</u>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With respect however to
the other respondent-employees their separation from the service is covered by
R.A. 1787 and they are entitled to the full benefits thereof <u>computed from
the time of their employment</u> and not merely from June 21, 1957 as claimed
by petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A similar question was
resolved in <u>Abe, et al. vs. Foster Wheeler Co. and Caltex Phil., Inc</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>Abe</u>, the dismissed employees of
defendant corporation <u>were employed after the repeal of Article 302</u> of
the Code of Commerce which granted employees "mesada" or separa­tion
pay, and <u>before the enactment of R.A. 1052</u>, the law which restored the
''mesada''.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was contended by
defendant-employer that inasmuch as </span>the employees concerned were <u>employed
at a time when there was no law granting the "mesada</u>", the latter
were not entitled to a separation pay upon termination of their services even
without prior notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court ruled
however <u>that at the time the employees were separated from the service</u>
there <u>was already a law granting the "mesada", R.A. 1052</u>,
which is to be applied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said the Court:</p>

<blockquote>"By its very nature, Republic Act 1052 is a measure intended
to provide protection to the work­ing men, and, in a way, the employers as
well, specifically in cases of employments with indefinite period or duration,
by requiring the employer or employee, as the case may be, before terminating
the employment, to give unto the other notice thereof 30 days in advance,
non-observance of which by the employer, subjects him to payment (to the
employee concerned) of a sum equivalent to the latter's compensation for one
month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The logical question that may be
raised concerns the nature of Republic Act 1052, i.e., whether it is a
regulatory measure, not a substantive law so that its enactment may properly be
considered a valid exercise of the police power of the State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer is in the affirmative.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It may be observed that the Act prescribes the manner of
terminating employment without a fixed or definite period, by requiring the
employer or employee, before terminating such employment, to notify the other
party of such fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently, the
purpose of the regula­tion is to give the other party opportunity to find
replace­ment or substitute, in the case of the employer, and other place of
employment or source of livelihood, in the case of the employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right to be thus notified can hardly be
considered substantive, nor does the provision requiring the employer to give
the employee, dismissed without such advance notification, the equivalent
salary of the latter for 1 month, bestow upon said employee any substantive
right or interest immediately upon execution of the con­tract of
employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Actually, the enactment of
the law merely makes an employment subject to the requirement that the same
would not be terminated without notifying the other party of the impending
termination, 30 days in advance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, in
case of non-compliance therewith, the employer shall be liable for payment to
the employee of an amount equivalent to the latter's compensation for 1
month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear therefrom that this
provision on payment may only be availed of in case of failure to comply with
the regula­tion on the giving of 30 day advance notice; that it partakes more
of a penalty for violation of the requirement which is within the power of the
legislature to impose (See Thorpe vs. Ruthland &amp; Burlington R.R. Co., 27
Vt. 140). <span style="">&nbsp;</span><u>The application, therefore
of Republic Act 1052, which was enacted in the exercise of the police power of
the State, to dismissal effected after June 12, 1954 is with legal sanction</u>."
(110 Phil. 198, 203-204, underline supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Insular Lumber Company vs. Court of Appeals, et al.</u>, 29
SCRA 371, which is mentioned in pages 11-12 of the main Opinion, the Court,
citing its decision in <u>Abe</u>, upheld the application of the amenda­tory
law R.A. 1787 to the case of the dismissed employees of Insular Lumber <u>who
were all separated by the company after the effectivity of said law</u>, more
particularly in October, 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notably,
the cases of <u>Abe</u> and <u>Insular Lumber</u> are on all fours with that of
private respondents now before Us whose services were terminated after June 21,
1957, but would not apply to Marcos Dictado who was separated on November 27,
1956.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ruling in <u>Abe</u> and <u>Insular</u>
does not conflict, in my view, with the Court's decision in <u>Mapua Institute</u>
inasmuch as the latter applies to a situation where the employee is separated <u>prior</u>
to the effectivity of R.A. 1787.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
retroactivity of R.A. 1787 is upheld in the sense that the law applies in full
force covering the period of service of the employee even prior to June 21,
1957, the date of effectivity of the law, for purposes of computing the
termination pay due him should he be separated after June 21, 1957 without the
required notice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, I concur in the affirmance of the decision under
review except for that portion referring to respondent Marcos Dictado who under
R.A. 1052 is entitled to separation pay for only one month as correctly decided
by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of
respondent Court of Appeals which grants the full benefits of R.A. 1787 to all
the private respondents should be accordingly modified.</p>
