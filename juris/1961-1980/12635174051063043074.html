				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>
Garcia <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>, together with <span class="SpellE">Macario</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cagalawan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Antiaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Dumagan</span>, was indicted for <span class="SpellE">malversation</span>
through falsification of public documents before the Court of First Instance of
<span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The information, docketed as criminal case
1748, charged that on various occasions during the period from November 16,
1953 to December 6, 1954, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, as municipal
treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Tandag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, conspiring with his co-accused, <span class="SpellE">Cagalawan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dumagan</span>, who at the
time were mayor and councilor, respectively, of the municipality, misappropriated
P16<span class="GramE">,499.50</span> of the public funds through falsification
of vouchers showing supposed deliveries of sand and gravel to the municipality.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment the three moved to quash the information on the
ground that it charged more than one offense, but the court, presided by Judge
Modesto R. <span class="SpellE">Remolete</span>, overruled their motion,
whereupon they pleaded not guilty and entered trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1956" day="27" month="9">September
 27, 1956</st1:date> the court rendered judgment finding them guilty and
sentencing them to 11 years and 4 months of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span>
<u>mayor</u> to 18 years, 2 months and 21 days of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Cagalawan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dumagan</span>
appealed to the Court of Appeals which, in its resolution of <st1:date year="1958" day="28" month="5">May 28, 1958</st1:date>, found merit in their
con­tention that the information was duplicitous, and accordingly remanded the
case to the trial court with instructions that <span class="GramE">a separate</span>
information be filed for each act of <span class="SpellE">malversation</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two were subsequently tried anew on eight
separate <span class="SpellE">informations</span>, but on <st1:date year="1959" day="23" month="12">De­cember 23, 1959</st1:date> were acquitted by the court,
this time presided by Judge <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Buslon</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Garcia <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> likewise appealed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Following its earlier resolution, the Court of Appeals ordered on <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1963</st1:date> the remand of the case
with similar instructions to the prosecuting fiscal to file separate <span class="SpellE">informations</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According­ly, eight information's for <span class="SpellE">malversation</span>,
docketed as criminal cases 358-365, were filed against the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
but, on the latter's mo­tion, the trial court quashed the <span class="SpellE">informations</span>
on the ground that the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was thereby placed in
double jeopardy.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this appeal by the State.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In its order of <st1:date year="1966" day="26" month="8">August
 26, 1966</st1:date> granting the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> omnibus
motion to quash, the trial court, now presided by Judge <span class="SpellE">Placido</span>
Reyes-<span class="SpellE">Roa</span>, relied on the following rationale:</p>

<blockquote>"In the case of People vs. Alvarez, 45 <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
478, the Supreme Court held:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"'The test for determining whether or not a prosecution for
one crime constitutes an obstacle to a subsequent action for another distinct
crime upon the same facts is to inquire whether the facts alleged in the second
information, if proven, would have been sufficient to support the former
information, for which the accused may have been acquitted or convicted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The gist of the question is, whether or not
the evidence <span class="GramE">support</span> the two actions.’</p>

<blockquote>"Under Sec. 9 of Rule 117, there are four requirements which
must be present for double jeopardy to exist:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Former conviction</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before a competent Court</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Valid information or com­plaint</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After defendant had pleaded to the charge.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Based upon the foregoing criterion, it is apparent that the
same evidence of the prosecution <span class="GramE">support</span> the two
actions."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The order appealed from should be set aside.</p>

<p class="BODY">Had the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> motion to quash been
granted by the Court of Appeals, undoubtedly the prosecution could forthwith
have filed eight separate <span class="SpellE">informations</span> for <span class="SpellE">malversation</span>, pursuant to section 7 of Rule 117, and the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> would not be heard to invoke the protection
against double jeopardy.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The fact that it was the trial court that denied the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
motion, with the consequence that he had to plead and enter trial and was
thereafter sentenced, in no wise makes this case different.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
For by appealing he prevented the judgment of conviction from becoming final,
with the result that, as the case now stands, there is no judgment of
conviction at all to speak of, and therefore the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
has not been placed in jeopardy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
error of the lower court is a fundamental one - the incorrect assumption that
criminal case 1748 terminated in a final conviction and that criminal cases
358-365 are new and different prosecutions for the same offenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence <span class="GramE">its invocation of the
same-evidence test</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is the requirement of a plea material considering that the
order of the court denying the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> motion to
quash was interlocutory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The point is
that as the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> could not immediately appeal,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
he had, as a matter of necessity, to plead to the charge and enter trial, and
thereafter raise the question on appeal in the event of conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is more, by appealing to the Court of Appeals and re­iterating
therein his objection, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> must be deemed <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from interposing the defense of double jeopardy.</p>

<p class="BODY">As we said recently in <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Obsania</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
"The application of the sister <span class="GramE">doctrines of waiver and <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> requires</span> two <u>sine</u> <u>qua</u> <u>non</u>
conditions:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>first</u>, the dismissal
must be sought or induced by defendant personally or through his counsel; and <u>second</u>,
such dismissal must not be on the merits and must not necessarily amount to an
acquittal." We emphasized in the same case that "The doctrine of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> is in quintessence the same as the doctrine of
waiver:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the thrust of both is that a
dismissal, other than on the merits, sought by the accused in a motion to dis­miss,
is deemed to be with his express consent and bars him from subsequently
interposing the defense of double jeopardy on appeal or in a new prosecution
for the same offense."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">These cases before us fall within the ambit of the rule on <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>, for the dismissal of the complaint in criminal
case 1748 on the technical ground of duplicity was granted at the instance and
insistence of the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its order of August 26, 1966 the court likewise made the
passing observation that, with the acquittal of <span class="SpellE">Cagalawan</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Dumagan</span> with whom the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
herein allegedly conspired in defrauding the Government, it is doubtful whether
the prosecution could "proceed … with any degree of success." It is
sufficient to dispose of this point to say that it is not a legal ground for
quash­ing <span class="GramE">an information</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, we do not here rule on, nor are
we called upon to resolve, the question whether the acquittal of <span class="SpellE">Cagalawan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dumagan</span> would
result, likewise in the acquittal of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
not having before us the facts in their entirety, <u>e</u>. <u>g</u>., the
grounds on which the former were acquitted following their retrial.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the order appealed from is annulled and set
aside, and these eight cases are hereby remanded to the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
for further proceedings in accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No pronouncement as to cost.</p>
