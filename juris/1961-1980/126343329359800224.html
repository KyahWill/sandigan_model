<p class="BODY">In their motion, petitioners pray that:</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span class="GramE">the</span> <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
of the workers involved be made for more than three (3) years without any
deduction or qualification or at least 50% <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
or 5½ years, also without deduction or qualification, if not from the date of
dismissal up to the date of actual reinstate­ment (pp. 4-5, Motion for
Reconsideration, pp. 230-231, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court's decision, among others, limited the liability of the
respondent company to the immediate reinstatement of the workers (petitioners
herein) and directed respondent <span class="SpellE">PAFLU</span> to pay the
petitioner workers the equivalent of three (3) years <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
without deduction or qualification.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is OUR considered view that respondent company is equally
liable for the payment of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> for having acted
in bad faith in effecting the dismissal of the individual petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bad faith on the part of the respondent
company may be gleaned from the fact that the petitioner workers were dismissed
hastily and summarily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At best, it was
guilty of a <span class="SpellE">tortious</span> act, for which it must assume <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> liability, since it apparently chose to summarily
dismiss the workers at the union's instance secure in the union's contractual
undertaking that the union would hold it "free from any liability"
arising from such dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that on <st1:date year="1964" day="17" month="5">May
 17, 1964</st1:date>, thirty-two (32) out of the thirty-six (36) members of the
local union, Liberty Cotton Mills Union, disaffiliated themselves from
respondent <span class="SpellE">PAFLU</span> in accordance with Article X, on
Union Affiliation, of the local union's Constitution and By-Laws, which
provides that:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 1.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Liberty Cotton Mills Workers Union-<span class="SpellE">Paflu</span> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
shall remain an affiliate as long as ten or more of its members evidence their
desire to continue the said local union's affiliation x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">PAFLU</span> received the
resolution of disaffiliation on <st1:date year="1964" day="25" month="5">May
 25, 1964</st1:date> and immediately informed the respondent company on <st1:date year="1964" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1964</st1:date> that the dis­affiliation
was null and void and that it is taking over the administration of the local
union in dealing with the management.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Two days later, on May 29, 1964, <span class="SpellE">PAFLU</span> advised
the company that the petitioner workers, who were among those who signed the
disaffiliation resolution, were expelled from their union membership in the
mother federation because they were found guilty of acts unbecoming of officers
and members of the union and disloyalty to the mother federation for
instigating union disaffiliation, and at the same time requested for their
dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1964</st1:date>, the company terminated the
employment of the petitioner workers pursuant to the Maintenance of Membership
provision of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, the pertinent portion of
which reads, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> for disloyalty to the union shall be dismissed from
employment by the Company upon request in writing by the Union, which shall
hold the COMPANY free from any liability arising from or caused by such
dismissal."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While respondent company, under the Maintenance of Membership
provision of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, is bound to dismiss any
employee expelled by <span class="SpellE">PAFLU</span> for disloyalty, upon its
written request, this undertaking should not be done hastily and
summarily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The company acted in bad
faith in dismissing petitioner workers without giving them the benefit of a
hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not even bother to
inquire from the workers concerned and from <span class="SpellE">PAFLU</span>
itself about the cause of the expulsion of the petitioner workers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, the company immediately dismissed
the workers on May 30, 1964 after its receipt of the request of <span class="SpellE">PAFLU</span> on May 29, 1964 - in a span of only one day - stating
that it had no alternative but to comply with its obligation under the Security
Agreement in the Collective Bargaining Agreement, thereby disregarding the
right of the workers to due process, self-organization and security of tenure.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Morever</span>, even after the workers were
dismissed on <st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1964</st1:date>,
and had sought for a reconsideration of their dismissal the next day,
respondent company stood pat on its decision and immediately denied the request
for reconsideration on <st1:date year="1964" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1964</st1:date>
without any valid reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This actuation
further emphasizes respondent company's bad faith in the dismissal of the
petitioner workers.</p>

<p class="BODY">The power to dismiss is a normal prerogative of the employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, this is not without
limitations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The employer is bound to
exercise caution in terminating the services of his employees especially so
when it is made upon the request of a labor union pursuant to the Collective
Bargaining Agreement, as in the instant case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Dismissals must not be arbitrary and capricious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due process must be observed in dismissing an
employee because it affects not only his position but also his means of
livelihood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Employers should therefore
respect and protect the rights of their employees, which include the right to
labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For as WE have already stated:</p>

<blockquote>"The right to labor is a constitutional as well as a statutory
right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every man has a natural right to
the fruits of his own industry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A man
who has been employed to undertake certain labor and has put into it his time
and effort is entitled to be protected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The
right of a person to his labor is deemed to be properly within the meaning of
constitutional guarantees</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>That
is his means of livelihood</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>He
cannot be deprived of his labor or work without due process of law</u>" (<span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> Laguna <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> Bus

Am <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>., section 344, pp. 1168-1171; underscoring
supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The "scandalous haste" with which the company dismissed
the workers, acceding with unusual alacrity to the request of <span class="SpellE">PAFLU</span>, and without giving them the benefit of a hearing
prior to their dismissal, also supports the conclusion that there was
conspiracy or connivance between the respondent company and respondent <span class="SpellE">PAFLU</span> in the dismissal of the petitioner workers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, the records show that the disaffiliation of the local
union members from the <span class="SpellE">PAFLU</span> was caused by the
alleged negligence of <span class="SpellE">PAFLU</span> and its lack of concern
over the problems of the local union and its members, particularly its neglect
in not providing the local union with a good lawyer who would attend to their <span class="SpellE">ULP</span> case against the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This apparent laxity or negligence of <span class="SpellE">PAFLU</span> invites suspicion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records also show that the local union members were
dissatisfied with the way <span class="SpellE">PAFLU</span> negotiated the
Collective Bargaining Agreement with the company because it did not fight for
their demands and instead accepted the proposals of the company.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">And furthermore, <span class="SpellE">PAFLU</span> expelled only
six (6) union members, because <span class="SpellE">PAFLU</span> erroneously
contends that their disaffiliation and their refusal to retract amounted to
disloyalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not disloyalty; it
was their dissatisfaction with <span class="SpellE">PAFLU</span> that compelled
them to disaffiliate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The constitutional
guarantee of security of tenure of the worker and his freedom of association -
to join or not to join a union - are paramount and should prevail over a
contractual condition for continued union membership and over whimsical or
arbitrary termination of his employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">PAFLU</span> also overlooked the
fact that only sixteen (16) out of the original thirty-two (32) signatories
retracted their disaffiliation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">PAFLU</span> should have also expelled the remaining sixteen
members who did not retract, instead of only the six members, if indeed their <span class="SpellE">unretracted</span> disaffiliation were an act of disloyalty
instead of dissatisfaction with the <span class="SpellE">PAFLU's</span> failure
to promote and defend their interests.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also worth considering here the fact that of the six
members expelled by <span class="SpellE">PAFLU</span> and subsequently dismissed
by the company, four (4) were officers of the local union and two were ordinary
members.</p>

<p class="BODY">The company also failed to notice this fact and proceeded
immediately to grant the request of <span class="SpellE">PAFLU</span> by
dismissing the petitioner workers without giving them the opportunity to be
heard.</p>

<p class="BODY">These facts and circumstances on record further underscore the
existence of conspiracy or connivance between the company and <span class="SpellE">PAFLU</span> in the dismissal of the petitioner workers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent company is therefore a party to
the illegal dismissal of the petitioner workers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under such a situation, the respondent
company should be jointly and severally liable with the respondent <span class="SpellE">PAFLU</span> for the payment of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
to the petitioner workers.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> prayed for by the
petitioner workers do not merit any consideration for the reason that the
amount of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> fixed by the Court in the main
decision, consisting of three (3) years <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
without deduction or qualification, following the formula of computing <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> enunciated in the case of Mercury Drug Co., Inc.,
et al. vs. CIR, et al.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(56 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 694 [1974], is just and reasonable under the facts and
circumstances obtaining in the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This new formula of fixing the amount of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
to a just and reasonable level without deduction or qualification has been
reiterated in a number of cases, the more recent of which is the case of L. R. <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span> Co., Inc., et al. vs. CIR, et al. (82 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 309 [1978]) where the Court ordered the reinstatement
of the illegally dismissed employees and awarded three (3) years <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> without deduction or qualification considering
the lapse of time from the date of their dismissal (see also <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> Development Corporation vs. <span class="SpellE">NLRC</span>,
et al. (81 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 489 [1978]; <span class="SpellE">Monteverde</span>,
et al. vs. CIR, et al. (79 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 259 [1977]; Insular
Life Insurance Co., Ltd. Employees Association-<span class="SpellE">NATU</span>
vs. Insular Life Assurance Co., Ltd. (76 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 50 [1977];
People's Bank and Trust Company, et al. vs. People's Bank and Trust Company
Employees Union, et al. (69 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 10 [1976]; and cases
cited therein).</p>

<p class="BODY">And the rationale for the formula was explained by this Court in
the case of <span class="SpellE">Feati</span> University Faculty Club vs. <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Feati</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype></st1:place>
(58 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 395 [1974]) as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> this
formula of awarding reasonable net <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> without
deduction or qualification relieves the employees from proving or disproving
their earnings during their lay-off and the employers from submitting
counterproofs; and obviates the twin evils of idleness on the part of the
employee who would 'with folded arms, remain inactive in the expectation that a
windfall would come to him' and attrition and protracted delay in satisfying
such award on the part of unscrupulous employers who have seized upon the
further proceedings to determine the actual earnings of the wrongfully
dismissed or laid-off employees to hold unduly extended hearings for each and
every employee awarded <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> and thereby render
practically nugatory such award and compel the employees to agree to
unconscionable settlements of their <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> award
in order to satisfy their dire need."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision dated <st1:date year="1975" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1975</st1:date> is hereby amended to read as follows:</p>
