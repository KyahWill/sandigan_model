				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">At or about four thirty in the morning of April 1, 1962, a water
patrol of the Bureau of Customs apprehended M/L <span class="SpellE">Cheton</span>
while it was passing through the breakwater of Manila loaded with 1,865 cartons
of untaxed blue seal cigarettes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
vessel was seized for violation of Section 2530(a) of the Tariff and Customs
Code and immediately thereafter was subjected to forfeiture proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the case, the
Law Division of The Bureau of Customs recommended, in its report to the
Collector of Customs of the Port of Manila, the imposi­tion of a fine of P1,000
instead of forfeiture on the ground that the incident was the first offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 11, 1962, after hearing the parties, the Col­lector of
Customs of the Port of Manila rendered a deci­sion imposing a fine of P10,000
instead of P1,000 as re­commended by the Law Division, in order to give force
and effect to the socio-economic program of the then President <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> <span class="SpellE">Macapagal</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">M/L <span class="SpellE">Cheton's</span> owner, C.F. Sharp &amp;
Co., Inc., moved for reconsideration, which was denied.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It appealed to the Commissioner of Customs
who modified the decision of the Collector by ordering the forfeiture of the
vessel instead of imposing only a fine in the amount of P10,000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion for reconsideration was filed but
the same was subsequently denied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, C.F. Sharp &amp; Co., Inc., appealed to the Court of Tax
Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Tax Appeals heard the parties and ren­dered the.
following judgment:</p>

<blockquote>"Finding no reversible error in the decision appealed from,
the same is hereby affirmed, with costs against petitioner."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration failed, hence this ap­peal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only issue in this case is whether or not M/L <span class="SpellE">Cheton</span> is subject to forfeiture in favor of the govern­ment
in accordance with paragraph a., Section 2530 of the Tariff and Customs Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is contended that the M/L <span class="SpellE">Cheton</span>
should not be ordered forfeited because it was loaded with untaxed foreign made
cigarettes with duress upon its patron and crew; and, that it was not use to
transport said ciga­rettes from a foreign port to any port or place in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The patron and the crew of ML <span class="SpellE">Cheton</span>
executed af­fidavits to the effect that at four o'clock in the morn­ing of
April 1, 1962, the M/L <span class="SpellE">Cheton</span> was intercepted on its
way from the <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> River to the Manila Yacht Club by
four armed men riding in a motorized <span class="SpellE">banca</span> who posed
as employees of the Manila Port Service; that they were or­dered to proceed to
pier 13 of the South Harbor where the armed men hurriedly loaded the cigarettes
in question; that after the loading, they were ordered to proceed towards <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>; that before reaching the breakwater, the patron
sighted a customs patrol boat towards which he di­rected the course of M/L <span class="SpellE">Cheton</span>; that when they Were along side the customs patrol
boat they informed the customs agents of their cargo; and that the four armed
men and their <span class="SpellE">banca</span> just vanished from the scene.</p>

<p class="BODY">The said written statements regarding duress were not given
credence by the Bureau of Customs and by the Court of Tax Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellate Courts usually do not interfere
with the lower court's findings as to the cre­dibility of witnesses and other
evidence for credibility is best left with the trial court - the Court of Tax
Ap­peals - and the Bureau of Customs which had the opportu­nity of observing
the witnesses, in the absence of a showing that some fact or circumstance of
weight and influence in the record was overlooked or misapplied, or its
significance misunderstood by the court.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
We see no reason to alter the finding of the Court of Tax Appeals on this
point.</p>

<p class="BODY">C.F. Sharp &amp; Co., Inc maintains further that para­graph a.,
Section 2530 of the Tariff and Customs Code does not apply to the instant case
inasmuch as it was not proved that M/L <span class="SpellE">Cheton</span> was
unlawfully used in the impor­tation of articles into any Philippine port.</p>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph a. of section 2530 of the Tariff and Cus­toms Code
states:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 2530.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Property
Subject to Forfei­ture Under Tariff and Customs Laws</u>. - Any vessel or
aircraft cargo, articles and other objects shall, under the following
conditions, be subject to forfeiture:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"a.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any vessel or aircraft, including cargo, which
shall be used unlawfully in the importation or exportation of articles into or
from any Philippine port or place except a port of entry; and any vessel which,
being of less than thirty tons capacity shall be used in the importation of
articles into any Philippine port or place except into a port of the <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span> sea where importation in such vessel may be authorized
by the Commissioner, with the approval of the department head."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that M/L <span class="SpellE">Cheton</span>
was apprehended carrying untaxed cigarettes of foreign origin without the,
necessary papers showing that they were entered lawfully through a port of
entry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no question also that
said cigarettes were liable for forfeiture pursuant to the Customs and Tariff
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> facts, the conclusion is inevitable that the
M/L <span class="SpellE">Cheton</span> was used in connection with unlawful
importation of said cigarettes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
burden was therefore shifted to the boat's owner to show that the carriage by
M/L <span class="SpellE">Cheton</span> of the smuggled cigarettes was
lawful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No such showing was made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the Court of Tax Appeals committed no
error in ordering the forfeiture of the launch in ques­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By way of comment, on petitioner's stand, it
would be absurd to require the Government to prove that a vessel was engaged in
smuggling, after it has already been caught red-handed, that is, loaded with
smuggled goods.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to petitioner's plea that it was de­prived of its
property without due process in that the Commissioner of Customs rendered his
decision without con­ducting a formal hearing, suffice it to state that Section
2313 of the Tariff and Customs Code, quoted below:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 2313.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Review
by Commissioner</u>. - The person aggrieved by the decisions or action of the
Collector in any matter presented upon protest or by his action in any case of
seizure may, within fifteen days after notification in writing by the Collector
of his action or decision give written notice to the Collector of his desire to
have the matter reviewed by the Commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon the Collector shall forthwith transmit all the records of the
proceedings to the Commissioner, who shall approve, modify or reverse the
action or decision of the Collector and take such steps and make such orders as
may be necessary to give effect to his decision."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Does not require the Commissioner of Customs to hold a formal
hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His duty is to approve, modify
or reverse the decision of the Collector of Customs on the basis of the
records, papers and evidence presented before the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the proceedings had before the
Court of Tax Appeals was a trial <u>de</u> <u>novo</u><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and if peti­tioner desired to present evidence in addition to those already
presented before the Collector of Customs, it could have done so.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner further urges Us to resolve in its favor the alleged
"doubt" in this case. The so-called "doubt" is that
allegedly produced by the acquittal of the patron and crew of M/L <span class="SpellE">Cheton</span> from criminal charges in connection with the
incident at bar. Insofar as the evidence adduced in this case is concerned
there is no doubt that M/L <span class="SpellE">Cheton</span> was used in
smuggling for which it should suffer the penalty of forfeiture pursuant to
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The result of criminal proceedings
in a separate case before a different tribunal, being dependent upon the
evidence adduced therein, would not necessarily influence the judgment in the
instant case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is hereby
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With costs against petitioner.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
