				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In a complaint dated <st1:date year="1973" day="27" month="8">August
 27, 1973</st1:date> Gideon <span style="">R. </span><span class="SpellE">Evalla</span> charged Municipal Judge Antonio B. <span class="SpellE">Mago</span> of Mercedes, <span class="SpellE">Cama­rines</span>
Norte with certain irregularities, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>(a) In 1969,
preparing the statement of the prose­cution witnesses, Gerardo Villanueva and <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bata­lero</span>, in Criminal
Case No. 1184, a grave coercion case filed against Clara R. <span class="SpellE">Evalla</span>,
complainant's wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Mago</span> prepared the statements allegedly at the instance of
Jose <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>, the judge's <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">ninong</span></u></span><span style="">.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(b) In 1972,
acquitting Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Cabusas</span> and Felipe <span class="SpellE">Badinas</span> in Criminal Case No. 1367, a case of malicious
mischief filed by <span class="SpellE">Pura</span> <span class="SpellE">Evalla</span>,
the daughter of the herein complainant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c) On <st1:date year="1973" day="21" month="8">August 21, 1973</st1:date>, Judge <span class="SpellE">Mago</span> allegedly "flung away" the letter of the
complainant, addressed to the Chief Executive, wherein he denounced <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> for not paying
for complainant's coconut land and trees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(d) On August 22,
1973, Judge <span class="SpellE">Mago</span> allegedly re­fused to furnish the
complainant with copies of the trans­cript to be used in the hearing of
Criminal Case No. 1578 filed by Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Cabusas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Teodora</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Sena</span> against Ruben <span class="SpellE">Alarcon</span>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After Judge <span class="SpellE">Mago</span> had submitted his
answer to the charges, this Court, upon the recommendation of the Judicial
Consultant, dismissed for lack of merit charges (a), (c) and (d) (See Resolu­tion
dated June 25, 1975).</p>

<p class="BODY">Two additional charges were filed by <span class="SpellE">Evalla</span>
against Judge <span class="SpellE">Mago</span>:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>demanding P120 from the complainant for the purchase of two <span class="SpellE">lawbooks</span> and irregular ratification of a special power of
attor­ney.</p>

<p class="BODY">After Judge <span class="SpellE">Mago</span> had answered those
charges, the same, together with the charge of having dismissed Criminal Case
No. 1367, were referred to the Executive Judge of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte for investigation, report and
recommendation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The charges were
investigated by Judge Domingo Medina Angeles.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><u>Dismissal of malicious mischief case</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The investigator found that Judge <span class="SpellE">Mago</span> acquitted <span class="SpellE">Badinas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cabusas</span> after trial and after conducting an ocular
inspection and that he rendered a decision based on the law and the facts
established during the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Herein
complainant Gideon <span class="SpellE">Evalla</span> did not testify in that
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His wife was the offended party
therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge Angeles concluded that the verdict of acquittal was
correctly rendered by Judge <span class="SpellE">Mago</span> who decided the case
on the merits and who acquitted <span class="SpellE">Badinas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cabusas</span> because their guilt was not established beyond
reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><u>Improper exaction</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Judge Angeles also found that the charge of
having demanded P120 for the purchase of two <span class="SpellE">lawbooks</span>
was not proven by <span class="SpellE">Evalla</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not file any bribery charge against
Judge <span class="SpellE">Mago</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no evidence that <span class="SpellE">Evalla</span> delivered <span style="">P120 </span>to Judge <span class="SpellE">Mago</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, it is apparent that there was an improper moti­vation on
respondent's part in writing on a page of complainant's notebook the titles of
two <span class="SpellE">lawbooks</span> and their prices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that res­pect his behavior was not above
reproach.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><u>Irregular ratification of special power of
attorney</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The evidence
shows that <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span> <span class="SpellE">Caro</span>
signed a special power of attorney in favor of Felipe <span class="SpellE">Eborde</span>,
a <span style="">barrio captain, empowering </span>him
(<span class="SpellE">Eborde</span>) to receive from the district highway <span style="">engineer at </span><span class="SpellE">Daet</span>
the compensation for the construction of the <span class="SpellE">Masalongsalong</span>
<span class="GramE">bridge</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge <span class="SpellE">Mago</span> ratified the said document
in <span class="SpellE">Caro's</span> absence on April 12, 1975.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That date is blurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was superimposed on a prior date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The document was prepared by a clerk in Judge
<span class="SpellE">Mago's</span> office at <span class="SpellE">Eborde's</span>
instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Caro</span>
testified that he had no complaint against Judge <span class="SpellE">Mago</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the strength of that special power of attorney, <span class="SpellE">Eborde</span> allegedly collected from the municipal treasurer of
Mercedes the sum of P3<span class="GramE">,000</span> as payment for the
construction of the bridge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears
that <span class="SpellE">Caro</span> was the ostensible contractor and <span class="SpellE">Eborde</span> was the one who actually supervised the
construction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eborde</span>
supposedly paid <span class="SpellE">Caro</span> a certain amount for consenting
to act as <span class="SpellE">Eborde's</span> dummy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, the law prohibits barrio captains
from entering into any contract with the government for any construction
project.</p>

<p class="BODY">The investigator recommends that Judge <span class="SpellE">Mago</span>
be exonerated of the charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Judicial Consultant recommends that respondent Judge be suspended for fifteen
days.</p>

<p class="BODY">The act of a notary in administering an oath in affiant's
absence, while not amounting to gross misconduct, is censurable (National
Bureau of Investigation vs. <span class="SpellE">Morada</span>, 112 Phil. 717; <span class="SpellE">Viuda</span> de <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span>, 61 Phil. 773; Ramirez vs. <span class="SpellE">Ner</span>,
Adm. Case No. 500, September 27, 1967, 21 SCRA 207).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of a municipal judge, a higher degree of ethical
standard should be observed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, respondent Judge is exonerated of the charge of
having improperly acquitted the defendants in the malicious mischief case, it
not appearing that his decision was unjust (<u>In re</u> <span class="SpellE">Climaco</span>,
Adm. Case No. 134-J, January 21, 1974, 55 SCRA 107).</p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with the charge of illegal exaction, respondent
Judge is admonished to avoid improper or unbecoming conduct that will cast a
doubt on his integrity.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the last charge, the respondent is suspended for a period
of fifteen days for having irregularly ratified the special power of attorney
executed by <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span> <span class="SpellE">Caro</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The commission of another irregularity on his
part will be treated with more severity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Let a copy of this decision be attached to his personal record.</p>
