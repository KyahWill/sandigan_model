				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p></p><div align="justify">Jose de Borja has been delinquent in the payment of
  his real estate taxes since 1958 for properties located in
  the City of Manila and Pasay City and has offered to pay
  them with two negotiable certificates of indebtedness Nos.
  3064 and 3065 in the amounts of P793.40 and P717.39,
  aforesaid negotiable certificates, the applicants for backpay
  rights covered by them being respectively Rafael Vizcaya
  and Pablo Batario Luna.<p></p>
		<p>The offers to pay real estate taxes in question were
  rejected by the city treasurers of both Manila and Pasay		
		  
				
				  
		
		  cities on the ground of their limited negotiability under 
  Section 2, Republic Act No. 304, as amended by Republic ;
  Act 800, and in the case of the city treasurer of Manila on 
  the further ground that he was ordered not to accept them 
  by the city mayor, for which reason Borja was prompted 
  to bring the question to the Treasurer of the Philippines 
  who opined, among others, that the negotiable certificates 
  cannot be accepted as payment of real estate taxes inasmuch 
  as the law provides for their acceptance from their backpay holder <i>only</i> or the original applicant himself, but not 
his assignee. In his letter of April 29, 1960 to the Treasurer of the Philippines, however, Borja entertained hope 
  that the certificates would be accepted for payment in 
  view of the fact that they were already long past due and 
  redeemable, but his hope was frustrated. So on June, 30,
  1960, Borja filed an action against the treasurers of both
  the City of Manila and Pasay City, as well as the Treasurer of the Philippines, to compel them to execute an act
  which the law allegedly requires them to perform, to wit:
  to accept the above-mentioned certificates of indebtedness
  considering that they were already due and redeemable so 
  as not to deprive him illegally of his privilege to pay his 
  obligation to the government thru such means</p>
		<p>Respondents in due time filed their answer setting up ,
  the reasons for their refusal to accept the certificates, and
  after the requisite trial was held, the court <i>a quo</i> rendered t
  judgment the dispositive part of which reads:</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p> "Wherefore, the treasurers of the City of Manila and Pasay City,
      their agents and other persons acting in their behalf are hereby
      enjoned from including petitioner's properties in the payment of
      real estate taxes, and to sell them at public auction, and respondent
      Treasurer of the Philippines, and the treasurers of the City of
      Manila and Pasay City are hereby ordered to accept petitioners
      Negotiable Certificates of Indebtedness Nos. 3064 and 3065 in the
      sums of P793.40 and P717.39 in payment of real estate taxes of his
      properties in the City of Manila and Pasay City, respectively, without cost."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Respondents took this appeal on purely questions of law.</p>
		<p>Reduced to bare essentials, the 12 errors assigned by
    appellants may be boiled down to the following: (<i>a</i>) has
     appellee the right to apply to the payment of his real
    estate taxes to the governments of Manila and Pasay cities
    the certificates of indebtedness he holds while appellants
    have the correlative legal duty to accept the certificates in
    payment of said taxes?; (<i>b</i>)
can compensation be invoked to extinguish appellee's estate tax
liability between the latter's obligation and the credit represented by
said certificates of indebtedness?</p>
		<p> Anent the first issue, the pertinent legal provision to be
      reckoned with is Section 2 of Republic Act No. 304, as
    amended by Republic Act No. 800, which in part reads: </p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>"Sec. 2. The Treasurer of the Philippines shall, upon application,
      and within one year from the approval of this Act, and under such
      rules and regulations as may be promulgated by the Secretary of
      Finance, acknowledge and file requests for the recognition of the
      right to the salaries and wages as provided in section one, hereof,
      and notice of such acknowledgment shall be issued to the applicant
      which shall state the total amount of such salaries or wages due to
      the applicant, and <i>certify that it shall be redeemed by the Government of the Philippines within ten years from the date of their
      issuance unthout interest: Provided</i>,
That upon application * * * , a certificate of indebtedness may be
issued by the Treasurer of the Philippines covering the whole or part
of the total salaries or wages the right to which has been duly
acknowledged and recognized, provided that the face value of such
certificate of indebtedness shall not . exceed the amount that the
applicant may need for the payment of (1) <span style="font-style: italic;">obligations subsisting at the</span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">time of the approval of this Act ' </span>for which the applicant may directly
be liable to the Government or , to any of its branches or
instrumentalities, or the corporations owned or controlled by the
Government, or to any citizen of the Philippines, who may be willing to
accept the same for such settlement; (2) <i>his taxes;</i> * * * <i>And Provided,</i> also, That any person who is not
      an alien, bank or other financial institution at least sixty per centum
      of whose capital is owned by Filipinos may, notwithstanding any
      provision of its charter, articles of incorporation, by-laws, or rules
      and regulations to the contrary, accept or discount at not more than
      three and one-half <i>per centum per annum</i> for ten years a negotiable		
		      
				
				      
		
		      
certificate of indebtedness which shall be issued by the treasurer of
      the Philippines upon application by a holder of a backpay acknowledgment.</p>
</blockquote>
		<p>To begin with, it cannot be contended that appellants
  are in duty bound to accept the negotiable certificates of
  indebtedness held by appellee in payment of his real estate
  taxes for the simple reason that they were not obligations
  subsisting at the time of the approval of Republic Act No.
  304 which took effect on June 18,1948. It should be noted
  that the real estate taxes in question have reference to
  those due in 1958 and subsequent years. The law is
  explicit that in order that a certificate may be used in payment of an obligation the same must be subsisting at the
  time of its approval even if we hold that a tax partakes of
  this character. Neither can it be contended that appellee
  can compel the government to accept the alleged certificates
  of indebtedness in payment of his real estate taxes under
  proviso No. 2 above quoted also for the reason that in order
  that such payment may be allowed the tax must be owed
  by the <i>applicant himself</i>.
This is the correct implication that may be drawn from the use by the
law of the word "his taxes". Verily, the right to use the backpay
certificate in settlement of taxes is given only to an applicant and
not to any holder of any negotiable certificate to whom the law only
gives the right to have it discounted by a Filipino citizen or
corporation under certain limitations. Here appellee is not himself the
applicant of the certificate h in question. He is merely an assignee
thereof, or a subsequent holder whose right is at most to have it
discounted upon maturity or to negotiate it in the meantime. <em>A fortiori </em>it may be concluded that, not having the right to 
  use said certificates to pay his taxes, appellee cannot compel appellants to accept them as he requests in the present 
  petition for mandamus. As a consequence, we can not but 
  hold that mandamus does not lie against appellants because they have in no way neglected to perform an act 
  enjoined upon them by law as a duty, nor have they unlawfully excluded appellee from the use or enjoyment of
  a right to which he is entitled.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="STYLE2 STYLE1"><sup>[1]</sup></span></p>
		<p>We are aware of the cases<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="STYLE2 STYLE1"><sup>[2]</sup></span> cited by the court<i> a quo</i>
wherein the government banking institutions were ordered to accept the
backpay certificates of petitioners in payment of their indebtedness to
them, but they are not here in point because in the cases mentioned the
petitioners were applicants and original holders of the corresponding
back- pay certificates. Here appellee is not. With regard to the second
issue, i.e. whether compensation can be invoked insofar as the two
obligations are concerned, Articles 1278 and 1279 of the new Civil Code
provide: </p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>"Art. 1278. Compensation shall take place when two persons, in
      their own right, are creditors and debtors of each other.</p>
		  <p>"Art. 1279. In order that compensation may be proper, it is necessary:</p>
          <p> (1) That each one of the obligors be bound principally, and that
    he be at the same time a principal creditor of the other;</p>
          <p>(2) That both debts consist in a sum of money, or if the things
    due are consummable, they be of the same kind, and also of the same
  quality if the latter has been stated;</p>
          <p> (3) That the two debts be due;</p>
          <p>(4) That they be liquidated and demandable;</p>
          <p> (5) That over neither of them there be any retention or controversy, commenced by third persons and communicated in due time
    to the debtor."</p>
</blockquote>
		<p>It is clear from the above legal provisions that
compensation cannot be effected with regard to the two obligations in
question. In the first place, the debtor insofar as the certificates of
indebtedness are concerned is the Republic of the Philippines, whereas
the real estate taxes owed by appellee are due to the City of Manila
and Pasay City, each one of which having a distinct and separate
personality from our Republic. With regard to the Certificates, the
creditor is the appellee while the debtor is the Republic of the
Philippines. And with regard to the taxes, the creditors are the City
of Manila and Pasay City while the debtor is the appellee. It appears,
therefore, that each one of the obligors concerning the two
obligations is not at the same time the principal creditor of the
other. It cannot also be said for certain that certificates are already
due. Although on their faces the certificates issued to appellee state
that they are redeemable on June 18,1958, yet the law does not say that
they are redeemable from its approval on June 18, 1958 but "within ten
years from the date of issuance" of the certificates. There is no
certainty, therefore, when the certificate are really redeemable with
in the meaning of the law. Since the requisites for the accomplishment
of legal compensation cannot be fulfilled, the latter cannot take place
with regard to the two obligations as found by the court<i> a quo</i>.  </p>
		<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is reversed. The
    petition for mandamus is dismissed. The injunction issued 
    against respondents-appellants is hereby lifted.
     No costs.</p>
