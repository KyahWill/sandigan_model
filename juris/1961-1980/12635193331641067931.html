				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeals from the joint decision and resolution of the Court of
Tax Appeals in Cases Nos. 411 and 610, on the issue of the applicability of
Section 51(d) and (e) of the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended, to
delinquent taxes assessed prior to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of
the amended provisions on 20 June 1959.</p>

<p class="BODY">These cases commenced with the filing by <span class="SpellE">Connel</span>
Bros. Company (Phil.), a domestic corporation, of petitions in the Court of Tax
Appeals for review of the assessments made against it by the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue for deficiency income taxes for 1955 in the sum of P28,065.00,
said to be due and payable on 20 August 1957 (Case No. 411), and for 1954 in
the sum of P45,629.00, said to be due on 2 August 1956 (Case No. 610).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deficiency assessments arose from the
disallowance by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue of deductions for bad
debts, depreciation, and excess in valuation of leasehold improvements claimed
by the taxpayer in its income tax returns for said taxable years.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due trial, the Court of Tax Appeals rendered on 20 April
1966 a joint decision in the two cases, reducing the liability of petitioner
taxpayer for deficiency tax for 1954, from P45,629.00 to P2,109.00, but
sustaining the assessment of P28,065.00 as deficiency tax for 1955.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner was thus ordered to pay to
therein respondent Internal Revenue Commissioner the amounts of P2,109.00 and
P28,065.00 as deficiency income taxes for 1954 and 1955, respectively, plus the
corresponding interests thereon, pur­suant to Section 51 of the Tax Code, with
provision that if the said deficiency taxes were not paid in full within 30
days from the finality of the decision, petitioner shall pay a surcharge of 5%
of the unpaid amount, plus interest at the rate of 1% a month computed from the
date the decision becomes final until it is fully paid, but not to exceed an
amount corresponding to the interest for a period of 3 years.</p>

<p class="BODY">On motions for clarification by both parties, the Tax Court modi­fied
its decision, and, in its resolution of <st1:date year="1967" day="30" month="6">30
 June 1967</st1:date>, provided:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from with respect to the
1954 assessment (CTA Case No. 610) is hereby modified, as indicated above,
while the decision in regard to the 1955 assessment (CTA Case No. 411) is
hereby sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner is ordered
to pay respondent the taxes for 1954 and 1955, respectively, plus the
corresponding interests of 1/2% a month provided in Section 51 (d) of the
Revenue Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 2343, <u>supra</u>, which in no
case shall exceed 18% corresponding to a period of three years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the said deficiency taxes are not paid in
full within thirty (30) days from the date this decision becomes final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, petitioner shall pay a surcharge of five per
cent (5%) of the unpaid amount, plus interest at the rate of one per cent (1%)
a month, computed from the date this decision becomes final until paid; <u>provided</u>,
that the maximum amount that may be col­lected as interests shall not exceed
the amount corresponding to a period of three (3) years, ….."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the foregoing ruling of the court, the Commis­sioner
of Internal Revenue interposed the present appeals only from that portion of
the decision prescribing the rate of interest on the delinquent taxes and the
surcharges thereon payable by the taxpayer, and the period within which said
additional payments must be made.</p>

<p class="BODY">Herein petitioner, Commissioner of Internal Revenue, now claims
that in the imposition of interests and surcharges on the delinquent taxes in
these cases, the respondent Court of Tax Appeals should have observed the old
or <span class="SpellE">unamended</span> provision of Section 51(e) of the Internal
Revenue Code which was <span class="SpellE">enforcible</span> when the
assessments were made, and not that of Section 51(d) of the same Code, as
amended by Republic Act 2343, which went into effect only on 20 June 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be pointed out that before its
amendment, Section 51(e) prescribed --</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 51.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Assessment
and payment of income tax</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>--</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">xxxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">xxxxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">xxxx</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"(e)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Surcharge and interest in case of
delinquency</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-- To any sum or sums
due and unpaid after the dates prescribed in subsections (b), (c) and (d) for
the payment of the same, there shall be added the sum of five <u>per centum</u>
on the amount of tax unpaid and interest at the rate of one <u>per centum</u> a
month upon said tax from the time the same became due, except from the estates
of insane, deceased, or insolvent persons."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">As amended by Republic Act 2343,
effective <st1:date year="1959" day="20" month="6">20 June 1959</st1:date>, the
provi­sion now reads:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 51.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>--</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">xxxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">xxxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">xxxx</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“(d)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Interest on deficiency</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-- Interest upon the amount determined as a
deficiency shall be assessed at the same time as the deficiency and shall be
paid upon notice and demand from the Com­missioner of Internal Revenue; and
shall be collected as part of the tax, at the rate of six <u>per centum per
annum</u> from the date prescribed for the payment of the tax (or, if the tax is
paid in installments, from the date prescribed for the payment of the first
installment) to the date the deficiency is assessed:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>, that the maximum amount that
may be collected as interest on deficiency shall in no case exceed the amount
corresponding to a period of three years, the present provisions regarding
prescription to the contrary notwithstanding.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(e)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Additions to the tax in case of non­payment</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>--<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">xxxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">xxxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">xxxx</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Deficiency</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-- Where a deficiency, or any interest
assessed in connection therewith under paragraph (d) of this section, or any
addition to the taxes provided for in section seventy-two of this Code is not
paid in full within thirty days from the date of notice and demand from the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue, there shall be collected upon the unpaid
amount, as part of the tax, interest at the rate of one <u>per centum</u>, a
month from the date of such notice and demand until it is paid:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>, That the maximum amount that
may be collected as interest on deficiency shall in no case exceed the amount
corresponding to a period of three years, the present provisions regarding
prescription to the contrary notwithstanding.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Surcharge</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-- If any amount included in the notice and
demand from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is not paid in full within
thirty days after such notice and demand, there shall be collected in addition
to the interest prescribed herein and in paragraph (d) above and as part of the
tax a surcharge of five <u>per centum</u> of the amount of tax unpaid."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In other words, under the old Section 51
(e), a delinquent taxpayer would have to pay, in addition to the unpaid tax, a
5% surcharge thereon computed from the time the tax became due, plus interest
on the whole unpaid amount at the rate of 1% a month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the amendatory act (Republic Act 2343),
the delinquent taxpayer shall pay, in addition to the tax, a deficiency
interest thereon at the rate of 6% <u>per annum</u> computed from the date
prescribed for payment of the income tax up to the assessment of the delinquency
tax, but which shall not exceed the amount corresponding to a period of 3
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The interest of 1% a month and
surcharge of 5% on the whole unpaid amount shall be imposed only in case the
delinquency tax and deficiency interest are not paid within 30 days from the
date they become due.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Parenthetically,
it may be stated that even before the Court of Tax Appeals could resolve its
motion for clarification of the decision in these cases, herein respondent taxpayer
paid on 10 June 1966 the sums of P2,109.00 and P28,065.00 as deficiency income
taxes for 1954 and 1955, respectively, and P5,431.32 as interest thereon at the
rate of 1/2% a month, corresponding to the maximum period of 3 years.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute here that the delinquency taxes became due
and the assessments <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> were made before the
amendment of Section 51 on <st1:date year="1959" day="20" month="6">20 June
 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In applying the
amended provision to these cases nevertheless, the Court of Tax Appeals
reasoned that by its (the court's) modification of the Commissioner's assessment
in the decision of 10 April 1966 there was issued what amounted to a new
assessment, and this new assessment was made when the amended provision was
already existing and in force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We can
not subscribe to this theory.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule as to when interests and surcharges on delinquent tax
payments became chargeable is already well-settled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cons­truing the same provisions of the old
Section 51(e) and the present Section 51(d) of the Tax Code, as amended by
Republic 2343, involved in these cases, this Court has declared that the
interests and sur­charges on deficiency tax are to be imposed upon failure of
the tax­payer to pay the tax on the date fixed in the law for payment thereof,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
which is, under the <span class="SpellE">unamended</span> Section 51, on or
before 15 May after the close of the calendar year, or on or before the 15th
day of the fifth month following the close of the fiscal year, as the case may
be.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The rule has to be so because a deficiency indicates non-payment of the correct
and collectible tax, and such state of deficiency exists not only from the
assessment of the deficiency but from the very time the taxpayer failed to pay
the correct amount due from him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Public policy demands that the date within which the correct
taxes, as well as the surcharges and interests in case of deficiency, are
payable, being specifically fixed by law, should not be moved or changed or
made subject to the discretion of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
And for that matter, neither should the accrual of the interests be made
dependent on the final outcome of an action contesting the correctness of the
assessment of deficiency tax by the Revenue Commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For there is nothing in the Internal Revenue
Code nor in Republic Act 1125, creating the Court of Tax Appeals, which invests
the said body with authority to supersede the period for payment of the tax
prescribed in Section 51, or to exercise the primary function of the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue of assessing and collecting taxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the taxpayer in these cases has failed
to pay the correct amount of taxes due and collectible in 1955 and 1956, his
liability <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> should be determined pursuant to
the law then in force when the tax originally fell due, which was the old
Section 51(e) of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is argued that the interests and surcharges for delinquency
partake of the nature of penal provisions, and as such, Republic Act No. 2343,
being more favorable to the taxpayer, should be given a retroactive effect.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is some reason for this view; however, it may be pointed
out that, in its Section 13, Republic Act 2343 expressly provides that -</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 13.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Act
shall take effect upon its approval:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>,
That the <u>rate hereinabove stipulated shall apply to income received from
January first, nineteen hundred and fifty-nine</u>, and for the <u>fiscal
periods ending after June thirty, nine­teen hundred and fifty-nine.</u>"
(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The incomes involved in these cases
having been received by the taxpayer before the period fixed in the law, the
rates prescribed therein cannot here be applied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is evident from Section 13 above quoted
that there was no intent to make Republic Act 2343 retroactive.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby modified;
the respondent taxpayer is ordered to pay the amounts of P2,109.00 and
P28,065.00 as deficiency income taxes for 1954 and 1955, respectively, plus 5%
surcharge on the amount of unpaid tax and interest at the rate of one <u>per
centum</u> a month until fully paid, computed from 20 August 1957, as regard
tax year 1955, and from 2 August 1956, as regard tax year 1954, deducting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> whatever amount the respondent taxpayer might
have already paid on the said tax obligation.<span style="">&nbsp;
