				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal, by both parties, from a decision of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> finding defendants <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span> V. de <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> liable for
libel and sentenc­ing them to pay, jointly and severally, to plaintiff Domin­go
Imperial, the sum of P20,000 as moral damages, and to bear the costs, as well
as dismissing defendants' counter­claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is an action by Domingo Imperial against <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span>
P. <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span>, Lorenzo P. <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span> V. de <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> and Alfredo
<span class="SpellE">Caldino</span> to recover P500,000 as moral damages and
P100,000 as exemplary or corrective damages, plus interest and costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span style="">their
joint answer, the first three (3) defendants set up a counterclaim for P500,000
each, as moral damages, and P200,000 as "corrective penalty",
plaintiff's action having been allegedly brought maliciously.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon, later, Lorenzo P. <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span>
died, in view of which the case was dismissed, insofar as he is concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was, likewise, dismissed as against
Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Caldino</span>, upon motion filed by him and
plaintiff Im­perial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the
action proceeded only against <span class="SpellE">Venan­cio</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span> V. de <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> - hereinafter referred to as Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>
- with the result already adverted to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff's action is mainly based upon the publication of:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) a mimeographed copy of an article,
entitled "History of the Last Elections <span style="">in </span><span class="SpellE">Albay</span>", by-lined "By Gov.
<span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span style="">P. <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span>", and marked as Exhibit F; (2) a certified copy
of a </span>letter, dated March 31, 1952, subscribed and sworn to by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>, addressed to the Commission on Appointments, and
mark­ed as Exhibit N, <span class="SpellE">photostatic</span> copy of the
original of which is Exhibit C; and (3) a certified copy of a letter <span style="">of </span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>,
bearing the same date, likewise, addressed to the Com­mission on Appointments,
and marked as Exhibit Q, <span class="SpellE">photostatic</span> copy of the
original of which is Exhibit T.</p>

<p class="BODY">Exhibit F purports to explain the reason for the alleged
"hostility of the Imperials - referring particularly to plaintiff Domingo
Imperial - "against the <span class="SpellE">Zigas</span>", stating
that it is due to the desire of the Imperials "to perpetuate them­selves
in leadership" and the failure of <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span>, as Governor of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>, to
acquiesce to be a "tool" or "rubber stamp" of the
Imperials, in connection with the lease of the public market site at <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> Port, and the lease of the fishery and the
slaughter house privileges in <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>, to
"dummies <span style="">of </span>the
Imperials".</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the other hand,
Exhibit N asserts, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that
"Hon. Domingo Imperial lacks honesty and integrity of character";
that "he committed treachery and sabotage against the Liberal Party, while
he was x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> acting as
Chairman of the Commission on Elections"; that "he not only used his
posi­tion, but, also, gave away money and other goods in order to fix the
elections in <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalistas</span>"; that "acting under his
instructions, his wife x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
and other relatives actively campaigned </span><span style="">in </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Albay</span></span><span style=""> against the Liberal Party, especially
against Ex-Governor <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span>";
that, among said relatives of the plaintiff were some </span>of his employees
in the Commission on Elections, as well as a civil service employee in the
Public Service Commission and a clerk in the Court of Appeals; that "the
reason for the enmity of Hon. Domingo Imperial against Ex-Governor <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span>" is "because as Provincial Governor of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>, Gover­nor <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span> refused to
be cowed and to be dictated by the Im­perials" or to be his
"tool" in connection with "illegal, illicit or immoral
transactions", such as a resolution, ap­proved by the municipal council of
<span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>, upon plaintiff's instructions, leasing part
of the <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> market site, for a nominal sum, to a
dummy of the Imperials, which resolution, like two (2) other resolutions of the
same council, giving the fishery privileges and the slaughter house privileges,
at nominal fees, to dummies of the Imperials, were disap­proved by Governor <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span>, because, "contrary to his oath of office x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> and x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> to his conscience", plaintiff "does not
want honest and good officials in the Government service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He wants public officials who serve their own
selfish interests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He wants corrupt
officials to take ad­vantage of their positions to enrich themselves and their
relatives at the expense of the government"; that "nepotism has been
his norm of conduct thereby benefiting only his close kin and relatives";
that while he was "Minister of Bangkok and to Indonesia x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> his family and other close
relatives were seen going around x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> selling wrist wat­ches, jewelry and Indonesian
silks"; that, "as Senator x <span class="SpellE">x</span> sometime
ago", he "secured x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
twenty (20) bales of UNRRA clothing destined to be distributed to the poor peo­ple
of the Philippines," but, instead, he caused the bales to be opened and
"sorted out the good clothing", then "gave some to his family
and the rest, sold to the public, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> leaving only for distribution to the poor the remaining
little clothing that were really useless"; that plaintiff "miserably
lacks nobleness and decency in his conduct as public official"; that when
a jobless young man sought his recommendation for a job in Manila, plaintiff
refused to help him "unless his father x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> would surrender to him (plaintiff) politically and
campaign against <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span> in the last elections";
and that plaintiff dismissed without cause a female employee of the Commission
on Elections merely be­cause her parents had not followed "the political
dictates of Imperial in the last elections".</p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, Exhibit Q states, among other things, that, "as
Chairman of the Commission on Elections", plaintiff had sent to the <span class="SpellE">Bicol</span> provinces "false ballots, similar to the
official" ones, on which the names of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
candidates had already been written; that these false ballots were used as
"<span class="SpellE">lanzaderas</span>", to be exchanged with official
ballots during the canvass; that plaintiff is "a man who throws stones
with a hidden hand"; that he "turned traitor to the Liberal
Party"; that "as Minister in Bangkok, Thai­land", he had done
nothing "except some business which he (Imperial) smuggled from Bangkok x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Indonesia <span style="">in </span>the form of wrist watches, jewelry
and embroidered clothes which he sold here at an enormous profit."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellants do not deny
the libelous nature of these imputations, but they:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) question the sufficiency of the evidence
on the authorship thereof; and (2) invoke their alleged privileged character.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As above indicated,
Exhibit F is a mimeographed copy of an article, entitled "History of the
Last Elections in <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>", by-lined," By
Gov. <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span>"
and written about the early part of 1950.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Its subject is the very topic of his political speeches in the </span>1949
<span style="">elections, dur­ing which his brother
Lorenzo, now deceased, ran for Con­gress, and lost to <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lawengco</span>, who, the <span class="SpellE">Zigas</span>
sus­pected, was supported by plaintiff herein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this con­nection, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Rito</span> testified
that, early in 1950, he saw a copy of Exhibit F on top of the desk of <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> </span>P. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ziga</span></span><span style="">, as Provincial Governor of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>; that there
were about </span>100 <span style="">copies thereof in
the latter's office; and that he (<span class="SpellE">Rito</span>) then heard <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> order the mailing and distribution thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, Jesus </span><span class="SpellE">Salalima</span>
<span style="">declared that, after a conference held
in said office, sometime in August, 1951, <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> P.
<span class="SpellE">Ziga</span> gave him said Exhibit F, which he (<span class="SpellE">Salalima</span>) readily mailed to plaintiff herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span>
P. <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span> is the author of said article and the </span>one
<span style="">who had caused the same to be
distributed and </span>published.</p>

<p class="BODY">How <span style="">about Exhibits N and </span>Q?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Both
were sent to the Commission on Appointments when it was considerin</span>g<span style=""> plaintiff's appointment as </span>Chairman
of the Commission on Elec­tions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Evidently, Exhibit </span>N was <span style="">supposed </span>to replace Ex<span style="">hibit </span>Q, for the contents of both <span style="">are about the </span>same, except that <span style="">Exhibit </span>N <span style="">includes more charges than </span>those m<span style="">ade in </span><span style="">Exhibit </span>Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although admittedly, signed by Mrs<span style="">. <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>, </span>the
lower court found that <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span><span style=""> </span>is the
real author thereof and that Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> <span style="">had </span>merely acted as his tool, by
lending her name and signature thereon.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon a<span style=""> </span>review of the
record, we do not find therein sufficient justification to disturb this
conclusion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Indeed, according to then
Congressman Espinosa, of <span class="SpellE">Mas­bate</span>, in March, 1952,
then Congressman Lorenzo P. </span><span class="SpellE">Ziga</span>, <span style="">now deceased and brother of <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span>, told him
(Espinosa), in the presence of other members of Congress, that plaintiff had
sent to <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> already filled in ballots, in order to
in­sure the election of Manuel <span class="SpellE">Calleja</span> as Governor in
1951, and that the <span class="SpellE">Zigas</span> were going to file the
corresponding complaint against the offenders, especially plaintiff herein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, Congressman <span class="SpellE">Galias</span>, of <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span>, declared that late in March, 1952, Congressman
Lorenzo P. <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span> urged him to oppose the confirmation
of plaintiff's appointment by the Commission on Elections, for he (Congressman <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span>) and his brother, <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span>
P. <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span>, were going to file charges against him
(plaintiff) with the Commission on Appointments, one of which was that, shortly
before the 1951 elections, plaintiff had sent to <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>,
from 10 to 12 thousand ballots already filled with the names of <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> candidates and that, a few days prior to the
meeting of said Commission on Appointments, Congressman <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span>
reiterated the request that he (<span class="SpellE">Galias</span>) object to
plaintiff's confirmation, inasmuch as charges had already been <span style="">preferred </span>against him before said
body.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Again, soon after the
1951 </span><span style="">elections, Miguel <span class="SpellE">Bustamante</span> was informed </span><span style="">by <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span>
that, with the help of his </span>brother, Lorenzo P. <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span>,
he (<span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span>) would
file with the Commission on Appointments a protest against plain­tiff's
appointment as Chairman of the Commission on Elections, because his (<span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Ziga's</span>) defeat in
said elections was due to the numerous ballots, already filled with names of <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> candidates, allegedly sent to <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> by the plain­tiff.</p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, there is sufficient evidence to warrant the
conclusion that <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span>
had caused Exhibits N and Q to be made and then signed by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>, as well as sent to the Commission on Appointments.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon </span>the other
hand, it is clear that Exhibit F is not <span style="">privileged
</span>at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, appellants do not
claim it to be so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to
Exhibits N and Q, the originals thereof had been sent to the Commission on
Appointments, in connection with plaintiff's appointment as Chairman of the
Commission on Elections, which was pending confirmation before said body, thus
giving to both documents the color of qualified privileged communications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted, however, that, pursuant
to Article 354 of the Revised Penal Code, "every defamatory imputation is
presumed to be mali­cious, even if true, if no good intention and justifiable
motive far making it is shown".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although said presumption is inapplicable to "a private
communication made by any person to another in the performance of any legal,
moral or social duty", the record satisfactorily shows that Ex­hibits N
and Q had been made and sent to the Commission on Appointments with actual
malice on the part of both Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> and appellant <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span>, and for the
purpose of besmirching plaintiff's reputation and exposing him to ridicule and
contempt.</p>

<p class="BODY">To begin with, there is the circumstance that <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span>
P. <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span> had tried to conceal the identity of the true
maker of said documents, by causing Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> to
sign the same, instead of doing so himself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, the defendants have not attempted to prove the truth of the
imputations therein made, or, at least, that they - particularly Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> ? had reasonable grounds to believe them to be
true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the nature of the
imputations is such and the language used so intemperate as to indicate that
defendants could not have earnestly believed them to be true or even
approximately true, and that they - especially <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span>
P. <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span> - were merely giving vent to their extreme
bitterness against plaintiff herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">This inference becomes even more imperative when we consider that
there is no competent evidence that plaintiff was financially interested in the
lease either of the mar­ket site or of the fishery or slaughter house
privileges in <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>; that, according to the
municipal treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> from 1921 to 1941 and
assistant provincial treasurer and cashier of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>
from 1941 to 1952, plaintiff had never interested himself in seeking or
intervening in any applica­tion for market privileges in <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>;
that plaintiff's wife was in Manila during the election campaign in 1951; that
she never campaigned, even when her husband was running for a public office;
that there is reliable and <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span> evidence
that plaintiff had always abstained from partici­pating in the proceedings in
the Commission on Elections in any matter affecting elections, not only in the
province of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>, but, also, in the entire <span class="SpellE">Bicol</span> region, precisely to avoid any possible suspicion and
to maintain public con­fidence in said Commission; that plaintiff was,
moreover, instrumental in stopping gem smuggling in Bangkok; that the persons named
in Exhibits N and Q, in connection with the charge of nepotism, were either not
appointed by plaintiff or not related to him, or their relationship is beyond
the <span style="">prohibited de</span>g<span style="">ree, or the position involved is beyond the
scope of the pertinent executive order; and that there is no competent evidence
</span><span style="">on </span><span style="">the alleged irregularities </span>in <span style="">connection with UNRR goods.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Then, <span style="">again,
independently of Exhibits </span>N <span style="">and
Q, the article </span>Exhibit <span style="">F
suffices to support plaintiff's action against <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span>
P. <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus clear that the lower court <span style="">was </span>justified in finding for plaintiff herein and in sentencing
the defendants to pay him the sum<span style=""> </span>of
P20,000 as moral damages.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Plaintiff, in turn,
contends </span>that <span style="">he is, also,
entitled to exemplary damages and that the defendants should, further, be
sentenced to pay interest on the amount or amounts adjudi­cated to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>With <span style="">respect to the exemplary damages, its re­covery is not a matter of
right (article 2233, Civil Code of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">) and the records do not show that the lower
court had abused its discretion in not awarding </span>it.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">Indeed, considering that plaintiff's
appointment had eventual­ly been confirmed, we are satisfied that the sum of
P20,000.00 adjudged in his favor, by way of moral damages, meets suffi­ciently
the demands of justice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As regards interest on the aforementioned sum, the cases of Lopez
vs. Pan American World Airways<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>

sanction the collection of the legal rate of interest from the promulgation of
the deci­sion appealed from, on <st1:date year="1959" day="10" month="12">December
 10, 1959</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> has died
meanwhile, his surviv­ing spouse <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> has substituted her, as one of the defendants
herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court, likewise, takes
judicial cognizance of the fact that Domingo Imperial has, also, pass­ed
away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, it is hereby decreed
that his legal representative or heirs be substituted in his stead, as
plaintiff herein.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thus modified, as re</span>g<span style="">ards the parties, as well </span>as <span style="">in the sense that defendants shall pay the
legal </span>rate of interest on the sum of P20,000, from December 10, 1959,
the decision appealed from should, therefore, be, as it is hereby affirmed in
all other respects, with costs against defendants-appellants <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> R. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Muñoz</span></span><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
