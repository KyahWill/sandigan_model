				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by plaintiffs, Julian <span class="SpellE">Singson</span>
and his wife, Ramona del Castillo, from a decision of the Court of First
Instance of Manila dismissing their complaint against de­fendants herein, the
Bank of the Philippine Islands and Santiago <span class="SpellE">Freixas</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that <span class="SpellE">Singson</span>, was one of the
defendants in civil case No. 23906 of the Court of First Instance, Manila, in
which judgment had been rendered sentencing him and his co-defendants therein,
namely, <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Lobregat</span> and
Villa­-<span class="SpellE">Abrille</span> &amp; Co., to pay the sum of P105,539.56
to the plain­tiff therein, Philippine Milling Co.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Singson</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lobregat</span> had seasonably appealed from said judgment, but
not Villa­-<span class="SpellE">Abrille</span> &amp; Co., as against which said
judgment, accordingly, became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due course, a writ of garnishment was
subsequently served upon the Bank of the Phi­lippine Islands - in which the <span class="SpellE">Singsons</span> had a current ac­count - insofar as Villa-<span class="SpellE">Abrille's</span> credits against the Bank were concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What happened thereafter is set forth in the
decision appealed from, from which we quote:</p>

<blockquote>"Upon receipt of the said Writ of Garnish­ment, a clerk of the
bank in charge of all matters of execution and garnishment, upon reading the
name of the plaintiff herein in the title of the Writ of Garnishment as a party
defendant, without further reading the body of the said garnishment and
informing himself that said gar­nishment was merely intended for the deposits
of defendant Villa-<span class="SpellE">Abrille</span> &amp; Co., <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> <span class="SpellE">Teus</span>, Fernando F. de
Villa-<span class="SpellE">Abrille</span> and Joaquin Bona, prepared a letter for
the signature of the Pre­sident of the Bank informing the plaintiff Julian C. <span class="SpellE">Singson</span> of the garnishment of his de­posits by the
plaintiff in that case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another letter
was also prepared and signed by the said President of the Bank for the Special
Sheriff dated <st1:date year="1963" day="17" month="4">April 17, 1963</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Subsequently, two checks issued by the plaintiff Julian C. <span class="SpellE">Singson</span>, one for the amount of P383 in favor of B. M. Glass
Service dated <st1:date year="1963" day="16" month="4">April 16, 1963</st1:date>
and bearing No. <span class="GramE">C-424852, and check No.</span> C-394996 for
the amount of P100 in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Lega</span> Corporation,
and drawn against the said Bank, were deposited by the said <span class="SpellE">drawees</span>
with the said bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Believing that the
plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Singson</span>, the drawer of the check, had no
more control over the balance of his deposits in the said bank, the checks were
dishonored and were refused payment by the said bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Af­ter the first check was
returned by the bank to the B.M.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Glass Service, the latter wrote plain­tiff Julian C. <span class="SpellE">Singson</span>
a letter, dated April 19, 1963, advising him that his check for P383.00 bearing
No. C-424852 was not honored by the bank for the reason that his account
therein had already been garnished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
said B. M. Glass Service further stated in the said letter that they were
constrained to close his credit account with them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view thereof, plaintiff Julian C. <span class="SpellE">Singson</span> wrote the defendant bank a letter on <st1:date year="1963" day="19" month="4">April 19, 1963</st1:date>, claiming that his
name was not included in the Writ of Execution and Notice of Garnishment, which
was served upon the bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant
President Santiago <span class="SpellE">Freixas</span> of the said bank took
steps to verify this information and after having confirmed the same,
apologized to the plaintiff Julian C. <span class="SpellE">Singson</span> and
wrote him a letter dated April 22, 1963, requesting him to disregard their
letter of April 17, 1963, and that the action of garnishment from his ac­count
had already been removed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A similar let­ter
was written by the said official of the bank on <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1963</st1:date> to the Special Sheriff informing him that
his letter dated <st1:date year="1963" day="17" month="4">April 17, 1963</st1:date>
to the said Special Sheriff was considered cancelled and that they had already
removed the Notice of Garnishment from plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Singson's</span>
account.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the defendants lost no
time to rectify the mistake that had been inadvertently committed, resulting in
the temporary freezing of the account of the plaintiff with the said bank for a
short time.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1963</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">Singsons</span> commenced the present ac­tion against
the Bank and its president, Santiago <span class="SpellE">Freixas</span>, for
damages<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
in consequence of said illegal freezing of plaintiffs’ account.</p>

<p class="BODY">After appropriate proceedings, the Court of First Instance of
Manila rendered judgment dismissing the complaint upon the ground that
plaintiffs cannot recover from the de­fendants upon the basis of a quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>, because the re­lation between the parties is
contractual in nature; be­cause this case does not fall under article 2219 of
our Civil Code, upon which plaintiffs rely; and because plain­tiffs have not
established the amount of damages allegedly sustained by them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court held that plaintiffs' claim for damages cannot be
based upon a tort or quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>, their relation
with the defendants being contractual in nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have repeatedly held, however, that the
existence of a contract between the parties does not bar the commission of a
tort by the one against the order and the consequent re­covery of damages <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, this view has been in effect, reiterated in a comparatively recent
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in Air France vs. <span class="SpellE">Carrascoso</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
involving an airplane pas­senger who, despite his first-class ticket, had been
ille­gally ousted from his first-class accommodation, and compelled to take a
seat in the tourist compartment, was held entitled to recover damages from the
air-carrier, upon the ground of tort on the latter’s part, for, although the
relation between a passenger and the carrier is "contractual both in
origin and nature x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the
act that breaks the contract may also be a tort".</p>

<p class="BODY">In view, however, of the facts obtaining in the case at bar, and
considering, particularly, the circumstance that the wrong done to the
plaintiffs was remedied as soon as the Pre­sident of the bank realized the
mistake he and his subordi­nate employee had committed, the Court finds that an
award of nominal damages - the amount of which need not be proven<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
in the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,000</span>, in addition to attorney's fees
in the sum of P500.00, would, suffice to vindicate plaintiff's rights.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the judgment appealed from is hereby reversed
and another one shall be entered sentencing the defendant Bank of the Philippine
Islands to pay to the plaintiffs said sums of P1<span class="GramE">,000</span>,
as nominal damages, and P500.00, as attorney's fees, apart from the costs.</p>
