				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The principal question in this appeal from a judgment of the
lower court in an action for prohibition is whether Ordinance No. 4760 of the
City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> is <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the due process clause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court held that it is and adjudged
it "unconstitutional, and, therefore, null and void.” For reasons to be
more specifically set forth, such judgment must be reversed, there being a
failure of the requisite showing to sustain an attack against its validity.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition for prohibition against Ordinance No. 4760 was filed
on July 5, 1963 by the petitioners, <span class="SpellE">Ermita­-Malate</span>
Hotel and Motel Operators Association, one of its members, Hotel del Mar, Inc.,
and a certain Go Chiu, who is "the president and general manager of the
second petitioner" against the respondent Mayor of the City of Manila who
was sued in his capacity as such "charged with the general power and duty
to enforce ordinances of the City of Manila and to give the necessary orders
for the faithful execution and enforcement of such ordinances." (par.
1).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was alleged that the petitioner
non-stock corporation is dedicated to the promotion and protection of the
interest of its eighteen (18) members "operating hotels and motels,
characterized as legitimate businesses duly licensed by both national and city
authorities regularly paying taxes, employing and giving livelihood to not less
than 2,500 persons and representing an investment of more than P3
million."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
(par. 2).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was then alleged that on
June 13, 1963, the Municipal Board of the City of Manila enacted Ordinance No.
4760, approved on June 14, 1963 by the then Vice-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Astorga</span>, who was at the time acting as Mayor of the
City of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(par. 3).</p>

<p class="BODY">After which the alleged grievances against the ordinance were set
forth in detail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was the assertion
of its being beyond the powers of the Municipal Board of the City of Manila to
enact insofar as it would regulate motels, on the ground that in the revised
charter of the City of Manila or in any other law, no reference is made to
motels; that Section 1 of the challenged ordinance is unconstitutional and void
for being unreasonable and <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of due process
insofar as it would impose P6,000.00 fee per annum for first class motels and
P4,500.00 for second class motels; that the provision in the same section which
would require the owner, manager, keeper or duly authorized representative of a
hotel, motel, or lodging house to refrain from entertaining or accepting any
guest or customer or letting any room or other quarter to any person or persons
without his filling up the pres­cribed form in a lobby open to public view at
all times and in his presence, wherein the surname, given name and middle name,
the date of birth, the address, the occupation, the sex, the nationality, the
length of stay and the number of companions in the room, if any, with the name,
relation­ship, age and sex would be specified, with data furnished as to his
residence certificate as well as his passport number, if any, coupled with a
certification that a person signing such form has personally filled it up and
affixed his signature in the presence of such owner, manager, keeper or duly
authorized representative, with such registration forms and records kept and
bound together, it also being provided that the premises and facilities of such
hotels, motels and lodging houses would be open for inspection either by the
City Mayor, or the Chief of Police, or their duly authorized representatives is
unconstitutional and void again on due process grounds, not only for being
arbitrary, unreasonable or oppressive but also for being vague, indefinite and
uncertain, and likewise for the alleged invasion of the right to privacy and
the guaranty against self-incrimination; that Section 2 of the challenged
ordinance classifying motels into two classes and requiring the maintenance of
certain minimum facilities in first class motels such as a telephone in each
room, a dining room or restaurant and laundry similarly offends against the due
process clause for being arbitrary, unreasonable and oppressive, a conclusion
which applies to the portion of the ordinance requiring second class motels to
have a dining room; that the provision of Section 2 of the challenged ordinance
prohibiting a person less than 18 years old from being accepted in such hotels,
motels, lodging houses, tavern or common inn unless accompanied by parents or a
lawful guardian and making it unlawful for the owner, manager, keeper or duly
authorized representative of such establishments to lease any room or portion
thereof more than twice every 24 hours, runs counter to the due process
guaranty for lack of certainty and for its un­reasonable, arbitrary and
oppressive character; and that insofar as the penalty provided for in Section 4
of the challenged ordinance for a subsequent conviction would cause the
automatic cancellation of the license of the offended party, in effect causing
the destruction of the business and loss of its investments, there is once
again a transgression of the due process clause.</p>

<p class="BODY">There was a plea for the issuance of preliminary injunction and
for a final judgment declaring the above ordinance null and void and
unenforceable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court on <st1:date year="1963" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1963</st1:date> issued a writ of
preliminary injunction ordering respondent Mayor to refrain from enforcing said
Ordinance No. 4760 from and after <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="7">July
 8, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the answer filed on August 3, 1963, there was an admission of
the personal circumstances regarding the respondent Mayor and of the fact that
petitioners are licensed to engage in the hotel or motel business in the City
of Manila, of the provisions of the cited Ordinance but a denial of its alleged
nullity, whether on statutory or constitutional grounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After setting forth that the petition did
fail to state a cause of action and that the challenged ordinance bears a
reasonable relations to a proper purpose, which is to curb immorality, a valid
and proper exercise of the police power and that only the guests or customers
not before the court could complain of the alleged invasion of the right to
privacy and the guaranty against self-incrimination, with the assertion that
the issuance of the preliminary injunction ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span>
was contrary to law, respondent Mayor prayed for its dissolution and the
dismissal of the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Instead of evidence being offered by both parties, there was
submitted a stipulation of facts dated <st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="9">September
 28, 1964</st1:date>, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"1. That the petitioners <span class="SpellE">Ermita-Malate</span>
Hotel and Motel Operators Association, Inc. and Hotel del Mar, Inc. are duly
organized and existing under the laws of the Philippines, both with offices in
the City of Manila, while the petitioner Go Chiu is the president and general
manager of Hotel del Mar, Inc., and the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
Victor <span class="SpellE">Alabanza</span> is a resident of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
City, all having the capacity to sue and be sued;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2 That the respondent Mayor is the duly elected and incumbent
City Mayor and chief executive of the City of Manila charged with the general
power and duty to enforce ordinances of the City of Manila and to give the
necessary orders for the faithful execution and enforcement of such ordinances;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3. That the petitioners are duly licensed to engage in the
business of operating hotels and motels in <span class="SpellE">Malate</span> and
<span class="SpellE">Ermita</span> districts in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4. That on June 13, 1963, the Municipal Board of the City of
Manila enacted Ordinance No. 4760, which was approved on June 14, 1963, by
Vice-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> <span class="SpellE">Astorga</span>,
then the acting City Mayor of Manila, in the absence of the respondent regular
City Mayor, amending sections 661, 662, 668-a, 668-b and 669 of the compilation
of the ordinances of the City of Manila besides inserting therein three new
sections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This ordinance is similar to
the one vetoed by the respondent Mayor (Annex A) for the reasons stated in his
4th <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span> dated February 15, 1963 (Annex B);</blockquote>

<blockquote>“5. That the explanatory note signed by then Councilor <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> <span class="SpellE">Astorga</span> was submitted
with the proposed ordinance (now Ordinance 4760) to the Municipal Board, copy
of which is attached hereto as Annex C;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“6. That the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
derived in 1963 an annual income of P101,904.05 from license fees paid by the
105 hotels and motels (including herein petitioners) operating in the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter came a memorandum for respondent on January 22, 1965,
wherein stress was laid on the presumption of the validity of the challenged
ordinance, the burden of showing its lack of conformity to the Constitution
resting on the party who assails it, citing not only U.S. v. <span class="SpellE">Salaveria</span>, but likewise applicable American
authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a memorandum likewise
refuted point by point the arguments advanced by petitioners against its
validity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then barely two weeks later,
on <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1965</st1:date>, the
memorandum for petitioners was filed reiterating in detail what was set forth
in the petition, with citations of what they con­sidered to be applicable
American authorities and praying for a judgment declaring the challenged
ordinance "null and void and unenforceable" and making permanent the
writ of preliminary injunction issued.</p>

<p class="BODY">After referring to the motels and hotels, which are members of
the petitioners association, and referring to the alleged constitutional
questions raised by the party, the lower court observed:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The only remaining issue here being
purely a question of law, the parties, with the nod of the Court, agreed to
file memoranda and thereafter, to submit the case for decision of the
Court." It does appear obvious then that without any evidence submitted by
the parties the decision passed upon the alleged infirmity on constitutional
grounds of the challenged ordinance, dismissing as is undoubtedly right and
proper the untenable objection on the alleged lack of authority of the City of
Manila to regulate motels, and came to the conclusion that "the challenged
Ordinance No. 4760 of the City of Manila, would be unconstitutional and,
therefore, null and void." It made permanent the preliminary injunction
issued against respondent Mayor and his agents "to restrain him from
enforcing the ordinance in question." Hence this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">As noted at the outset, the judgment must be reversed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A decent regard for constitutional doctrines
of a fundamental character ought to have admonished the lower court against
such a sweeping condemnation of the challenged ordinance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its decision cannot be allowed to stand, consistently
with what has hitherto been the accepted standards of constitutional
adjudication, in both procedural and substantive aspects.</p>

<p class="BODY">Primarily what calls for a reversal of such a decision is the
absence of any evidence to offset the presumption of validity that attaches to
a challenged statute or ordinance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
was expressed categorically by Justice Malcolm:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The presumption is all in favor of validity. *** .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The action of the elected representatives of
the people cannot be lightly set aside.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The councilors must, in the very nature of things, be familiar with the
necessities of their parti­cular municipality and with all the facts and
circumstances which surround the subject and necessitate action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The local legislative body, by enacting the
ordinance, has in effect given notice that the regulations are essential to the
well being of the people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Judiciary should not lightly set aside
legislative action when there is not a clear invasion of personal or property
rights under the guise of police regulation."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It admits of no doubt therefore that there being a presumption of
validity, the necessity for evidence to rebut it is unavoidable, unless the
statute or ordinance is void on its face, which is not the case here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The principle has been nowhere better
expressed than in the leading case of O'Gorman &amp; Young v. Hartford Fire
Insurance Co.,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
where the American Supreme Court through Justice Brandeis tersely and
succinctly summed up the matter thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The statute here questioned deals with a subject clearly within
the scope of the police power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are
asked to declare it void on the ground that the specific method of regulation
prescribed is unreasonable and hence deprives the plaintiff of due process of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As underlying questions of fact may condition
the constitutionality of legislation of this character, the presumption of
constitutionality must prevail in the absence of some factual foundation of
record for overthrowing the statute." No such factual foundation being
laid in the present case, the lower court deciding the matter on the pleadings
and the stipulation of facts, the presumption of validity must prevail and the
judgment against the ordinance set aside.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor may petitioners assert with plausibility that on its face the
ordinance is fatally defective as being repugnant to the due process clause of
the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mantle of
protection associated with the due process guaranty does not cover
petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This particular
manifestation of a police power measure being specifically aimed to safeguard
public morals is immune from such imputation of nullity resting purely on
conjecture and unsupported by anything of substance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To hold otherwise would be to unduly restrict
and narrow the scope of police power which has been properly characterized as
the most essential, insistent and the least limitable of powers,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
extending as it does "to all the great public needs."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
It would be, to paraphrase another leading decision, to destroy the very
purpose of the state if it could be deprived or allowed itself to be deprived
of its competence to promote public health, public morals, public safety and
the general welfare.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Negatively put, police power is "that inherent and plenary power in the
State which enables it to prohibit all that is hurtful to the comfort, safety,
and welfare of society."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question but that the challenged ordinance was
precisely enacted to minimize certain practices hurtful to public morals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The explanatory note of the then Councilor <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> <span class="SpellE">Astorga</span> included as
annex to the stipulation of facts speaks of the alarming increase in the rate
of prostitution, adultery and fornication in Manila traceable in great part to
the existence of motels, which "provide a necessary atmosphere for
clandestine entry, presence and exit" and thus become the "ideal
haven for prostitutes and thrill-seekers." The challenged ordinance then
"proposes to check the clandestine harboring of transients and guests of
these establishments by requiring these transients and guests to fill up a registration
form, prepared for the purpose, in a lobby open to public view at all times,
and by introducing several other amendatory provisions calculated to shatter
the privacy that characterizes the registration of transients and guests."
Moreover, the increase in the license fees was intended to discourage
"establishments of the kind from operating for purpose other than
legal" and at the same time, to increase "the income of the city
government." It would appear therefore that the stipulation of facts, far
from sustaining any attack against the validity of the ordinance, argues
eloquently for it.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a fact worth noting that this Court has invariably stamped
with the seal of its approval, ordinances punishing vagrancy and classifying a
pimp or procurer as a vagrant;<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>

all of which are intended to protect public morals.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the legislative organs of the government, whether national or
local, primarily rest the exercise of the police power, which, it cannot be too
often emphasized, is the power to prescribe regulations to promote the health,
morals, peace, good order, safety and general welfare of the people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of the requirements of due process,
equal protection and other applicable constitutional guaranties, however, the
exercise of such police power insofar as it may affect the life, liberty or
property of any person is subject to judicial inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where such exercise of police power may be
con­sidered as either capricious, whimsical, unjust or unreasonable, a denial
of due process or a violation of any other applicable constitutional guaranty
may call for correction by the courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are thus led considering the insistent, almost shrill tone, in
which the objection is raised to the question of due process.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
There is no controlling and precise definition of due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It furnishes though a standard to which
governmental action should conform in order that deprivation of life, liberty
or property, in each appropriate case, be valid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What then is the standard of due process
which must exist both as a procedural and as substantive requisite to free the
challenged ordinance, or any governmental action for that matter, from the
imputation of legal infirmity sufficient to spell its doom? It is
responsiveness to the supremacy of reason, obedience to the dictates of
justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Negatively put, arbitrariness
is ruled out and unfairness avoided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
satisfy the due process requirement, official action, to paraphrase <span class="SpellE">Cardozo</span>, must not outrun the bounds of reason and result in
sheer oppression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due process is thus
hostile to any official action marred by lack of reasonableness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Correctly has it been identified as freedom
from arbitrariness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the embodiment
of the sporting idea of fair play.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
It exacts fealty "to those strivings for justice" and judges the act
of officialdom of whatever branch "in the light of reason drawn from
considerations of fairness that reflect [democratic] traditions of legal and
political thought."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>

decisions based on such a clause re­quiring a "close and perceptive

<p class="BODY">It would thus be an affront to reason to stigmatize an ordinance
enacted precisely to meet what a municipal lawmaking body considers an evil of
rather serious proportion an arbitrary and capricious exercise of
authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would seem that what
should be deemed unreasonable and what would amount to an abdication of the
power to govern is inaction in the face of an admitted deterioration of the
state of public morals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be more
specific, the Municipal Board of the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
felt the need for a remedial measure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
provided it with the enactment of the challenged ordinance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A strong case must be found in the records,
and as has been set forth, none is even attempted here, to attach to an
ordinance of such character the taint of nullity for an alleged failure to meet
the due process requirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor does it
lend any semblance even of deceptive plausibility to petitioners' indictment of
Ordinance No. 4760 on due process grounds to single out such features as the
increased fees for motels and hotels, the curtailment of the area of freedom to
contract, and, in certain particulars, its alleged vagueness.</p>

<p class="BODY">Admittedly there was a decided increase of the annual license
fees provided for by the challenged ordinance for both hotels and motels, 150%
for the former and over 200% for the latter, first-class motels being required
to pay a P6,000 annual fee and second-class motels, P4,500 yearly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been the settled law however, as far
back as 1922 that municipal license fees could be classified into those imposed
for regulating occupations or regular enterprises, for the regulation or
restriction of non-useful occupations or enterprises and for revenue purposes
only.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
As was explained more in detail in the above Cu <span class="SpellE">Unjieng</span>
case:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"(2) Licenses for non-useful
occupations are also incidental to the police power and the right to exact a
fee may be implied from the power to license and regulate, but in fixing amount
of the license fees the municipal corporations are allowed a much wider
discretion in this class of cases than in the former, and aside from applying
the well-known legal principle that municipal ordinances must not be
unreasonable, oppressive, or tyrannical, courts have, as a general rule,
declined to interfere with such discretion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The desirability of imposing restraint upon the number of persons who might
otherwise engage in non-useful enterprises is, of course, generally an
important factor in the determination of the amount of this kind of license
fee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence license fees clearly in the
nature of privilege taxes for revenue have frequently been up­held, especially
in cases of licenses for the sale of liquors.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, in the latter cases the fees have rarely been declared
unreasonable."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

this Court affirmed the doctrine earlier announced by the American Supreme
Court that taxation may be made to implement the state's police power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only the other day, this Court had occasion
to affirm that the broad taxing authority conferred by the Local Autonomy Act
of 1959 to cities and municipalities is sufficiently plenary to cover a wide
range of subjects with the only limitation that the tax so levied is for public
purpose, just and uniform.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As a matter of fact, even without reference to the wide latitude
enjoyed by the City of Manila in imposing licenses for revenue, it has been explicitly
held in one case that "much discretion is given to municipal corporations
in determining the amount," here the license fee of the operator of a
massage clinic, even if it were viewed purely as a police power measure.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
The discussion of this particular matter may fitly close with this pertinent
citation from another decision of significance:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"It is urged on behalf of the plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
that the enforcement of the ordinance would deprive them of their lawful
occupation and means of livelihood because they can not rent stalls in the
public markets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it appears that
plaintiffs are also dealers in refrigerated or cold storage meat, the sale of
which outside the city markets under certain conditions is permitted. * *
*.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And surely, the mere fact, that some
individuals in the community may be deprived of their present business or a
particular mode of earning a living cannot prevent the exercise of the police
power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was said in a case, persons
licensed to pursue occupations which may in the public need and interest be
affected by the exercise of the police power embark in those occupations
subject to the disadvantages which may result from the legal exercise of that
power."<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Nor does the restriction on the freedom to contract, insofar as
the challenged ordinance makes it unlawful for the owner, manager, keeper or
duly authorized representative of any hotel, motel, lodging house, tavern,
common inn or the like, to lease or rent any room or portion thereof more than
twice every 24 hours, with a proviso that in all cases full payment shall be
charged, call for a different conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, such a limitation cannot be viewed as a transgression against the
command of due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is neither
unreasonable nor arbitrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precisely it
was intended to curb the opportunity for the immoral or illegitimate use to
which such premises could be, and, according to the explanatory note, are being
devoted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How could it then be arbitrary
or oppressive when there appears a correspondence between the undeniable
existence of an undesirable situation and the legislative attempt at
correction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, petitioners cannot
be unaware that every regulation of conduct amounts to curtailment of liberty,
which as pointed out by Justice Malcolm cannot be absolute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"One thought which runs through all these different conceptions of
liberty is plainly apparent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'<st1:city><st1:place>Liberty</st1:place></st1:city>'
as understood in democracies, is not license; it is 'liberty regulated by law.'
Implied in the term is restraint by law for the good of the individual and for
the greater good of the peace and order of society and the general well-­being.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No man can do exactly as he pleases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every man must renounce unbridled
license.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right of the individual is
necessarily subject to reasonable restraint by general law for the common good.
* * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The liberty of the citizen may be
restrained in the interest of the public health, or of the public order and
safety or otherwise within the proper scope of the police power."<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A similar observation was made by Justice Laurel:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Public welfare, then, lies at the
bottom of the enactment of said law, and the state in order to promote the
general welfare may interfere with personal liberty, with property, and with
business and occupations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Persons and
property may be subjected to all kinds of restraints and burdens, in order to
secure the general comfort, health, and prosperity of the state * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this fundamental aim of our Government the
rights of the individual are subordinated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><st1:city><st1:place>Liberty</st1:place></st1:city> is a blessing
without which life is a misery, but liberty should not be made to prevail over
authority because then society will fall into anarchy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither should authority be made to prevail
over liberty because then the individual will fall into slavery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The citizen should achieve the required
balance of liberty and authority in his mind through education and personal
discipline, so that there may be established the resultant equilibrium, which
means peace and order and happiness for all.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is noteworthy that the only decision of this Court nullifying
legislation because of undue deprivation of freedom to contract, People v. <span class="SpellE">Pomar</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
no longer "retains its <span class="SpellE">virtuality</span> as a living
principle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The policy of <u>laissez</u> <u>faire</u>
has to some extent given way to the assumption by the government of the right
of intervention even in contractual relations affected with public
interest."<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
What cannot be stressed sufficiently is that if the liberty involved were
freedom of the mind or the person, the standard for the validity of governmental
acts is much more rigorous and exacting, but where the liberty curtailed
affects at the most rights of property, the permissible scope of regulatory
measure is wider.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
How justify then the allegation of a denial of due process?</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, there is the attempt to impugn the ordinance on another
due process ground by invoking the principle of vagueness or uncertainty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would appear from a recital in the
petition itself that what seems to be the <span class="SpellE">gravamen</span> of
the alleged grievance is that the provisions are too detailed and specific
rather than vague or uncertain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Peti­tioners,
however, point to the requirement that a guest should give the name,
relationship, age and sex of the companion or companions as indefinite and
uncertain in view of the necessity for determining whether the companion or
companions referred to are those arriving with the customer or guest at the
time of the registry or entering the room with him at about the same time or
coming at any indefinite time later to join him; a proviso in one of its
sections which cast doubt as to whether the maintenance of a restaurant in a
motel is dependent upon the discretion of its owners or operators; another
proviso which from their standpoint would require a guess as to whether the
"full rate of payment" to be charged for every such lease thereof
means a full day's or merely a half-day's rate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It may be asked, do these allegations suffice to render the ordinance
void on its face for alleged vagueness or uncertainty?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To ask the question is to answer it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From <span class="SpellE">Connally</span> v.
General Construction Co.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>

the principle has been consistently upheld that what makes a statute
susceptible to such a charge is an enactment either forbidding or requiring the
doing of an act that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its
meaning and differ as to its application.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Is this the situation before us?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A citation from Justice Holmes would prove illuminating:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"We agree to all the generalities about
not supplying criminal laws with what they omit, but there is no canon against
using common sense in construing laws as saying what they obviously mean."<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">That is all then that this case presents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it stands, with all due allowance for the
arguments pressed with such vigor and determination, the attack against the
validity of the challenged ordinance cannot be considered a success.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Far from it.<span style="">&nbsp;

at p. 1163. Also:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"To Frankfurter
the police power, true to its etymology, is the power to shape policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It defies legal definition; as a response to
the dynamic aspects of society, it cannot be reduced to a constitutional
formula.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law must be sensitive to
life; in re­solving cases, it must not fall back upon sterile <span class="SpellE"><u>cliches</u></span>; its judgments are not to derive from an

large-scale industry, it must meet the challenge of drastic social change.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For him as for Holmes, 'society is more than
bargain and business' and the jurist's art rises to no higher peak than in
vindicating interests not represented by the items in a balance-sheet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a progressive society, new interests
emerge, new attitudes appear, social consciousness quickens.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the face of the unknown one cannot choose
with certainty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor as yet, has the
whole of truth been brought up from its bottomless well: and how fragile in
scientific proof is the ultimate validity of any particular economic
adjustment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Social development is a
process of trial and error; in the making of policy the fullest possible
opportunity must be given for the play of the human mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If Congress or legislature does not regulate,

Cf. "In weighing arguments of the parties it is important to distinguish
between the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as an instrument for
transmitting the principles of the First Amendment and those cases in which it
is applied for its own sake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The test of
legis­lation which collides with the Fourteenth Amendment, be­cause it also
collides with the principles of the First, is much more definite than the test
when only the Four­teenth is involved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Much of the vagueness of the due process clause disappears when the
specific prohibitions of the First become its standard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right of a State to regulate, for
example, a public utility may well include, so far as the due process test is
concerned, power to impose all of the restrictions which a legis­lature way
have a 'rational basis' for adopting.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But freedoms of speech and of press, of assembly, and of worship may not
be infringed on such slender grounds.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They are susceptible of restriction only to prevent grave and immediate
danger to interests which the state may lawfully protect.” (West Virginia State
Bd. of <span class="SpellE">Edu</span>. <i>v</i>. <span class="SpellE">Barnette</span>,
(1942) 319 US 624, at 639).</p>
