(herein referred to as CIR)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> by 
respondent union against petitioner, Bay View Hotel, Inc., on September 27, 
1962, <i>viz</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"3. That the respondent [petitioner herein], in violation of Commonwealth Act 
No. 444, better known as the Eight-Hour Labor Law, has not been paying full 
overtime compensation to the employees who have worked and have been working for 
more than eight hours a day due to the exigency of the service and those also 
who have worked and have been working on Sundays and legal holidays;</p>
<p>4. That the respondent, in violation of Sec. 10, letters (f) and (g), of 
Republic Act No. 602, better known as the Minimum Wage Law, has been deducting 
the amount of P2.00 from each employee every month allegedly for medical fees 
thus reducing the salaries of the employees without the consent of the employees 
concerned;</p>
<p>5. That the respondent has not also been paying or has not been refunding in 
full to the employees concerned the collection from the customers of the Manila 
Hotel of the extra 'service charge' in lieu of 'tips' to the waiters or roomboys 
and which therefore are supposed to be paid to said employees but respondent has 
not been able to pay or refund in full said collection to the employees 
concerned;</p>
<p>6. That the respondent has not been complying with the grant of vacation 
leave of three (3) days a year in accord- ance with the Collective Bargaining 
Contract between the respondent and the Hotel Employees Union, another union in 
the respondent premises which is the collective bargaining agency in the 
Collective Bargaining Contract with the respondent;</p>
<p>7. That the respondent has been dismissing many of the members of the 
petitioner union since the organization and registration of the petitioner 
herein with the Department of Labor on May 31, 1962 beginning with the dismissal 
of the Treasurer, Ramiro Zamora, and Manuel Braga, board member, on the same 
date and thereafter, has dismissed and has been dismissing from the service its 
employees who are members of the petitioner union without just cause or for 
union activities up to this date, numbering 65 employees in all, 41 of whom were 
refused admission by an illegal lock-out in the Laundry Department of the 
respondent on August 26, 1962, and [of] the Bamboo Room on September 10, 1962, 
whose names and dates of dismissal are herewith attached as Annex 'A' and made a 
part of this petition;"</p></blockquote>
<p>On January 16, 1963, petitioner moved to dismiss. Grounds: (1) CIR has no 
jurisdiction; and (2) the dismissals and lockout alleged, constitutive of unfair 
labor practice, are the subject matter of Case 3387-ULP before another branch of 
the CIR.</p>
<p>On March 11, 1963, CIR Judge Emiliano C. Tabigne sustained the motion, 
dismissed the petition for want of jurisdiction.</p>
<p>On August 15, 1963, the CIR <i>en banc</i> resolved to reverse Judge 
Tabigne's order. It declared itself with jurisdiction "under the Com. Act No. 
103, and the ruling in the Prisco case" since "the number of the complainants 
involved exceeds thirty (30), they are still employees of the respondent, their 
claims arose out of employment relation, and the labor dispute may cause a 
strike or lock-out". The court gave due course to the complaint. As expected. 
Judge Tabigne dissented. Petitioner now brings this matter to us on 
certiorari.</p>
<ol><li>Petitioner's case is planted upon the averment that respondent's causes of 
action are not covered by any one of those enumerated in the 1956 case of PAFLU 
vs. Tan, 99 Phil. 854, 882. There, this Court confined the CIR's jurisdiction to 
the following cases: 
<blockquote>
<p>"x x x (1) when the labor dispute affects an industry which is indispensable 
to the national interest and is so certified by the President to the industrial 
court (Section 10, Republic Act No. 875); (2) when the controversy refers to 
minimum wage under the Minimum Wage Law (Republic Act No. 602); (3) when it 
involves hours of employment under the Eight-Hour Labor Law (Commonwealth Act 
No. 444); and (4) when it involves an unfair labor practice [Section 5, (a). 
Republic Act No. 875]." </p></blockquote>But the court below asserted 
jurisdiction on the authority of PRISCO vs. CIR, et al., L-13806, May 23, I960. 
In that case, this Court reviewed the cases decided since PAFLU and then stated: 

<blockquote>
<p>"Analyzing these cases, the underlying principle, it will be noted in all of 
them, though not stated in express terms, is that where the employer-employee 
relationship is still existing or is sought to be reestablished because of its 
wrongful severance (as where the employee seeks reinstatement), the Court of 
Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over all claims arising out of, or in 
connection with employment, such as those related to the Minimum Wage Law and 
the Eight-Hour Labor Law. After the termination of the relationship and no 
reinstatement is sought, such claims become mere money claims, and come within 
the jurisdiction of the regular courts.</p></blockquote>
<p>We are aware that in 2 cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> some 
statements implying a different view have been made, but we now hold and declare 
the principles set forth in the next preceding paragraph as the one governing 
all cases of this nature." </p>
<blockquote></blockquote>Then, amongst the many cases thereafter, restatements 
were made in Sy Huan vs. Bautista, et al., L-16115, August 29, 1961, and Campos, 
etal., vs. Manila Railroad Co., et al., L-17905, May 25, 1962. In <em>Sy 
Huan</em>, we said: 
<blockquote>
<p>"The jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations, under the law and the 
jurisprudence, extends only to cases involving (a) labor disputes affecting an 
industry which is indispensable to the national interest and so certified by the 
President to the Court, Section 10, Republic Act No. 875; (b) controversy about 
the minimum wage under the Minimum"Wage Law, Republic Act No. 602; (c) hours of 
employment under the Eight-Hour Labor Law, Commonwealth Act No. 444; and (d) 
unfair labor practice. Section 5 (a) Republic Act No. 875. PAFLUvs. Tan, 52 O.G. 
5836. xxx And such disputes and controversies, in order that they may fall under 
the jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations, must arise while the 
employer-employee relationship between the parties exists, or the employee seeks 
reinstatement. When such relationship is over and the employee does not seek 
reinstatement, all claims become money claims that fall under the jurisdiction 
of the regular courts. Price Stabilization Corporation vs. Court of Industrial 
Relations, et al, x x x".</p></blockquote>
<p>And in <em>Campos</em>, the language we employed was:</p>
<blockquote>"We may, therefore, restate, for the benefit of the bench and the 
bar, that in order that the Court of Industrial Relations may acquire 
jurisdiction over a controversy in the light of Republic Act No. 875, the 
following circumstances must be present: (a) there must exist between the 
parties an employer-employee relationship, or the claimant must seek his 
reinstatement; and (b) the controversy must relate to a case certified by the 
President to the CIR as one involving national interest, or must have a bearing 
on an unfair labor practice charge, or must arise either under the Eight-Hour 
Labor Law, or under the Minimum Wage Law. In default of any of these 
circumstances the claim becomes a mere money claim that comes under the 
jurisdiction of the regular courts."</blockquote>
<p>Later pronouncements reiterate the Campos case. As matters now stand, the 
doctrine enunciated in Campos still prevails.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3</sup> 
</p><p></p>
</li><li>A rule so highly esteemed and honored for so long a time is that 
jurisdiction over the subject matter is determined by the allegations of the 
complaint,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> the truth of which is to be 
theoretically admitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
<p></p>
<p>With this precept on hand, we now proceed to analyze the recitals in the 
petition.</p>
<p>There is an employer-employee relationship. And those dismissed seek 
reinstatement. The initial requirement of the Campos rule is thus satisfied.</p>
<p>Next we go to the claims of respondent union.</p>
<p>The first refers to a violation of Commonwealth Act 444. Petitioner herein, 
so the union asserts, "has not been paying full overtime compensation to the 
employees" who worked more than eight hours a day and also on Sundays and 
holidays.</p>
<p>The second involves a transgression of Republic Act 602. Petitioner, it is 
alleged, "has been deducting the amount of P2.00 from each employee every month 
allegedly for medical fees thus reducing the salaries of the employees" without 
their consent.</p>
<p>These two fall clearly within the orbit of the Campos decision. For, they are 
claims that "arise either under the Eight-Hour Labor Law, or under the Minimum 
Wage Law".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></p>
<p>Another claim: The alleged dismissals of union members, including union 
officials, numbering 65 in all, and lockout of 41 of that number — "without just 
cause or for union activities". This is an unfair labor practice charge<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> over which the CIR unquestionably has 
jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p>
<p>We are not unmindful of the admission made by the respondent union in its 
opposition of January 19, 1963 — to the motion to dismiss — that "the dismissal 
and lockout made by respondent [petitioner herein], as alleged in the complaint, 
have been duly investigated by the Prosecuting Division" of the CIR "and 
assigned to another branch" of said court as Case No. 3387-ULP.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> This fact alone will not dislodge 
jurisdiction from the CIR. The complaint in the case at bar, we must remember, 
was presented on September 27, 1962, long before the union made the admission 
aforesaid on January 19, 1963. And, it is not known whether ULP case was filed 
before the present complaint was received in court. Or, whether said ULP case 
was but an offshoot of that complaint. If the latter be the case, then the 
charge of unfair labor practice here is necessarily interwoven with the ULP 
case. And, said charge, should not be dismissed. Because, jurisdiction once 
acquired is not lost.</p>
<p>Two grievances remain.</p>
<p>One is that petitioner "has not been refunding in full" to the waiters and 
roomboys the amounts collected from customers as extra "service charge" in lieu 
of "tips". The other is that petitioner has failed to comply "with the grant of 
vacation leave of three (3) days a year in accordance with the Collective 
Bargaining Contract".</p>
<p>Whether the two causes just mentioned, standing alone, belong to the domain 
of the CIR, we need not now consider. The industrial court has jurisdiction over 
the main causes of action with respect to rninimum wage, overtime compensation 
and unfair labor practice. Which places the complaint herein in its entirety, 
including the two, within the jurisdiction of the industrial court. Because, 
<em>all</em> of said claims arose out of the<em> same</em> employment. </p>
</li><li>But, petitioner takes the position that jurisdiction over one is not 
jurisdiction over all. </li></ol>
<p>This Court, however, already had occasion to rule in a case<span class="style2"><sup>[10]</sup></span> similar in factual context to the present, 
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"x x x But considering that in this case, plaintiff-appellant's main claim is 
for the collection of overtime compensation, which comes within the jurisdiction 
of the Industrial Court, We see no reason for dividing the 2 causes of action, 
involved herein and for holding that one falls within the jurisdiction of one 
court and the remaining cause of action of another court, x x 
x"</p></blockquote>
<p>We find reinforcement of this view in <em>PRISCO</em>, <em>supra</em>, where 
express pronouncement was made that as long as the employer-employee 
relationship exists or is sought to be re-established, the industrial court "has 
jurisdiction over all claims <em>arising out of, or in connection with</em>, 
employment".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p>
<p>We are unprepared to break away from the teaching in the cases just adverted 
to. To draw a tenuous jurisdictional line is to undermine stability in labor 
litigations. A piecemeal resort to one court and another gives rise to 
multiplicity of suits. To force the employees to shuttle from one court to 
another to secure full redress is a situation gravely prejudicial. The time to 
be lost, effort wasted, anxiety augmented, additional expense incurred — these 
are considerations which weigh heavily against split jurisdiction. Indeed, it is 
more in keeping with orderly administration of justice that all the causes of 
action here "be cognizable and heard by only one court: the Court of Industrial 
Relations."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p>

denied and the appealed resolution of the Court of Industrial Relations <i>en
