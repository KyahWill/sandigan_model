of the decision of the respondent Workmen's Compensation Commission denying the

<p class="BODY"><st1:city><st1:place>Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Bael</span> was employed by the
respondent Bureau of Public Schools as an elementary grade school teacher

with a weekly salary of P71.50.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On or
about <st1:date year="1975" day="26" month="7">July 26, 1975</st1:date> at
about <st1:time minute="20" hour="17">5:20 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon
on her way home from her place of work she met a vehicular accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> she was
riding on rammed against an electric post and turned turtle pinning her to
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time of her death she left
her husband, <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Bael</span>,
and three minor children, Agnes, <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> and
Cynthia, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Bael</span>, the petitioners herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">In due time petitioners filed a Notice of Death and Claim for
Compensation with the respondent Bureau of Public Schools.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1975" day="22" month="4">April
 22, 1975</st1:date>, respondent through the Solicitor General, filed a motion
to dismiss the claim on the ground that the Office of the Solicitor General as
counsel of the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
has not been furnished with the copy of the supposed notice of claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1975" day="13" month="5">May
 13, 1975</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> City Sub-Regional
Office Hearing Officer denied the motion to dismiss the claim on the ground
that the respondent has failed to controvert the claim and has thus waived all
available defenses including the right to notice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the Acting Referee rendered its decision the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"AWARD THEREFORE is hereto entered in favor of the above claimant
and against the respondent, ordering the latter to pay the following:</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->To the claimant thru this Office, the total sum
of SIX THOUSAND AND TWO HUNDRED (P6,200.00) pursuant to Section 8 of the Act;
and</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->To the Commission thru this Office, the sum of
P61.00 under Section 55 of the Act.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The shares of the minors which is one-half (1/2) of the amount of
P6,000.00 shall be deposited in a bank nearest the residence of the said minors
pursuant to the Commission Rules.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Upon review of the records of the case by
the respondent Workmen's Compensation Commission, the latter set aside the
order of the Hearing Officer of <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> City
Sub-Regional Office and denied the claim of petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the decision of the respondent Workmen's
Compensation Commission, petitioners have come to this Court on a petition for
review raising the following issues:</p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->WHETHER LACK OF REPORT OF ACCIDENT AND/OR
CONTROVERSION OF THE CLAIM IPSO FACTO RENDERS THE EMPLOYER LIABLE.</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->WHETHER THE DEATH OF AN EMPLOYEE OCCURRING WHILE
ON HIS OR HER WAY HOME FROM WORK, OUTSIDE THE EMPLOYER'S PREMISES ALSO IPSO
FACTO ENTITLES THE FORMER TO COMPENSATION.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The main argument of respondent is that it is entitled to a copy
of the Notice of Death and Claim for Compensation which must be transmitted to
the Office of the Solicitor General in its capacity as counsel for the National
Government, even in cases where the claim is <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent invokes Commission Circular dated <st1:date year="1973" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1973</st1:date> which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"10. <u>Transmittal
of Claim to Solicitor General</u>. - In all claims for compensation against the
Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the Chief of the Work­men's Compensation Section or Unit shall see to it that a
copy of the notice and claim for compensation is transmitted to the Office of
the Solicitor General in its capacity as counsel for the National Government
even if the claim is <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Violation of this mandatory requirement may
subject the officer to administrative action as hinted in the case of Republic
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(Department of Justice) vs. WCC &amp; <span class="SpellE">Cleofe</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Arzaña</span> G.R. No. 29019, <st1:date year="1972" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1972</st1:date>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It is explicit from the foregoing
provision that what is <span class="SpellE">mandatorily</span> required of the
Chief of the Workmen's Compensation Section or Unit is to see to it that a copy
of the Notice and Claim for Compensation is transmitted to the Office of the
Solicitor General in its capacity as counsel for the National Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not require the claimant to transmit
a copy of the Notice and Claim for Compensation to the Office of the Solicitor
General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the duty of the head of
office or unit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the petitioners
have already filed their Notice of Death and Claim for Compensation with the
proper Workmen's Compensation Unit, there is already a substantial compliance
of due process on the part of the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is the fault of the head of the office if it does not transmit a copy
thereof to the Office of the Solicitor General.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As held in Republic (Department of Justice) vs. WCC &amp; <span class="SpellE">Arzaña</span>, G.R. No. 29019, May 18, 1972, a disregard by the
office concerned of the provisions of law governing the transmittal of claims
against the Government should not prejudice the claimant, worker or employee
who has no control over the said official and whom the Workmen's Compensation Act
so clearly aims to protect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Republic's remedy is to proceed administratively against the officer concerned
for violation of the regulations involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the records show that respondent Bureau of Public
Schools has failed to report about the death of Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
de <span class="SpellE">Bael</span> to the nearest Regional Labor Office of the
Department of Labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither has it <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> the claim within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period provided under Section 45 of the Act and of Memorandum Circular No. 210
issued by the Office of the President on <st1:date year="1968" day="29" month="10">October 29, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a consequence, the Hearing Officer declared the claim of petitioners <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span> and made the corresponding award in favor of
respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not prepared to hold the Hearing Officer to have abused
his discretion in making such award.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
our jurisdiction failure to controvert a claim within the prescribed period
amounts to a waiver of the right to controvert and a renunciation of all
defenses.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
This means that all non-jurisdictional defenses, such as non-compensability of
the illness, prescription, etc. are barred<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and such legal effect does not violate the requirements of due process.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
If on this ground alone, the instant petition should be granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">But even going into the merits of the petition, We are inclined
to grant the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The injury of the
deceased that resulted in her untimely death comes within the purview of the
"going to and coming from rule".</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In the case before Us, the circumstances
attending the death of the deceased constrain Us, to hold that the accident of
the deceased comes within the "going to and coining from rule”.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records show that right after her work at
school she immediately proceeded to go home by taking a <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In going home, she has still other school
work to do, like preparing, lesson plan for the next day, correcting papers and
preparing school projects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she
therefore took a <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> on her way home, she was
merely commuting to another place to continue with her work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her taking the ride in that fatal vehicle can
be treated as a necessary incident to her school work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The very nature of the work of the deceased,
the time required of her after class hours created that special circumstances
that qualify her heirs to the benefits arising from her death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In one case, the claimant started working
with the Bureau of Public Schools as a classroom teacher as early as July 8,
1953, assigned in one of the barrios of the town of <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span>,
province of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In going to her place of work, she had to cross the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
where she had to board a <span class="SpellE">banca</span> to ferry her to the
other side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In one of her trips while
alighting from the <span class="SpellE">banca</span>, she slipped causing her to
fall and her head bumped on the side of the boat, resulting in the pains and
contusions on the head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here the Supreme
Court held that the head injury that induced the tumor which caused her death
was incurred in line of duty.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Similarly, in the instant case, We can consider the death of the deceased as
having occurred in connection with her duty.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, the judgment of the respondent
Commission, is hereby reversed and sat aside and the original award of the
Acting Referee, Regional Office No. 4, Workmen's Compensation Unit, revived and
reinstated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without pronouncement is to
costs.</p>
