<p class="BODY">A Constabulary sergeant took the extrajudicial confession of <span class="SpellE">Laspardas</span> which was sworn to before the municipal judge of <span class="SpellE">Wao</span>. <span class="SpellE">Laspardas</span> was interrogated
in the <span class="SpellE">Cebuano</span> dialect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The questions and answers as translated into
English, read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Preliminary:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Laurencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Laspardas</span>, you are being informed that you are under
investigation for your involvement in the commission of an offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You are reminded that under our New

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why
are you here now at the office of the investigation section 447th PC Company? -

paying their accounts to me and at that time if the mother of the victim was
around I might kill her also but because her children were <u>only around I
killed them</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another thing <span class="GramE">sir,</span> was on that said day, <st1:date year="1976" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1976</st1:date> at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">four

while you were entering your penis to her vagina? - A:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did not able, sir, because she was
already dying due to her wounds in the breast.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was able to move her hips while (I was) inserting my penis.</blockquote>

and where did you do it? - A:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
house of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Arriesgado</span> in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span>

<p class="BODY">In view of <span class="SpellE">Laspardas</span>' admission in his
confession that he raped <st1:city><st1:place>Elizabeth</st1:place></st1:city>,
the complaint was amended so as to add rape to the charge of double
murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon arraignment in the municipal
court, <span class="SpellE">Laspardas</span> pleaded guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was elevated to the Court of First
Instance where a fiscal filed <span class="GramE">an information</span> for those
offenses aggravated by treachery, evident premeditation and dwelling.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment in the Court of First Instance, <span class="SpellE">Laspardas</span>, with the assistance of counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>, again pleaded guilty after the information
was translated to him in the <span class="SpellE">Cebuano</span> dialect which he
speaks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He answered in the affirmative
when the trial judge asked him if he understood the charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His counsel manifested that he explained to
the accused the law involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
accused admitted to his counsel that he had executed an extra­judicial
confession.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the arraignment, <span class="SpellE">Laspardas</span> was
placed on the witness stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
testified that the contents of his confession were explained to him in the <span class="SpellE">Cebuano</span> dialect; that he affixed his <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span>
thereto and that it was true, as stated in his confession, that he killed the
two girls because he was mad at their parents; that his organ touched the lips
(labia) of the vagina of Elizabeth <span class="SpellE">Arriesgado</span> who was
still alive, when he tried to have sexual intercourse with her, and that he
used his bolo in wounding the two victims.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of <span class="SpellE">Laspardas</span>, a judicial
confession elicited without cajolery or duress, is conclusive evidence as to
his guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The thirty-eight-year-old
accused declared that he worked for two years as a farmhand of the <span class="SpellE">Arriesgado</span> spouses, plowing their farm and harvesting their
corn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because he had not been paid his
accumulated wages amounting to more than four hundred sixty pesos, he was very
angry with the said spouses.</p>

<p class="BODY">When on <st1:date month="12" day="1" year="1976">December 1, 1976</st1:date>
the said spouses left the house and he found himself alone with their two daughters,
he conceived the idea of killing them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He perpetrated the killing in the evening of that day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could not state the exact time because he
had no watch.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the elder daughter, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Elizabeth</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE">,</span> was dying, he was sexually aroused and he had carnal
intercourse with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About half an inch
of his penis penetrated her vagina.</p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>,
assigned to defend the accused in this Court, contends that the accused made an
improvident plea of guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He invokes
the ruling that in a capital offense, specially where the accused has little or
no education, the proper and prudent course to follow is to take such evidence
as is available and necessary in support of the material allegations of the information,
including the aggravating circumstances therein enu­merated, not only for the
satisfaction of the trial judge himself but also to aid this Court in
determining whether the accused really and truly understood the consequences of
his plea (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Bulalake</span>, 106 Phil. 767).</p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> adverts
to the trial court's failure to require the prosecution to present
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record itself shows why
the trial court did not do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
discloses that there is not a scintilla of doubt as to the guilt of the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such a situation, the trial
court does not abuse its discretion in not re­quiring the prosecution to
present its evidence (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Duaban</span>, L-31912,
August 24, 1979).</p>

Phil. 703, 705).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Another contention of counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
is that the trial court erred in convicting the accused of rape with homicide
although in the information three distinct offenses, namely, rape and two <span class="GramE">murders,</span> were charged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fiscal characterized them as "double murder with
rape".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He alleged in the indict­ment
that the rape was committed on the occasion of the murders.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, imposes the
death penalty "when by reason or on the occasion of the rape, a homicide
is committed".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The instant case
presents a novel, reverse situation (analogous to rape accompanying a robbery) where
the rape was committed on the occasion of the murder, that is to say, when the
female victim of a murderous assault was at death's door, she was raped.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rape with homicide was committed (1) where the rapist, who was
suffering from gonorrhea, infected the victim and, as a result of the
infection, she died of peritonitis (People vs. Acosta, 60 Phil. 158); (2) where
the accused dragged a woman to a cane-field, struck her, rendered her
unconscious, had sexual intercourse with her and then killed her thereafter
(People vs. Lopez, 107 Phil. 1039; People vs. Ramos, L-34355, July 30, 1979)
and (3) where the accused had sexual intercourse with a girl below twelve years
of age and then strangled her (People vs. Yu, 110 Phil. 793; People vs.
Francisco, L-37418, September 28, 1979; People vs. Garcia, L-44364, April 27,
1979).</p>

<p class="BODY">Those decided cases are different from the instant case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the victim herein was already at the <span class="SpellE">threshhold</span> of death when she was ravished, that bestiality
may be regarded either as a form of <u>ignominy</u> causing disgrace or as a
form of <u>cruelty</u> which aggravated the murder because it was unnecessary
to the commission thereof and was a manifest outrage on the victim's person
(Arts. 14[17 and 21] and 248 [6], Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>See People vs. <span class="SpellE">Ganal</span>,
85 Phil. 743, People vs. <span class="SpellE">Bacsa</span>, 104 Phil. 136 and
People vs. <span class="SpellE">Cayeta</span>, 101 Phil. 1258, where the rape was
treated as an aggra­vating circumstance in robbery with homicide).</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
that the special complex crime of rape with homicide was not committed in this
case and that two separate murders were perpetrated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The murders were qualified by treachery and
aggravated by evident premeditation and abuse of confidence, two circumstances
which are deducible from the testimony of the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Premeditation was evident because there was a sufficient interval
of time between the planning of the murders and the execution thereof to allow
the conscience of the accused to overcome the resolution of his will had he
desired to hearken to its warnings.</p>

<p class="BODY">There was abuse of confidence because, according to the accused,
he had stayed for two years with the family of his two young and trusting
victims who in their immaturity and innocence never had <span class="GramE">an
inkling</span> that he had homicidal intentions towards them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Presumably, they looked upon him as their
protector and guardian in their parents' absence and not as their aggressor and
assassin.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dwelling is not aggravating because the house of the victims was
also the residence of the accused (<st1:country-region><st1:place>U. S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. Rodriguez, 9 Phil. 136, 139-140; <st1:country-region><st1:place>U. S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Destrito</span> and De <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>,
23 Phil. 28, 33).</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
that passion and obfuscation and lack of instruction should be taken into
account cannot be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused
acted in a spirit of lawlessness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
supposed passion and obfuscation were not generated by lawful sentiments.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lack of instruction is not mitigating because the illiterate
accused, as a Christian, cannot possibly be ignorant of the fifth commandment
(you shall not kill) or that it is contrary to natural law to commit murder
(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Mutya</span>, 106 Phil. 1161, per <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, <u>C</u>. <u>J</u>.; U. S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Balaba</span>,
37 Phil. 260, 270).</p>

<p class="BODY">It results that the mitigating circumstance of plea of guilty,
the only extenuating circumstance that can be appreciated in his favor, can
offset only one of the two aggravating circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the killing of <st1:city><st1:place>Elizabeth</st1:place></st1:city>,
there is the additional aggravating circumstance of ignominy or cruelty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, two death penalties should be imposed
on the accused (Arts. 64[1 and 4] and 248, Revised Penal Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">The two murders were specifically alleged in the information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused cannot complain that he was not
duly informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although his extrajudicial confession was used as a basis by the
trial court in interrogating him, nevertheless, it was not formally presented
in evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, there is no issue as
to its admissibility or as to its sufficiency under section 20, Article IV of
the Constitution or in the light of the procedural safeguards spelled out in
