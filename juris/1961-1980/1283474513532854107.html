				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><div style="text-align: center;">SUMMARY<br></div><br>Both cases involved claims for money against the Manila Railroad Company. The claimants filed their respective claims with the Regional Office of the Department of Labor, which granted the claims. After the Labor Standard Commission affirmed the decision of the Regional Officer, the case was elevated to the Court of First Instance on appeal, which in turned also affirmed the appealed decision. The Manila Railroad Company appealed to this Court questioning the authority of the Regional Officer to decide claims for money, invoking Reorganization Plan No. 20-A of the Government Survey and Reorganization Commission. The Supreme Court set aside the appealed decision without prejudice to the plaintiffs&nbsp; to sue&nbsp; in the proper court.<br><br>HELD: Reorganization Plan No. 20-A is void insofar as it takes away from the courts the power and authority to decide claims for money, and the decision of the Regional Office or the Department of Labor is not appealable to the Court of First&nbsp; Instance.</div>
