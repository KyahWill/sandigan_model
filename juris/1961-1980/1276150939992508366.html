				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>On July 8, 1907 Lambeito Ynotorio and Santos Catalan filed an action in the 
Court of First Instance of Capiz (Civil Case No. V-2209) against Canuta (now 
deceased), Joselino Vicente, and Pepito, all surnamed Lira, Crispin Catalan Vda. 
de Grino and Manuel Grino, Jr. for partition and/or to recover from the hitler 
the ownership and possession of one-half undivided interests in 141 parcels of 
land situated in the municipalities of Dumalaa and Sigma, Capiz, in the 
municipality of Pototan, Iloilo, and in the city of Iloilo, and to recover 
damages in the total sum of Pl,492,250.00. </p>
<p>Their complaint alleged, in substance, that Lamberto Ynotorio's father 
Eustaquio, and Santos Catalan's mother, Domingn Ynotorio, (both deceased) were 
brother and sister, respectively of Felipe Ynotorio who died in 1924 intestata 
and without issue, survived by his wife, def fenriant Canuta Lira, leaving the 
Ml parcels of land described in the complaint as their conjugal properties; that 
Canuta Lira thru fraud and illegal transactiolis, transferred several of said 
properties to her co-defendants Joselino, Vicente and Pepito, all surnamed Urn, 
their natural mother, Crispiua Catalan Vda. do Grino, and the altar's son, 
Manuel Grino, Jr., thus deprivins plaintiffs of thier lawful share in the 
inheritance of their late uncle, Felipe Ynotorio; that defendants had teen in 
possession of said properties since the (tenth of Felipe, and had refused to 
deliver to the plaintiffs their one-half interest therein a3 well as the 
corresponding produce thereof, despite repeated demands therefor. </p>
<p>Defendants' answer alleged, among other things, that Felipe Ynotorio died 
leaving a will which was duly probated and wherein Canuta Lira was made 
universal heir of all the properties left by the decedent; that 80 of the 144 
parcels of land described in the complaint belonged exclusively to Canuta who 
acquired them after the death of her husband, and the remaining 64 parcels were 
owned by Crispina Catalan Vda. de Grino, having acquired them from her deceased 
husband, Manuel Grino; that on February 27, 1936, Canuta Lira donated her 
properties mentioned above to her legally adopted children, Joselino, Vicente 
and Pepito all surnamed Lira, legitimate children of the spouses Manuel Grino 
and Crispina Catalan; that defendants and their predecessors-in-interest had 
been in exclusive and actual possession as owners of all the properties 
aforesaid for more than seventy years. As affirmative defenses, they further 
alleged that the complaint stated no cause of action; that, if it did, the same 
had prescribed, and that plaintiffs had no legal capacity to sue; and, as 
counterclaim, they sought recovery of the sum of P160.00000 as damages. </p>
<p>Defendants subsequently filed a motion for a preliminary hearing on their 
affirmative defenses, and a motion to strike out the allegations made in the 
complaint that no testate nor intestate proceedings had been instituted to 
settle the estate of the late Felipe Ynotorio and that the latter left no will, 
which allegations were, allegedly inconsistent with those in plaintiffs' reply 
of August 13, 1957. Both motions were denied by the court on the ground that the 
facts alleged therein would require the presentation of evidence by the parties. 
</p>
<p>On February 7, 1958, while the case was pending be- fore the lower court, 
defendant Canuta Lira died, and Arsenio Frial, on behalf of the legal heirs of 
Felipe Ynotorio, filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Capiz for 
letters of administration of the conjugal properties of Felipe Ynotorio and 
Canuta Lira, including the properties involved in the present case (Special 
Proceedings No. V-2269). The petition was granted over the opposition interposed 
by the plaintiffs herein, who appealed to the Court of Appeals. Meanwhile, 
plaintiffs moved for the dismissal of the present case, without prejudice to 
their taking such subsequent action or actions as the outcome of said appeal may 
warrant. Defendants opposed the motion on the ground that their counterclaim for 
damages contained in the answer cannot remain pending for independent 
adjudication by the court. </p>
<p>On November 13, 1959, the court issued an order dismissing the case without 
prejudice, and ruling that the amount which defendants ought to recover in their 
counter-claim may be the subject of a separate action or may be claimed in 
Special Proceedings No. L-2269. </p>
<p>The present is an appeal taken by defendants from (1) the order of the lower 
court of March 20, 1958 denying: (a) their motion for a preliminary hearing on 
their affirmative defenses; (b) their motion of September 4, 1957 for the 
striking out of certain allegations made in plaintiffs' reply, etc., and (2) 
from the lower court's order of November 13, 1959 dismissing the case, without 
prejudice, and ruling besides that the amount involved in the counterclaim may 
be the subject of a separata action or a claim filed in Special Proceedings No. 
2269; </p>
<p>This appeal, insofar of it refers to the order of the lower court of March 
20, 1958 is without merit. The trial court refused to hold a preliminary hearing 
in connection with the affirmative defenses interposed by appellants in their 
amended answer—that appellees' complaint did not state a cause of action; that 
they had no legal capacity to sue; that their causes of action, if any, had 
prescribed, and that, at any rate, all the questions raised in their complaint 
were already res judicata— upon the ground that there would bo need for the 
parties to present evidence for a proper resolution thereof. ThU appears to be 
true and an accurate appreciation of the situation Involved. It was obviously 
the best thing to have the case fully tried on the merits instead of holding 
merely a preliminary hearing, in order that the trie! court may be placed in a 
position to resolve correctly the questions raised by appellants.</p>
<p>However, we are of the opinion, and so hold, that the lower court erred in 
dismissing the case, as stated heretofore, over the objection of appellants who 
claimed that their counterclaim could not remain pending for inde- pendent 
adjudication. Said counterclaim is as follows: </p>
<p align="center">"COUNTERCLAIM" </p>
<p>the defendants allege: </p>
<ol><li>That the plaintiffs, at the pendency of Special Proceeding No. 1817 of this 
Honorable Court entitled, 'Testate Estate of the late Felipe Ynotorio', were 
aware of the institution and pendency of the aforesaid Special Proceedings for 
the settlement of the estate of the deceased, Felipe Ynotorio, and of tile fact 
that the said deceased left a will naming and instituting the defendants, Canuta 
Lira, as his universal heirs, and that the said Special Proceeding had been 
terminated with the settlement of the estate of the deceased and that all the 
properties of the deceased had been adjudicated by this Honorable Court in favor 
of the defendant, Canuta Lira, the universal heir of the deceased under the said 
will, and that the said will was duly probated by this Honorable Court way back 
on October 1, 1924; <br><br>
</li><li>That prior to the filing of this action, the attorneys for the plaintiffs 
were duly advised by the undersigned counsel for the defendants of the judicial 
settlement of the estate of the de- ceased Felipe Ynotorio, and of the 
adjudication by this Honorable Court of all the properties of the said deceased 
in favor of the defendant, Canuta Lira, by reason of her having been instituted 
universal heir of the said deceased in his will, and of the fact that the said 
wilt of the said deceased had been duly probated by this Honorable Court; 
<br><br>
</li><li>That notwithstanding all the foregoing, the plaintiffs instituted the 
present action as a result of which the defendants have been constrained to 
retain the services of their counsel and incur expenses in connection therewith 
in the sum of P50,000.00; <br><br>
</li><li>That by reason of the institution of the present action the defendants have 
incurred and will incur expenses incident to this case which expenses will 
amount to not less than P10,000.00; and <br><br>
</li><li>That by reason of the institution of the present action, the defendants have 
been greatly humiliated, their feelings have been gravely wounded, thus 
suffering moral and sentimental damages in the sum of not less than 
P100,000.00." </li></ol>
<p>It is clear that the counterclaim stated above is one that arises from, or is 
necessarily connected with, appellee's own action and cannot remain pending for 
independent adjudication by the court. We have already held that, in such case, 
the court may not dismiss the case over the opposition of the defendant (Belleza 
vs. Huntington, 89 Phil., 689, Froilan vs. Fan Oriental, etc., September 30, 
1954 and Domingo vs. Santos, et al., 55 Phil. 361). </p>
<p>Having arrived at the above conclusion, we do not find it necessary to 
resolve the other merely incidental issues raised in appellants' brief. </p>
<p>WHEREFORE, the orders appealed from are set aside, and this case is remanded 
to the lower court for further proceedings. </p>
