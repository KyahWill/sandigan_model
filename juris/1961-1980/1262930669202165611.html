				<H3>THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. BINALBAGAN ESTATE, INC., RESPONDENT.<br><br>DECISION
(WITH RESOLUTION OF MARCH 31, 1965)</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.P., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The Government, availing itself of its inherent power of taxation, imposed 
taxes on the Binalbagan Estate, Inc. for income received by the latter 
corresponding to the years 1951, 1952 and 1953. Binalbagan Estate, Inc. paid 
said taxes under protest and filed before the Court of Tax Appeals an action for 
their refund. The Court of Tax Appeals found for the taxpayer and the Collector 
of Internal Revenue brought this case before the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>From 1918 up to December 8, 1941 Binalbagan Estate, Inc. (Binalbagan for 
short), a domestic corporation, operated a sugar central at Binalbagan, 
Occidental Negros. 99.5% of its capital stock was then owned by the Philippine 
National Bank. Its tangible assets, with an acquisition value of P7,797,994,69, 
included a sugar mill capable of producing daily from 6,000 to 7,000 piculs of 
sugar. It possessed a sugar quota of 296,525,856 piculs.</p>
<p>During World War II, Einalbagan lost its books, records and papers. 40% to 
50% of its machineries, equipment and plant was rendered useless. After the war 
or in 1945, it tried to reconstitute its books and records and its accountant, 
Mr. Eufrenio Ramos, assisted by two employees of the Philippine National Bank, 
Messrs. Cion and Domingo, undertook the work. Mr. Ramos evaluated Bi-nalbagan's 
assets at P824,559.91 and accordingly entered said amount in its newly 
reconstituted books. Its sugar quota was not given any value.</p>
<p>In 1946, upon advice of President Manuel A. Roxas and the Council of State, 
in order to achieve economy in the rehabilitation of destroyed sugar mills and 
to lower the operating cost of milling sugar in the area where they were 
located, Binalbagan and Isabela Sugar Co., Inc. (Isabela for short) proposed to 
merge their assets to form a new corporation to be known as Binalbagan-Isabela 
Sugar Co., Inc. (BISCOM for short), with a capital stock divided into 400,000 
non-par value shares.</p>
<p>To ascertain the contribution and participation of Binalbagan and Isabela in 
BISCOM, a committee composed of Messrs. E.T. Westly, chairman, Raymundo Robles 
and Gonzalo Guillen, members, appraised the assets of both merging corporation. 
Their qualifications to undertake their work are admitted by both parties. The 
committee fixed the fair market value of Binalbagan's tangible assets at 
P2,541,134.69 and the sugar quota at P5.00 per picul or P1,482,629.28. It also 
pegged Isabela's tangible assets at P2,466,062.80.</p>
<p>On the basis of the Westly Committee's appraisal, merger was realized with 
Binalbagan being allocated 216,000 shares of BISCOM's capital stock in exchange 
for its tangible assets and sugar quota. In 19-18, Binalbagan gave away 39,055 
shares to three small sugar centrals which joined BISCOM in consideration for 
their voting trust, thereby reducing its equity to 176,945 shares. In 1951 
Binalbagan sold all the 176,915 shares to Philippine Planters' Investment Co. 
for P6,192,935.00 payable in installment. Philippine Planters Investment Co. 
paid P1,500,000.00 in 1951; P350,764.47 including interest of P4,296.97 in 1952; 
and P1,231,710.76 inclusive of interest in the sum of P13,878.26 in 1953. All 
these receipts together with sundry profits and credits to surplus were reported 
in Binalbagan's income tax returns for 1951, 1952 and 1953. Income tax paid 
thereon is as fallows:</p>
<p>1951 
.................................................................................. 
P14.327.00</p>
<p>1952 
.................................................................................... 
37,410.00</p>
<p>1953 
.................................................................................... 
139,617.00</p>
<p>For 1951, Binalhagan deducted the book value of its tangible assets in the 
sum of P824,559.91 (as appraised by Mr. Ramos in 1945) from the initial payment 
of P1,500,000.00, then reported 50% of the remainder as income (gain from sale 
of capital assets). It claimed certain deductions which later on were found not 
allowable. For 1952 and 1953, only 50.7o of the payments made by Philippine 
Planters' Investment Co. was returned for income tax purposes.</p>
<p>On November 27, 1954 the Collector of Internal Revenue assessed against 
Binalbagan deficiency income tax in the sums of P267,246.001, P36,030.00 and 
P127,949.00 for the years 1951, 1952 and 1953, respectively- In said 
assessments, he spread over 1951, 1952 and 1953 the gain realized from the sale 
of Binalbagan's B1SCOM shares in accordance with Section 3 of the National 
Internal Revenue Code. The Collector further considered taxable 100 of the gain 
from the sale of said BISCOM shares pursuant to Section 34 (b) of the Tax Code. 
Binalbagan reported only 50% of said gain. For 1953, he assessed in addition 
income tax on P3,259.60, representing miscellaneous charges to surplus 
applicable to previous years.</p>
<p>Binalbagan questioned the deficiency assessments but paid the same on August 
18, 1955 under protest. Then it claimed refund of P444,040.61 as overpaid income 
tax for 1951, 1952 and 1953, alleging that its treasurer in preparing its income 
tax returns erroneously used as the cost of acquisition of its BISCOM shares the 
sum of P824,559.91<span class="style2 style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> instead of 
P4,023,763.97.<span class="style2 style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span></p>
<p>Binalbagan's claim for refund having been denied, it appealed to the Court of 
Tax Appeals. Said court, after hearing, found the appraisal of the Westly 
Committee the correct acquisition value of Binalbagan's 216,000 BISCOM shares, 
accordingly recomputed the income tax liability of Binalbagan and ordered the 
refund of the amount of P443.060.00 as.overpaid income tax for the years 1951, 
1952 and 1953, with legal 'interest thereon from the date of payment. Hence, 
this appeal of the Collector of Internal Revenue.</p>
<p>The issue is: How much did Binalbagan gain when it sold 176,945 non-par value 
BISCOM shares to. Philippine Planters Investment Co. in 1951.</p>
<p>The law in point is Section 35 of the Tax Code, which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sec. 35. Determination of gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of 
property.â€”The gain derived or loss sustained from the sale or other disposition 
of property, read, personal or mixed, shall be determined in accordance with the 
following schedule: *******</p>
<p>"(b) In the case of property acquired on or after March first, nineteen 
hundred and thirteen, the cost thereof if such property was acquired by purchase 
or the fair market price or value us of the date of acquisition if the same was 
acquired by gratuitous title.</p>
<p>"(c) In the case of exchange of one piece of property for another, the 
property received in exchange shall be considered as the equivalent of monoy in 
a sum equal to its fair market value on the date on which the exchange was 
made."</p></blockquote>
<p>Section 35 was implemented by Section 136 of Revenue Regulations No. 2 of the 
Department of Finance, otherwise known as Income Tax Regulations. We quote 
Section 136:</p>
<p>The appraised value of its tangible assets as ascertained by Mr. Ramos in 
1945.</p>
<p>The value of its tangible assets and sugar quota fixed by the Westly 
Committee in 1946.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sec. 136. For the purpose of ascertaining the gain or loss from the sale or 
exchange of property, the basis is the cost of such property or in the case of 
property which should be included in the inventory, its latest inventory 
value.</p>
<p>"* * * In any case proper adjustment must be made in computing gain or loss 
from the exchange or sale of property for any depreciation or depletion 
sustained and allowable as deduction in computing net income; the amount of 
depreciation previously charged off by the taxpayer shall be deemed to be true 
depreciation sustained unless shown by clear and convincing evidence to be 
incorrect.<span class="style2 style1"><sup>[3]</sup></span>" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p></blockquote>
<p>To determine gain or loss from the sale of the 176,945 non-par value BISCOM 
shares, the basis is the acquisition cost of said shares. Binalbagan, however, 
did not pay for them in cash but with its tangible assets and sugar quota. This 
brings us to the question as to the value of Binalbagan's tangible assets and 
sugar quota as of 1946 when Binalbagan acquired the 216,000 non-par value shares 
of BISCOM in exchange therefor.</p>
<p>The Collector of Internal Revenue holds the view that the acquisition cost of 
Binalbagan's 216,000 BISCOM nonpar value shares is equivalent to the acquisition 
cost of the tangible assets given in exchange therefor. Such acquisition cost 
amounts to P824,559.91 as determined by Mr. Ramos in 1945. How said value was 
arrived at, considering that Binalbagan's books and records were lost during the 
war, is not shown. But the Collector indicated that Mr. Ramos made his 
calculation at the mill site and obtained his figures from his knowledge of the 
assets in question acquired by him as accountant of Binalbagan. This method of 
calculation suffers from the unreliability of human memory to record and recall 
figures with thorough exactness. Such flaw becomes apparent when we take into 
account that P824,559.91 is only 10.57% of P7,797,994.69, the acquisition value 
of the tangible assets in question. This appears too inadequate an estimate 
considering that only 40% to 50% of the said assets were destroyed during the 
war.</p>
<p>The Collector of Internal Revenue places much emphasis on what he asserts as 
estoppel in pais and contends that because the amount of P824,559.91 appears in 
Binalbagan's books, said amount should be held controlling. We do not find this 
contention material herein inasmuch as whether or not P824.559.91 is held the 
correct acquisition cost of the tangible assets in question, the same would not 
determine the profits realized from the sale of Binalbagan's BISCOM shares to 
the Philippine Planters' Investment Co. The fact remains that P824,559.91 is not 
the fair, market value of said assets and, as will presently be explained, the 
basis in computing the taxable gain from the sale of Binalbagan's BISCOM shares 
is the fair market value of the assets and sugar quota in question. At any rate, 
Binalbagan's error in carrying the figure P824.559.91 in its books and using the 
same in its income tax returns for 1951, 1952 and 1953 neither benefited 
Binalbagan nor prejudiced the Government.</p>
<p>Binalbagan maintains that the true and correct acquisition cost of its 
216,000 shares of BISCOM is equivalent to the fair market value of its tangible 
assets and sugar quota as appraised by the Westly Committee.<span class="style2 style1"><sup>[4]</sup></span> This view was sustained by the Court 
of Tax Appeals. Considering the evidence, law and jurisprudence applicable to 
this case, we find the conclusion of the Court of Tax Appeals in order.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt as to the competence of the chairman and members of 
the, Westly Committee, all of whom were engineers of sugar centrals and were 
recognized technical experts in sugar central equipment and appurtenances by 
reason of their long experience in the sugar industry. Precisely, to forestall 
overvaluation of assets by either of the merging corporations (Binalbagan and 
Isabela), each entity appointed one representative to the committee. The 
chairman, who was connected with the Del Carmen &amp; Calamba Sugar Estate, had 
no relationship or privity with either of said merging corporations nor with 
their respective representatives.</p>
<p>Assuming, however, that the acquisition cost of Binal-bagan's tangible assets 
is P824,559.91, the value determined by Mr. Ramos in 1945, said value may not 
rightly be considered the acquisition cost of the 216,000 BISCOM shares as 
insisted by the Collector of Internal Revenue. We are not called upon to decide 
the income tax due on the profit which may have been realized by Bi-nalbagan 
when it acquired the 216,000 BISCOM shares in ezcJuwge for its tangible assets, 
in which case the basis would be the acquisition cost of said assets pursuant to 
Subsection (b), Section 35 of the Tax Code (Gutierrez vs. Court of Tax Appeals, 
54 Off. Gaz., 2912.). As correctly found by the Court of Tax Appeals, the 
controversy rests on whatever tax is imposable on the gain obtained from the 
sale of the 216,000 BISCOM shares to the Philippine Planters' Investment Co. In 
short, the first transaction was an exchange, and the second was a sale. The 
basis in determining the gain in such sale in the cost of said shares. Inasmuch 
as the shares were acquired in exchange for Binalbagan's tangible assets and 
sugar quota, their cost is equivalent to the fair market value of said assets 
and sugar quota at the time of the exchange as appraised by the Westly 
Committee. (Subsection [c], Section 35 of the Tax Code, afore-quoted.)</p>
<p>The rule has been aptly stated, thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>" * * Where the consideration is property, its amount is determined by its 
fair market value at the time of the exchange and not by the original cost of 
the consideration. It is the same as if the property given in exchange had first 
been sold and the purchase price then immediately used to buy the property whose 
cost basis is under consideration. The consideration for property received in an 
exchange cannot be the original cost of the property surrendered therein. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>* * * The consideration for property received in an exchange is the value of 
the property surrendered " (Jacob Mertens, Jr., Law on Federal Taxation, Vol. 3, 
Sec. 21, p. 375.)</p>
<p>The above rule prevails in the United States.<span class="style2 style1"><sup>[5]</sup></span> Our income tax law being of American 
origin, <span class="style2 style1"><sup>[6]</sup></span> the interpretation 
adopted by American courts on corresponding and contemporaneous provisions has 
peculiar persuasive effect on the interpretation of Philippine laws on the 
subject.</p>
<p>The fair market value of Binalbagan's tangible assets as appraised by the 
Westly Committee in the amount of P2,541,134.69 augmented by the value of its 
sugar quota amounting to P1,482,629.28 is the correct acquisition cost of the 
216,000 BISCOM shares. It is, however, contended by the Collector that the value 
of the sugar quota ought not to be accounted as part of the acquisition cost of 
the BISCOM shares for the simple reason that Binalbagan acquired them without 
cost. Under Subsection (c), Section 35, of the Tax Code, the acquisition cost of 
the shares of stock is equivalent to the fair market value of the property given 
in exchange therefor. The sugar quota, which had a fair market value of f 5.00 
per picul, was part and parcel of the property turned over by Binalbagan to 
BISCOM for the 216,000 shares.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the contract of merger between Binalbagnn and Isabela, we 
doubt if Binalbagan could have been allocated 216,000 shares without the sugar 
quota, or even with it, if the tangible assets of Binal-bagan were valued at 
only P824.559.91. In plain language it cost Binalbagan P2,541,134.39 worth of 
tangible assets and P1,482,629.28 worth of sugar quota to acquire 216,000 shares 
of BISCOM.</p>
<p>As to the method of apportioning Einalbagan's taxable gain over 1951, 1952 
and 1953, there is no controversy. Under Section 43 of the Tax Code, the taxable 
gain or income is that portion of the installment payments actually received 
during the year which the gross profit realized or to be realized when payment 
is completed, bears to the total contract price. The accepted formula is:</p>
<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="63%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="23%">Selling Price </td>
<td width="32%">&nbsp;</td>
<td width="45%">&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>X Installment Received </td>
<td>= Profit for the Year </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Gross Profit </td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon such formula, the Court of Tax Appeals computed Binalbagan's tax 
liability which, in addition to the tax on sundry income, is set forth 
below:</p>
<p>1951.................................................................................... 
P64613.00</p>
<p>1952 
.................................................................................... 
23,523.00</p>
<p>1953 
.................................................................................... 
91,419.00</p>
<p>Total 
................................................................................. 
P179,555.00</p>
<p>As Binalbagan paid a total of P622,615.00, it therefore overpaid the amount 
of P443.060.00 (not P444,040.61 as claimed), which should justly be refunded to 
it.</p>
<p>The Collector has called our attention to the prescription of Binalbagan's 
right to the refund of the tax paid prior to March 22, 1954 corresponding to the 
years 1951 and 1952. Indeed, the right to the refund of said tax in the 
aggregate amount of P51,773.00 has prescribed under Section 306 of the Tax Code. 
Binalbagan filed its petition for review in the Court of Tax Appeals on March 
22, 1956, more than two years from the date of payment. However, prescription 
has not set in to claim refund of the tax paid after March 22, 1954. The 
following tabulation will clearly illustrate:</p>
<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="52%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="18%" height="16">1951..............</td>
<td width="28%">P14,327.00</td>
<td width="30%">P267,246.00</td>
<td width="24%">P281,573.00</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>1952.............</td>
<td>37,446.00 </td>
<td>36,030.00</td>
<td>73,476.00</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>1953.............</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>127,949.00</td>
<td>267,566.00</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>139,617.00</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>

<td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>TOTAL............</td>
<td>P51,773.00</td>
<td>P570,842.00</td>
<td>P622,615.00</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>Accordingly, refund of P443,060.00, or any amount not exceeding P570,842.00, 
has not prescribed.</p>
<p>The Court of Tax Appeals awarded Binalbngan legal interest computed from the 
date the taxes were paid. There is no statutory provision awarding interest in 
these cases. On several occasions, <span class="style2 style1"><sup>[7]</sup></span>we ruled that in the absence of a 
statutory provision clearly directing or authorizing the payment of interest on 
the amount to be refunded to the taxpayer, the National Government cannot be 
required to pay interest. Later, however, we held that where the collection of 
the tax sought to be refunded was attended with arbitrariness, the Commissioner 
of Internal Revenue is liable to pay interest.<span class="style2 style1"><sup>[8]</sup></span> In the case at bar, collection of 
the deficiency income tax was not arbitrary. As a matter of fact, the figures 
used by the Collector in his deficiency assessment were those reported by 
Binalbagan in its own income tax returns. Hence, the consequent error in the 
assessment was occasioned, not by the Collector's arbitrary determination, but 
by the taxpayer's admitted mistake.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is ordered to refund to the 
Binalbagan Estate, Inc. the amount of P443,060.00 as overpaid income tax for 
years 1951, 1952 and 1953, without interest No costs. So ordered.</p>

<h3>RESOLUTION </h3>
<h3>March 31, 1965</h3>
<p><strong>Bengzon, J.P., J.:</strong></p>
<p>Petitioner has moved for reconsideration of our decision herein.</p>
<p>We held that the acquisition cost of the 216,000 nonpar value BISCOM shares 
which respondent Binalbagan Estate, Inc. acquired in exchange for its tangible 
assets and sugar quota, is the fair market value of said assets and sugar quota 
as of the time of the exchange.</p>
<p>According to movant, however, the acquisition cost of the afore-stated 
216,000 BISCOM shares in the capital invested on, rather than the fair market 
value of, the assets given in exchange for them. Since the fair market value of 
the assets includes not only capital invested but also the increase in value, 
movant contends that to determine the true and actual gain realized from the 
subsequent sale of the BISCOM shares only the capital invested should be 
considered. Accordingly, movant argues that the effect of using the fair market 
value of the assets as the acquisition cost of the BISCOM shares would be to 
reduce the true and actual gain by the amount equivalent to the increase in 
value of the assets, thereby allowing Binalbagan to avoid the payment of the 
corresponding tax on said increase of value.</p>
<p>We cannot agree with this contention. Such increase in value of the assets 
should have been taxed as profit realized by Binalbagan from the exchange of 
said assets for the BISCOM shares. Such tax fell due at the time of the 
exchange, or specifically not later than May 15, 1947. The same, therefore, is 
distinct from the tax on the profit from the sale of the BISCOM shares; so that, 
to assess the former as part of the latter, as pressed by the movant, would be 
inequitable and unfair, considering that prescription may have set in. The 
reason given by movant why no tax was separately imposed on the profit from the 
exchange of assets for stocks is that the same "was merely paper profit" because 
there was actually no money paid or received by the parties in the exchange. 
Since, in all dispositions of property by exchange no money changes hands, the 
profit derived therefrom would always be, in the words of movant, "merely paper 
profit." Consequently, if we were to sustain movant's proposition, no profit 
from any exchange of properties will be taxable. Such a view will render 
completely negatory paragraph (c) of Section 35 of the National Internal Revenue 
Code, which provides for the rule in determining taxable gain when one property 
is exchanged for another. The National Assembly, in enacting the National 
Internal Revenue. Code, could not have intended the afore-stated paragraph to
