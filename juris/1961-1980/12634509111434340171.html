				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by the Government from a decision of the Court of Tax
Appeals, reversing of the decisions of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and
the <span style="">Com</span>missioner of Customs, in
Cases No. 956 and 957 of said Court, holding <span class="SpellE">Botelho</span>
Shipping Corporation and General Shipping Co., Inc. - hereinafter referred to
collectively as the Buyers - liable for the payment of the sums of P483<span class="GramE">,433.00</span> and P494,824.00, respective­ly, as compensating
taxes on the vessels "M/S Maria <span class="SpellE">Rosello</span>"
and "M/S General Lim."</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 30, 1960, the Reparations Commission of the Philippines
- hereinafter referred to as the Commission - and <span class="SpellE">Botelho</span>
Shipping Cor­poration - hereinafter referred to as <span class="SpellE">Botelho</span>
- entered into a "Contract of Conditional Purchase and Sale of Reparations
Goods," whereby the for­mer agreed to sell to <span class="SpellE">Botelho</span>
for P6<span class="GramE">,798,888.88</span> the vessel "M/S Maria <span class="SpellE">Rosello</span>," procured by the Commission from Japan,
pursuant to the pro­visions of the Philippine-Japanese Reparations Agreement of
May 9, 1956.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On September 19, 1960, the
Commission signed a similar contract with General Shipping Co., Inc. -
hereinafter referred to as General Shipping - for the sale thereto of "M/S
General Lim" at the price of P6<span class="GramE">,951,666.66</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both agreements, couched in identical terms,
except as to price, sti­pulated that:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">“<span class="GramE">a</span>)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Reparations Commission 'retains title to
and ownership of the above described vessel until the same is fully paid
for.'" <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> 'A', p. 2,
both cases)</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">“b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stipulated purchase price of the M/S MARIA
ROSELLO was to be paid by <span class="SpellE">Botelho</span> to the Commission
under a deferred payment plan in 10 equal yearly installments of P717,333.49,
bearing 3% interest per annum, beginning August 31, 1962 and August 31 of every
year thereafter until the year 1972, while the purchase price of the M/S
GENERAL LIM was to be paid by General Shipping to the Commission under a
deferred payment plan in 10 equal yearly installments of P723,132.68, bearing
3% interest per annum beginning September 30, 1962 and September 30 of every
year until the year 1972.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 9, p. 4 and A-2, both cases) <span class="GramE">(See
Respondents' brief, p. 4.)"</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Delivered in Japan to its respective buyers, acting on behalf of
the Commission, the vessels, upon their departure from Tokyo, on the maiden
trip thereof to the Philippines, were issued, by the Philippine Vice-Consul in
said city, provisional certificates of Philippine registry, in the name of the
Commission, so that the vessels could proceed to the Philippines and secure
therein the respective final registration documents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon arrival at the port of Manila, the Buyers filed the
correspond­ing applications for registration of the vessels, but, the Bureau of
Customs placed the same under custody and refused to give due course to said ap­plications,
unless the aforementioned sums of P483,433 and P494,824 were paid as
compensating tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the Commissioner of
Customs refused to re­consider the stand taken by his office, the Buyers
simultaneously filed, with the Court of Tax Appeals, their respective petitions
for review, against the Commissioner of Customs and the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue - hereinafter referred to collectively as Appellants - with ur­gent
motion for suspension of the collection of said tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a joint hearing on this motion, the
same was, on October 31, 1960, granted by the Tax Court, upon the filing of a
P500<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> bond by each one of the Buyers.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 17, 1961, while these cases were pending trial in said
Court, Republic Act No. 3079 amended Republic Act No. 1789 - the Original
Reparations Act, under which the aforementioned contracts with the Buyers had
been executed - by exempting buyers of repara­tions goods acquired from the
Commission, from liability for the com­pensating tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, section 20 of Republic Act No.
3079, pro­vides:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
This Act shall take effect upon its ap­proval, except that the amendment
contained in Sec­tion seven hereof relating to the requirements of pro­curement
orders including the requirement of down payment by private applicant end-users
shall not ap­ply to procurement orders already duly issued and verified at the
time of the passage of this amendatory Act, and except further that the
amendment contained in Section ten relating to the insurance of the re­parations
goods by the end-users upon delivery shall apply also to goods covered by
contracts already en­tered into by the Commission and the end-user prior to the
approval of this amendatory Act as well as goods already delivered to the
end-user, and except further that the amendments contained in Sections eleven
and twelve hereof relating to the terms of installment payments on capital
goods disposed of to private parties, and the execution of a performance bond
before delivery of reparations goods, shall not apply to contracts for the
utilization of reparations goods already entered into by the Commission and the
end-users prior to the approval of this amenda­tory Act:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, That any end-user may apply for the
renovation of his utilization contract with the Commission in order to avail of
any provision of this amendatory Act which is more favorable to an applicant
end-user than has heretofore been granted in like manner and to the same extent
as an end-user filing his application after the approval of this amendatory
Act, and the Commission may agree to such renovation on condition that the
end-user shall voluntarily assume all the new obligations provided for in this
amendatory Act."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Invoking the provisions of this section 20, the Buyers applied,
therefore, for the renovation of their utilization contracts with the
Commission, which granted the application, and, then, filed, with the Tax
Court, their supplemental petitions for review.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, the parties submitted Stipulations of Fact and, after a
joint trial, at which they introduced additional evidence, said Court rendered
the appealed deci­sion, reversing the decisions of herein Appellants, and
declared said Buyers exempt from the compensating tax sought to be assessed
agains<span style="">t</span> the vessels
aforementioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence,
these appeals by the Government.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>G. R. No. L-21633 refers to the case as regards "M/S Maria <span class="SpellE">Rosello</span>," whereas "M/S General Lim" is the
subject-matter of G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-21634.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">It seems clear that, under Republic Act No. 1789 - pursuant to
which the contracts of Conditional Purchase and Sale in question had been
executed - the vessels "M/S Maria <span class="SpellE">Rosello</span>"
and "M/S General Lim" were subject to compensating tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, Section 14 of said Act provides that
"reparations goods obtained by private parties shall be exempt <u>only</u>
from the payment of customs duties, consular fees and the special import
tax." Although this Section was amended by R. A. No. 3079, to include the
"compensating tax" among the exemptions enumerated therein, such
amendment took place, not only after the contracts involved in these appeals had
been perfected and partly consummated, but, also, after the corresponding
compensating tax had become due and payment thereof demanded by Appellants
herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, moreover, obvious that
said additional exemption should not and cannot be given retroactive operation,
in the absence of a manifest intent of Congress to do this effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue in the cases at bar hinges on
whether or not such intent is clear.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants maintain the negative, upon the ground that a tax
exemption must be clear and explicit; that there is no express provi­sion for
the retroactivity of the exemption, established by Republic Act No. 3079, from
the compensating tax; that the favorable provi­sions, which are referred to in
section 20 thereof, cannot include the exemption from compensating tax; and,
that Congress could not have intended any retroactive exemption, considering
that the result there­of would be prejudicial to the Government.</p>

<p class="BODY">The inherent weakness of the last ground becomes manifest when we
consider that, if true, there could be no tax exemption of any kind whatsoever,
even if Congress should wish to create one, because every such exemption
implies a waiver of the right to collect what otherwise would be due to the
Government, and, in this sense, is prejudicial there­to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, however, tax exemptions may and do
exist, such as the one prescribed in section 14 of Republic Act No. 1789, as
amended by Re­public Act No. 3079, which, by the way, is "clear and
explicit," thus, meeting the first ground of appellant's contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may not be amiss to add that no tax
exemption - like any other legal exemption or exception - is given without any
reason <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In much the same way as other statutory commands, its avowed purpose is
some public bene­fit or interest, which the law-making body considers
sufficient to off­set the monetary loss entailed in the grant of the
exemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, <u>section 20 of
Republic Act No. 3079 exacts a valuable consideration</u> for the retroactivity
of its favorable provisions, namely, the voluntary assumption, by the end-user
who bought reparations goods prior to June 17, 1961, of "all the <u>new</u>
obligations provided for in" said Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">The argument adduced in support of the third ground is that the
view adopted by the Tax Court would operate to grant exemption to particular
persons, the Buyers herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be
noted, however, that there is no constitutional injunction against granting tax
exemptions to particular persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, it is not unusual to grant legislative franchises to specific individuals
or entities, conferring tax exemp­tions thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the fundamental law forbids is the
denial of equal protection, such as through unreasonable <span style="">discrimination or </span>classifi­cation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, Section 14 of the Law on Reparations, as amend­ed,
exempts from the compensating tax, not particular <u>persons</u>, but persons
belonging to a particular <u>class</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, appellants do not as­sail the Constitutionality of said section
14, insofar as it grants exemp­tions to end-users who, <u>after</u> the
approval of Republic Act No. 3079, on June 17, <span style="">1961, </span>purchased reparations goods procured by the Commis­sion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the view point of Constitutional Law,
especially the equal protection clause, there is no difference between the
grant of exemption to said end-users, and the extension of the grant to those
whose con­tracts of purchase and sale were made <u>before</u> said date, under
Republic Act No. <span style="">1789.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that Republic Act No. 3079 does not explicitly declare
that those who purchased reparations goods prior to June 17, 1961, are exempt
from the compensating tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not
say so, because they do <u>not</u> really enjoy such exemption, <u>unless</u>
they comply with the provision in Section 20 of said Act, <u>by applying for
the renovation of their respective utilization contracts</u>, "in order to
avail of <u>any</u> provision <span style="">of </span>the
Amendatory Act which is more favorable" to the applicant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, it is manifest, from the
language of said section 20, that the same intend­ed to give such buyers the
opportunity to be treated "in like manner and to the same extent as an
end-user filing his application after the approval of this Amendatory
Act." Like the "most-favored-nation-clause" <span style="">in in­ternational </span>agreements, the
aforementioned section 20 thus seeks, <u>not</u> to discriminate or to create
an exemption or <span style="">exception, </span>but
to <u>abolish</u> the discrimination, exemption or exception that would
otherwise result, in favor of the end-user who bought after <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1961</st1:date> and against one who
bought prior thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it is
difficult to find a substantial justification for the distinction between the
one and the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As correctly held by
the Tax Court in Philippine Ace Lines, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue
(C. T. A. Nos. 964 and <span style="">984, </span>January
25, 1963), and reiterated in the cases under consideration:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>In providing that the favorable provision of
Republic Act No. <span style="">3079 </span>shall be
available to applicants for renovation of their utilization contracts, on
condition that said applicants shall voluntarily assume all the new obligations
provided in the new law, the law intends to place persons who acquired
reparations goods before the enactment of the amendatory Act on the same
footing as those who acquire reparations goods after its enactment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is so because of the provision that once
an applica­tion for renovation of a utilization contract has been <span class="GramE">approved,</span> the favorable provisions of said Act shall be
available to the applicant 'in like manner and to the same extent, as an
end-user filing his application after the ap­proval of this amendatory Act.' To
deny exemption from compensating tax to one whose utilization contract has been
renovated, while granting the exemption to one who files an application for
acquisition of reparations goods after the approval of the new law, would be
contrary to the express mandate of the new law, that they both be subject to
the same privileges in like manner and to the same extent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be manifest distortion of the
literal meaning and purpose of the new law."</blockquote>

is hereby affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>, without any
pronouncement as to costs.</p>
