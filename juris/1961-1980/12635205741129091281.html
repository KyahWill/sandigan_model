its Special Proceeding No. 4977, denying the probate of the will of the
deceased, <span class="SpellE">Digna</span> <span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These appeals were brought to the Court of
Appeals, but said court certified the same to this Supreme Court on 26 May
1964, in accord with the latter's prior decision in Fernandez, etc., et al. vs.

which settled the question of appellate jurisdiction in favor of the Supreme
Court over that of the Court of Appeals, on the appeal from the appointment of

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span>,

this Supreme Court allowed their intervention on 24 July 1967, upon showing
that their interest as substitute heirs was vested definitely upon the death of
<span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span>, and
that said <span class="SpellE">movants</span> for intervention merely adopt the
pleadings and briefs filed in behalf of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span>'
s petition for probate was opposed by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
in an amended opposition filed in the course of the trial in the court below
and admitted without objection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
opposition alleged the following grounds:</p>

<blockquote>“a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the deceased, <span class="SpellE">Digna</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span>, the alleged testatrix and the instrumental
witnesses did not sign the alleged will, each and every page thereof, in the
presence of each other;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the deceased, <span class="SpellE">Digna</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span>, the alleged testatrix, affixed her
signature to her alleged will under undue and improper pressure and influence
and/or duress brought to bear upon her by the petitioner, for his own personal
benefit and advantage and that of his nieces, <span class="SpellE">Adelina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sajo</span> and Rose Marie M. <span class="SpellE">Kohlhaas</span>
and his half-sister <span class="SpellE">Conchita</span> <span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span>

<span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span>, at the time she affixed her signature to
her alleged will was not of sound and disposing mind;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“d)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the alleged will, now being offered for
probate had already been revoked by the deceased, <span class="SpellE">Digna</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the court below rendered judgment, holding as unsubstantiated
the last three (3) grounds above-enumerated, but sus­taining the first, that
is, that the will was not executed in accordance with Section 618 of Act 190,
and, therefore, denied the probate of the will.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner and one <span class="SpellE">Adelina</span> <span class="SpellE">Sajo</span>, who was named a devisee under the questioned will,
appealed the judgment, as aforesaid, assigning errors of fact and law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">oppositors-appellees</span>
did not appeal but counter-assigned errors in their brief.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no controversy that the late <span class="SpellE">Digna</span>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing before the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, only one of

well whether Mr. <span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span> was there at the time he
signed the will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The witness explained
that he could not re­member some details because fourteen years had elapsed,
and when he signed as a witness, he did not give it any importance, and because
at the time he (Col. <span class="SpellE">Mansueto</span>) was very worried
because of <span class="SpellE">rumours</span> that the Japanese <span class="SpellE">Kempeitai</span> would arrest officers of the USAFFE who did not

cared for them since childhood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Digna</span> gave Villanueva instructions concerning the will, and
handed him her old will and a handwritten list of the certificates of title of
her properties, which list she asked and obtained from her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before leaving, Villanueva asked <span class="SpellE">Digna</span> to look for three witnesses; their names were furnished
him two or three days later and he sent word that the will could be executed on
7 October 1944 (as it actually was); on that day he brought one original and 2
copies with him, and handed them to <span class="SpellE">Digna</span>; she read
the document and while doing so the witnesses <span class="SpellE">Mansueto</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Hernaez</span> and <span class="SpellE">Buenaflor</span>
came.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Villanueva talked with them and

lawyer's behest <span class="SpellE">Digna</span> <span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span>

paragraph 9, where <span class="SpellE">Con­cepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span>
was designated as "<span class="SpellE">hermana</span>"; the word was

the words "<span class="SpellE">Pagina</span> <span class="SpellE">primera</span>",
"<span class="SpellE">Pagina</span> <span class="SpellE">Segunda</span>"

The latter did not ask the husband (<span class="SpellE">Herminio</span>) to join

<p class="BODY">Upon the evidence, the trial judge concluded that <span class="SpellE">Mansueto</span> did not actually see <span class="SpellE">Digna</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span> sign the will in question, basing such
conclusion upon the fact that while <span class="SpellE">Mansueto</span>
positively identified his own signature ("I identify this as my
signature") but not that of the testatrix, his five answers to the
questions of counsel, in reference thereto, being "this must be the
signature of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Digna</span> <span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span>”.</p>

<p class="BODY">In our opinion, the trial court's conclusion is far fetched,
fanciful and unwarranted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was but natural
that witness <span class="SpellE">Mansueto</span> should be positive about his
own signature, since he was familiar with it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He had to be<span style=""> </span>less
positive about <span class="SpellE">Digna</span> <span class="SpellE">Maravilla's</span>
signature since he could not be closely acquainted with the same:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>for aught the record shows, the signing of
the will was the only occasion he saw her sign; he had no opportunity to study
her signature before or after the execution of Exhibit "A”.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, he witnessed <span class="SpellE">Digna's</span>
signing not less than fourteen years previously.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To demand that in identifying <span class="SpellE">Digna's</span> signature <span class="SpellE">Mansueto</span> should
display a <span class="SpellE">positiveness</span> equal to the certainty shown
by him in recognizing his own, exceeds the bounds of the reasonable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The variation in the expressions used by the
witness is the best evidence that he was being candid and careful, and it is a
clear badge of truthfulness rather than the reverse.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court's error gains no support from <span class="SpellE">Mansueto's</span>
statement on cross-examination that "I remember and (I) signed the will in
the presence of all the witnesses and in the presence of attorney Villa­nueva"
(page 29, Volume 1, <span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Amago</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of an assurance that no one
else was present, this assertion does not really contradict <span class="SpellE">Mansueto's</span>
testimony in chief that "I have read the entire document before I signed
it in the presence of the other witnesses, <span class="SpellE">Digna</span> <span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span> and Attorney Villanueva" (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Amago</span>, Volume 1, pages
18-19).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well to note that the
cross examiner did not ask <span class="SpellE">Mansueto</span> if no one else
besides those mentioned by him had seen him sign.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any contradiction inferred from both
statements is purely con­jectural; it did not come from the witness and is
insufficient to impeach his veracity, the difference in the answers being due
to no more than an accidental lapse of memory.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A will may be allowed even if some witnesses do not remember having
attested it, if other evidence satisfactorily show due execution (V. Act 190,
Section 632), and that failure of witness to identify his signature does not
bar probate.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">15</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">That <span class="SpellE">Mansueto</span>, <span class="SpellE">Hernaez</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Buenaflor</span>, together with the testatrix and the
lawyer, sat next to one another around one table when the will was signed is
clearly established by the <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span> testimony
of both attorney Villanueva and <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span>; and that detail proves beyond doubt that each
one of the parties concerned did sign in the presence of all the others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be remembered, in this connection,
that the test is not whether a witness did see the signing of the will but whether
he was in a position to see if he chose to do so.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">16</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court rejected the evidence of both <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span> and Manuel Villanueva, giving as a reason
that they were biased and in­terested in having the probate succeed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reasoning is not warranted:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>for <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span> certainly stood to gain more under the previous
will of his wife (Exhibit "G") where he was made the sole
beneficiary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to attorney Villanueva,
while he had been a friend of <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> from boyhood,
he also had been the family lawyer, and his intervention in the execution of
the will of one of his clients became inevitable, for it is not to be expected
that the testatrix should call upon a stranger for the purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If Villanueva wished to perjure in favor of <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span>, all he needed was to color his testimony against
the due execution of the will (Exhibit "A") and not in favor thereof,
since, as previously observed, <span class="SpellE">Digna's</span> first will
(Exhibit "G") was more advantageous to the widower.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find it difficult to understand the trial court's distrust of
a lawyer who did no more than discharge his professional duty, or its readiness
to attribute improper motives to proponent's witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, in <span class="SpellE">Sotelo</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Luzan</span>, 59 Phil. 908, has remarked that -</p>

<blockquote>"It is hardly conceivable that any
attorney of any standing would risk his professional reputa­tion by falsifying
a will and then go before a court and give false testimony."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">And in Fernandez vs. <span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span>,
49 Phil. 380, 385, We ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"'In weighing the testimony of the attesting witnesses to a
will, the statements of a competent attorney, who has been charged with the
responsibili­ty of seeing to the proper execution of the instrument, is
entitled to greater weight than the testi­mony of a person casually called to
participate in the act, supposing of course that no motive is revealed that
should induce the attorney to prevaricate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reason is that <u>the mind of the attorney, being conversant with
the requisites of proper execution of the instrument, is more likely to become
fixed on details, and he is more likely than other persons to retain those
incidents in his memory</u>.'" (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Appellees</span> <span class="SpellE">endeavoured</span>
to sustain the court's refusal to probate the will by referring to the evidence
of their witness Marino <span class="SpellE">Tupas</span>, a man of "no
permanent job"<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">17</span></span></a>, who narrated that on the last
week of September, 1944 one Mariano <span class="SpellE">Buenaflor</span> had
been introduced to him by one Lt. <span class="SpellE">Garaton</span> at his
guerrilla outpost in <span class="SpellE">Montalban</span> and described as a man
wanted by the Japanese.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tupas</span>' patently exaggerated testimony is that this <span class="SpellE">Buenaflor</span> stayed with him at his outpost camp until
January, 1945, living and sleeping with him, and was never for a single moment
out of his sight<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">18</span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why a civilian refugee should remain at a
guerrilla outpost for four months, without engaging in any particular helpful
activity on his part, was not explained.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Shown photographs and asked to identify <span class="SpellE">Buenaflor</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Tupas</span> hedged by pleading that the <span class="SpellE">Buenaflor</span>
who stayed with him had a long beard.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, <span class="SpellE">oppositor-appellees</span>' reverse alibi for
the instrumental witness, Mariano <span class="SpellE">Buenaflor</span>, was not
only pa­tently mendacious but did not establish any reliable connection between
the instrumental witness of <span class="SpellE">Digna's</span> will and the <span class="SpellE">Buenaflor</span> who, according to <span class="SpellE">Tupas</span>,
stuck to him as a burr in 1944.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
wonder the trial court gave no credit to such evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Oppositors</span>' attempts to establish that
the testatrix <span class="SpellE">Digna</span> <span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span>
was mentally incompetent to validly execute the will in question met no better
fate in the court below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They introduced
one <span class="SpellE">Eufrocina</span> <span class="SpellE">Berja</span> who
qualified <span class="SpellE">Digna</span> <span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span>
as insane because she saw <span class="SpellE">Digna</span> <span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span>
acting strangely one morning in 1921 (23 years before the will was execu­ted).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Berja's</span> own
words -</p>

<blockquote>"Would you not call a person insane
who is waving a bunch of flowers and singing along a road, es­pecially taking
into consideration their reputation in the Community?" (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1959" day="21" month="5">21 May
 1959</st1:date>, page 19)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Even if to this ridiculous appraisal were to be added the fact
that (according to this witness) <span class="SpellE">Digna</span> saw her in
1946, but would not answer her questions and "was in a deep thought (sic)
and her tongue was coming out of her mouth" (Do., pages 14-15), her
evidence would cer­tainly not justify a finding that <span class="SpellE">Digna</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span> was not competent to execute the testament
in 1944.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By <span class="SpellE">Berja's</span>
standards, any one could be held insane.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is the case for the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
improved by the evidence of their witness <span class="SpellE">Eleazar</span>
Lopez, who asserted having visited his aunt, <span class="SpellE">Digna</span>
Mara-villa (whom he had not seen since he was four years old), two days after
the first bombing of Manila by the American planes in September, 1944.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lopez claimed to have seen <span class="SpellE">Digna</span> on that occasion laughing and crying and then staring
blankly at the ceiling, without recognizing the witness; and that he visited
her again toward mid-October of the same year and she had worsened.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">19</span></span></a>
Coming from a nephew who expected to succeed if the will in question were
denied probate, and who sought to become ad­ministrator of the estate, even
offering to resign from his position in the government if appointed<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">20</span></span></a>,
this testimony of Lopez was evidently colored by his monetary interest, thus
leading to its correct discrediting by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His recollection after 15 years of the
alleged symptoms of his aunt is very suspicious, as it does not even appear
that Lopez at the time bothered to inquire from other persons what caused his
aunt's alleged abnormal condition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the court's duty to reconcile conflicts of evidence should
lead it to hold that the symptoms described by Lopez were due to a temporary
disturbance of the nerves caused by the unsettling effect of a bombardment not
previously experienced, com­patible with the due execution of the will on 7
October 1944.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As between the testimony
of Lopez and that of attorney Villanueva, who repeatedly visited and talked to
the testatrix around the time her will was executed, We have no hesitation in
accepting the latter's view that <span class="SpellE">Digna</span> <span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span> was competent to make the will when it was
signed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law itself declares that -</p>

<blockquote>"To be of sound mind, it is not
necessary that the testator be in full possession of all his reasoning
faculties or that his mind be wholly unbroken unimpaired or <span class="SpellE">unshattered</span>
by disease, injury or other cause." (Civil Code, Article 799; <span class="SpellE">Bugnao</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Ubag</span>, 14 Phil. 163).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We are satisfied that the preponderance of evidence is to the
effect that the testament, Exhibit "A", was duly executed by a
qualified testatrix and competent witnesses, in conformity with the statutory
requirements.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, the decree of the court below
denying probate of the 1944 will of <span class="SpellE">Digna</span> <span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span> (Exhibit "A") is reversed and the said
