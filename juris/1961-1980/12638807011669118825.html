<p class="BODY">Preliminarily, it must be stated that on August 14, 1962, counsel
for appellants filed a "petition" asking that this case be forwarded
to the Court of Appeals to enable them to raise questions of fact, but upon
opposition by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> on the ground that the record
on appeal of appellants was approved by the trial court as follows:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">"O R D E R</p>

<blockquote>"When the record on appeal was called for hearing this
morning, counsel for the defendants manifested that she is intending to appeal
the decision of this Court to the Supreme Court purely on a question of law,
and further manifested that she is waiving all her mani­festations and
allegations in the notice of appeal which has the effect of raising issues of
facts herein, and in view of such manifestations counsel for the plaintiff
withdrew his opposition to the approval of the record on appeal;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The record on appeal of the defendants is hereby approved,
and let the same be transmitted to the Supreme Court, within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period, and the notice of appeal is considered
amended as per manifestation of the counsel for the defendants.</blockquote>

AND TO PAY THE COSTS."<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In their first assignment of error, appellants contend that the
trial court erred in not granting <span style="">their
motion for leave </span>to file a third-party <span style="">complaint against one <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> </span>from whom they <span style="">allegedly acquired the land in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span>motion was first denied because,
according to the trial court, it was prematurely filed before appellants had
filed their answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the motion was
reiterated after the filing of the answer, the trial court also reiterated its
denial, holding that what appellants were actually attempting to do was to join
a new party as defendant to their counterclaim and, furthermore there was no
showing that "plaintiff in this case desires to assert a claim against the
would be third-party defendant."</p>

<p class="BODY">Assuming there is some degree of plausibility in appellants'
position that the filing of their proposed third-party should have been
allowed, We hold that at this stage, it would be very impractical to correct
whatever error might have been committed by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, such error, if any, cannot be
raised for the first time in an appeal of the main case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, the denial of permission to a
defendant to file a third-party complaint, even if erroneous, does not have the
effect of depriving the court of jurisdiction to proceed with the trial and
judgment of the case as between the original parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever claim for contribution, indemnity,
subrogation or any other relief said defendant may in fact be entitled to is
not lost because of the refusal of the trial court to allow the filing of a
third-party complaint, for it may still be enforced in an independent
suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, appellants' first
assignment of error must be overruled.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In their second, third and fourth assignments of error,
appellants maintain that the trial court should have held that <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> title over the land in dispute is not
indefeasible and that said appellants were possessors and builders in good
faith entitled to indemnity for permanent improvements they have made on said
land.</p>

<p class="BODY">In respect to these contentions, the trial court held:</p>

<blockquote>"The facts of the present case are simple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff' s ownership of the land object of
this litigation is admitted by the defendants and sup­ported by Transfer
Certificate of Title No. 37186-Rizal (now No. 1267 - <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City) marked as Exhibit A, of the Office of the Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
also a fact that in 1949, defendants took possession of a portion of said
property with an area of 1,500 square meters and constructed therein a house
and other im­provements without plaintiff's consent or know­ledge (See <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B-1).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
plaintiff claims rents for the area occupied by the defendants at the rate of
P450.00 per month.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, defendants claim that said portion of the
property occupied by them was acquired by them by virtue of an alleged deed of
sale executed by <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>
in their favor in 1949 (See <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also submitted the 'Compromise
Agreement' approved by the Hon. Judge <span class="SpellE">Hermogenes</span> <span class="SpellE">Caluag</span>, Civil Case No. Q-135 etc. (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
5).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also claim that they have
improvements introduced in the sum of P60,000.00, but the Tax Declaration (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 12) of the said property was only assessed at
P17,360.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They further claim that
defendants are builders in good faith.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The question before the court is whether plaintiff or
defendants, is or are, the owners of the portion of property in question and as
to whether the defendants built their improvements in good faith or
otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To these two propositions,
hinges the determination of their rights.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The records disclosed that plaintiff corporation has Transfer
Certificate of Title No. 37686-Rizal (now No. 1267-Q. C.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While defendants based their rights on the
alleged Testimonial Title (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 6), it is observed
that plaintiff's title is indefeasible and against the whole world, while that
of the defendants is not and could not even be considered an imperfect title,
as well known in Land Registration Act (Act No. 496).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently, the clause (sic) of one of the two
titles is not hard to determine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The fact that defendants admit not only in their pleading (See <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> C-3 ) but also in open court that plaintiff
corporation is the owner of the property in question and that its title is an
incontrovertible one, the right of the plaintiff to recover possession of the
lot in question cannot be seriously questioned by defendants and its right
thereto is <span class="SpellE">imprescriptible</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Atun</span> et al v. <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span> et al, G. R.

Phil. 298).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The next issue is whether defendants are builders in good
faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let us examine the record of this
case, whether defendants could invoke that they were builders in good
faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time they bought the
property from the <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>, they did not inquire
whether the said <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> was a registered owner of the
property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, they never registered
the deed of sale (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1) in the Office of the
Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, as testified to by
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Jurilla</span> while on record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order that defendants may be called buyers
in good faith, it must be shown by clear and convincing evidence that upon
buying the property, they were not aware of any flaw in their title or made of
acquisition.</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"Art. 526, <span class="SpellE">N.C.C</span>. — He is deemed <span style="">a </span>possessor in good faith who is not
aware of any flaw which invalidates it.</p>

<p class="2Q">"He is deemed a possessor in bad faith, who possesses in any
case contrary to the foregoing.</p>

<p class="2Q">"Mistake upon a doubtful or difficult ques­tion of law may be
on the basis of good faith.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The fact that in 1950 defendant <span class="SpellE">Jurilla</span>
tendered to the <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> Subdivision the balance of
the consid­eration of P4,500.00 (See <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1) and
refused to accept the tender, is a clear indication that notice to Vicente <span class="SpellE">Jurilla</span>, who is a lawyer, that the party from whom he was
supposed to have bought the property was not the owner thereof and could not,
therefore, transmit title to him."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The conclusions of fact of His Honor contained in these portions
of the appealed decision may not be <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>,
since, as We have pointed out earlier, this appeal is limited to questions of
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in the light of the facts thus
found by His Honor, We cannot say that the legal conclusions derived <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> have no basis in law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants argue on pp. 25 to 26 of their brief this wise:</p>

<blockquote>"It may be argued however that in 1914 or 21 years after the
issuance of the <span class="SpellE">Informacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Posesoria</span>
in 1893 plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> or its pre­decessors in
interest claimed to have obtained certificate of title of a big tract of land
including the land in question under the land registration law or Act 496.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless we respectfully submit that the
'<span class="SpellE">Informacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Posesoria</span>'
covering the land in question conferred absolute and indefeasible title to the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span> under the Spanish Mortgage Law and that the
issuance of a certificate of title under the Land Registration Law 20 years
thereafter could not defeat the title upon the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span>
considering that upon the issuance of the alleged certi­ficate of title in favor
of the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> the actual and adverse
possessor of the property in question were the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span>
and not the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> or its immediate
predecessors."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Surely, appellants' reliance on the so-called "<span class="SpellE">Informacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Posesoria</span>" of
their vendor, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>,
cannot hold water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing is better
settled — indeed, it is axiomatic — in the law and jurisprudence in this
jurisdiction relative to land registration, than that a Torrens title is
indefeasible and incontrovertible as against any right or title in favor of any
party existing prior to the issuance thereof not annotated on the title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, in their answer filed in the court
below, appellants, by making a general denial of the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
allegation that it is the holder of a Torrens title over the land in dispute,
have virtually admitted the owner­ship thereof in <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
albeit they claimed that they had acquired the same for valuable consideration
from <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> whose
right over the same, according to them, was recognized by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
in the compromise settlement in Civil Case No. Q-135 entitled <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> et al. vs. J. M.
<span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> et al.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the real issues for Our determination are whether or not
there was in fact any such compromise settlement submitted to and approved by
the court and whether or not appellants' right to the land in question by
virtue of the sale made to them by <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> has really
been recognized by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, which are the very
issues raised in the rest of the assignments of error in appellants' brief.</p>

<p class="BODY">Actually, the fundamental affirmative defense of appellants seem
to be a little hazy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their answer to
the complaint below, there is the following allegation:</p>

<blockquote>"5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That defendants vigorously deny the
allegations in paragraph 5 of plaintiff's complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The truth is that by virtue of the compromise
agreement marked Annex 'II', the plaintiff J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>
&amp; Co., Inc., had stepped into the shoes of the vendor <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> with respect to the land in question covered
by the deed of sale Annex 'I', not only of the rights and interests of said <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> but also the
concomitant obligations inherent thereto then legally existing and enforceable
at the time of the execution of the compromise agreement and approved by a
competent court as evidenced by the decision marked Annex 'III' hereunto
attached and made part of the present answer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That what the defendants are herein asserting against the plaintiff J.
M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc. is the compliance of the
obligations by the said plaintiff which said plaintiff (J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc., ) had assumed for and in behalf of
the vendor <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>
in that deed of sale Annex 'I' by virtue of the compromise agreement Annex 'II'
and approved by the court as evidenced by the decision Annex 'III'. " (Pp.
46-47, Rec. on Appeal.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, on pp. 33-34 of their brief, they contend
thus:</p>

<blockquote>"It may be argued further that plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
has succeeded or stepped into the shoes of <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> (<span class="SpellE">Deudors</span>) by virtue of the
Compromise Agreement Annex 'II'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It must be noted however that when <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>
and plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> executed the Compromise
Agreement Annex 'II', <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> had already sold,
conveyed and transferred his title, possession and whatever rights and claims
upon the land in question in favor of the defendants-appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>
could not have transferred, sold or conveyed to the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> by virtue of the Compromise Agreement whatever
rights or interest upon the land in question previously con­veyed for valuable
consideration to defendants-appellants by virtue of the deed of absolute sale
Annex 'I'."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As We see it, it is apparently the view of appellants that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> by obligating itself in the compromise agreement,
wherein the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span> expressly admitted the
indefeasibility of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> title over the land in
controversy, to pay a large sum of money to the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span>,
said <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had done so by way of payment of an
agreed purchase price of the rights of ownership that the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span>
still had over the said lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not
find the terms of the compromise agreement to be in that sense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it appears to Us, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
entered into the compromise agreement confident of its position that its
Torrens title over the property in question is unassailable and the monetary
consideration therein stipulated was for no other purpose than to buy peace of
mind, what with the numerous and protracted litigations it had had to either
institute or defend against holders of supposed Spanish grants or titles being
pitted against its registered title, notwithstanding they were not brought out
during the registration proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such, to Us, is the clear import of the following provisions of the
compromise agreement:</p>

<blockquote>"FIRST — That the OWNERS own a tract
of land situated in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City and covered by
Transfer Certificate of Title Nos. 37685, 37686, 37677, 37678, 37679, 37680,
37683, of the Register of Deeds of Q. C. containing an area of approximately
nine hundred (900) hectares, which they have subdivided and have sold and
offered for sale by installment since 1938 to the public under the trade name
'Santa Mesa Heights Subdivision';</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SECOND — That within the perimeter of
said land is an area measuring fifty (50) <span class="SpellE">quiñones</span>,
over which the <span class="SpellE">DEUDORS</span>, have claimed <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> rights by virtue of what purports to be an
abstract of an 'information <span class="SpellE">posesoria</span>' covering said
latter property, which recites that at the time of the issuance thereof in
1893, the records of the Register of Deeds of Manila (South District) showed
that said property was registered in the name of the old <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>, predecessors-in-interest of the present, <span class="SpellE">DEUDORS</span> who are parties hereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The relative position and area of the land
claimed by the <span class="SpellE">DEUDORS</span> in relation to the property of
the OWNERS covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. (as above)
above-mentioned, is shown in the sketch hereto attached as Annex 'A' and made,
part hereof;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"THIRD — That said <span class="SpellE">DEUDORS</span>
have been in pos­session of the land in question and claim to be the owners
thereof and during the period of said pos­session have sold their rights to
various third persons;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"FOURTH — That in the middle of 1950,
the <span class="SpellE">DEUDORS</span>, under a mistaken impression of the
nature of their rights in said property, began the following suits against the
OWNERS in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City:
(a) Case No. Q-135, <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> et al vs. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>; (b) Case No. Q-183, <span class="SpellE">Fulgencio</span>

Q-177, <span class="SpellE">Agripino</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> vs.
<span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"FIFTH — That after examining the
various documents evidencing the title to said lands, the <span class="SpellE">DEUDORS</span>
have decided to, as they hereby recognize the complete absolute and
indefeasible title in fee simple of the OWNER over the said property, and
hereby renounce, cede and quitclaim into and in favor of the OWNERS any right,
title or interest of whatever nature they may have had in the past or may now
have or may have in and to said property in the future;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SIXTH — That for and in consideration
of the foregoing renunciation, cession and quitclaim, and of the improvement
which the <span class="SpellE">DEUDORS</span> have made on said property, and of
their undertaking to help maintain the OWNERS possession of said property and
other obligations assumed by the <span class="SpellE">DEUDORS</span> under this
agreement, the OWNERS hereby promise to pay said <span class="SpellE">DEUDORS</span>
in the manner herein specified, the sum of ONE MILLION TWO HUNDRED AND ONE
THOUSAND AND SIXTY THREE PESOS (P1,201,063.00) x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> ." (Pp. 62-64, Record on Appeal.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As can be seen, there is nothing in the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
terms of the agreement from which anyone can gather that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
ever recognized or acknowledged any superior right or title, much less a
transferable one, of the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span>, contrary to the
contention of appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, in so
far as appellants are concerned, there is the specific stipulation in paragraph
7 to the following effect:</p>

<blockquote>"SEVENTH — That the sales of the <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> rights claimed by the <span class="SpellE">DEUDORS</span>,
are described in the list submitted by them to the OWNERS which are attached
hereto marked Annexes 'B' and 'C' and made a part hereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever amounts may have been collected by
the <span class="SpellE">DEUDORS</span> on account thereof, shall be deducted
from the total sum of P1,201,063.00 to be paid to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It shall be the joint and <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>
obligations of the <span class="SpellE">DEUDORS</span> to make the buyers of the
lots pur­portedly sold by them recognize the title of the OWNERS over the
property purportedly bought by them and to make them sign whenever possible,
new contracts of purchase for said property at the current prices and terms
specified by the OWNERS in their sales of lots in their subdivision known as
'Sta. Mesa Heights Subdivision'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">DEUDORS</span> hereby advise the OWNERS that the buyers listed in
Annex 'B' herein with the annotation 'continue' shall buy the lots respectively
occupied by them and shall sign new contracts, but the sums already paid by
them to the <span class="SpellE">DEUDORS</span> amounting to P134,922.84 (subject
to verification by the Court) shall be credited to the buyers and shall be
deduced from the sums to be paid to the <span class="SpellE">DEUDORS</span> by
the OWNERS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">DEUDORS</span>
also advise the OWNERS that the buyers listed in Annex 'C' herein with the
annotation 'Refund' have decided not to continue with their former contracts of
purchase with the <span class="SpellE">DEUDORS</span> and the sum already paid by
them to the <span class="SpellE">DEUDORS</span> and <span class="SpellE">totalling</span>
P101,182.42 (subject to verification by the Court) shall be refunded to them by
the OWNERS and deducted from the sum that may be due the <span class="SpellE">DEUDORS</span>
from the OWNERS." (Pp. 65-66, Record on Appeal.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">As far as We can gather from the record,
the appellants are among those listed in the Annex B referred to in the
paragraph.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of these circumstances, it is not to be wondered
that in its answer to appellants' counterclaim insisting on their alleged right
to acquire the land in controversy pursuant to the terms of their purchase from
<span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> alleged:</p>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That plaintiff refused the tender of payment
of defendants because the same was not in accordance with the current price of
the lot <span style="">and </span>because defendants refused
to enter into a new contract of purchase with plaintiff, contrary to the terms
of the compromise agreement by virtue of which they were making such
tender.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See par. 7 of Compromise
Agreement. )"(Page 101, Record on Appeal.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In short, We cannot find any basis in the record for upholding
the claim of appellants articulated in their answer below as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That plaintiff J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>
&amp; Co., Inc. is in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> to question the right,
title, interest, and possession of the defendants herein in the land now in
question covered by the deed of sale An­nex 'I' inasmuch that in the compromise
agree­ment Annex 'II' and approved by a competent court (Annex 'III' ), the
said plaintiff J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc. has
acknowledged that the defendant Ester L. <span class="SpellE">Jurilla</span> is
one of the purchasers of <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>; that said Ester L. <span class="SpellE">Jurilla</span>
could buy said lot evidenced by Annex 'I' , the land now in question, from the
plaintiff J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc., the lot which
<span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> has agreed
to sell to said Ester L. <span class="SpellE">Jurilla</span> now defendant; that
the plaintiff J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc., in
accepting the renunciation and quit­claim by <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> in favor of the said plain­tiff J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc., the latter knew of the commitments
and obligations of <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>
in favor of the defendant Ester L. <span class="SpellE">Jurilla</span> as shown
by her being included in the list made part of the com­promise agreement of
those purchasers of lots when <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> was still in possession; and that plaintiff J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc. , by reason of the compromise Annex
'II' had also assumed certain obligation with regard to the defendant Ester L. <span class="SpellE">Jurilla</span>, recognizing her as a purchaser who made partial
payments and continue to buy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That because of the foregoing facts, the
plaintiff J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc., had stepped
into the shoes of the vendor <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> in that deed of sale Annex 'I', not only of the
rights and interests of said <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>, but also the concomitant obligations inherent
thereto then legally existing and enforceable at the time of the execution of
the compromise agreement Annex 'II' and approved by a competent court (Annex
'III').</blockquote>

<blockquote>"8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That after the rendition of the judgment Annex
'III' the defendants spouses Vicente <span class="SpellE">Jurilla</span> and
Ester L. <span class="SpellE">Jurilla</span> tendered and offered payment to the
plaintiff J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc., in compliance
with the terms and conditions stipulated in the deed of sale Annex 'I', but
said plaintiff J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc., refused
and continue to refuse to receive the payment or installments <span style="">stipulated in the said deed of sale unless
the defendants spouses herein would execute and sign a new contract with the
plaintiff J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc., and to pay a
very high and exorbitant price of SEVENTY PESOS (P70.00) per square meter for
the same land covered by the same deed of sale, contrary to and in violation of
the terms and conditions agreed upon in the repeatedly mentioned deed of sale.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That by virtue of the compromise agreement,
the plaintiff J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc., had stepped
into the shoes of the vendor <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> with respect to the land in question covered by the
deed of sale Annex 'I', not only of the rights and interests of said <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> but also the
concomitant obligations inherent thereto then legally existing and enforceable
at the time of the execution of the compromise agreement and approved by the
Court." (Pp. 47-50, Rec. on Appeal.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the contrary, what can
be readily deduced from the above discussion is that, since appellants are
invoking the supposed compromise agreement they are referring to (which <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> claims was subsequently rescinded), they are the
ones actually in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> to insist that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> should abide by the terms of the sale to them of
the land in dispute by <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As contended by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
under the seventh paragraph of the compromise agreement, all that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> has recognized with reference to the sale made by <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span> to appellants is that from the monetary
consideration to be paid by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span>, the down-payment which appellants had paid to <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> would be
deducted and virtually considered as paid to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
and that the balance that appellants would have to pay to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
would depend on whatever agreement may be entered into between them and <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, without regard to the terms of appellants'
purchase from <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And as rightly contended by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, since
appellants are unwilling to enter into new negotiations with it, they have no
right to continue in possession of the land in question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">IN VIEW OF ALL THE
FOREGOING</span></b><span style="">, the judgment of
the </span>trial court is affirmed, with costs against appellants.</p>
