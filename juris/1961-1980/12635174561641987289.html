				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for certiorari, with a prayer for the issuance of a writ
of preliminary injunction, filed by Jose A. Beltran, Vicen­te B. <span class="SpellE">Magadia</span>, and Jose O. Sta. <span class="SpellE">Romana</span>
against Commissioners Enrique Medina and Isidro <span class="SpellE">Tayag</span>
of the First Division, Public Service Commission, some twenty-nine members of
the Bus Ope­rators Association of the Philippines (BOAP), and the BOAP itself,
to enjoin the enforcement and implementation of the Commissioners orders dated
December 8, 1965 and January 17, 1966, respectively, and, after due notice and
hearing, to declare them null and void for being contrary to law.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1964</st1:date>
the respondent bus operators (hereinaf­ter referred to as the respondent
operators), through the BOAP, filed with the Public Service Commission (hereinafter
referred to as the Commission) an application for the increase of bus fares
(docketed therein as Case 64-2365).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More
specifically, they prayed for authority (1) to increase by one centavo per
passenger per kilometer one-way whatever fares they were then authorized to
charge, and (2) to charge a minimum fare of fifteen centavos (PO.15) per
passenger.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1964</st1:date>
the Commission scheduled for <st1:date year="1964" day="16" month="9">Septem­ber
 16, 1964</st1:date> the first hearing on the above application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In connec­tion with the said hearing, the
Commission required the respon­dent operators to notify all municipal mayors
and councils, pro­vincial governors and boards, and city mayors and councils
through­out the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
about the aforesaid application by furnishing <span class="GramE">them</span>
copies thereof as well as of the notice of hearing issued there under, at least
15 days beforehand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was apart from
the gene­ral notice by publication made by the respondent operators in com­pliance
with the Commission's order for the publication of the said application in two
newspapers of general circulation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1964</st1:date>,
despite the publication and the notices by mail sent to all municipal,
provincial and city authorities by the respondent <span class="GramE">operators</span>,
only the provinces of <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>

dated <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1965</st1:date>,
the petitioner Beltran registered in his and in behalf of his co-residents of

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="26" month="2">February 26, 1965</st1:date>,
after about four members of the ap­plicant BOAP had presented their evidence in
support of the appli­cation and rested their case, an urgent <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> petition for provi­sional authority to adjust
passenger rates was filed jointly by the respondents La <span class="SpellE">Mallorca</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> Bus Co., Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to the Commission's order, the
aforesaid urgent petition was published on <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1965</st1:date> in the <u>Daily</u> <u>Mirror</u> and the <u>Manila</u>

by the respondents Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines, Inc. and the <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> Transporta­tion Co., Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter two petitions were not published,
but they were filed in the very same proceeding in which the La <span class="SpellE">Mallorca­Pambusco</span> petition was filed, <span class="SpellE">i</span>.
e., PSC Case 64-2365.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> in PSC Case 64-2365
actually began present­ing their evidence on <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1965</st1:date> when the counsel for the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, presented his first witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 10, 1965 the petitioner Beltran, in behalf of the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> Project Residents Association, filed an <u>ex</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> motion, which was adopted by the other <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>, for the auditing and examination of the books
and accounts of the respondents bus operators by the General Auditing Office'
pursuant to section l of Com. Act 325. A similar motion dated <st1:date year="1965" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1965</st1:date> was filed by the counsel
for the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Against these motions, the respondents Laguna <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span>
Bus Co. and <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> Transportation Co. filed an
opposition on May 24, 1965, upon the grounds that the respondent operators had
already submitted to the Commission their financial statements for the years
1963 and 1964, as well as their income tax returns, and that there were on file
with the Commission copies of their annual reports, to all of which interested
parties may refer for the pur­pose of verifying the respondent operators, true
financial condi­tions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same
opposition contended that Com. Act 625 did not impose on the Commission an
obligation to order the audit and examination of the books, records and
accounts of the respondent operators.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Both motions were denied in an undated order of Com­missioner <span class="SpellE">Guinto</span> who adopted the arguments embodied in the op­position.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="7">July 27, 1965</st1:date>
a motion for reconsideration of the afore-cited order of denial was filed by
the petitioner Beltran for the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> Project
Residents Association, with a prayer that the same be submitted for the resolution
of the Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="22" month="10">October 22, 1965</st1:date>
the Commission, through respondent Commissioner Medina, set the case for
hearing on <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="10">October 29, 1965</st1:date>
at 900 a. m.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="10">October 29, 1965</st1:date>
a memorandum was issued by the act­ing Secretary of the Commission, through the
administrative officer thereof, re-assigning the case to respondent
Commissioner Medina.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="19" month="11">November 19, 1965</st1:date>
Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Guinto</span> issued a me­morandum transmitting
the case to the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of respondent Com­missioner
Medina for continuation of the hearing, upon the ground that it was a rate-case
which properly belonged to the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 8, 1965 Commissioner Medina issued an or­der,
concurred in by Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Tayag</span>, granting
provisional authority to the respondent bus operators and "all operators
who are situated in the same area and are operating under the same
conditions" to increase the bus rates, as follows: (a) minimum charge, for
less than seven (7) <span class="SpellE">kms</span>. <span class="GramE">P0.15; (b)
basic charge, per kilometer - P0.02; and (c) maximum charge in sub-standard
roads per km. - P0.025, and making the same immediately ef­fective.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Commissioner Gregorio C. <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>,
the third mem­ber of the First Division to which respondent Commissioners
Medina and <span class="SpellE">Tayag</span> belonged, dissented on the ground
that no ur­gent need to grant the petition for increase of rates had been shown
on the basis of the evidence presented.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There were filed several motions to reconsider the foregoing order, one
of which was that filed <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> by the
petitioners as counsel for the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>, Pro­ject
Residents Association and the Confederation of PHHC Housing Residents
Association.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hearing on the said motions for reconsideration was set for <st1:date year="1966" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1966</st1:date> at which date,
extensive arguments were raised by the parties, including a manifestation by
the counsel for the respondent operators that the latter were amenable to a re­turn
to the old minimum rate of P0.10 for not more than five kilo­meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the hearing, Commissioner Medina, with
the con­currence of Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Tayag</span>, issued an
order affirming their provisional order of <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1965</st1:date>, with the modification that the minimum
charge for distances of five kilometers or less should be reverted to the
former rate of P0.10. Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Pangani­ban</span>
dissented and voted to return to the old rate until the termina­tion of the
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence the present petition for certiorari which impugns the
Jurisdiction of the respondent Commissioners, acting as mem­bers of the First
Division, to issue the orders of <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="12">December
 8, 1965</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1966" day="17" month="1">January 17,
 1966</st1:date>, respectively, because:</p>

<blockquote>“(1) Only the
Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> can render a deci­sion in connection with
cases involving the fixing of rates and petitions for reconsideration of orders
or resolutions, as provided by the Public Service Act.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even granting that there was such power the
respondent Commissioners failed to observe a mandatory provision of law, i.e.,
Sec. 1, Com. Act 325, before granting the said provisional increase.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(3) The First
Division of the Public Service Commission, of which the respondent
Commissioners are members, is not empowered by any law to extend the
provisional authority to increase rates to the bus operators which were not
applicants, because this is contrary to the requirements of the Public Service
Act relative to the fixing of rates only upon proper notice and hearing; and
that consequently, the aforesaid orders are null and void because they
authorized other bus operators which were not applicants to increase their
rates.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(4) Assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> that the First Division of the Public
Service Commission had jurisdic­tion over the petitions for provisional authori­ty
to increase rates, the order of December 8, 1965 is arbitrary because it was
immediately implemented contrary to the requirement that within thirty (30)
days, said petition to increase provisionally the rates must be published and
notice given to the affected parties."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We have carefully leafed through the record of this case and have
been unable to find any indication that the various mo­tions to reconsider the
order dated <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1965</st1:date>
granting provisional authority to the respondent bus operators and others
similarly situated to increase their <span class="GramE">rates,</span> were
submitted for decision or resolution to the Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, the record shows that
the order dated <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1965</st1:date>
and the order dated <st1:date year="1966" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1966</st1:date>
denying the motions to re­consider the former <span class="GramE">order,</span>
were both resolved by a division of three Commissioners, one of whom dissented
from both orders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first order,
however, was non-interlocutory because imme­diately <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
pursuant to section 33 of the Public Service Act which provides, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that –</p>

<blockquote>"... <u>All orders of the Commission</u> to conti­nue an
existing service or <u>prescribing rate to be charged shall be immediately operative</u>;
x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Thus, any and all motions to reconsider
the same should have been lodged with and resolved by the Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
as directed by section 3 of the said Act which states -</p>

<blockquote>"... That any motion for reconsideration of a decision or
non-interlocutory order of any Commissioner or division shall be heard directly
by the Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> and the concurrence of at least four
Commissioners shall be necessary for the promulgation of a final decision or or­der
resolving such motion for reconsideration."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This Court cannot consider and will not resolve the pre sent
petition to enjoin the enforcement and implementation of two orders of-the
Public Service Commission, one of which was beyond the jurisdiction of a mere
division of three Commissioners to issue.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This case should be remanded to the Public Service Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
so that the latter can act on and resolve <u>all the issues</u> raised in the
various motions to reconsider the order dated <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1965</st1:date>, and take such actions as it may see fit
in accordance with law and with the environmental milieu now obtaining.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, let this case be remanded to the Public
Service Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> for further proceedings as herein
indicated. No costs.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur with the main opinion of Justice Castro that peti­tioners'
motion for reconsideration of the First Division's Order of December 8, 1965
granting provisional authority to the respon­dent bus operators to increase their
rates was beyond the First Division's jurisdiction to consider and deny, and
that the case should be remanded to the Public Service Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
for its proper determination and resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Four salient facts in the case have struck my attention:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">This is a mass application for
increase of bus rates throughout the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
by twenty nine members of the Bus Operators Association of the Philippines
(BOAP) and the BOAP itself;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">Only six operators headed by La <span class="SpellE">Mallorca</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pambusco</span> filed
urgent ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> petitions for provisional authority
to increase their rates, but the first Division granted the provisional
increase of rates not only to the applicants but <u>en</u> <u>masse</u> to
"all operators who are situated in the same area and are operating under
the same conditions; "</span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">3.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">There is strong indication of <span class="SpellE">precipitateness</span> and lack of regard for the interest of the
general traveling public in the mass increase authorized by the First Division,
for its authorization of a minimum fee of fifteen centavos (P0.15) per passenger
was quickly withdrawn in its Order of January 17, 1966, denying (without
jurisdiction) the motion for reconsideration, but reverting to the former rate
of ten centavos 00. 10) <span class="GramE">per</span> passenger for distances of
five kilometers or less, after counsel for respondent bus operators had
manifested at the "rehearing" their amenability thereto;.</span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">4.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>
had throughout dissented against the provisional increase voted by his
colleagues (Commissioners Medina and <span class="SpellE">Tayag</span>) on the
ground that no urgent need <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> had been shown on
the basis of the evidence presented and that the old rates should therefore be
maintained until the termination of the case on the merits.</span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">5.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">I believe under such
circumstances, that as provided in Section 1 of Commonwealth Act No. 325, the
public interests demand that there should first be a prior examination of the
financial condition of the respondent bus operators and the Commission <u>en</u>
<u>banc's</u> action on petitioners' motion for reconsider­ation, as remanded
by the Court, should await the outcome of such examination by the Auditor
General.</span></p>
