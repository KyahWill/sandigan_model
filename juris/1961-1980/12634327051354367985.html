				<H3>SAN MIGUEL CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. HON. CELSO AVELINO, PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF CEBU, BRANCH XIII, AND THE CITY OF MANDAUE, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">It is understandable for petitioner San Miguel Corporation to
expect the speedy determination of its claim that the challenged ordinance of
respondent City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Mandaue</span></st1:place></st1:city><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
imposing a specific tax should be nullified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence its concern at the failure of respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, Branch XIII, to grant its motion to dismiss on the
ground of lack of jurisdiction a complaint for the collection of such tax filed
by respondent City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The challenged order
reads as follows: <span style="">&nbsp;</span>"Acting on the
[motion to dismiss] filed by the defendant through counsel on October 11, 1974
and the [opposition] thereto filed by the plaintiff through counsel on October
17, 1974, the Court finds no justifiable reason in dismissing the Complaint at
this stage of the proceedings and hereby denies said motion."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Offhand, it would not be easy to assail its correctness, manifesting as it does
caution and care in ascertaining the principal question involved in the suit
for the collection of the specific tax, which is its validity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is undoubted that under the Constitution,
even the legislative body cannot deprive this Court of its appellate
jurisdiction over all cases coming from inferior courts where the constitutionality
or validity of an ordinance or the legality of any tax, impost, assessment, or
toll is in question.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Since it is likewise expressly provided in Section 43 of the Judiciary Act that
the original jurisdiction over all civil actions involving the legality of any
tax, impost or assessment appertains to the Court of First Instance,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
it takes a certain degree of ingenuity to allege that the lower court was
bereft of such authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel for
petitioner, Attorney Demosthenes B. <span class="SpellE">Gadioma</span>, both in
the petition and in his scholarly and exhaustive memorandum, did seek to impart
plausibility to a suit of this character by relying not so much on the alleged <u>ultra</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>vires</u></span> or constitutional infirmity of the
ordinance but rather on the failure of respondent City to follow the procedure
set forth in the Local Tax Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
It was contended that there was a finding of invalidity by the then Acting
Secretary of Justice, at present the Acting Minister of Justice, <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Macaraig</span>, Jr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is inaccuracy in such a
characterization as the actual phrase used by such dignitary is that it
"is of doubtful validity."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The argument pressed is that a suit for collection is not the appeal provided
for in the last sentence of Section 47:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The decision of the Secretary of Justice shall be final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> unless, within thirty days upon receipt thereof,
the aggrieved party contests the same in a court of competent
jurisdiction."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> <st1:place><st1:placename>Respondent</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> disagrees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is its submission that the suit for
collection cannot be viewed other than as an appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The aggrieved party, here respondent City, in
the suit for collection, did definitely contest the correctness of the decision
of the Secretary of Justice in a court of competent jurisdiction - this, even
on the assumption that there was a finding of invalidity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statutory purpose is thus satisfied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an action is in accordance with the
traditional and appropriate procedure to test the legality of a statute,
decree, or ordinance.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court finds such an approach persuasive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It conforms to the authoritative principle
that the question of validity is for the judiciary to decide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As far back as the leading case of <span class="SpellE">Marbury</span> v.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Madison</st1:place></st1:city>,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
where the American Supreme Court enunciated the principle of judicial review,
Chief Justice Marshall stressed:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial
department to say what the law is."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
That was precisely what was done by respondent City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has likewise in its favor the fact that
even the very decision of the Acting Secretary of Justice relied upon did not
squarely rule on the validity of the ordinance but only on its "doubtful
character." The writs prayed for, <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition,
cannot issue.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts are undisputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place><st1:placename>Respondent</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, in accordance with
Presidential Decree No. 231, enacted in 1973, to take effect on <st1:date year="1974" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1974</st1:date>, the challenged
ordinance, otherwise known as the <span class="SpellE">Mandaue</span> City Tax
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The City Treasurer, on <st1:date year="1974" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1974</st1:date>, demanded from
petitioner payment of the said specific tax on the total volume of beer it
produced in the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Mandaue</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner, on <st1:date year="1974" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1974</st1:date>, contested the collection of said specific
tax "on the ground that Section 12 (e) (7) in relation to Section 12 (e)
(1) and (2), <span class="SpellE">Mandaue</span> City Ordinance No. 97, is
illegal and void because it imposed a specific tax beyond its territorial
jurisdiction." The matter was then referred by respondent City to its City
Fiscal, pursuant to such Presidential Decree.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Its validity was sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then
came the appeal to the Secretary of Justice, with the then Acting Secretary of
Justice <span class="SpellE">Macaraig</span>, as noted, rendering the opinion
that it is "of doubtful validity." A suit for collection was thereÂ­after
filed by the City where it squarely put in issue the validity of such
ordinance, thus contesting the opinion of the Acting Secretary of Justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crucial issue from the petitioner's standpoint is whether the
filing of such action after such opinion was rendered may be considered
"an appeal" under the Presidential Decree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence the motion to dismiss by petitioner,
which was denied, respondent Judge finding "no justifiable reason at
[that] stage of the proceedings, "<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
resulting in this petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition.</p>

<p class="BODY">To repeat, the petition must fail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The writs prayed for cannot be granted.</p>

<blockquote>1. Tersely and bluntly put, petitioner would deny the jurisdiction
of respondent Judge to pass upon the validity of a challenged ordinance in an
appropriate action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To say the least,
there is unorthodoxy in such an approach.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What immediately calls attention is its novelty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is opposed to and is not in conformity
with the accepted juridical norm that the validity of a statute, an executive
order or ordinance is a matter for the judiciary to decide and that whenever in
the disposition of a pending case such a question becomes unavoidable, then it is
not only the power but the duty of the Court to resolve such a question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the pending suit by respondent City,
sought to be dismissed by petitioner corpoÂ­ration, it specifically prayed
"that Ordinance No. 97, Series of 1973, of the herein plaintiff is valid,
legal, and enforceable in accordance with law; * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Since both under the Constitution and the Judiciary Act, respondent Judge is
vested with jurisdiction to make such a declaration, it would be, at the very
least, premature for the corrective power of this Tribunal to be interposed,
just because he did not, "at [that] stage of the proceedings," grant
the motion to dismiss on the allegation that there was lack of
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The authorities support
squarely the procedure followed by respondent City to remove doubts as to the
validity of the ordinance in question.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Even more in point are these two decisions with reference to the municipal
power to impose specific taxes on beverages manufactured within its territorial
boundaries, City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:place></st1:city>
v. <span class="SpellE">Gruet</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
and City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Naga</span></st1:place></st1:city>
v. Court of Appeals.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
It is worth mentioning that in the first case cited, the entity involved is
petitioner corporation, then known as San Miguel Brewery, Inc., defendant and
appellant <span class="SpellE">Gruet</span> being sued in his capacity as manager
of its Coca-Cola Plant in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. There is this reinforcement to the conclusion reached.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To so construe Section 47 would be to raise a
serious constitutional question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it
would in effect bar what otherwise would be a proper case cognizable by a court
precisely in the exercise of the conceded power of judicial review just because
the procedure contended for which is that of an "appeal," under the
circumstances a term vague and ambiguous, was not followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner may not be sufficiently aware of
the implications of such a proposition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would run counter to the well-settled doctrine that between two
possible modes of construction, the one which would not be in conflict with
what is ordained by the Constitution is to be preferred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every intendment of the law should lean
towards its validity, not its invalidity.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The judiciary, as noted by Justice Douglas, should favor "that
interpretation of legislation which gives it the greater chance of surviving
the test of constitutionality."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>3. The inherent weakness of this suit for <i>certiorari</i> and
prohibition is likewise discernible from the fact that the then Acting
Secretary of Justice <span class="SpellE">Macaraig</span> limited himÂ­self to a
finding that the ordinance in question was "of doubtful validity."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
That is far from a categorical declaration of its being repugnant to the
Constitution or its being <u>ultra</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>vires</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That betrays a realization that unless and
until the judiciary speaks in no uncertain terms, the presumption of validity
continues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Misgivings as to the likelihood
of an alleged infringement of any binding norm do not suffice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is this aphorism from Justice
Malcolm:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"To doubt is to
sustain."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
That is merely to accord recognition to the well-settled and binding doctrine
that only in a very clear case is the judiciary justified in nullifying a
statute, decree, or ordinance.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4. One last word.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
decision certainly does not extend to any determination by this Court as to the
validity, or lack of it, of the assailed ordinance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To do so would be, at the very least,
premature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is a function for the
lower court to perform.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hearing of the case before respondent
Judge should be conducted as speedily as circumstances permit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against petitioner.</p>
