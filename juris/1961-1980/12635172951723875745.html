				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Pastor, Antonio and Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Tapac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Glicerio</span> and Ramon <span class="SpellE">Cabigayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Abegonia</span> and Jesus <span class="SpellE">Abadiac</span> were charged with robbery with homicide in the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Jesus <span class="SpellE">Abadiac</span>
was never arrested, the trial below proceeded only as against the other six
defendants all of whom had pleaded not guilty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After such trial the court rendered judgment as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"There is no sufficient evidence to prove that the several
defendants conspired to commit the crime; although it is evident that they
helped each other in committing the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As there is no way to prove which <span class="GramE">wounds</span> were
caused by each one of them; so they all shall be held equally liable for the
result of their illegal act, for the death of the deceased, for homicide.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"All of them were armed; and since they were seven, the
circumstance that advantage was taken of superior strength shall be considered
to aggravate the penalty against all of them (par. 15, <st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The <span class="GramE">cutting of the ear, of the jaw and of
the tongue as well as the removal of both eyes were</span> unnecessary in the
commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were other wrongs
deliberately caused to augment the wrong already done; acts which characterized
vindictiveness; acts which were absolutely not necessary for the execution of
their purpose to kill the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
were acts of rashness and cruelty indicative of complete disregard of the
physical pains of another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
another aggravating circumstance (par. 21, <st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We have it therefore clear and beyond reason­able doubt that
the six accused on trial have com­mitted the crime of homicide as defined in
Art. 249 of the Revised Penal Code and therein pena­lized by reclusion
temporal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With respect to the crime of robbery, we hold that only
Pastor <span class="SpellE">Tapac</span> should be made res­ponsible for the
same:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>for he alone committed the robbery
after the victim was wounded and fallen and was rendered helpless, and might be
dying if not yet then dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He took the
money, a personal property of the deceased, with intent to gain, after
committing violence upon the person of his victim<b> </b>(Art. 293, Revised
Penal Code).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We have no evidence to prove that the other accused
participated in that robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was
no conspiracy, it could be that none of them stopped Pastor <span class="SpellE">Tapac</span>
from committing the robbery; but such would not be a just conclusion that they
participated in its commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
robbery there­fore should be attributed only to him (Pastor <span class="SpellE">Tapac</span>).<b><o:p></o:p></b></blockquote>

<blockquote>"As the robbery was committed in connection with the homicide,
the crime should fall under Art. <span class="GramE">294 (Supra) which provides
the penalty of reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span> to death.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Therefore the crime committed by Pastor <span class="SpellE">Tapac</span>
is homicide <span class="SpellE">complexed</span> with robbery; and the penalty
to be imposed shall be for the most serious crime (Art. <span class="GramE">46,
supra).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is no evidence to show that the drunk­enness of the
accused was either habitual or intentional.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such shall be considered to mitigate the penalty for all the accused
(Art. 15, Supra).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In view of the above, the Court finds and declares Pastor <span class="SpellE">Tapac</span> guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of
homicide <span class="SpellE">complexed</span> with robbery, and his five
co-accused guilty of homi­cide, in the commission of which one mitigating and
three aggravating circumstances were present; and,</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Therefore, convicts each one of them to suf­fer as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pastor <span class="SpellE">Tapac</span>,
to reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpe­tua</span>; Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tapac</span>,
to an indeterminate penalty from TWELVE (12) YEARS of <span class="SpellE">prision</span>
mayor to TWENTY (20) YEARS of reclusion temporal; and <span class="SpellE">Glicerio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cabigayan</span>, Ramon <span class="SpellE">Cabigayan</span>,
Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Tapac</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Pbegonia</span>, each, also to an indeterminate penalty from TEN
(10) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY of <span class="SpellE">prision</span> mayor to
SEVENTEEN (17) YEARS, FOUR (4) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY of reclusion temporal;
all with the accessory penalties, and all of them to indemnify, jointly and
severally the heirs of the deceased P6,000.00 plus P800.00, and pay the cor­responding
costs." <span class="GramE">(pp. 61-63 rec.).</span></blockquote>

counsel de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span>, with the following assign­ment of

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="17" month="3">March 17, 1967</st1:date>,
Pastor <span class="SpellE">Tapac</span> filed a motion for the withdrawal of his
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We granted the same in our
resolution of April 5 of the same year (record pp. 32-33).</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' brief states the facts as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Felipe <span class="SpellE">Mabutas</span> (deceased) and his
wife, Lolita, were residents of the Barrio proper of <span class="SpellE">Parasanon</span>,
<st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pinabacdao</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Samar</span></span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Barrio has a <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Magdawat</span>, about 8 kilo­meters from the Barrio proper.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The spouses own a store in <span class="SpellE">Parasanon</span>
managed by the wife, and an abaca plantation in <span class="SpellE">Magdawat</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Within the year prior to <st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1963</st1:date>, they established a stripping machine
in the latter place, and they engaged in the abaca business under the
management of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was to
buy both raw abaca for stripping, and also dried abaca, from other planters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To haul the purchases, they had to have a <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> (T.S.N. pp. 6-8, Sept. 8, 1965).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1963</st1:date>,
the deceased left his home in <span class="SpellE">Parasanon</span> to go to <span class="SpellE">Magdawat</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His wife
handed P800.00 to him with which to buy abaca and a <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>
(T.S.N., p. 6, Sept. 8, 1965).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1963</st1:date>,
an upland <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span> in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span>
<span class="SpellE">lnalaran</span> (<span class="SpellE">Enalaran</span>), <span class="SpellE">Parasanon</span>, belonging to Antonio and Dolores <span class="SpellE">Ocenar</span>, was being planted (T.S.N., p. 5, Sept. 23,
1965).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On hand in the morning of that
day to help them were more than 50 neighbors, among whom were <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabaljao</span>, a nephew of
the deceased, and the seven defendants herein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Of the latter, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tapac</span> is the father of
Pastor <span class="SpellE">Tapac</span> and Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Tapac</span>,
and the father-in-law of <span class="SpellE">Glicerio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabigayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ramon <span class="SpellE">Cabi­gayan</span> is
the brother of <span class="SpellE">Glicerio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabigayan</span>,
the brother-in-law of <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Abegonia</span>,
and the cousin-in-law of Jesus <span class="SpellE">Abadiac</span> (T.S.N., p. 4,
Sept. 23, 1965).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">noon</st1:time> time, the
planters repaired to the nearby house of Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Ocenar</span>
for their lunch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just before the meal
was about to be served, the deceased arrived at the house of Trinidad for the
purpose of buying the latter 's <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> (T.S.N., p.
20, Sept. 23, 1965).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had a radio
receiving set with him which, presumably, he allowed Juan <span class="SpellE">Labutin</span>,
<st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>'s son, to handle (T.S.N., p. 8, Sept. 23,
1965).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>'s
asking price for the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> was P250.00, which she
later on reduced to P230.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
deceased was willing, to pay only P200.00 and, in an effort to <span class="SpellE">psychologize</span> <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>, he drew that
sum from his wallet and offered it to her, stating that the amount should be suf­ficient
considering that the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> was still young
('small').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the people around came
to know that the deceased was carrying money with him (T.S.N., p. 21, Sept. 23,
1965).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>
remained adamant, and the negotiation terminated in the understanding that the
deceased could take up the matter with her son, Juan <span class="SpellE">Labutin</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the son agreed, the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>
would be sold at the price of­fered by the deceased (T.S.N., p. 25, Sept. 24,
1965).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The deceased stayed for lunch at <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>'s
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After eating, he went down from
the house and sat on a rung of the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here, he was joined by appellant Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tapac</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter asked the deceased for a monetary
loan which was refused, the deceased stating that he needed his cash for his
purchases of abaca.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The refusal was
resented by Antonio's son, Pastor <span class="SpellE">Tapac</span>, to the
extent that, when the deceased rose to leave and had asked Juan <span class="SpellE">Labutin</span> for his radio, Pastor struck him with a bolo from
behind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That act of Pastor precipitated
a general attack on the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Antonio also <span class="SpellE">boloed</span> him, followed by <span class="SpellE">Glicerio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> (T.S.N., pp.
7-10, Sept. 23, 1965).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>After</u> <u>he</u> <u>was</u> <u>already</u> <u>dead</u>, Ramon
<span class="SpellE">Cabigayan</span>, Jesus <span class="SpellE">Abadiac</span>
and Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Tapac</span> also <span class="SpellE">boloed</span>
him (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">'1-b', p. 54, of
record).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>His tongue and right ear
were cut, his lower jaw smashed, and his two eyes were gouged (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">'A', p. 52 of the record).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, Pastor grabbed the wallet of the
deceased which was in his pocket, tearing the pocket in the pro­cess (T.S.N.,<i>
</i>pp. 9-10, Sept. 23, 1965)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Comparing the above statement of facts, with the findings of fact
made by the trial court and the counter statement of facts made in the brief
filed by the Office of the Solicitor General, one will find no substantial
discrepancy except as to this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that
while according to the trial court and the Office of the Solicitor General
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Cabigayan</span>, Jesus <span class="SpellE">Abadiac</span>
and Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Tapac</span> <span class="SpellE">boloed</span>
the deceased Felipe <span class="SpellE">Mabutas</span> while he was still alive,
appellants contend that the three did so after <span class="SpellE">Mabutas</span>
was already dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, in their
brief (second assignment of error) it is claimed that the lower court erred in
convicting Ramon <span class="SpellE">Cabigayan</span> and Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Tapac</span> of the crime of homicide instead of finding them
guilty of an impossible crime, defined and penalized under Articles 4(2) and 59
of the Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support of
this view they rely exclusively upon a portion of the affidavit of prosecution
witness <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span><b> </b><span class="SpellE">Cabaljao</span>,
which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"When Felipe bade farewell, he asked his radio from Juan <span class="SpellE">Labotin</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I saw
Pastor <span class="SpellE">Tapak</span> stab Felipe <span class="SpellE">Mabutas</span>,
hitting him in the left neck, then Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tapak</span>
stabbed Felipe on his head, Felipe fell and rolled, then <span class="SpellE">Glicerio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Abiguña</span> stabbed Felipe, <u>Ramon</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Cabigayan</u></span> <u>stabbed</u> <u>while</u> <u>Felipe</u> <u>was</u>
<u>already</u> <u>dead</u> <u>and</u> <u>they</u> <u>kept</u> <u>on</u> <u>stabbing</u>
<u>when</u> <u>Jesus</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Abadiak</u></span> <u>arrived</u>
<u>at</u> <u>the</u> <u>cadaver</u> <u>let</u> <u>us</u> <u>stab</u> <u>him</u>
<u>so</u> <u>that</u> <u>he</u> <u>cannot</u> <u>go</u> <u>home</u> <u>to</u> <u>his</u>
<u>store</u>, <u>Rodrigo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Tapak</u></span> <u>arrived</u>
<u>and</u> <u>stabbed</u> <u>Felipe</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Mabutas</u></span>......"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the evidence of record, <span class="GramE">We</span>
are of the opinion that the sworn statement relied upon is not sufficient to
show that the trial court erred.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is extremely doubtful that <span class="SpellE">Cabaljao</span>
could have known positively that Felipe <span class="SpellE">Mabutas</span> was
already dead when Ramon <span class="SpellE">Cabigayan</span> and Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Tapac</span> also struck him, because <span class="SpellE">Cabaljao</span>
was upstairs near the window of the house of Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Ocenar</span>
where the crime was committed, from which vantage point he was looking down and
saw the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The most that one may
perhaps accept in this connection is that from the place where he was, it <u>seemed</u>
to him that the victim was already dead.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Material in this connection is the evidence to the effect that Jesus <span class="SpellE">Abadiac</span> - the accused who did not stand trial because he
was never arrested - told his companions to continue stabbing their victim so
that the latter could no longer go home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This clearly justifies the inference that when <span class="SpellE">Abadiac</span>
made such statement, their victim was still alive.</p>

<p class="BODY">We therefore, find the second assignment of error to be without
merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of the first assignment of error, appellants argue
that as the trial court held that it was only Pastor <span class="SpellE">Tapac</span>
who committed the robbery - although it likewise held all the appellants to be
equally guilty of homicide - he alone should have been sentenced to indemnify
the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P800.00 - the amount of which he robbed
their victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be observed that the information charges all the
appellants with having conspired, confederated and helped one another in killing
Felipe <span class="SpellE">Mabutas</span> in order to rob him of his money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence in this connection fully
justifies the conclusion that upon seeing the money in cash which Felipe <span class="SpellE">Mabutas</span> carried, the cupidity of appellants Antonio and
Pastor <span class="SpellE">Tapac</span> - father and son - in whose presence <span class="SpellE">Mabutas</span> counted the P200.00 which he showed to Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Ocenar</span> to induce her to sell her <span class="SpellE">cara­bao</span>
seized and overwhelmed them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of the fact that the transaction had failed, <span class="SpellE">Mabutas</span> refused to give the loan sought by Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tapac</span>, the latter and his children and other relatives
present suddenly attacked him in the cruel manner heretofore described - going
to the extent of cutting his ear, tongue and jaw, gouging his eyes - in other
words mutilating him unnecessarily.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter they left together, but not until after Pastor <span class="SpellE">Tapac</span> had robbed their victim of his money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All these leave us no other alternative but
to conclude that there was conspiracy amongst them (People vs. Castro et al.,
G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-17465, </span><st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="8"><span class="GramE">August 31, 1964</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">;
People vs. Luna et al., G. R. No.</span> L-15480, <st1:date year="1961" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1961</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY">For conspiracy to exist, no previous agreement to commit the
offense is necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conspiracy is
deemed to have been established if the evidence shows that the de­fendants had
the same purpose and joined together in its execution (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Cadag</span>, et al., G. R. No. L-13830, <st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1961</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this case such evidence exists.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Con­spiracy having thus been established, the act or acts of any one
conspirator is or are the acts of all of them, and each conspirator is
responsible for the unlawful act or acts of his co-conspirator (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Cadag</span>, supra; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Monadi</span>
et al, G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-3370-71, </span><st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="9"><span class="GramE">September 27, 1965</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">; People vs. Reyes et al., 46 O. G. 3780).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with the third and last assignment of error, all
that <span class="GramE">We</span> now need to say is the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">The acts of cruelty unnecessarily perpetrated against the
deceased Felipe <span class="SpellE">Mabutas</span> are beyond question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His assailants - notwithstanding the fact
that because of the unexpectedness of the assault he could not have offered any
resistance - inflicted upon him the following physical injuries:</p>

<blockquote>"Three (3) fatal wounds (all penetrating) on the left breast;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Three (3) fatal wounds (all penetrating) on the left portion
of the abdomen;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"One stabbed wound just below the neck (front section) wound
on the right arm (palm about to be separated);</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Two (2) fatal wounds (both penetrating) on the left and right
portion of the back;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"One stabbed wound on the left shoulder with fractured bones;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"One stabbed wound on the right ribs (penetrating);</blockquote>

<blockquote>"One fatal wound on the forehead;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"One fatal wound on the right section of the head; and</blockquote>

rec.)"</span></p>

<p class="BODY">As in this case conspiracy is clearly deducible from the
concerted action taken by all the appellants, it is not neces­sary to show
which of the above physical injuries was inflicted by this or that particular
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each one of them is

<p class="BODY">The foregoing shows conclusively that all the appellants are
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of robbery with homicide punishable
with Reclusion <span class="SpellE">Perpetua</span> to Death under the provision
of Article 294(1) of the Revised Penal Code, the commission thereof having been
attended by the aggravating circumstances of treachery and cruelty (Article 14,
paragraph 21, Revised Penal Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">There is, however, some evidence tending to show that appellants
were under the influence of liquor when they com­mitted the crime. This can not
be entirely disregarded con­sidering that on <st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1963</st1:date> they worked on the <st1:place><st1:placetype>land</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Antonio</st1:placename></st1:place> and Dolores <span class="SpellE">Ocenar</span> to help them for free in its cultivation and lunch
was served them at the usual time of the day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As customary in similar occasions, some in­toxicating beverages may have
been served before and after the meal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We are, therefore, inclined to appreciate in favor of appellants the
mitigating circumstance of intoxication, not habitual or intentional, in
accordance with the provisions of Article 15, Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This mitigating circumstance, however, would
suffice only to offset one of the aggravating circumstances mentioned heretofore,
this justifying the imposition of the heavier penalty of Death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, for lack of the required number of
votes, the same can not be imposed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, all the five appellants are hereby sentenced to suffer
Reclusion <span class="SpellE">Perpetua</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The indemnity of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> is also raised to
P12,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>THUS MODIFIED</b>, the appealed decision is affirmed in all
other respects.</p>
