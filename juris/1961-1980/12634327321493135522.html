				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> of
the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission which reversed the award
rendered by the Hearing Referee granting petitioner disability compensation
benefits under Sections 13 and 14 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as
amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">The referee's decision dated November 5, 1975 granted
petitioner-claimant Carmelita E. Vega P6,000.00 as disability compensation for
her ailment diagnosed as <span class="SpellE">ectopic</span> pregnancy,
complicated with hypertension and urinary tract infection, besides having
undergone hysterectomy, which caused her disability for labor as a public
school teacher; P5,391.40 as reimbursement of medical and hospital expenses;
and P61.00 as administrative fee.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General received a copy of the award on <st1:date year="1975" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1975</st1:date>, but failed to
timely take an appeal allegedly due to "volume and heavy pressure of
work." Instead, it filed on <st1:date year="1975" day="10" month="12">December
 10, 1975</st1:date> a pleading denominated Petition to Elevate the Records for
Relief from Judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent
Commission, acting on the merits of the petition, reversed the award and
dismissed the claim, ruling that claimant's <span class="SpellE">ectopic</span>
pregnancy (pregnancy outside the uterus) does not come within the compensatory
ambit of the law and that there is proof that her alleged hypertension was
complicated as would result to incapacity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, on April 7, 1976, claimant filed the instant petition wherein she
assailed the respondent Commission's decision dated January 30, 1976 as
contrary to law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the basis of controlling jurisprudence that the Workmen's
Compensation Commission loses appellate power to review the decision of a
hearing officer that has lapsed into finality, the Court sets aside the
disputed decision and reinstates the award rendered by the hearing referee.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principle that perfection of appeal within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period is mandatory and jurisdictional, and
that failure to do so renders the questioned decision final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> that deprives the appellate court of jurisdiction
to entertain the appeal applies to judgments of courts and of quasi-judicial
agencies like the Workmen's Compensation Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This rule of finality of judgments being
founded on public policy operates against all employers in compensation cases
whether private or public.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Cruz vs.
Workmen's Compensation Commission,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court speaking thru Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>, reaffirmed
the doctrine in Soliven vs. Workmen's Compensation Commission<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
thus:</p>

<blockquote>"xxx '(the) basic rule of finality of judgment is applicable
indiscriminately to one and all and regardless of whether respondent employer
be a public or private employer, since the rule is grounded on fundamental
considerations of public policy and sound practice that at risk of occasional
error, the judgment of courts and award of quasi-judicial agencies must become
final at some definite date fixed by law,' and '(I)t is of course beyond
question that the perfection of an appeal within the statutory or <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period is mandatory and jurisdictional and
that failure to so perfect an appeal renders final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
the questioned decision and deprives the appellate court of jurisdiction to
entertain the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lapse of the
appeal period deprives the courts of jurisdiction to alter the final judgment.’

<p class="BODY">Since it is undisputed that the Solicitor General received notice
of the referee's award on <st1:date year="1975" day="11" month="11">November
 11, 1975</st1:date> and did not interpose a timely appeal within the 15-day
statutory period, it is obvious that the award had already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> when the respondent Commission rendered its
reversal decision on <st1:date year="1976" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1976</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the Solicitor General filed a petition for relief
from judgment within the 30-day grace period, but under the rules<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
such petition must be grounded on fraud, accident, mistake or excusable
negligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ground invoked by the
Solicitor General in the petition <span class="SpellE">i</span>. e., "volume
and heavy pressure of work" resulting in its inability to take an appeal
or file a motion for reconsideration has no merit.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The ground has been rejected by the Court in Cruz vs. Workmen's Compensation
Commission<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
with admonition:</p>

<blockquote>"In the Luzon Stevedoring Corporation cases (71 SCRA 655),
wherein the Court commended the Commission for recognizing in the sixteen (16)
separate cases therein involved its lack of appellate jurisdiction to review or
set aside the questioned awards which had already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and 'thereby relieving this Court from the
needless burden of having to set aside its action had it arbitrarily resolved
the matter otherwise' (contrary to the action taken by it in the cases at bar),
the Court in dealing with respondent's counsel's plea of volume and pressure of
work cited the now Chief Justice's admonition in Republic vs. Lim (42 SCRA 163)
that in 'failing to take the necessary and appropriate precautions required by
the circumstances, which resulted in (its) being unable to take an appeal from
the said award of the referee, the <i>[</i>respondent<i>]</i> has only (itself)
to blame."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In improvidently proceeding to pass upon the substantial merits
of the referee's award, after it had ordered the elevation of the entire
records of the claim, without first decisively resolving the propriety of the
petition for relief from judgment, respondent Commission committed grave abuse
of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The award appealed from
having become final, and the petition availed of not being authorized by the
rules, the respondent Commission did not acquire appellate jurisdiction over
the case and, hence, its decision reversing the award and dis­missing the claim
is null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, We note that the referee has made it clear in the
award that the respondent Republic did not effectively controvert the
claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, the respondent Com­mission
justifies its reversal on the ground that "mere failure to controvert will
not make a claim compensable if in its very face it is not so." Although
there is logic in its Conclusion, we hold that the respondent Commission cannot
disregard the settled doctrine in compensation cases that non-<span class="SpellE">controversion</span> of the claim constitutes a waiver of all
non-jurisdictional defenses and, consequently, an admission of compensability
of the claim by the employer.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"The effect of non-<span class="SpellE">controversion</span> on
the part of the employer is, indeed, far-reaching.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As enunciated in a long line of decisions,
this inaction constitutes a waiver of any conceivable defense not jurisdictional
in nature, and fatal to those that might have been raised by the employer; it
is a renunciation of the right to challenge the propriety of the claim; and
ultimately it is an admission of compensability by the employer.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, as articulated in Agustin vs. Workmen's Compensation Commission<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
the claimant-petitioner's right to compensation becomes all the more
impregnable when we take into account that the employer's right to controvert
the claim has been forfeited due to its failure to file with the Commission the
notice of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> prescribed by the second
paragraph of Section 45 of the Act."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the respondent Commission states in its
decision that the petitioner-claimant has proved by ample evidence not only her
employment with the respondent Bureau of Public Schools but also her disability
for work on account of her illness since April 13, 1971 to November 21,
1971.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having established that
petitioner's illness supervened in the course of employment, there arises in
her favor the <span class="SpellE">rebuttable</span> presumption that the said
illness either arose out of, or at least was aggravated by, the nature of her
employment, and that consequently, the burden to show by substantial evidence
to the contrary lies with the employer.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
We noted that respondent employer failed to discharge this burden of proof.</p>
