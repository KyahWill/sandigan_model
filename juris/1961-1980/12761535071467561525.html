				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>On February 19, 1958 the spouses Perfecto Sarmiento and Cristina Canonigo 
hereinafter referred to as respondents filed an action for recovery of 
possession of land, with damages, with the Justice of the Peace Court of Naga, 
Cebu, against herein petitioners, alleging, among other things, that they were 
the owners of the parcel of land situated in barrio Alfaco-Lutak, Naga, Cebu, 
described in paragraph 3 of their complaint; that petitioners were their tenants 
over a portion thereof, their oral contract of tenancy providing that one-third 
of the produce of the land would pertain to respondents and the remaining 
two-thirds to petitioners; that in June, 1957, after the crop harvest, 
respondents demanded their share of the crop harvested by petitioners, but the 
latter refuel to deliver the same; that by reason thereof, respondents asked 
them to vacate the premises, and upon their refusal to do so, the case was 
filed. </p>
<p>Petitioners filed their answer with counterclaim, alleging, in turn, that 
they were the owners of the land described in the complaint, having inherited it 
from Pablo Geraldez, the original owner thereof, and, as affirmative defense, 
they claimed that the court had no jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the 
complaint as it involved either ownership of real estate or a tenancy 
relationship between the parties. </p>
<p>After triad, the court rendered judgment ordering petitioners to vacate the 
premises, to pay respondents, jointly and severally, the sum of P400.00 as the 
value of their share in the produce of the land, the sum of P1,000.00 as monthly 
rental from July 1, 1957 until possession is restored, and the sum of P200.00 as 
attorney's fees. </p>
<p>Petitioners appealed to the Court of First Instance of Cebu where they filed 
a motion to dismiss the case on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction to 
try it because under Itcp. Act No. 1199, all cases involving the ejectment of a 
tenant by the landlord shall be within the original and exclusive jurisdiction 
of the Court of Agrarian Relations. The respondent judge, however, denied the 
motion in 'his order dated July 7. 1958. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, as petitioners failed to pay the monthly rental fixed by the 
Justice of the Peace Court of Naga since August 1958, upon motion of 
respondents, respondent judge issued a writ of execution, and on July 7, 1950, 
respondents filed a motion to declare petitioners in contempt of court for their 
refusal to comply with said writ. The respondent court, however, postponed 
action thereon until after the trial of the case on the merits. </p>
<p>After the respondents had presenter all their evidence, petitioners again 
moved for the dismissal of the action upon the same ground. This was also denied 
by the respondent judge on March 31, 1960, as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The motion to dismiss filed by the defendants on the ground of lack of 
jurisdiction of this Court for this case belongs to the Court of Agrarian 
Relations not being well founded for the real issues involved in this case is 
ownership as can be gleaned from the pleadings, said motion to dismiss is hereby 
denied." </p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioners moved for a reconsideration of the above-quoted order on the 
ground that if the real issue involved in this case was "ownership" as held in 
the order aforesaid then the case should be dismissed because the Justice of the 
Peace Court of Naga had no jurisdiction over the case. Upon denial by the 
respondent judge of said motio in for reconsideration, the petition for 
certiorari before Us was commenced. </p>
<p>On the basis of the allegations made in the complaint filed in the Justice of 
the Peace Court of Naga, Cebu, the action instituted was for the ejectment of 
petitioners from the land that they were cultivating as tenants of respondents. 
Should the allegations made in their answer be taken into account, the resulting 
issue laid before said court necessarily involved the question of ownership over 
said land because, while the complaint asserted that respondents were the owners 
thereof, said answer averred that petitioners were the owners. </p>
<p>It is obvious that whether the real issue laid before the court of origin was 
the ejectment of a tenant or ownership over the laid they were cultivating, said 
court had no jurisdiction. If it was the first issue that was involved, 
jurisdiction was with the Court of Agrarian Relations, while it was the Court of 
First Instance of Cebu who had jurisdiction over the question of title. </p>
<p>Such being the case the conclusion becomes inescapable that the proceedings 
had in the court of origin being void for lack of jurisdiction, the Court of 
First Instance could not exercise appellate jurisdiction over the case. </p>
<p>True, the case was partially tried in the Court of First Instance, but it 
must be observed that petitioners raised the question of lack of jurisdiction 
seasonably, not only in the court of origin but also in the Court of First 
Instance in the latter court, twice: first, by motion to dismiss before trial, 
and afterwards by a similar motion after respondents had closed their case. It 
cannot be said therefore that they had given their consent to the case being 
taken up by the Court of First Instance of Cebu in the exercise of its original 
jurisdiction as authorized under the provisions of Rule 40, Section 11 of the 
Rules of Court. </p>
<p>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the petition under consideration is granted and the 
writ of certiorari prayed for therein is ordered issued. As a result, the orders 
complained of, dated July 7, 1958, March 81, 1960 and May 7 of the same year are 
set aside. With cost against respondents. </p>
