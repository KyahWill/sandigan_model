<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is an appeal by the Republic 
of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> from the decision of the Court 
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental declaring 
petitioner Felix Tan qualified for admission to Philippine citizenship. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The records show that all 
requirements to confer jurisdiction on the court below to hear the petition had 
been complied with. The evidence shows that the petitioner is a subject of the 
Republic of Nationalist China under whose laws Filipinos may be granted the 
right to become naturalized citizens; that the petitioner was born on February 
25, 1932, in the City of <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span>; that the 
petitioner is still unmarried; that since birth he had never gone to China; that 
he speaks and writes the English language and the <span class="SpellE">Visayan-Cebuano</span> dialect; that lie does not own any real 
estate in the Philippines; that tie acquired his elementary, secondary and first 
year college education in the public schools and in private schools recognized 
by the Government and not limited to any race or nationality and wherein 
Philippine history, government and civics are part of their curricula; that the 
petition was regularly employed as a salesman in the Sin <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> <span class="SpellE">Huat</span> Store in the City of 
<span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span> from which derived annual salaries amounting 
to Pl,560 in 1958, P1,680 in 1959 and Pl,740 in 1960 with free subsistence and 
lodging estimated to be valued at P50.00 a month. <span class="GramE">petitioner</span> declared that in 1961 when the hearing of petition 
for admission to Philippine citizenship was he was earning P180.00 a month. The 
evidence further shows that the petitioner hart been regularly paying his 
personal taxes and he had no tax liability with the Government; that he was duly 
registered as an alien and been paying the registration fees <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>; that he is in good health and is not suffering 
from any incurable or contagious disease; that corresponding clearance 
certificates were issued by different government officers m his favor, 
certifying to his good and irreproachable character and that he had never been 
accused nor convicted of any crime involving moral turpitude; that he had been 
giving contributions to civic and religious organizations; that the petitioner 
believes in the principles underlying the Philippine Constitution; that he had 
been conducting himself in a proper and irreproachable manner during the entire 
period of his residence in the Philippines; that he had been mingling freely and 
associating socially with the Filipinos; that he is not opposed to organized 
government nor is he affiliated with any associations or group of persons who 
uphold and teach doctrines opposed to organized governments; that he is not 
defending or teaching the necessity or propriety of violence, personal assaults 
or assassination for the success and predominance of man's ideas; that he is not 
a polygamist nor a believer in the practice thereof; that it is his intention in 
good faith to become a citizen of the Philippines and for that matter he 
renounces all the allegiance and fidelity that he had to any foreign 
sovereignty, particularly to the Republic of Nationalist China, of which he is a 
citizen or subject; that he had resided continuously to the Philippines from the 
date of the filing of his petition for naturalization and would reside therein 
up to and after the time of his admission to Philippine citizenship. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After hearing, the lower court 
declared that the petitioner has all the qualifications and none of the 
disqualifications under Philippine laws lo become a Philippine citizen by 
naturalization, and it thereby ordered that naturalization certificate be issued 
to him after the expiration of two years from the promulgation of the decision 
upon satisfactory proof that he had complied with requisites prescribed by 
Republic Act 530. In the present appeal, the Solicitor General, in behalf of the 
Republic of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, maintains that the lower court 
erred in finding that the petitioner has all 'the qualifications and none of the 
disqualifications to become a Philippine citizen by naturalization. The 
Solicitor General particularly points out that the petitioner does not have a 
lucrative trade or profession, which is one of the conditions required by law 
for aliens to be admitted to Philippine citizenship. As a matter of fact, .the 
city Attorney of <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span> City, in representation .of 
the Solicitor General, had opposed the petition in the lower court precisely on 
the ground that the petitioner did not have a lucrative trade or profession. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Considering the salary received 
by the petitioner during the three years prior to the hearing of this case, that 
is, P1<span class="GramE">,560.00</span> in 1958, P1,680.00 in 1959, P1,740.00 in 
1960, or an average of P1,660.00 a year during the said three years, it results 
that the petitioner had an average monthly .salary in the sum of P138.00 during 
the three years prior to the hearing of this case. At the hearing, which took 
place on September 7, 1961, an <span class="SpellE">unsworn</span> statement of 
Tan <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> Eng, who claimed to be the manager of Chin 
<span class="SpellE">Shu</span> <span class="SpellE">Huat</span> Store, was 
presented; and in said certificate it was stated that the petitioner was 
employed in the said v store as salesman with the salary of P180.00 a month 
Â»with free board and lodging. This Tan <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> Eng was 
.not presented as a witness. The Solicitor General maintains that the 
certificate of Tan <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> Eng is a very unreliable piece 
of evidence to prove that the petitioner was receiving a salary of P180.00 a 
month with free board and lodging. We agree with the Solicitor General that it 
was not satisfactorily established that the petitioner was receiving a salary of 
P180.00 a month. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On the basis of the highest 
salary received by the petitioner during the three years prior to the hearing of 
this case, which was P1,740.00 a year in 1960, it can be said that his monthly 
salary as of the time he filed his petition for citizenship on January 23, 1961 
was P145.00 a month. If to this monthly salary of P145.00 is added the free 
board and lodging at the rate of P50.00 a month, then it may be said that the 
highest monthly income of the petitioner was around P195.00 a month. The 
petitioner did not own any real property <span class="GramE">or</span> had other 
source of income. The petitioner had not filed any income tax return but he had 
paid additional residence taxes on the basis of his yearly income for the years 
1958, 1959 and 1960. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Lucrative employment means a 
gainful employment. It is not only that the person having the employment gets 
enough for his ordinary necessities in life. It must be shown that the 
employment gives one an income such that there is an appreciable margin of his 
income over his expenses as to be able to provide for an adequate support in the 
event of unemployment, sickness, or disability to work and thus avoid one's 
becoming the object of charity or a public charge. We believe that the 
petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> in the present case, who earns 
only around P145.00 a month with a free board and lodging estimated to cost 
P60.00 a month, does not have an employment that is lucrative enough as to 
consider him not subject to the hazards of penury in the event of unemployment, 
sickness or disability. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Considering the high cost of 
living that has been prevailing, which cost of living has tended to increase 
rather than decrease, and the low buying power of the Philippine currency, this 
Court has in recent decisions adopted a higher standard in determining whether a 
petitioner for Philippine citizenship has a lucrative trade or profession that 
would qualify him for admission to Philippine citizenship. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the case of 
<span class="SpellE">Koh</span> Chet alias <span class="SpellE">Hianchit</span> S. 
Chua <i>vs</i>. Republic of the 
</span></span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, G.R.

1964</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
this Court denied the petition for Philippine citizen- ship of the petitioner 
who was single and had an employment as a purchaser and salesman in the store of 
his mother with a monthly salary of P200.00. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the case of Alberto <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Lin Chuan vs. Republic of the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, L-18550, Feb. 28, 1964, the 
petitioner for Philippine citizenship was single and was employed at the Cosmos 
Industrial Company with a salary of P200.00 a month with free board and lodging. 
This Court held that the petitioner did not have a lucrative trade or profession 
that would qualify him for admission to Philippine citizenship. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The situation of the 
petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> in the present case, as far as 
income is concerned, is not any better than that of the petitioners in the two 
cases that <span class="GramE">We</span> have mentioned in the two preceding 
paragraphs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the decision appealed from is
