				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The question presented for determination in this petition for the
review of a decision of the Court of Tax Appeals, one that is of first
impression, would not have arisen had respondent <span class="SpellE">Itogon-Suyoc</span>
Mines, Inc., the taxpayer involved, duly paid in full its liability according
to its income tax return for the fiscal year 1960-61.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, it deducted right away the amount
represented by a claim for refund filed eight (8) months back, for the previous
year's income tax, for which it was not liable at all, so it alleged, as it
suffered a loss instead, a claim subsequently favorably acted on by petitioner
Commissioner of Internal Revenue but after the date of such payment of the
1960-1961 tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, an interest
in the amount of P1,512.83 was charged by petitioner Commissioner of Internal
Revenue on the sum withheld on the ground that no deduction on such refund
should be allowed before its approval.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the matter was taken up before the Court of Tax Appeals, the above
assessment representing interest was set aside in the decision of <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is the decision now on appeal by petitioner
Commissioner of Internal Revenue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
sustain the Court of Tax Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Itogon-Suyoc</span> Mines, Inc., a
mining corporation duly organized and existing in accordance with the laws of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
filed on <st1:date year="1961" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1961</st1:date>,
its income tax return for the fiscal year 1959-1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It declared a taxable income of P114,368.04
and a tax due thereon amounting to P26,310.41, for which it paid on the same
day, the amount of P13,155.20 as the first installment of the income tax
due.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1961</st1:date>, petitioner filed an amended income tax
return, reporting therein a net loss of P331,707.33.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It thus sought a refund from the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue, now the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1962</st1:date>,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Itogon-Suyoc</span> Mines, Inc. filed its income
tax return for the fiscal year 1960-1961, setting forth its income tax
liability to the tune of P97,345.00, but deducting the amount of P13,155.20
representing alleged tax credit for overpayment of the preceding fiscal year 1959-1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="12">December
 18, 1962</st1:date>, petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed
against the respondent the amount of P1,512.83 as 1% monthly interest on the
aforesaid amount of P13,155.20 from <st1:date year="1962" day="16" month="1">January
 16, 1962</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="12">December 31,
 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The basis for such an
assessment was the absence of legal right to deduct said amount before the
refund or tax credit thereof was approved by petitioner Commissioner of
Internal Revenue.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Such an assessment was contested by respondent before the Court
of Tax Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already noted, it
prevailed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1965</st1:date>, now on appeal,
explains why.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Respondent assessed against the
petitioner the amount of P1,512.83 as 1% monthly interest on the sum of
P13,155.20 from January 16, 1962 to December 31, 1962 on the ground that
petitioner had no legal right to deduct the said amount from its income tax
liability for the fiscal year 1960-1961 until the refund or tax credit thereof
has been approved by respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, petitioner paid the amount of P13,155.20 as
first installment on its reported income tax liability for the fiscal year
1959-1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, it turned out that
instead of deriving a net gain, it sustained a net loss during the said fiscal
year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, it filed an amended
income tax return and a claim for the refund of the sum of P13,155.20, which
sum it subsequently deducted from its income tax liability for the succeeding
fiscal year 1960-1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The overpayment
for the fiscal year 1959-1960 and the deduction of the overpaid amount from its
1960-1961 tax liability are not denied by respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this circumstance, we find it unfair and
unjust for the Commissioner to exact an interest on the said sum of P13,155.20,
which, after all, was paid to and received by the government even before the
incidence of the tax in question."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">That is the question before us in this petition for review by the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
argues that the Court of Tax Appeals should not have absolved respondent
corporation "from liability to pay the sum of P1,512.83 as 1% monthly
interest for delinquency in the payment of income tax for the fiscal year
1960-1961."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
As noted at the outset, we find such contention far from persuasive.</p>

<p class="BODY">It could not be error for the Court of Tax Appeals, consider­ing
the admitted fact of overpayment, entitling respondent to refund, to hold that
petitioner should not impose an interest on the aforesaid sum of P13,155.20
"which after all was paid to and received by the government even before
the incidence of the tax in question." It would be, according to the Court
of Tax Appeals, "unfair and unjust" to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree but we go farther.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The imposition of such an interest by
petitioner is not supported by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The National Internal Revenue Code provides that interest upon
the amount determined as a deficiency shall be assessed and shall be paid upon
notice and demand from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue at the rate therein
specified.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
It is made clear, however, in an earlier provision found in the same section
that if in any preceding year, the taxpayer was entitled to a refund of any
amount due as tax, such amount, if not yet refunded, may be deducted from the
tax to be paid.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question respondent was entitled to a refund.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of waiting for the sum involved to be
delivered to it, it deducted the said amount from the tax that it had to
pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That it had a right to do according
to the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true a doubt could
have arisen due to the fact that as of the time such a deduction was made, the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue had not as yet approved such a refund.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an admitted fact though that respondent
was clearly entitled to it, and petitioner did not allege otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor could he do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under all the circumstances disclosed
therefore, the applicability of the legal provision allow­ing such a deduction
from the amount of the tax to be paid cannot be disputed.</p>

<p class="BODY">This conclusion is in accordance with the principle announced in
Castro v. Collector of Internal Revenue.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
While the case is not directly in point, it yields an implication that makes
even more formidable the case for respondent taxpayer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As there held, the imposition of the monthly
interest was considered as not constituting a penalty "but a just
compensation to the state for the delay in paying the tax, and for the
concomitant use by the taxpayer of funds that rightfully should be in the
government's hands * * *."</p>

<p class="BODY">What is therefore sought to be avoided is for the taxpayer to
make use of funds that should have been paid to the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, in view of the overpayment for the
fiscal year 1959-1960, the sum of <span style="">P13,155.</span>20
had already formed part of the public funds.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It cannot be said, therefore, that respondent taxpayer was guilty of any
delay enabling it to utilize a sum of money that should have been in the
government treasury.</p>

<p class="BODY">How then, as a matter of pure law, even if we lay to one side the
demands of fairness and justice, which to the Court of Tax Appeals seem to be
uppermost, can its decision be overturned?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, we find no valid ground for this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1965</st1:date> of the Court of Tax Appeals is
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without pronouncement as to
costs.</p>
