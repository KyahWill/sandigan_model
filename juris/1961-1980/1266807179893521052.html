<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is a petition to review a 
decision of the Court of Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The facts are set forth clearly 
hi the decision under review, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"It appears that the petitioners, 
<span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> Unsay and Antonia <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>, together with Marta Mendoza, <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> <span class="SpellE">Nonato</span> and Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>, and respondents <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> 
Diaz and David <span class="SpellE">Liwanag</span> were defendants and plaintiff's 
respectively, in Civil Case No. 2798 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>. This action was for the collection of a certain sum 
of money and to enforce a right of usufruct over certain parcels of land located 
in the municipalities of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Cainta</span>, province of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>. The 
defendants resisted that action on the ground that as the right of usufruct 
claimed by the plaintiffs was not noted on the Torrens certificate of title 
covering the property and defendants <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> Unsay and 
Antonia <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span> were purchasers for value and in good 
faith, the latter were not obligated to recognize said right. After trial, in 
which the parties were given ample opportunity to substantiate their respective 
contentions, the trial court rendered judgment ordering, among other things, 
that the defendants deliver to the plaintiffs the possession of the land 
involved in the action for the duration of the tatter's right of usufruct 
thereon. From this judgment, only defendants Marta Mendoza and <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> <span class="SpellE">Nonato</span> appealed. The other 
defendants, including the petitioners herein, did not appeal. Instead, the 
petitioners on January 14, 1960, or almost five months after the judgment 
rendered in the case had Income final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> as 
regards them, filed a motion to dismiss the action on the ground that the trial 
court had acted, not only in excess, but without jurisdiction in <span class="GramE">rendering</span> said judgment, as their title to be land free of 
all encumbrances is indefeasible and could not be stacked collaterally. This 
motion was denied by the respondent Judge. A motion for a reconsideration of 
said order was likewise denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"On March 8, 1960, the respondent 
Judge, upon motion, issued a writ for the execution of judgment in so far as it 
concerned the petitioners, ordering the provincial sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> to eject the latter from the parcels of land involved 
in the action for the duration of the right of usufruct thereon of respondents 
<span class="SpellE">Feliza</span> Diaz and David <span class="SpellE">Liwanag</span>. Informed of the issuance of this writ, the 
petitioners filed on March 9, 1960, a motion asking that said writ be quashed, 
alleging that the judgment had not yet become final as regards them, because 
defendants Maria Mendoza and <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> <span class="SpellE">Nonato</span> had appealed <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> and 
said appeal had the effect of suspending the finality of said judgment as 
regards all the defendants. This motion was likewise denied by the respondent 
Judge in an order dated March 16, 1960. Served with notice of the order of 
denial of their motion, petitioners filed another motion asking that, instead of 
ejecting <span class="GramE">them</span> from the lands, respondents <span class="SpellE">Feliza</span> Diaz and <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> <span class="SpellE">Nonato</span> be ordered to receive from them the amount of P30.00 
a month during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the case on appeal. 
This motion was likewise denied by the respondent Judge. <span class="GramE">xxx</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioners then went to the 
Court of Appeals oh a petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction 
seeking to annul the order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> denying dismissal of the action and also the order 
denying the motion to quash execution. The appellate court, however, dismissed 
the petition, finding both requests to be without merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">For simplification, <span class="GramE">We</span> shall discuss the errors assigned in only two questions, 
namely, (1) whether or not the action filed in the Court of First Instance 
(Civil Case No.2798) may be dismissed; and (2) the propriety of execution with 
respect to the defendants who did not appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As found correctly by the appeals 
court, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> had 
jurisdiction over the person and the subject matter of the action. In the first 
places the action is merely an ordinary one to collect a sum of money and to 
enforce a right of usufruct on certain parcel of land situated in the said 
province of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, and moreover, the parties thereto 
were duly served with summons. It may be possible, it is true, that the 
defendants in that action have set up as their defense the existence of a 
Torrens Certificate of Title which would show or prove their ownership over the 
land in question and wherein there appears no annotation as to any usufruct, but 
this defense alone does not alter the nature of the action filed and does not, 
therefore, divest the trial court of its jurisdiction thereon. It is difficult 
to see how the complaint here to enforce the right of usufruct would constitute 
a collateral attack against the indefeasible title to the property in 
question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">For the above reasons, we do not 
see any plausibility of setting aside the decision of the trial court on the 
ground of lack and/or in excess of jurisdiction. Parenthetically, it is worthy 
to note from respondents' brief that from the very start of the proceedings in 
the court of origin, there never were invoked by herein petitioners (defendants 
therein) the defenses of lack of jurisdiction, <span class="SpellE">res</span> 
<span class="SpellE">judicata</span> nor indefeasibility of title—which defenses 
they have raised in the Court of Appeals and here again. As a matter of fact, 
according to the respondents, the alleged title claimed by the defendants to 
cover the property was never presented during the trial.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Of course, <span class="GramE">We</span> are not here, for the present and under the instant 
proceedings, to decide on the tenability of the defense thus raised. That 
question is properly the subject of appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As to the second point, 
jurisprudence on the matter has established that—<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">“Whether an 
appeal by one of several judgment debtors will affect the liability of those who 
did not appeal, must depend upon the facts in each particular 
case.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> If the 
judgment can only be sustained upon the liability of the one who appeals, and 
the liability of the other judgment debtors solely depends upon the question 
whether or not the appellant is liable, and the judgment is revoked as to that 
appellant, then the result of his appeal will inure to the benefit of all. Where 
the liability of each judgment debtor is several, arid one appeals only, the 
judgment on appeal will not affect those who did not appeal." <span class="GramE">( Municipality</span> of Orion vs. <span class="SpellE">Concha</span>, 
50 Phil. 679)<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioners herein are sued for 
the collection of a sum of money and upon the basis of a contract of usufruct 
supposed to have been entered into between their co-defendants and the 
plaintiffs. As already stated, the defense set up is that there was no 
annotation of any such usufruct on the title issued in their names and that they 
were purchasers for value and in good faith of the property under litigation. 
The right of any of the defendants to retain the property would depend upon the 
holding on the appellate court on the tenability of such defense raised by them. 
In other words, the defense is not personal to any or some of the defendants—it 
would apply to all. As the ruling is reiterated, "if the judgment can only be 
sustained upon the liability of the one who appeals and the liability of the 
other judgment debtors solely depends upon the question whether or not the 
appellant is liable and the judgment is revoked as to that appellant, then the 
result of his appeal will inure to the benefit of all.” Exactly the same 
situation as described in this quotation is found to be obtaining in our case 
and therefore, <span class="GramE">We</span> fell that execution on the holding as 
to the usufruct, pending appeal by some of the defendants, should not issue 
against the other defendants who did not appeal (Petitioners 
herein).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Since the record of the aforesaid 
civil case has not been forwarded to this Court, there is nothing before us to 
clarify whether or not there was a pronouncement on part of the trial court that 
the defendants are liable for the sum of money claimed from, them, and whether 
of not their liability, if any, would be several. No mention of this aspect of 
the case has been discussed either in the petition, in the briefs, or even in 
the decision of the Court of Appeals affirming the orders of the lower court. 
such a case, our holding on the matter would be in that if the judgment of the 
trial court condemns defendants, severally, to pay the plaintiffs a sum of 
money, then this part of said judgment may be executed with respect to the 
herein petitioners (defendants therein who did not 
appeal).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In conformity with the above 
pronouncements, the decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby modified in that 
the order of execution issued against petitioners requiring them to deliver 
possession of the land in question is hereby annulled. Be it understood, 
however, that execution may issue as to the money judgment, if any, and if held 
to be several- In all other respects the decision appealed from is affirmed. No 
costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
