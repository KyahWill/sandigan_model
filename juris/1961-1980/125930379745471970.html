				G.R. No. L-18826, December 17, 1966</h4>
				<H3>ANTONIO Y. MAYUGA, PETITIONER-APPELLANT, VS. CESAR R. MARAVILLA, JUSTICE OF THE PEACE OF THE MUNICIPALITY OF ODIONGAN AND AQUILINO GALLOMOSA, RESPONDENTS-APPELLEES.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.P., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align=""><div align="justify"><br><p>On March 22, 1960, Aquilino Galloraosa, through then acting Provincial Fiscal 
Edmundo Ruado, filed before the Justice of the Peace of Odiongan, Romblon an 
information (Criminal Case No. 4720) against Antonio Mayuga, charging him of 
Homicide Through Reckless Imprudence, alleging that he failed to remove an 
intestinal pack (rolled gauze) from the surgical opening which he, as a medical 
practitioner, made in a cesarean operation on Gallomosa's wife, Avelina 
Gallomosa, causing infection and leading to her death on December 8, 1956.</p>
<p>After conducting a preliminary <i>examination</i>, the Justice of the Peace, 
Cesar Maravilla, found that a prima facie case existed and ordered Mayuga's 
arrest.</p>
<p>Before the preliminary <i>investigation</i>, Mayuga, on August 30, 1960 moved 
to quash the information on the ground that the accompanying annexes and oral 
testimonies made in the preliminary examination conducted by the Justice of the 
Peace were all hearsay and insufficient to establish a prima facie case.</p>
<p>When the Justice of the Peace after due hearing denied the motion to quash as 
well as subsequent motions for reconsideration as being without merit, the 
accused on November 20, 1960 petitioned for certiorari before the Court of First 
Instance of Romblon alleging grave abuse of discretion on the part of the 
Justice of the Peace and seeking the annulment of his orders and the dismissal 
of the information.</p>
<p>On January 21, 1961 the Court of First Instance issued an order dismissing 
the petition for lack of merit and directed the Justice of the Peace to continue 
with the <i>preliminary investigation</i> of Criminal Case No. 4720.</p>
<p>After denial on February 8, 1961 of motion for reconsideration the accused 
appealed the order of dismissal to the Court of Appeals. The latter however 
certified the case to Us on questions of law: (1) Was the Court of First 
Instance in error in upholding the actuations of the Justice of the Peace? (2) 
Was the outright dismissal of the petition for certiorari also an error?</p>
<p>Appellant objects to the following, as insufficient basis for the existence 
of a prima facie case:</p>
<p>1) Exhibit A—an allegedly unsigned, unauthenticated and unidentified true 
copy of a purported autopsy report issued by Dr. Perpetua Penales on March 4, 
1957. She was not presented for cross examination.</p>
<p>2) Exhibit B—a certificate stating that Avelina Gallomosa died on December 8, 
1956 signed by the Municipal Treasurer, whose signature was not identified.</p>
<p>3) Exhibit C—a partly accomplished, unsigned and unattested form of 
certificate of death of the Bureau of Health later substituted by a photostatic 
copy marked as Exhibit C-1.</p>
<p>4) The testimonies of the deceased's husband Aquilino Gallomosa, Sancho 
Pargao, rural health nurse who attended during the autopsy, and Dr. Godofredo 
Fatalla, incumbent Municipal Health Officer.</p>
<p>Appellant should bear in mind that a preliminary <i>examination</i> such as 
was conducted by the Justice of the Peace has for its purpose only the 
determination of whether a crime has been committed and whether there is 
probable cause to believe the accused guilty thereof,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and if so, the issuance of a warrant of 
arrest. And it should not be forgotten that a preliminary<em> investigation</em> 
has two stages:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> First, a preliminary 
examination of the complainant and his witnesses prior to the arrest of the 
accused;<sup><sub><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</span></sub></sup> and, second, the reading to the accused after his arrest of the 
complaint or information filed against him, and his being informed of the 
substance of the evidence against him, after which he is allowed to present 
evidence in his favor, if he desires.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
Probable cause, in regard to the first stage of preliminary investigation, 
depends on the discretion of the Judge or magistrate empowered to issue the 
warrant of arrest. It suffices that facts are presented to him to convince him, 
not that a person has committed the crime, but that there is probable cause to 
believe that such person committed the crime charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The proceeding is generally ex parte<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> unless the defendant desires to be present 
and while under the old Rules the Justice of the Peace or investigating officer 
must take the testimony of the complainant and the latter's witnesses under 
oath, only the testimony of the complainant shall be in writing and only an 
abstract or brief .statement of the substance of the testimony of the other is 
required.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Regarding preliminary 
investigation, it has thus been ruled that "the occasion is not for the full and 
exhaustive display of the parties' evidence; it is for the presentation of such 
evidence only as may engender well-grounded belief that an offense has been 
committed and that the accused is probably guilty thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Accordingly, it has been ruled that "a 
justice of the peace court is not prohibited by any law "from reaching the 
conclusion that "probable cause" exists from the statement of the prosecuting 
attorney alone or any other person whose statement or affidavit is entitled to 
credit in the opinion of the judge or magistrate.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></p>
<p>We note that aside from the above-enumerated documentary evidence alleged to 
be hearsay, there are testimonies of witnesses and also the affidavits of the 
complaining witness Aquilino Gallomosa and of Dr. Perpetua Penales, attached to 
the petition for certiorari as annexes A and B, respectively. These testimonies 
alone even excluding said documents alleged to be hearsay evidence, under the 
rules then applicable and the jurisprudence, are sufficient to uphold the 
conclusion of the Justice of the Peace in his finding that a prima facie case 
existed. In fact We find that in looking into the matters objected to as 
inadmissible and insufficient, the Justice of the Peace did more than that 
required to form his conclusion, an act commendable of him in his efforts to 
clear his mind of doubts in forming his opinion which the Court of First 
Instance correctly upheld.</p>
<p>Appellant further argues that under Section 6 of Rule 67, now Section 6 of 
Rule 65, Rules of Court, a petition for certiorari, once sufficient in form and 
substance, should be answered and the Court of First Instance should have 
required the Justice of the Peace to do so before dismissing the petition. 
Suffice it to observe that precisely in this case the petition is deficient in 
substance. And as held in Arvisu v. Vergara, 90 Phil. 621, 623-623: "On 
principle, dismissal (of a petition for certiorari) would also be proper if 
before answer is filed, the attention of the court is called to the fact that 
from its own allegations the petition appears to be without merit."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of dismissal appealed from is hereby affirmed and 
respondent Justice of the Peace is directed to proceed with the preliminary 
investigation of Criminal Case No. 4720, with costs against the appellant.</p>
<p><b>SO ORDERED.</b></p><em>Concepcion, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Dizon,
