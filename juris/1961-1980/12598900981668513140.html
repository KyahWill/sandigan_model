				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from a resolution of the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental 
granting a motion of plaintiffs Florencia M. Guanco and Celso S. Guanco, for the 
dismissal of the second and third counterclaims in the amended answer of 
defendant Nicolas Monteblanco and dismissing said counterclaims.
<p>Said plaintiffs are husband and wife, whereas defendant Segundo Monteblanco 
is the father of plaintiff Florencia M. Guanco. Plaintiffs' complaint set up 
several causes of action, some against defendant Segundo Monteblanco, others 
against defendant Nicolas Monteblanco, and the rest against both. The defendant 
filed separate answers and amended answers. The amended answer of Segundo 
Monteblanco admitted some allegations of the complaint, denied other allegations 
thereof, alleged some affirmative defenses and set up a counterclaim, with 
several causes of action. The amended answer of Nicolas Monteblanco, likewise, 
admitted some allegations of the complaint, denied1 other allegations thereof, 
and set up three (3) counterclaims. Plaintiffs moved for the dismissal of the 
second and third counterclaims of Nicolas Monteblanco, which was granted by the 
lower court. Hence, this appeal by said defendant.</p>
<p>Although both parties have, in their respective briefs, merely discussed the 
merits of the resolution granting said motion to dismiss, this appeal cannot be 
entertained, for the simple reason that said resolution is interlocutory in 
nature, and, hence, its review should be deferred until after the disposition of 
the main case, which does not appear to have been heard as yet. The necessity of 
not passing upon the merits of said resolution becomes more apparent when we 
consider that the issues raised in the second and third counterclaims of Nicolas 
Monteblanco are interwoven with the main issues raised in plaintiff's complaint 
and the amended answer filed by defendant Segundo Monteblanco (Caldera 
<i>vs</i>. Balcueba, 84 Phil., 304, 305; Quimosin <i>vs</i>. Javien, L-2968, 
resolution of July 19, 1949).</p>
<p>Indeed, plaintiffs seek in their complaint: (1) the partition of the conjugal 
partnership of Segundo Monteblanco and his deceased wife Concepcion Benedicto, 
mother of Florencia M. Guaneo, which allegedly continued under the 
administration of Segundo Monteblanco; (2) an accounting thereof; (3) the 
delivery of several parcels of land the possession of which is said to have been 
forcibly taken by Segundo Monteblanco from the plaintiffs; (4) the recovery of 
damages allegedly suffered by them in consequence thereof, aside from attorney's 
fees; (5) the reconveyance to the plaintiffs of certain sugar quotas allegedly 
belonging to them and said to have been fraudulently and simulatedly transferred 
by Segundo Monteblanco to Nicolas Monteblanco, after both had caused the 
registration of said quotas in plaintiffs' name to be cancelled in the 
corresponding central; (6) the registration of said quotas in the name of the 
plaintiffs; (7) the recovery of P4,350 claimed to have been paid by plaintiffs 
to Segundo Monteblanco in consideration of his alleged promise to disclaim any 
interest in said quotas, which he did not fulfill; (8) the recovery from Nicolas 
Monteblanco of P10,000 as moral and exemplary damages caused by the 
aforementioned acts said to have been performed by Segundo Monteblanco upon: the 
advice of Nicolas Monteblanco, who is allegedly the illegitimate son of Segundo 
Monteblanco; (9) the recovery from Segundo Monteblanco of one-half of the price 
of two (2) lots of the aforesaid conjugal partnership allegedly sold by him; 
(10) the recovery of a lot said to have been held by Segundo Monteblanco in 
trust for the plaintiffs and allegedly conveyed by him fraudulently and 
fictitiously to Nicolas Monteblanco; and (11) the appointment of a receiver of 
the properties above referred to, in order to forestall further manipulations of 
the defendants to defraud the plaintiffs and to insure the proper management of 
said properties, which Segundo Monteblanco is not in a position to undertake due 
to "old age and physical handicap."</p>
<p>Upon the other hand, Segundo Monteblanco alleged in his amended answer, 
<i>inter alia</i>, that, since the death of his wife, the properties belonging 
to their conjugal partnership and some of his exclusive properties were 
administered by the plaintiffs; that the property to which plaintiffs' third 
cause of action refers belongs, not to them, but to him; that the sugar quotas 
alluded to in the complaint are his exclusive property and the conveyance 
thereof to Nicolas Monteblanco was made for a consideration actually paid by 
him; that certain properties of Segundo Monteblanco were mortgaged to secure a 
loan for a given venture of the plaintiffs; that the latter administered said 
properties and saw to it that the mortgage be foreclosed; that plaintiffs, 
subsequently, secured in their favor a promise to sell from the mortgagee, which 
had acquired said properties at the auction sale, and, then, fraudulently 
conveyed their rights to a relative of plaintiff Celso S. Guanco, thus depriving 
Segundo Monteblanco of his aforementioned properties; that Nicolas Monteblanco 
is not his offspring, but the legitimate son of the deceased Nicolas Sian Sr., 
who left the child under his (Segundo Monteblanco's) custody; that Nicolas Sian 
Sr., likewise, left his properties under the care of Segundo Monteblanco, in 
trust and for the benefit of Nicolas Monteblanco; and that, in order to help the 
plaintiffs extricate themselves from some financial difficulties they had before 
the war, particularly in connection with the purchase of an Hacienda Fidela, 
certain crop loan deficits and some time loan accounts, Segundo Monteblanco sold 
the aforementioned properties, held by him in trust and for the benefit of 
Nicolas Monteblanco, and applied the proceeds thereof to the payment of said 
obligations of plaintiffs herein.</p>
<p>Segundo Monteblanco prayed therefore: (<i>a</i>) that plaintiffs be sentenced 
to render accounts of their administration of said conjugal estate and of his 
own properties, and to reconvey to him his properties which were illegally 
acquired by them from the mortgagee thereof, as well as to pay moral damages, 
exemplary damages and attorney's fees; (<i>b</i>) that the Hacienda Fidela be 
placed under receivership <i>pendente lite</i>; (<i>c</i>) that plaintiffs be 
ordered to reconvey said Hacienda to Nicolas Sian Jr. (Nicolas Monteblanco) in 
consideration of the purchase price thereof, which was paid with proceeds of the 
properties held by Segundo Monteblanco in trust and for the benefit of said 
Nicolas Sian Jr. (or Nicolas Monteblanco), or else, to pay him the amount of 
said proceeds, with interest thereon, as well as the amount of the other 
obligations of the plaintiffs paid with proceeds of said properties.</p>
<p>The allegations in plaintiffs' complaint and in the amended answer of 
defendant Segundo Monteblanco regarding the nature of the relations between 
Segundo Monteblanco and Nicolas Sian, Jr. or Nicolas Monteblanco, gave occasion 
for the latter's counterclaims. In the first counterclaim of Nicolas 
Monteblanco, he sought moral and exemplary damages for the injury caused by the 
allegation that he is an illegitimate son of Segundo Monteblanco, despite the 
alleged knowledge of the plaintiffs that he (Nicolas Sian, Jr. or Nicolas 
Monteblanco) is the son of the spouses Nicolas Sian, Sr. and Rosario 
Velasco.</p>
<p>By way of second cause of action, Nicolas Monteblanco alleged that <i>"with 
the full knowledge of plaintiffs regarding the existing * * * trust"</i> and 
"with the understanding" that Segundo Monteblanco "would sell the properties 
held in trust for Nicolas Sian Jr. (Nicolas Monteblanco) so that with the 
proceeds of the purchase" (sale) "thereof he would purchase, as in effect he did 
purchase * * * the said Hacienda Pidela and in the meantime place it in the name 
of plaintiff Celso S. Guanco and his wife"; that for such "purpose, with the 
proceeds of the sale of the trust properties" Segundo Monteblanco "paid the 
amount of about twenty-five thousand pesos in payment of the price of 'Hda. 
Fidela' and other amounts totalling about fourteen thousand pesos * * *"; and 
"that in doing this, the defendant Segundo Monteblanco acted in the belief as 
<i>he was assured by Celso S. Guanco upon demand at any time, he would deliver 
the property purchased with the trust funds (Hda. Fidela) to the beneficiary 
thereof, who is no other than Nicolas Monteblanco"</i>.</p>
<p>The third counterclaim of Nicolas Monteblanco refers to other sums of money, 
taken from the proceeds of the sale of said properties of the Sians, allegedly 
applied by Segundo Monteblaneo to the satisfaction of other monetary obligations 
of the plaintiffs, as set forth in the amended answer of Segundo 
Monteblanco.</p>
<p>Insofar as the appeal before us is concerned, the allegations of the 
complaint and of the two (2) amended answers adverted to above offer the 
following salient features, namely:</p>
<ol><li>Plaintiffs, according to the defendants, were <i>aware of the fideicomisary 
character of the funds applied by Segundo Monteblanco</i> to the satisfaction of 
their (plaintiffs') debts, and Segundo Monteblanco did so, according to Nicolas 
Monteblanco, <i>upon the assurance of plaintiff Celso S. Guanco that "upon 
demand at any time he would, deliver the property purchased with the trust 
funds</i> (Hda. Fidela) to the beneficiary thereof, who is no other than Nicolas 
Monteblanco". It is thus difficult to understand why the lower court found, in 
the resolution appealed from, that Nicolas Monteblanco had a cause of action 
against Segundo Monteblanco only, not against the plaintiffs. 

</li><li>The second and third counterclaims of Nicolas Monteblanco are, not only 
intimately related to the issues raised by the complaint and the amended answer 
of Segundo Monteblanco. Said counterclaims of Nicolas Monteblanco are 
<i>substantially identical</i> to the fourth and sixth causes of action in the 
counterclaim of Segundo Monteblanco. Hence, they will have to be decided by the 
lower court, after trial of the case on the merits, regardless of its resolution 
dismissing the second and third counterclaims of Nicolas Monteblanco. As a 
consequence, a determination of the merits of the present appeal would lead to a 
judgment on said causes of action in the counterclaim of Segundo Monteblanco. 
</li></ol>
<p>Wherefore, without prejudice to the consideration of the merits of said 
resolution at its proper time, this appeal is hereby dismissed, with the costs 
of this instance against defendant-appellant Nicolas Monteblanco. It is so 
ordered.</p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes,
