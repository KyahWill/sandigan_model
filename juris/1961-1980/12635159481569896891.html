appeal by the People of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Phi­lippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
is an order, dated <st1:date month="1" day="8" year="1965">January 8, 1965</st1:date>,
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>
dismissing, upon motion of the defense, an indictment for rape against Willy <span class="SpellE">Obsania</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On November 22, 1964,
barely a day after the occurrence of the alleged crime, <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dollente</span>, the 14-year old victim, and her parents, <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Dollente</span> and Carmelita <span class="SpellE">Lureta</span>, filed in the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Balungao</span>,

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>"That on or about the
21st day of November 1964, at around 2:00 to 3:00 in the afternoon, par­ticularly
in <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cawakalan</span>, barrio
of <span class="SpellE">Capulaan</span>, <span style="">municipality
of <span class="SpellE">Balungao</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>,
Philippines and within the jurisdiction of the Hono­rable Court, the said
accused Willy <span class="SpellE">Obsania</span>, armed with a dagger, by means
of violence and intimidation, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously did then
and there have carnal knowledge of the complainant <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dollente</span>, against her will and on the roadside in the
<span class="SpellE">ricefields</span> at the above mentioned place while she was
alone on her way to barrio San <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>.”</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After the case was remanded to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> for further proceedings, the assistant
provincial fiscal filed an information for rape against the accused, embody­ing
the allegations of the above complaint, with an additional aver­ment that the
offense was committed “with lewd designs”.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused pleaded not guilty upon arraignment, and forthwith
his counsel moved for the dismissal of the case con­tending that the complaint
was fatally defective for failure to al­lege "lewd designs" and that
the subsequent information filed by the fiscal which averred "lewd
designs" did not cure the jurisdic­tional infirmity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court <u>a</u> <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> </span>granted
the motion and ordered dismissal of the action, ruling that "the failure
of the complaint filed by the offended party to allege that the acts committed
by the accused were with 'lewd designs' does not give this Court jurisdic­tion
to try the case." From this order, the fiscal brought the instant appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Two issues are tendered
for resolution, namely: first, are "lewd designs" an indispensable
element which should be alleged in</span> <span style="">the
complaint? and, second, does the present appeal place the accused in double
jeopardy? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Both <span style="">must be answered in
the negative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused, in his motion to dismiss, as well as the trial
judge, in his order of dismissal, rely basically on the ruling in <u>P</u><u><span style="">eople vs. <span class="SpellE">Gilo</span></span></u><span style=""> </span>(L-18202, April 30, 1964).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case which involve a prosecution for
acts of lasciviousness, this Court, in passing, opined that "lewd
design" is </p>

<blockquote>“… an indispensable element of all crimes against chastity, such as
abduction, seduction and rape, including acts of lasciviousness . . . an
element that characterizes all crimes against chastity, apart from the
felonious or criminal intent of the offender, and such element must be always
present in order that they may be considered in contempla<span style="font-size: 12pt;">tion
of law.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Nothing in the foregoing statement can be reasonably interpreted
as requiring an <u>explicit</u> allegation of "lewd design" in a
complaint for rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold in no uncertain
terms that in a complaint for rape it is not necessary to allege "lewd
design" or "unchaste motive," for to require such averment is to
demand a patent superfluity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lascivious
intent inheres in rape and the unchaste design is manifest in the very act
itself - the carnal know<span style="">ledge of a
woman through force or intimidation, or when the wo­man is deprived of reason
or otherwise unconscious, or when the woman is under twelve years of age.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear that the complaint here satisfies the requirements of
legal sufficiency of an indictment for rape as it unmis­takably alleges that
the accused had carnal knowledge of the <span style="">complainant
</span>by means of violence and intimidation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We therefore hold that the trial judge erred in dismissing the case on
the prof­fered grounds that the complaint was defective for failure to al­lege
"lewd design" and, as a consequence of such infirmity, that the court
<u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>quo</u> did not acquire jurisdiction over the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The error of the trial judge was in confusing
the concept of jurisdic­tion with that of insufficiency in substance of an
indictment.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We come now to the more
important issue of double jeo­pardy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
accused maintains that "assuming, <span class="SpellE">arguendo</span>, that
the argument is right that the court <u>a</u> <u>q</u></span><u><span style="">uo</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">has jurisdiction, the
appeal of the Government constitutes double jeopardy."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">An appeal by the prosecution in a criminal case is not available
if the defendant would thereby be placed in double jeopardy.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Correlatively, section 9, Rule 117 of the Revised Rules of Court provides:</p>

<blockquote>"When a defendant shall have been convicted or acquitted, or
the case against him dismissed or otherwise terminated without the express
consent of the defendant, by a court of competent jurisdic­tion, upon a <span style="">valid complaint or information or other </span>formal
charge sufficient in form and substance to sustain a conviction, and after the
defendant had pleaded to the charge, the conviction or acquittal of the <span style="">defendant </span>or the dismissal of the case
shall<span style=""> be a bar </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">another prosecution for the offense charged, or for any attempt to
commit the same or frustration thereof, or for any offense which necessarily
includes or is necessarily included in the offense charged in the former
complaint or information.”</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In order that the protection against double jeopardy may inure in
favor of an accused, the following requisites must have obtained in the
original prosecution: (a) a valid complaint or in­formation; (b) a competent
court; (c) the defendant had pleaded to the charge; and (d) the defendant was
acquitted, or convicted, or the case against him was dismissed or otherwise
terminated with­out his express consent.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The complaint filed with
the municipal court in the case at bar was valid; the court </span><u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> was a competent tribunal with jurisdiction to
hear the case; the record shows that the accused pleaded not guilty upon
arraignment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the only remaining
and decisive question is whether the dismissal of the case was without the
express consent of the accused.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The accused admits that
the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> dismissal was ordered by the trial
judge upon his motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, he vehemently contends that under the prevailing jurisprudence,
citing <u>People</u></span><u><span style=""> vs. <span class="SpellE">Bangalao</span>, et al</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">(94 Phil. 354, February 17, 1954), <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Labatete</span></u>
(L-12917, April </span><span style="">27, 1960), </span><u><span style="">People v</span></u><u><span style="">s. <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span></span></u><span style=""> (L-19795, July 31, 1964), </span><u><span style="">People </span></u><u><span style="">vs. </span></u><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Cloribel</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">(L-20314,
August 31, 1964), an erroneous dismissal of a criminal action, even upon the
instigation of the accused </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">a motion to quash or dismiss, does not bar
him from pleading the defense of double jeopardy in a subsequent appeal by the
Government or in a new prosecution for the same offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused suggests that the
above-enumerated cases have abandoned the previous ruling of this Court to the
effect that when a case is dismissed, other than on the merits, upon motion of
the accused personally or through counsel, such dismissal is to be regarded as
with the </span><span style="">expr</span><span style="">ess consent of the accused and consequently
he </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">deemed to have waived</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> his right to plead double jeopardy and/or he
is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> from claiming such defense on appeal by the
Government or in another indictment for the same offense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This particular aspect of
double jeopardy - dismissal or termination of the original case without the
express consent of the defendant - has evoked varied and apparently conflicting
rulings from this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We must
untangle this jurisprudential maze and fashion out in bold relief a ruling not
susceptible of equivocation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, a
searching extended review of the pertinent ca­ses is imperative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The doctrine of <u>waiver
of double jeopardy</u> was enunciated and formally <span class="SpellE">labelled</span>
as such for the first time in 1949 in <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Salico</span></u>,
<u>supra</u>,</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">with three justices dissenting.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In that case, the provincial fiscal appealed
from the order of the trial court dismissing, upon motion of the defendant made
immediately after the prosecution had rested its case, an indictment for
homicide, on the ground that the prosecution had failed to prove that the crime
was committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court, or, more
specifically, that the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Vic­torias</span> in
which the crime was allegedly committed was comprised within the province of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rejecting the claim of the accused that the appeal placed him in double
jeopardy, this Court held that the dismissal was erroneous because the evidence
on record showed that the crime was committed in the town of <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> and the trial judge should have taken judicial
notice that the said municipality was included within the province of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental and therefore the offense charged was
committed with­in the jurisdiction of the court of first instance of the said
province.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In ruling that the appeal by
the Government did not put the accused in peril of a second jeopardy, this Court
stressed that with "the dismissal of the case by the court below upon
motion of the defen­dant, the latter has not been in jeopardy," and
"assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> that the defendant had
been already in jeopardy in the court below and would be placed in double
jeopardy by the appeal, the defendant has waived his constitutional right not
to be put in danger of being convicted twice for the same offense.” Mr. Justice
<span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Feria</span>, speaking
for the majority, reasoned </span><span style="">that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“. . . when the case is dismissed <u>with the express consent</u>
of the defendant, the dismissal will not be a bar to another prosecution for
the same offense; because, his action in having the case dismissed constitutes
a waiver of his cons­titutional right or privilege, for the reason that <span style="">he thereby prevents the court from proceeding
to the trial on the merits and rendering a judgment of conviction against him."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The <span class="SpellE"><u>Salico</u></span>
doctrine was adhered to and affirmed in <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Marapao</span></u>
(85 Phil. 832, March 30, 1950), <span class="SpellE"><u>Gandicela</u></span><u>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Lutero</span></u> (88 Phil. 299, March 5, 1951), </span><u><span style="">People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pinuela</span>,
et al</span></u><span style="">. </span><span style="">(91 Phil. 53, March 28, 1952), <u>Co Te </u></span><u><span style="">Hue vs. <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span>
</span></u><span style="">(94 Phil. 258, January 26,
1954), and <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Desalisa</span></u> (L-15516,
December 17, 1966).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Marapao</span></u></span><span style="">, t</span><span style="">he defendant was indicted for slight physical injuries </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Sibonga</span>, </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cebu</span></span></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the prose­cution had rested its case, a continuance was had, and
when trial was resumed, the court, upon motion of the defense, ordered the case
dismissed for failure of the prosecution to appear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the court reconsidered this order
upon representation of the fis­cal who appeared moments later, and ordered the
defense to pre­sent its evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
accused moved to set aside the latter order on the ground that it placed him in
double jeopardy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acceding to this
motion, the court dismissed the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, the accused was charged in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> with the offense of assault upon a person in
authority, based on the same facts alleged in the former complaint for slight physical
injuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, upon motion of the
accused, the trial court dismissed the new indictment on the ground of double
jeopardy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this order, the
prosecution appealed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In upholding the
appeal of the Govern­ment, this Court observed that although the information
for assault necessarily embraced the crime of slight physical injuries for
which the accused was indicted in the justice of the peace court,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>". . . it appears that the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
was neither convicted nor acquitted of the previous charge against him for
slight physical injuries, for that case was dismissed upon his own request
before trial could be finished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having
himself asked for such dismissal, before a judgment of conviction or acquittal
could have been rendered, the <span class="SpellE">appel­lee</span> is not entitled
to invoke the defense of double jeopardy . . .”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Gandicela</u></span>,
this Court had occasion to reiterate the <span class="SpellE"><u>Salico</u></span>
ruling:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"But where a defendant expressly consents to, by moving for,
the dismissal of the case against him, as in the present case, even if the
court or judge states in the order that the dis­missal is definite or does not
say that the dis­missal is without prejudice on the part of the fis­cal to file
another information, the dismissal <span style="">will
not be a bar to a subsequent prosecution of the defendant for the same
offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Ylagan</span>,
58 Phil. 851; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Salico</span>, 84 Phil. 722)."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">And
in denying the motion for reconsideration filed by the accused in that case,
this Court held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"According to Section 9 of Rule 13, if a criminal case is dismissed
otherwise than upon the merits at any stage before judgment, with­out the
express consent of the defendant, by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon a
valid complaint or information, and after the defen­dant has pleaded to the
charge, the dismissal of the case shall be definite or a bar to another
prosecution for the same offense; but if it is <span style="">dis­</span>missed upon the petition or with the express con­sent of the
defendant, the dismissal will be with­out prejudice or not a bar to another
prosecution <span style="">for </span>the same
offense, because, in the last case, the defendant's action in having the case
dismissed constitutes a waiver of his constitutional right not to be prosecuted
again for the same offense."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Pinuela</u></span>, <span style="">as in </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Salico</u></span>,
the prosecution had presented its evidence against the defendant, and the trial
court, upon mo­tion of the accused, dismissed the criminal action for lack of
evidence showing that the crime charged was committed within its territorial
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal by the
Government, this Court found that the evidence showed otherwise and, <span style="">like in <span class="SpellE"><u>Sa­lico</u></span>, </span>the majority rejected the plea of
double jeopardy interposed by the accused on the ground that his virtual
instigation of the erroneous dismissal amounted to a waiver of his right against
a second jeopardy.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Co Te Hue</u>, it was the theory of the petitioner that the
charge of <span class="SpellE"><u>estafa</u></span> filed against him having been
dismissed, albeit provisionally, without his express consent, its revival
constitu­ted double jeopardy which bars a subsequent prosecution for the same
offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This claim was traversed by the
Solicitor General who contended that considering what had transpired in the
confe­rence between the parties, the provisional dismissal was no bar to the
subsequent prosecution for the reason that the dismissal was made with the
defendant's express consent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court
sus­tained the view of the Solicitor General, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"We are inclined to uphold the view of the Solicitor
General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the transcript of the
notes taken at the hearing in connection with<span style=""> the motion for dismissal, it appears that a confe­rence was held
between petitioner and the offen­ded party in the office of the fiscal
concerning the case and that as a result of that conference the offended party
filed the motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also
appears that as no action has been taken on said motion, counsel for petitioner
invited the attention of the court to the matter who acted thereon only after
certain explanation was given by said counsel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And when the order came the court made it plain that the dismissal was
merely provisional in character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can
be plainly seen that the dismissal was effected not only with the express
consent of the petitioner but even upon the urging of his counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This attitude of peti­tioner, or his counsel,
takes this case out of the operation of the rule."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">In
essence, this Court held that where a criminal case is dismissed provisionally
not only with the express consent of the ac­cused but even upon the urging of
his counsel, there can be no double jeopardy under section 9, Rule 113, if the
indictment against him is revived by the fiscal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This decision subscribes substantially to the
doctrine on waiver established in <span class="SpellE"><u>Salico</u></span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The validity and currency
of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Salico</u></span> doctrine were intimated in the
recent case of </span><u><span style="">People vs. <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span></span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">(L-18257, June 30, 1966), and six months
later were reaffirmed in </span><u><span style="">People
vs. <span class="SpellE">D<span style="">esalisa</span></span></span></u><span style="">, </span><u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Fajardo</u></span>,
this Court, through Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Querube</span> <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, observed:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The record does not reveal that <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
expressly agreed to the dismissal of the information as ordered by the trial
Judge or that they performed any act which could be considered as ex­press
consent within the meaning of the rule.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While they did file a motion asking that the case be quashed, or that a
reinvestigation thereof be ordered, the court granted neither alternative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What it did was to order the prosecution to
amend the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This order was in
effect a denial of the motion to <span style="">quash,
and it was only after the prosecution failed to amend that the court dismissed
the case on that ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
even under the theory enun­ciated in some decisions of this Court (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Sal<span style="">i</span>co</span>,
etc.) </span>that if a valid and su<span style="">fficient
informati</span>on <span style="">is erroneously
dismissed upon mo</span>tion of <span style="">the
defendant he is deemed to have waived the plea of double jeopardy in connection
with an appeal from the order </span><span style="">of
</span><span style="">dismissal, <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
here are not precluded from making such plea.”<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">To

<blockquote>"In the first place, the accused-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>

liability under the facts alleged in the information in the preceding case, No.
Q-972, and the trial court instead of allowing the withdrawal of the motion to
quash, virtually sustained the same when it denied the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span>
mo­tion to amend, thereby forcing the latter to dis­miss the case; hence, it
can not be held that the former case <span style="">was
</span>terminated without the express <span style="">consent

themselves showed that the information in the previous case was insufficient to
charge them with any criminal offense, in view of their rela­tionship with the

attach, there must be an information sufficient in form and substance to
sustain a conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lastly, the herein
accused having successfully contended that the information in the former case
was insuffi­cient to sustain a conviction, they cannot turn around now and
claim that such information was after all, sufficient and did place them in
danger of jeopardy of being convicted <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, as they formerly contended, no conviction
could be had </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the previous case, they are </span><span style="">in </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">estoppel</span></span><span style=""> to contend now that the information in the second case places them in

<blockquote>"Where the complaint or information is in truth valid and
sufficient, but the case is dismissed upon the petition of the accused on the
ground that <span style="">the complaint or
information is invalid and insufficient, such dismissal will not bar another
prose­cution for the same offense and the defendant is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>
from alleging in the second information that the former dismissal was wrong
because the complaint or information was valid."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">In
this particular case, upon motion of the defendants, the trial court dismissed the
information because it did not allege the use of violence, notwithstanding the
fact that the offense charged was coercion under article 287 of the Revised
Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal, however, this
Court ruled that the dismissal was erroneous be­cause "although the
offense named in the information is coercion, it does not necessarily follow
that the applicable provision is the first paragraph, since the second
paragraph also speaks of ‘coercions’.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Inasmuch as the recitals in </span><span style="">the
</span><span style="">information do not include violence,
the inevitable conclusion is that the coercion contem­plated is that described
and penalized in the second paragraph.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We come now to the case of <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Casiano</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case the accused was charged with <span class="SpellE"><u>estafa</u></span> in a complaint filed with the justice of the
peace court of Rosales, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused waived her right to preliminary
investigation and the record was accordingly forwarded to the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> where the provincial fiscal
filed an information of "illegal possession and use of false treasury or
bank notes.” Upon arraignment the defendant pleaded not guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequent­ly, the defense filed a motion to
dismiss on the thesis that there had been no preliminary investigation of the
charge of illegal possession and use of false treasury or bank notes, and that
the absence of such preliminary investigation affected the jurisdic­tion of the
trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion was granted on
the ground that the waiver made by the defendant in the justice of the peace
court did not deprive her of the right to a preliminary investiga­tion of an
entirely different crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal to
this Court, it was held that the dismissal was erroneous because the
allegations of the information filed in the Court of First Instance were inclu­ded
in those of the complaint filed in the justice of the peace court where the
defendant had already waived her right to a preliminary investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the question of whether the appeal placed
the defendant in double jeopardy, this Court, thru Mr. Chief Justice (then
Associate Justice) <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
observed that the situation of <span class="SpellE">Casiano</span> was identical
to that of the accused in <span class="SpellE"><u>Acierto</u></span></p>

<blockquote>“. . . were she to plead double jeopardy in this case, for such plea
would require the as­sertion of jurisdiction of the court of first instance to
try her and that the same erred in yield­ing to her plea therein for lack of
authority <span class="SpellE">there­for</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the language of our decision in the <span class="SpellE">Acierto</span>
<span style="">case, it is <u>immaterial</u> whether
or not the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> had said authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It, likewise, makes no difference whether or
not the issue raised by de­fendant in the lower court affected its
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact is that she
contested its jurisdiction and that, although such pretense was erroneous, she
led the court to believe that it was correct and to act in accordance with such
belief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The elemen­tary principles of
fair dealing and good faith de­mand, accordingly, that she be <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> now from taking the opposite stand in order to
pave the way for a plea of double jeopardy, unless the rule of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> laid down </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the <span class="SpellE">Acierto</span> case is revoked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, said rule applies with
greater force to the case at bar than to the <span class="SpellE">Acierto</span>
case, because the same involved two (2) <u>separate proceed­ings</u> before
courts deriving their authority from <u>different</u> <u>sovereignties</u>,
whereas the appeal in </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">case at bar is a <u>continuation</u> of the
proceedings in the lower court, which like this Supreme Court, is a creature of
the <u>same</u> <u>sovereignty</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
short, the inconsistency and impropriety would be more patent and glaring in
this case than in that of <span class="SpellE">Acierto</span>, if appellant
herein pleaded double jeopardy in this instance."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">This Court then forthrightly stated that
"the rule of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> applied in the <span class="SpellE">Acierto</span> case should be maintained, because:</p>

<blockquote>“1. It is basically and fundamentally sound and just.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2. It is in conformity with the principles of legal ethics, which
demand good faith of the highest order in the practice of law. </blockquote>

<blockquote>“3. <span style="">It is well settled that
parties to a judi­cial proceeding may not, on appeal, adopt a theory
inconsistent with that which they sustained in the lower court.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

it had <u>no</u> jurisdiction, but the case was tried and decided </span>upon <span style="">the theory that it <u>had</u> jurisdiction,
the parties are not barred on appeal, from assailing such jurisdiction, for the

consent of the </u></span><u><span style="">p</span></u><u><span style="">arties or by <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span></span></u><span style="">’ (5 C.J.S. 861-863).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, if the lower court <u>had</u>
jurisdiction, and the case was heard and decided upon a given theory, such, for
instance, as that the court had <u>no</u> jurisdiction, the party who induced
it to adopt such theory will not be permit­ted, on appeal, to assume an
inconsistent position - that the lower court <u>had</u> jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, the principle of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
applies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule that jurisdiction is
conferred by law, and does not depend upon the will of the parties, has <u>no</u>
bearing thereon."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

case <span class="SpellE">Alfreda</span> Roberts, together with Jose <span class="SpellE">Archilla</span>, </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">charged

Roberts, through her counsel, filed a motion praying that the complaint be
quashed with regard to her on the ground that the facts alleged therein did not
consti</span>tute the offense charged for failure to aver that "insofar as
<span class="SpellE">Alfreda</span> Roberts is concerned, her marriage to Jose
Luis <span class="SpellE">Archilla</span> was her second marriage. . .” On
appeal, the prosecution contended that the trial court erred in granting the
motion to quash, because the complaint was sufficient and at least charged the
accused as an accomplice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant
maintained that even if that were true, the quashing of the information
amounted to her acquittal which prevented the prosecution from taking the said
ap­peal as it would place her in double jeopardy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Justice Felix Bautista Angelo, writing
for the majority, ruled that the trial court erred, and proceeded to emphasize
that the accused<span style=""> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“. . . cannot now be allowed to invoke the plea of double jeopardy
after inducing the trial court to commit an error which otherwise it would not
have committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> cannot adopt a posture of double dealing without
running afoul with the <span style="">doctrine of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well-</span>settled
that the parties to a <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> proceeding may not,
on appeal, adopt a theory inconsistent with that which they sustained in the
lower court (Williams v. <span class="SpellE">McMicking</span>, 17 Phil. 408;
Molina v. <span class="SpellE">Somes</span> etc.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
is now <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from invoking the plea of double
jeopardy upon the theory that she would still be convicted under an information

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The accused in this case
now before us nevertheless in­sists that the <span class="SpellE"><u>Salico</u></span>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Bangalao</u></span>, the complaint filed
by the victim's mother alleged that the rape was committed "by means of
force and in­timidation" while the information filed by the fiscal alleged
that the offended party was a "minor and demented girl" and that the
defendants "successively had sexual intercourse with her by means of force
and against the will of Rosita <span class="SpellE">Palban</span>." After
the accused had pleaded not guilty, the defense counsel moved for the dismissal
of the case on the ground that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to try the
offense of rape charged by the fis­cal since it was distinct from the one
alleged in the complaint which did not aver that the victim was <span style="">a </span>"demented
girl".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court sustained
the motion and dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal by the prosecution, this Court held
that the trial judge erred in dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction, <span style="">but </span>ruled, however, that the appeal
could not prosper because it placed the accused in double jeopardy.</p>

<blockquote>"As the court below had jurisdiction to try the case upon the
filing of the complaint by the mother of the offended party, the defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> would be placed in double jeopardy <span style="">if </span>the

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After mature analysis, we

to prove that the crime was committed within the jurisdiction of the
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment was in fact a final
judgment of acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere fact
that the accused asked for his acquittal after trial on the merits (after the
prosecution had rested its case) is no reason for saying that the case was ‘<span style="">dismissed’ </span>with <span style="">his ex­</span>press consent and he may again
be subjected to ano­ther prosecution. "</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From the above-quoted
statement, <span style="">it is </span>clear that what
in <span class="SpellE"><u>Salico</u></span> was repudiated In <span class="SpellE"><u>Labatete</u></span> was the <u>premise</u> that the dis­missal
therein was not on the merits and <u>not</u> the <u>conclusion</u> that a
dismissal, other than on the merits, sought by the accused, is deemed to be
with <span style="">his express consent and therefore
constitutes a waiver of his </span>right <span style="">to plead </span>double jeopardy <span style="">in
the event of an </span>appeal by the prosecution or a second indictment <span style="">for the same offe</span>nse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, <span style="">In </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Labatete</u></span>, merely pointed out
that the <span class="SpellE">con­troverted</span> dismissal <span style="">in <span class="SpellE"><u>Salico</u></span>
“was in fact an </span>acquittal." Reason­ing <u>a</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>contrario</u></span>,
had the dismissal <span style="">not amounted to
acquittal, </span>then </span><span style="">the
doctrine of waiver would have applied and prevailed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact we believe with the
majority in <span class="SpellE"><u>Salico</u></span> that the </span><span style="">dismissal </span><span style="">therein was not on the merits and therefore
did not amount to an acquittal:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>"If the prosecution
fails to prove that the offense was committed within the territorial
jurisdiction of the court and the case is dismissed, the dismissal is not an
acquittal, inasmuch as if <span style="">it were so the defendant could not be again prose­cuted for the same offense
before a court of com</span><span style="">petent
jurisdiction; that it is elemental that in such case the defendant may again be
prosecuted for the same offense before a court of competent jurisdiction."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Granting, however, that
the <span class="SpellE"><u>Salico</u></span> doctrine was abandoned in <span class="SpellE"><u>Labatete</u></span>, it was resurrected in </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Desalisa</span></u></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Moreover, <span class="SpellE"><u>Labatete</u></span>
never mentioned the doctrine of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> enunciated
in <span class="SpellE"><u>Acierto</u></span> which had been repeatedly
reaffirmed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To bolster his contention
that the <span class="SpellE"><u>Salico</u></span> doctrine has been dropped from
the corpus of our jurisprudence, the accused cites <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span></u>,</span><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Here the accused appealed to the Court </span><span style="">of First Instance
his conviction in the inferior court for acts of lasciviousness </span><span style="">with consent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After conducting the preliminary in­vestigation, the fiscal charged the
accused with corruption of minors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Villarin</span> pleaded not guilty, and before the case could be
heard, </span><span style="">his
counsel filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that </span><span style="">the information did not allege facts
constituting the crime charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting
on this motion, the trial court dismissed the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On ap­peal by the prosecution, this Court,
thru Mr. Justice Felix Angelo Bautista, held that the dismissal was erroneous,
but that this error:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“. . . cannot now be remedied by setting aside the order of
dismissal of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u><span style=""> </span>and by remanding the case to it for further
pro­ceedings as now suggested by the prosecution con­sidering that the <u>case
was dismissed without the </u><u><span style="">express
</span>c</u><u><span style="">onsent of the accused even
if it was upon </span>the motion of his counsel</u>, for to do so would place
the accused in double jeopardy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only
exception to the rule on the matter is when the dismissal is with the consent
of the accused, and here this consent has not been obtained." (underscoring

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Villarin</span></u></span><span style=""> gives the impression, as gleaned from the
above statement, that this Court therein sustained the plea of double jeopardy
on </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">ground that the dismissal </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">without the </span><span style="">express consent </span><span style="">of the
defendant as it </span><span style="">was ordered "upon the motion of his counsel" </span><span style="">and not upon motion of the defendant
himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This con­clusion </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">rather unfortunate and must be rectified, for
</span><span style="">the
settled rule is that the acts of counsel in a criminal prosecution bind </span><span style="">his client.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, in <u>People vs. Romero</u> (89 Phil. 672, </span><st1:date month="7" day="31" year="1951"><span style="">July 31,
 1951</span></st1:date><span style="">), this Court
held categorically that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<u>The fact that the counsel for the defendant</u>, <u>and
not the defendant himself personally moved for the dismissal of the case
against him</u>, <u>had the same effect as if the </u><u><span style="">defendant had
personally moved </span><span style="">for such
dismissal</span></u><span style="">, </span><u><span style="">inasmuch as the act
of the counsel in the prosecution of the defendant's cases was the act of the
defendant </span>himself</u>, for the only case <span style="">in </span>which the defendant <span style="">cannot
be represented by </span><span style="">his counsel is in pleading guilty according </span><span style="">to Section 3, Rule 114, of the Rules of
Court." </span><span style="">(underscoring supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On
this consideration alone, we cannot agree with the accused in </span><span style="">the case at bar that this Court in <span class="SpellE"><u>Villarin</u></span> intended to </span><span style="">abandon </span><span style="">the <span class="SpellE"><u>Salico</u></span> ruling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had the motion to dismiss filed by <span class="SpellE">Villarin's</span> counsel been considered as one made </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">the defendant himself, as should have been done, the <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span> case should have been resolved consistent with the
doctrine of waiver in <span class="SpellE"><u>Salico</u></span> and/or that of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> in <span class="SpellE"><u>Acierto</u></span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As a final citation in
support of his theory, </span><span style="">the accused in the case at </span><span style="">bar </span><span style="">invokes <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Clorib<span style="">le</span></span></u></span><span style="">,</span><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">, where this Court, in sustaining the plea of
double jeopardy interposed by the </span><span style="">defendants, stated <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In asserting that Criminal Case No. 45717 may still be
reinstated, the petitioner adopts the ruling once followed by this Court to the
effect that a dismissal upon the defendant's own motion <span style="">is a</span><span style=""> dismissal consented to by him and, consequently, will not be a bar to
another prosecution for the same offense, because, his action in having the </span><span style="">case dismissed
constitutes a waiver of his constitutional right or privilege, for the reason
that he thereby prevents the court from proceeding to the trial on </span>the
merits and rendering <span style="">a </span>judgment of conviction against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People <span style="">v. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Salico</span></span><span style="">, </span><span style="">84 </span><span style="">Phil. 722) <u>But</u>, <u>this authority has

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">And

<span class="SpellE">Peo</span>. v. <span class="SpellE">Salico</span>, 45 O.G. No.
4, 1765-1776, and later reiterated in <span class="SpellE">Peo</span>. v. Romero,
L-4517-20, July 31, 1951, a dismissal upon defendant's motion will not be a bar
to ano­ther prosecution for the same offense as said dismissal was not without
the express consent of the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>This
ruling</u>, <u>however</u>, <u>has no application to the instant case</u>, <u>since

different grounds</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the <span class="SpellE">Salico</span> case, the dismissal was based on the ground that the
evidence for the prosecution did not show that the crime was committed within
the territorial juris­diction of the court which, on appeal, we found that it
was, so the case was remanded for further proceedings; and in the Romero case
the dismis­sal was due to the non-production of other impor­tant witnesses </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">the prosecution on a date fixed by the court and under the
understanding that no further postponement at the instance of the government
would be entertained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">In </span><span style="">both cases, the right of a defendant to a
speedy trial was never put in issue." (underscoring supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The <span class="SpellE">gravamen</span>
of the foregoing decisions was reiterated in <u>People vs. Robles</u> (L-12761,
June 29, 1959) where the trial </span><span style="">court,
upon motion </span><span style="">of the defendant,
dismissed the case on the ground that the failure of the prosecution to present
its evidence despite several postponements granted at its instance, denied the
accused a speedy trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In rejecting the
appeal of the Government, this Court held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In the circumstances, we find no alternative than to hold
that the dismissal of Criminal Case No. 11065 is not provisional in character
but one which is tantamount to acquittal that would bar further prosecution of

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Cloribel</u></span>, the case dragged
for three years and eleven months, that is, from <st1:date month="9" day="27" year="1958">September 27, 1958</st1:date> when the information <span style="">was filed to </span><st1:date month="8" day="15" year="1962"><span style="">August 15, 1962</span></st1:date><span style=""> when it was called for trial, after numerous

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Considering the factual
setting in the case at bar, it is clear that there is no parallelism between <span class="SpellE"><u>Cloribel</u></span> and the cases </span>cited therein, on the
one hand, and the instant case, on the other.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> dismissal was predicated
on the erroneous contention of the accused that the complaint was defective and
such infirmity affected the jurisdiction of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, and
not on the right of the accused to a speedy trial and the failure of the
Government to prosecute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appealed
order of dismissal in this case now under consideration did not terminate the
action on the merits, whereas in <span class="SpellE"><u>Cloribel</u></span> and
in the other related cases the dismissal amounted to an acquittal because the
failure to <span style="">pro</span><span style="">­secute </span>presupposed that the
Government did not have a case against the accused, who, in the first place, is
presumed innocent.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The application of the
sister doctrines of waiver and <span class="SpellE">estop­pel</span> requires two

be sought or induced by the defendant personally or through his </span><span style="">counsel; </span><span style="">and <u>second</u>, such dismissal </span><span style="">must </span><span style="">not be on the
merits and must not necessarily amount to an acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indubitably, the case at bar falls squarely
