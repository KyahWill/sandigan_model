				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS.
DALMACIO SABENORIO, ROLANDO SABENORIO AND TORIBIO ORTIZ, DEFENDANTS (AT
LARGE), ESTEBAN ANGCON, DEFENDANT WHOSE DEATH SENTENCE IS UNDER REVIEW.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an automatic review of the death sentence imposed by the
Court of First Instance of Leyte, Tacloban City Branch VII, on Esteban Angcon,
who, together with his bro­ther Policarpo Angcon (who died during the pendency
of this case), was convicted of robbery in band with homicide and physical
injuries and was ordered to pay an indemnity of nine thousand pesos to the
heirs of Melecio Marentes (Criminal Case No. N-0315).</p>

<p class="BODY">The review of the death sentence is simplified by the fact that
Esteban Angcon, a twenty-six-year old farmer, signed an extrajudicial
confession in the Cebuano dialect which was taken by the chief of police and
sworn to before the municipal mayor (Exh. C and C-1).</p>

<p class="BODY">In that confession, he admitted that in the afternoon of Sunday,
December 6, 1964, while he was in the cockpit, he and his younger brother
Policarpo Angcon, and his com­panions, Dalmacio Sabenorio, Lando Sabenorio and
Dioso Ortiz conspired to rob Melecio Marentes because the latter had received
"plenty of money from the sale of his land".</p>

<p class="BODY">In pursuance of that conspiracy, Esteban, who was armed with a
sawed-off shotgun, and his four companions went at seven o'clock in the evening
to the house of Marentes located at Sitio Bunacan, Barrio Villalon, Calubian,
Leyte.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dalmacio fired at the lock of the
house and Dioso pounded it with a piece of wood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Esteban and his companions entered the house.</p>

<p class="BODY">Esteban recounted in his confession that once inside the house he
shot Marentes who was in a kneeling position.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Marentes died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Esteban and his
companions were able to get three thousand pesos which amount was entrusted to
Dalmacio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not give Esteban any
part of it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Policarpo Angcon signed a similar confession before the chief of
police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was also sworn to before the
muni­cipal mayor (Exh. B).</p>

<p class="BODY">The counsel <u>de</u> <u>oficio</u> of Esteban Angcon candidly
stated in his brief that after he "has made a very careful and
conscientious study of the records of this case" and read several times
the transcripts of the stenographic notes, "<u>in</u> <u>conscience</u>,
he is fully convinced" that Esteban Angcon took part in the robbery and
killed Melecio Marentes (Page 116 of Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">At the trial, two eyewitnesses, namely, Gregoria Casas, the
victim's wife, and his mother-in-law, Bonifacia Avila, who were with the victim
in his house at the time of the killing and the robbery, testified that they
saw Esteban Angcon shooting Marentes while he was in a kneeling posi­tion and
that the sum of three thousand pesos was taken by Esteban and his companions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two eyewitnesses were acquainted with Esteban because he
resided in the same barrio; he was a neighbor and a friend, and, as a cockfight
aficionado, he frequented the house of Marentes for the purpose of holding
practice cockfights (<u>purok</u>).<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The municipal health officer, who performed the autopsy on the
body of the twenty-two-year-old victim, cer­tified and testified that the
victim sustained a gunshot wound in the chest which perforated his left lung
and the ventricles of his heart.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
wound was fatal (Exh. A).</p>

<p class="BODY">As to why the robbery was committed, the prose­cution proved that
thirteen days before the incident Prudencio Esmero paid P2,820 to Gregoria
Casas, the victim's wife, as part payment of the price of an eight-hectare land
(Exh. F).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That payment was the major
part of the sum of three thousand pesos which Esteban Angcon and his companions
took from the overnight bag in the victim's house and which, according to his
confession, was entrusted to Dalmacio Sabenorio.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the evidence of the <u>corpus</u> <u>delicti</u> or the
fact of the commission of the robbery with homicide confirms the extra­judicial
confession of Esteban Angcon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Esteban's
counsel <u>de</u> <u>oficio</u> admits that even without his confession and on
the basis alone of the prosecution's other evidence, said counsel is morally
convinced that Esteban committed robbery with homicide.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the trial, the Angcon brothers impugned the voluntariness of
their confessions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They claimed that
they were maltreated by the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
chief of police and the municipal mayor testified that the confessions were
executed by the two accused without any violence, coercion or duress.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the confessants had sworn their confessions before the
mayor, it so happened that the municipal judge arrived in his office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The chief of police brought the Angcon
brothers to the municipal judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
magistrate asked them whether their confessions were freely executed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They did not complain of any maltreatment.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of Esteban Angcon's confession, which should be given
full credence, his defense of alibi was correctly rejected by the trial
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His guilt was established beyond
reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(The Sabenorio
brothers and Toribio Ortiz are at large.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel <u>de</u> <u>oficio</u>, Virgilio B. Jara, who submitted
a well-written brief and who thoroughly studied the case, contends that the
trial court erred in not holding (1) that the crime committed was robbery with
homicide only and not robbery in band with homicide and physical injuries, (2)
that nocturnity and evident premeditation are not aggravating, (3) that lack of
instruction and lack of intent to commit so grave a wrong are mitigating and
(4) that <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>, and not death, is the proper
penalty.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the counsel <u>de</u> <u>oficio</u>
that the trial court erred in holding that Esteban Angcon is guilty of physical
injuries in addition to robbery in band with homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only robbery in band with homicide was
charged in the original and amended information and in the complaint filed by
the chief of police in the municipal court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although there are indications in the record that Gregoria Casas
and Bonifacia Avila suffered physical injuries, nevertheless, inasmuch as the
information did not include physical injuries, the trial court could not expand
the special complex crime charged therein by adding thereto the offense of
physical injuries (See sec. 4, Rule 120, Rules of Court).</p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel's contention that there is no conclusive evidence that
the <u>robo</u> <u>con</u> <u>homicidio</u> was committed by a band is
correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the confession of Policarpo
Angcon, it is stated that only two of the five accused were armed with guns
(Exh. B).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the prosecution
witnesses testified that the three of the five accused who entered the victim's
house were armed, it is not certain that the two who re­mained outside were
also armed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it cannot be categori­cally
averred that the crime was committed by a <u>cuadrilla</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel <u>de</u> <u>oficio's</u> contention
that nocturnity is not aggravating cannot be sustained considering that it may
be deduced from Esteban Angcon's confession and the cir­cumstances surrounding
the commission of the crime that the five malefactors sought the cover of night
in order to consummate the crime with impunity.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention that evident premeditation is not aggravating is
based on the testimonies of the two prose­cution eyewitnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is argued that their testimonies do not
show that the killing of the victim was included in the conspiracy to commit
robbery.</p>

<p class="BODY">As correctly observed by the defense counsel, evident
premeditation is inherent in robbery with force upon things but may be
aggravating in robbery with homi­cide with respect to the homicide.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the oral evidence shows that Esteban Angcon
and his two companions, upon entering the house of Marentes, asked his wife
where her husband was and they looked for him in the bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On finding him, they kicked him and Esteban
shot him while he was kneeling and pleading for mercy and his wife was
entreating that his life be spared.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that, according to Esteban's confession, there was a
conspiracy in the afternoon to commit the robbery in the evening and
considering the manner in which the rob­bery was committed, there is sufficient
basis for concluding that the conspirators' plan embraced the killing of
Marentes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, <u>premeditación
conocida</u> is aggravating.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no merit in the
contention that lack of instruction is mitigating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Esteban Angcon knows how to sign his
name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is for the trial court to
determine whether the accused is a person of low intelligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No such finding was made by the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to lack of intent to commit so grave a wrong, it should be
noted that Esteban Angcon shot the victim in spite of the latter's submissive
attitude and the plea for mercy made by his wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it cannot be said that Esteban did not
intend to commit the grave wrong of killing the unarmed and docile victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Esteban acted with a high degree of per­versity
in killing Marentes.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dwelling is admittedly aggravating in this
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since three aggravating
circumstances attended the commission of the robbery with homicide and no
mitigating circumstance can be appreciated in favor of Esteban Angcon, the
trial court did not err in imposing the death penalty on him (Arts. 63[1] and
294[1], Revised Penal Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General's recommendation that the death penalty,
being "harsh and excessive", a request for executive clemency should
be made is not in order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Until the
lawmaking body "sees fit to repeal or modify the imposi­tion of the
extreme penalty, the courts will continue to impose the same when the facts and
circumstances in a case so warrant" (People vs. Olaes, 105 Phil.
502).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The "courts do not shirk
their disagreeable duty to impose the death penalty in cases where the law so
requires" (People vs. Carillo and Raquenio, 85 Phil. 611).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The instant case is such a case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The civil liability should be increased to twelve thousand pesos
and should include the sum of three thousand pesos which was taken by the malefactors.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the trial court's judgment is affirmed with the
modifications (1) that Esteban Angcon is sentenced to death for the offense of
robbery with homicide, (2) that the indemnity of nine thousand pesos is
increased to twelve thousand pesos and (3) that he is further ordered to pay to
the victim's heirs the sum of three thousand pesos, the amount taken during the
robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs <u>de</u> <u>oficio</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">ABAD <st1:city><st1:place>SANTOS</st1:place></st1:city>,
<i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the facts
as narrated in the decision, there can be no penalty but death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For under our system of criminal justice, <span class="SpellE">prescinding</span> the recently promulgated Probation Law, the
imposition of penalties is mechanistic.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="GramE">rules on the applica­tion of penalties contained
in the Revised Penal Code approximates</span> the programmed mind of today's
computer:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>input equals output which is
impervious to the <span class="SpellE">quibblings</span> of the infinitely
equivocal human personality. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>However,
for reasons to be stated, I believe that Esteban <span class="SpellE">Angcon</span>
is deserving of executive clemency.</p>

<p class="BODY">I am not opposed to capital punishment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I believe that certain crimes have to be
punished by the supreme retributive penalty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I also believe that capital punishment has a deterrent effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But to achieve that effect, it must have to
be implemented without unneces­sary delay, lest procrastination instil
skepticism about the mighty arm of the law, which smites the malefactor with
righteous anger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What are the facts in
this case in respect of the time element?</p>

<p class="BODY">The crime was committed on December 6, 1964, and on the very next
day Esteban and his brother <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> (now deceased)
were arrested by police authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
assume that Esteban has been in detention ever since, for aside from the
gravity of the crime he was accused of committing (which is robbery in band
with homicide) the record does not show that he posted bail for his provisional
release, which he probably could not do anyway by reason of poverty.</p>

<p class="BODY">Esteban and <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> were tried by
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> and sentenced to
die on August 18, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to law,
the decision was elevated to this Court for review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only now that the sentence imposed on
Esteban has become definite, since his detention in 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be less than perspicacious to lay
the blame at the door of the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The delay in the disposition of the case can be attributed to "un
mar de <span class="SpellE">razones</span>." One of them which <span class="GramE">stands</span> out prominently, is the heavy workload of the
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may not be amiss to state here
that notwithstanding the fact that the Court of Appeals was created precisely
to reduce the appellate jurisdiction of this Court, many petitions (a good number
of them without merit) are being filed with us to review decisions of the Court
of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another contributing factor
is the burden imposed on the Court by the 1973 Constitution which gave it the
power of "administrative supervision over all courts and the personnel
thereof." The time which the Court spends in this area is not
inconsiderable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result its
adjudicative functions have been adversely affected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is compounded by the fact that the
Office of Court Administrator (P. D. No. 828, as amended by P. D. No. 842)
which was created in <span class="GramE">1975,</span> has yet to be
organized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the Constitution be
amended again, perhaps a re-examination of the Court's power of administrative
supervision over all courts and the personnel thereof will not be
inappropriate.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering then that in the multitudinous dark nights of the
soul while under detention, the accused has suffered retribution awful to
contemplate, and considering further that time has silently effected a dilution
of the deterrent effect of capital punishment in this case, I recommend
executive clemency for the accused.</p>
