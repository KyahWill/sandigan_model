				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">Appeal
</span>by the Solicitor General from the decision of the Court of First
Instance of Oriental Mindoro (Case <span style="">No.
R-20) granting appellee's petition for naturalization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was submitted without petitioner-appellee's
brief in reply </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">that of appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner was born of Chinese parents in the municipality of
Capiz (now Roxas City), Province of Capiz, on January 15, 1934 and since then
resided con­<span style="">tinuously in the
Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He studied and finished his
elementary education in Aklan College, a Catholic institution, and his high
school in the Northwestern Vi­sayan College, both located at Kalibo,
Aklan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time of the hearing his
place of residence was Pinamalayan, Oriental Mindoro, although he was then a
fourth year chemical </span>engineering student at the Mapua Institute of
Technology, Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to his
petition filed October 13, 1959, his annual income was P1,800.00 as <span style="">a </span>salesman
of the Globe Bicycle Store at 564 Plaza C. de la Barca, Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two witnesses, former Congressman Conrado Morente and Mayor
Dominador Madrid, both residents of Pinamalayan, vouched for petitioner's good
moral character and irreproach­able conduct.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, the Solicitor General alleges that the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> erred in granting the petition notwithstanding:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the failure of petitioner-appellee to
indicate in his petition his former place or places of residence; (2) his
insufficient annual income, alleged in the petition to be only P1,800.00; and
(3) the fact that petitioner was using an alias without judicial authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence is not clear insofar as the first error is
concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even only on the ground
stated in the second assignment of error, this appeal must be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">As </span>alleged in the petition,
petitioner-appellee’s annual income was P1,800.00, or P150.00 a month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have repeatedly held that <span style="">such an </span>amount is not sufficient to
satisfy the requirement of the Naturalization <span style="">law </span>that the applicant must have a
lucrative occupation or calling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Sy Ang
Hoc vs. Republic, <span style="">G. </span>R. No. L-12400, March 29, 1961; Richard Velasco vs. Republic,
G. R. No. L-12214, May 25, 1960; Tan vs. Re­public, G. R. No. L-14861, March
17, 1961; Zacarias vs. Republic, G. R. No. L-14860, May 30, 1961), nor <span style="">a </span>monthly
income of P200.00 (Go vs. Republic, G. R. No. L-18068, October 30, 1962; Ong
Lim Chuan vs. Republic, G. R. No. L­18550, February 28, 1964; Koh Chet Hianchit

1966; and Chua Tak Seng vs. Republic, G. R. No. L-21599, October 29, 1966).</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that petitioner-appellee, as found by the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u>, was receiving an additional income of P100.00 monthly from <span style="">his </span>tutorial class, increasing his
total monthly income to P250.00, does not meet the statutory requirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Uy vs. Republic, G. R. No. L-20208, June 30,
1965; Uy vs. Republic, G. R. No. L-20799, November 29, 1965; Sy vs. Republic,
G. R. No. L-19581, April 29, 1966; and Tan Tiu vs. Republic, G. R. No. L-21018,
November 29, 1966).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed even <span style="">a monthly income of 1,300.00 has been held
insufficient (Sia Faw vs. Republic, G. R. No. L-24782, November 17, 1967).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">Wherefore</b><span style="">, the decision appealed from is reversed, and
the petition is denied, with costs against petitioner-appellee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
