				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case was certified to the Supreme Court by the Court of Appeals
in view of its finding that the appellant committed, not homicide but murder,
and that he should be sentenced to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">At about 9:00 o'clock in the evening of May 14<span class="GramE">,1963</span>,
on the occasion of the barrio fiesta of San Isidro, <span class="SpellE">Sulat</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, while Manuel Penis and Sunday <span class="SpellE">Jabole</span> were walking side by side towards the seashore, <span class="SpellE">Cel­so</span> <span class="SpellE">Acabado</span>, coming from the
opposite direction, sud­denly stabbed Manuel Penis with a knife on the <span class="SpellE">epi­gastric</span> region and immediately ran away towards the
house of <span class="SpellE">Imboy</span> <span class="SpellE">Lobederio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sunday <span class="SpellE">Jabole</span>
recognized <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Acabado</span> as
the attacker.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon being stabbed, Manuel
Penis declared to his attacker, "I know you. You are <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Acabado</span>." <span class="SpellE">Jabole</span> then
took the wounded victim to the house of <st1:place><st1:placename>Barrio
  Lieutenant</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Francis­co</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Plaza</st1:placename></st1:place>
where his dying declaration, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "B", was
taken by ex-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Zosimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Opimo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In his dying declaration, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
"B", the wounded vic­tim identified his assailant as <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Acabado</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon learn­ing of the wounding of her son,
Manuel Penis, <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span> <span class="SpellE">Sob­remonte</span>
went to the house of <st1:place><st1:placename>Barrio Lieutenant</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Francisco</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Pla­za</st1:placename></st1:place>,
where her son lay gravely wounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
their conversa­tion, Manuel told his mother that it was <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Acabado</span> who stabbed him and requested her to take the
necessary action against <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Acabado</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The wounded man was then taken to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Borongan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>Emergency</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> where he died on May 16
due to internal hemorrhage resulting from the knife wound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The death certificate, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> "A", described the wound as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Wd. stab 1-1/2 inches
long hypochondriac re­gion, left, directed inwards, medially penetrating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wound perforating the greater curvature of
the stomach.”<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the witness stand the
attending physician attributed the death to internal hemorrhage. </p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court erred in finding that the killing was homicide on
the ground that the night attack was from in front.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was treachery because although the
attack was from in front, it was sudden and in the dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The killing should therefore be qualified as
murder. </p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant contends that the evidence is insufficient to identify
him as the knife-wielder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention
is unmeritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant was
positively identified by the eyewitness, Sunday <span class="SpellE">Jabole</span>,
and by the victim himself who declared at the time of the night attack, "I
know you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You are <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Acabado</span>."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant was also identified by the victim in his dying declaration
taken by ex-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Zosimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Opimo</span>
and in his verbal declaration to his mother, <span class="SpellE">Eusta­quia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sobremonte</span>, in the same evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence shows that Manuel Penis and
Sunday <span class="SpellE">Jabole</span> knew <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Acabado</span> who was a resident of the nearby barrio of <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Nato</span></span> prior to the stabbing. </p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant contends that the lower court erred in not sustaining
his defense of alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to him
and his witnesses, on the night of the incident he was in the barrio of <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Nato</span></span>, some 9 kilometers away from
the barrio of <st1:city><st1:place>San Isidro</st1:place></st1:city>, attending
a dance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention is
untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alibi is one of the weakest
defenses, and is easily fabricated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
have examined the testimonies in support of this defense of alibi, and have
found the same unworthy of cre­dence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even if the alibi were to be given credence it would not constitute a
good defense because the appellant could easily have taken time to go to the
barrio of San Isidro in half an hour by bicycle or in less than two hours by
foot and because of the positive identification of appel­lant, in the
circumstances, by Sunday <span class="SpellE">Jabole</span> and by the victim
himself. </p>

<p class="BODY">There being no mitigating or aggravating circumstance attending
the commission of the murder, appel­lant should be given the penalty of <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpe</u>tua</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The civil indemnity of P6<span class="GramE">,000</span> should be raised
to P12,000 (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pantoja</span>, G.R. No. L-18793, <st1:date year="1968" day="11" month="10">October 11, 1968</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, the appealed judgment is mo­dified
by: 1. sentencing the appellant <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Acabado</span> to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>
with the accessory penalties of the law; and 2. ordering the said appellant to
pay the heirs of Manuel Penis the sum of P12<span class="GramE">,000</span> as
civil in­demnity.</p>
