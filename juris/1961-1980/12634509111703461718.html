				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> City in its Civil Case No. 10485, dated June 28,
1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This case was originally brought
to the Court of Appeals, but subsequently certified to Us on the ground that
the issues raised are purely legal.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that on <st1:date year="1948" day="3" month="11">November
 3, 1948</st1:date>, the plaintiff filed an action against the defendant Nieves
de Lozano and her husband <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> Lozano for the
collection of a sum of money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
trial, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> on <st1:date year="1959" day="23" month="6">June
 23, 1959</st1:date> rendered its decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of which is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the court hereby renders judgment, sentencing the
de­fendants herein, Nieves de Lozano and <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
Lozano, to pay unto the herein plaintiff, <span class="SpellE">Hermogenes</span> <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>, the total sum of Three Thousand Five Hundred Pesos
and Seven Centavos (P3,500.07), <span style="">with
legal interest thereon from the date of the </span><span style="">filing </span><span style="">of the instant
complaint until fully paid.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>With costs against the said defendants."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the judgment, the defendants interposed an
appeal to the Court of Appeals but the ap­peal was dismissed on <st1:date year="1960" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1960</st1:date> for failure of the
defendants to file their brief on time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the record of the case was remanded to the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u><span style="">, </span>a writ of execution was issued, and
on <st1:date year="1960" day="18" month="8">August 18, 1960</st1:date> levy was
<span style="">made upon a parcel of land covered by
transfer certificate of title No. 8192 of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>
in the name of Nieves de Lozano.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
<span style="">notice of sale at public auction was
published in accordance with law and scheduled for </span><st1:date year="1960" day="16" month="9"><span style="">September 16, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On that date, however, defendant Nieves de Lozano made a partial
satisfaction of the judgment in the amount of P2,000.00, and requested for an
adjournment of the sale to <st1:date year="1960" day="26" month="10">October
 26, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On October 17,
1960, she filed an amended motion, dated October 14, alleging that on November
11, 1952, during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the case, defendant <span class="SpellE">Pas­cual</span> Lozano died and that the property levied upon was
her <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span> property, and praying that her
liability be fixed at one-half (1/2) of the amount awarded in the judg­ment and
that pending the resolution of the issue an order be issued restraining the Sheriff
from carrying out the auction sale scheduled o<span style="">n </span>October 26, 1960.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On that date the sale
proceeded anyway, and the property of Nieves de Lozano which had been levied
upon was sold to the judgment creditor, as the highest bidder, for the amount
of P4,175.12, the balance of the judgment debt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1960</st1:date>,
plaintiff filed an opposition to the defendant's amended motion dated <st1:date year="1960" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on <st1:date year="1961" day="28" month="6">June 28, 1961</st1:date>, the trial court issued the questioned
order, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of which is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the court hereby grants the motion of counsel for
defendant Nieves <span style="">de Lozano, dated
October 5, 1960, which was amended on October 14, 1960, and holds that the
liability of the said defendant under the judgment of June 23, 1959, is only joint,
or P1,750.04, which is one-half (1/2) of the judgment debt of P3,500.07 awarded
to the plaintiff and that the writ of execution be accordingly modified in the
sense that the liability of defendant Nieves de Lozano be only P1,750.04 with
legal interest from the date of the filing of the complaint on November 5, 1948
until fully paid, plus the amount of P21.28 which is also one-half (1/2) of the
costs taxed by the Clerk of Court against the defendant spouses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let the auction sale of the above-mentioned property
of defendant Nieves de Lozano pro­ceed to satisfy her liability of P1,750.04
with legal interest as above stated and the further sum of P21.28 representing
the costs, unless she voluntarily pays the same to the judg­ment creditor
(herein plaintiff).”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Plaintiff interposed an
appeal from the above-quoted order and assigned several errors, which present
three major issues, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(a)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">whether or not the judgment debt
could be satisfied from the pro­ceeds of the properties sold at public auction.</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Plaintiff-appellant
submits that a "<span class="SpellE">nunc</span> pro <span class="SpellE">tunc</span>"
order should have been </span><span style="">issued </span><span style="">by the trial court dismissing, as of November
11, 1952, the case against the late <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> Lozano by
reason of his death, and that the lower court should have corrected its
decision of June 23, </span><span style="">1959, by
striking out the letter "s" in the word "defend­ants" and
deleting the words "and <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> Lozano."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We do not think that the
action suggested would </span>be legally justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would entail a substantial amend­ment<span style=""> of the decision of </span><st1:date year="1959" day="23" month="6"><span style="">June 23,
 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">, which has long
be­come final and in fact partially executed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A decision which has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
can no longer be amended or corrected by the court except for clerical errors
or mistakes,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and however erroneous it may be, cannot be
disobeyed;</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> otherwise litigations would be endless and
no </span>questions could be considered finally settled.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The <span style="">amendment sought by appellant
involves not merely clerical errors but the very substance of the </span>controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it cannot be accomplished by the issuance
of a "<span class="SpellE">nunc</span> pro <span class="SpellE">tunc</span>"
order such as that sought in this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The purpose of an order "<span class="SpellE">nunc</span> pro <span class="SpellE">tunc</span>" is to make a present record of an order which
the court made at a previous term, but which was not then recorded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can only be made when the thing ordered
has previously been made, but by inadvertence has not been entered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case there was no order pre­viously
made by the court and therefore there is nothing now to be recorded.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Now then, it is clear
that the decision of </span><st1:date year="1959" day="23" month="6"><span style="">June 23, 1959</span></st1:date><span style=""> does not specify the extent of the liability
of each defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule is that when
the judgment does not order the defendants to pay jointly and severally their
liability is merely joint, and none of them may be compelled to satisfy the
judgment in full.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is in harmony
with Articles 1137 and 1138 of the </span>Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Plaintiff-appellant
contends that in any event </span>the entire judgment debt can be satisfied
from the proceeds of the property sold at public auction in view of the
presumption that it is conjugal in character although in the name of only one
of the spouses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention is
incorrect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The presumption under Article
160 of the Civil Code refers to property acquired during the marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in they instant case there is no showing
as to when the property in question was acquired, and hence the fact that the
title is in the wife's name alone is determinative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, appellant himself admits in his
brief (p. 17) that the property in question is <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant next points out that even if the land levied upon were
originally <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span>, it became conjugal property
by virtue of the construction of a house thereon at the expense of the common
fund, pursuant to Article 158, paragraph 2 of the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, it has been held by this Court that
the construction of a house at conjugal expense on the exclusive property of
one of the spouses does not automatically make it conjugal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that in the meantime the conjugal
partnership may use both the land and the building, but it does so not is owner
but in the exercise of the right of usufruct.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The ownership of the land remains the same until the value thereof is
paid, and this payment can only be demanded in the liquidation of the
partnership (<span class="SpellE">Coingco</span> vs. Flores, 82 Phil. 284; <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Bibby</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Padilla, 74 Phil. 377; Testate Estate of <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> Padilla, G. R. No. L-8748, <st1:date year="1961" day="26" month="12">Dec. 26, 1961</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The record does not show that there has already been a liquidation of
the conjugal partnership between the late <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
Lozano and Nieves de Lozano.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the property levied upon, being the separate property of
defendant Nieves de Lozano, cannot be made to answer for the liability of the
other defendant.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 18, 1967 counsel for defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
filed with Us a petition alleging, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>;
that prior to the expiration of the redemption period and pursuant to an order
of the lower court defendants filed a surety bond in the amount of P3,175.12 as
the redemption price, which bond was duly approved by the lower court; that
some­time last September 1966, defendants filed a petition before the lower
court praying that the sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> be
ordered to execute the corresponding deed of redemption in favor of defendant
Nieves de Lozano represented by her judi­cial administrator or that, in the
alternative, the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> City be
directed to cancel Entries Nos. 19234 and 20042 at the back of TCT No. 8192;
and that said petition was denied by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same prayer made below is <span style="">reiterated </span>in the said petition of <st1:date year="1967" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1967</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing petition of <st1:date year="1967" day="18" month="5">May
 18, 1967</st1:date> alleges facts which occurred after the perfection of the
present appeal and which should therefore be submitted to and passed upon by
the trial court in connection with the implementation of the order appealed
from, which is hereby affirmed, with costs.</p>
