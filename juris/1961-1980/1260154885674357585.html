				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On May 17, 1955, the Court of First Instance of Iloilo rendered against 
defendant Ernesto Hornada a decision (in Civil Case No. 2571), in favor of 
plaintiffs Vicente Penuela and Luis Pedregosa, the dispositive part of which 
reads:
<blockquote>
<p>"Por Tanto, el Juzgado falla este asunto:</p>
<p>"(<i>a</i>) Condenando al demandado que remueva el dique y la presa 
construidos en la parte sur y sureste, respectivamente, de su terreno;</p>
<p>"(<i>b</i>) Condenando al demandado que pague al demandante Luis Pedregosa, 
en concepto de daños actuales, 10 bultos de palay al año, equivalente a 20 
cavanes, a contar desde 1949 a 1952, ambos inclusiva;</p>
<p>"(<i>c</i>) Condenando al demandado que pague al demandante Vicente Penuela, 
en concepto de daños actuales, 10 bultos de palay al año, equivalente a 20 
cavanes, contar desde 1953 hasta que este asunto este decidido 
definitivamente;</p>
<p>"(<i>d</i>) Condenando al demandado que pague a los demandantes la suma de 
P1,000.00 en concepto de daños morales; y</p>
<p>"(<i>e</i>) Condenando, dademás al demandado que pague las costas del 
juicio.</p>
<p>"Asi se ordena."</p></blockquote>
<p>Dissatisfied with said decision, defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals 
(docketed as CA-G. R. No. 15871-R). Said court, on December 20, 1957, affirmed 
said decision <i>in toto</i>, except as to paragraph (d) of the abovequoted 
dispositive part, which it modified by eliminating the sum of P1,000.00 awarded 
as moral damages by the trial court.</p>
<p>On January 27, 1959, plaintiffs filed with the trial court a motion for 
execution (of said decision) and bill of costs. Said motion was set for the 
court's consideration on January 31, 1959. On said date, however, defendant 
moved for postponement to February 7, 1959 on the ground that he would file a 
written opposition thereto, and except to the bill of costs. Postponement was 
duly granted by the court. Notwithstanding said postponement, however, the 
court, on February 3, 1959, issued a writ of execution in favor of plaintiffs, 
which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"To: The Provincial Sheriff of Iloilo or any of his lawful Deputies:</p>
<p>"GREETINGS:</p>
<p>"Pursuant to the Decision of this Honorable Court dated May 17, 1955 which 
was modified by the resolution of the Honorable Court of Appeals dated December 
20, 1957 eliminating payment of any moral damages, you are hereby commanded to 
cause the defendant to remove the dike and dam constructed in the southern and 
southeastern part of his land; to pay the plaintiff Luis Pedregosa, in concept 
of actual damages, 10 <i>bultos</i> of palay per year, equivalent to 20 cavanes, 
counting from 1949 to 1952, both inclusive; to pay plaintiff Vicente Penuela, in 
concept of actual damages, 10 <i>bultos</i> of palay, equivalent to 20 cavanes, 
counting from 1953 until this case is finally decided; and to pay the costs of 
suit in the sum of P41.10 only in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo; and 
return this writ into Court within 60 days from date with your proceedings 
endorsed hereon;</p>
<p>"But, if sufficient personal property cannot be found whereof to satisfy this 
writ and lawful fees thereon, then we command you, that of the lands and 
buildings of the said defendant, you make the said sums of money in the manner 
required by law, and do likewise make return of your proceedings with this writ 
into Court within 60 days after its receipt by you."</p></blockquote>
<p>Before receiving said writ of execution, defendant, on February 4, 1959, 
within the time granted by the court, filed the following opposition to 
plaintiffs' aforesaid motion for execution and bill of coats (of January 27, 
1959):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Comes now defendant in the above-entitled case, by his undersigned counsel, 
and in opposition to the motion for execution and bill of costs dated January 
27, 1959, to this Honorable Court respectfully represents:</p>
<p>"1. That the decision of this Honorable Court requires the defendant to 
remove 'l dique y la presa construidos en la parte sur y sureste 
respectivamente', but the defendant does not know which dike or dam are to be 
removed, because there is a 'pilapil' or 'cajon' which is the boundary line 
between defendant's property and that of Federico Hornada and that of defendant; 
and that this dike cannot be removed or destroyed without the consent of 
Federico Hornada;</p>
<p>"2. That the small dam which is opened and closed by means of a board which 
is situated on the land of defendant will not impede the flow of the water to 
the Abaangay River, but is opened and closed to utilize the water to irrigate 
defendant's rice land;</p>
<p>"3. That with regards to ten <i>bultos</i> of palay to be paid to Luis 
Pedregosa beginning with the year 1949 to 1952, Luis Pedregosa is already dead, 
and the defendants does not know who are his heirs administrators or assigns who 
are not parties to this case, and Atty. Gemarino is not representing them;</p>
<p>"4. That as regards to the ten <i>bultos</i> of palay beginning with the year 
1953 to be paid to Vicente Penuela, the latter ceased to be its lessee in the 
year 1955 when the said property was sold to the brother and sister of Vicente 
Penuela's wife, and, therefore, he has no right to receive the said palay beyond 
the crop year 1954-55; moreover, beginning with the crop year 1953-54, Vicente 
Penuela had not suffered any demage because beginning that year there was little 
water coming from his land to the property of the defendant due to the long 
draught; and</p>
<p>"5. That the defendant is willing to present evidence to prove the 
observation and objections above mentioned on the date that may be fixed by the 
court.</p>
<p>"WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that the issuance of execution in 
consonance with the decision of this Court be deferred until the above 
observations and objections can be passed upon by the Court."</p></blockquote>
<p>On February 7, 1959, the date to which the consideration of plaintiffs' 
motion for execution and bill of costs (of January 27, 1959), has been 
postponed, the court suggested to defendant that he file a motion for 
reconsideration, in view of the fact that it (court) had already issued the 
aforementioned writ of execution (dated February 3, 1959). Complying with the 
court's suggestion, defendant on February 11, 1959, filed a motion for 
reconsideration, alleging, <i>inter alia</i>, that when plaintiffs' motion for 
execution and bill of costs (of January 27, 1959) and defendant's opposition 
thereto (of January 4, 1959) were called for consideration and resolution of the 
court on February 7, 1959, "the court refused to resolve the same, on the ground 
that the Writ of Execution has already been issued"; that considering the 
grounds of his opposition (as stated in paragraph 4 thereof), "the consideration 
of plaintiff's motion should have been deferred, or the writ of execution should 
have been stayed until the matters stated in defendant's opposition shall have 
been resolved first"; and that he "is willing to present evidence to prove and 
substantiate the observations and objections" mentioned on the date which may be 
fixed by the Court. On February 17, 1959, said motion for reconsideration was 
denied by the court, in an order of this tenor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"No encontrandola bien fundada, se deniega la moción de reconsideración del 
demandado de fecha 11 de febrero de 1958 y se mantiene la orden de este Juzgado 
de fecha 3 de febrero de 1957.</p>
<p>"Asi se ordena."</p></blockquote>
<p>Hence, this appeal.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span></p>
<p>The appeal is meritorious. It is not disputed that on January 27, 1959, 
plaintiffs filed with the trial court a motion for execution of its decision of 
May 17, 1955 (affirmed with modification by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 
15871-R on December 20, 1957) and bill of costs. Said motion was set for hearing 
on January 31, 1959. On said date, defendant moved for postponement of the 
hearing to February 7, 1959 as he would file a written opposition to the motion 
for execution and bill of costs. The court duly granted defendant's petition. 
Despite this grant of postponement, however, and before defendant could file his 
announced written opposition, the trial court issued the writ of execution 
prayed for by plaintiffs on February 3, 1959, i.e., one (1) day prior to the 
filing by defendant of his written opposition on February 4, 1959. On February 
7, 1959, when the motion for execution and the opposition thereto came up for 
hearing, the court suggested that a motion for reconsideration of the order of 
execution already issued be filed by defendant, which the latter did, only to be 
denied on February 17, 1959. This actuation of the trial court is, to our mind, 
a reversible error considering that the opposition and the motion for 
reconsideration aver facts which, if established as defendant offered to do, 
would constitute equitable grounds for stay of execution. The defendant sought 
clarification of the precise dam and water gate ("presa") he was ordered to 
remove, there being: another dike ("pilapil" or "cajon") on the same portion of 
his land mentioned in the decision. He, likewise, informed the court of the 
death of plaintiff Luis Pedregosa subsequent to the decision, and the fact that 
his heirs or administrator are unknown, for which reason there was uncertainty 
as to whom to pay the ten <i>bultos</i> of palay mentioned in the decision. 
Finally, defendant submitted that the other plaintiff, Vicente Penuela, in whose 
favor as lessee of the land defendant was also sentenced to pay ten 
<i>bultos</i> of palay annually from 1953 up to the date the case is definitely 
decided<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span> ("hasta que este asunto este 
decidido definitivamente") had ceased to be such lessee since 1955, long before 
the case has been definitely decided. Certainly, these facts, especially the 
last two which have occurred <i>after</i> the decision of the trial court which 
was affirmed (except for the grant of moral damages) by the Court of Appeals, 
fully justify the stay of execution until the matter shall have been determined 
by the court after due hearing thereon.</p>
<p>For all the foregoing, the writ of execution dated February 3, 1959, as well 
as the order of the trial court dated February 17, 1959 denying defendant's 
motion for reconsideration of the said writ, are hereby set aside. The case is 
remanded to the lower court, with direction to receive evidence on and, 
accordingly, decide defendant's opposition to plaintiff's petition for 
execution. Without costs. So ordered.</p><i>Bengzon, Acting C.J., Padilla, 
Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L.,</i> and <i>Dizon, JJ.,</i> 
concur. <br><br><br>
