<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1971" day="15" month="10">15 October 1971</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabuhay</span>
Rubber Corporation<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
asked this Court for leave to withdraw its intervention in the <span style="">case </span>at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its petition, the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
claimed that it entered into a "Memorandum of Agreement" dated <st1:date year="1971" day="28" month="7">28 July 1971</st1:date> with the Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">The above "Memorandum of Agreement" relates mainly to a
modification in the schedule of payments to be made by the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
on the “P5,346,884.79 total value" of the reparations goods delivered to <span style="">it, covered by three separate contracts of
conditional purchase and sale dated 25 May 1964, 4 December 1964 and 17 January
1965 entered into with the Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
stipulation in the "Memorandum of Agreement" provides that except for
the revision in the schedule of payments, all the other terms and conditions
set forth in the three contracts of condi­tional purchase and sale "shall
remain unchanged and in full force and effect."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, both the aforesaid contracts dated 4 December
1964 and 17 January 1965 include a provision stating that the payments to be
made by the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> on the reparations goods it
acquired "shall be on the basis of the free market rate of exchange
pursuant to the Presidential directive of March 28, 1963, without prejudice to
re-adjustment should the courts finally declare invalid the imposition of the
free market rate." The contract dated 25 May 1964, however, merely states
that "the f.o.b. US dollar currency value of the reparations goods shall
be payable in its equivalent in Philippine peso currency computed at such rate
of exchange as shall be finally determined in [the aforesaid] Civil Case No.
54375, it being expressly understood and agreed upon, however, that the peso
equivalent of the dollar value of the goods to be reflected in the Schedule of
Payments shall be expressed in Philippine currency at a rate finally determined
by the Court in <span style="">said </span>Civil Case
No. 54375."</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, this Court, using the free market rate of exchange
decreed by the Presidential Directive dated 30 October 1962, as further
clarified on 28 March 1963, as the <span style="">basis
</span>in the conversion <span style="">of the
US-dollar-stated cost of the reparations goods acquired by the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> into Philippine pesos, granted the <span class="SpellE">intervenor's</span> petition for the withdrawal of its
intervention in a resolution dated 21 October 1971.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At the outset, the main conclusions articu­lated in this Court's
decision of 22 February 1968 now questioned by the CMI relate to the
following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the Contract to
Purchase dated 29 November 1961 -- which contract excludes a specific
description of both the objects to be procured and the price to be paid <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> and omits an express stipulation as to the rate of
exchange to be used in the conver­sion into Philippine pesos of the US dollar
procure­ment cost of the reparations goods applied for -- ­merely constitutes a
preliminary agreement; (2) that the said Contract to Purchase, even on the
assumption that it partakes of the nature of a perfected contract between the
parties, "can only be so with respect to the rights and obligations
therein stipulated and agreed upon by the parties"; and (3) that the
application by the Commission of the free market rate of exchange in the
determination of the Philippine peso cost of the reparations goods "would
not spell impairment of any obligation" under the said contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">Observably, the CMI, in its more than eighty-page "Motion
for Reconsideration and/or Clarification," advances numerous impressive
arguments, all intended to persuade this Court to reconsider its decision of 22
February 1968, set it aside, and enter a new one in its favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It certainly requires but the minimum of
effort to understand the whys for the laborious pains taken by the CMI to
convince this Court now to take a completely different view of the case under
consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And aptly, a discussion
of these numerous arguments proffered by the CMI appears, at this stage of the
proceedings, profitless and unnecessary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After all, most, if not all, of the arguments of the CMI, reduced to
their bare and <span style="">simple terms, constitute
reiterations and reproductions, if not mere rehashes, of the same arguments it
previously submitted for consideration by the court <u>a</u> </span><u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> as well as by this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="">This Court indeed, in the consideration
of this case, not only carefully conducted a study in depth of all the issues
raised but also objectively examined and deliberated upon all the arguments,
extending to their legal and factual bases and implications, submitted by the
CMI and the Commission in support of their respective stands in relation to the
said issues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its decision of <st1:date year="1968" day="22" month="2">22 February 1968</st1:date>, this Court
extensively discussed the legal aspects of the controversy, delving into the
juridi­cal relations between the CMI and the Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court thus deems it an exercise in
superfluity as well as in redundancy to disclose and further expound on -- in
this resolution -- the <u>minutiae</u> of the legal considerations which
constituted the main emphasis of the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For these considerations, in
the main, adequately and squarely answer the legal postulates tendered by the
CMI in its action against the Commission in the first instance and in the
subsequent appeal to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the nature of the case at bar and the importance and
significance of the issues posed render imperative a disquisition on certain
consi­derations in support of the main conclusions arrived at by this Court
clearly spelled out and fully explained in the decision of 22 February
1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, there arises
the need, by way of preface to a further exposition of these additional considerations,
to restate briefly the reasons for the holding that the Contract to Purchase
constitutes and "reveals all the earmarks of a mere preliminary
agreement." This Court so opined for the said Contract to Purchase
significantly carried neither any specific description of both the objects to
be procured and the price to be paid <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> nor any
express stipulation as to the rate of exchange to be used in the determination
of the Philippine peso equivalent of the US dollar value of the repa­rations goods
applied for and procured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court
stated that the agreement, as is obvious from its face, "does not contain,
and was not intended to contain, all of the important terms and conditions of
the future contract," thereby leaving them for future determination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Contract to Purchase is thereby rendered
incomplete and necessitated a stipulation therein for the execution, before the
<span style="">delivery of the reparations goods to
the CMI of a <span style="">contract </span></span><span style="">of </span><span style="">conditional purchase and sale "wherein
the dollar price </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">goods may be reduced into its peso equivalent" to supersede the
former agreement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">An analysis of the aforementioned steps or phases attached to the
procurement program of repa­rations goods in implementation of the Reparations <span style="">Agreement easily results in the observation
that the conclusion between the Commission and the applicant </span><span style="">end-user of </span><span style="">any agreement -- wherein the </span><span style="">Commission </span><span style="">gives "due
course" to the application of the applicant end-user; wherein the said
applicant end-user "engages itself to perform" certain obligations
derived from the pertinent provisions of Republic Act 1789, as amended; and,
notably, wherein the parties agree to enter into a subsequent contract to
supersede the earlier agreement -- evidences nothing more than the parties’
participation in a simple preliminary tran­saction, devoid of any obligatory
effect whatsoever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The qualification of
such a transaction into a com­plete one attaches only upon the conclusion of

The CMI and the Commission entered into the Contract to Purchase on <st1:date year="1961" day="29" month="11">29 November 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Verily, it appears evident that at the time
of the execution of the Contract to Purchase, the CMI fully knew the status of
the said agreement, particularly in relation to the reparations goods it
applied for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, the very schedule
which included the said goods in its commodity list was still pending for
consultation between the Philippine and Japanese governments.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such a schedule, a tentative one, takes the form of a mere
proposed catalogue of items of specific goods which the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
seeks to requisition from <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>

the tentative </span>one, <span style="">the Japanese
government enjoys a certain latitude of discretion to <span style="">ask </span>for the deferment of any specific request for any given
reparations item.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Consi­dering this, the Commission could thus
reasonably ascertain the reparations goods subject to its disposition for
allocation only after the conclusion of the agreed annual schedule between the </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Mission</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Japan</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> and the Japanese government.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, the inclusion of the reparations goods applied for
by an applicant end-user in the tentative schedule constitutes no guaranty of a
definite allocation of the said reparations goods in favor of the said
applicant end-user.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As observed by this Court
in <u><span style="">Terminal Shipping Corpo­ration
vs. Hon. Juan L. <span class="SpellE">Bocar</span> and </span>the </u><u><span style="">Reparations Commission</span></u><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the annual tentative schedule formu­lated by
the Commission has "to have some measure of flexibility," a quality
"designed to meet the exigencies of bilateral negotiation and to keep pace
with the ever-changing needs of a developing nation like ours." This Court
therein also observed that --<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Section 6, 2nd paragraph, sub-paragraph (a) of the
Reparations Act, as amended, categorically allows subsequent change in the
tentative schedule involving any <span style="">item
or project, whether by addition, substitution or deletion, whether in kind,
quantity, or value, whether partial or total, provided that such change has
been duly endorsed </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">the National Economic Council and approved by
the President."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">And subject to the same extent and
limitations as provided, the same provision of Republic Act 1789, as amended,
also allows change even <span style="">in </span>the
agreed schedule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the law itself
concedes the sub­sequent revision of the schedule -- either the <span style="">tentative schedule prepared by the Commission
or the agreed one concluded by the Mission in Japan with the Japanese
government -- constitutes another indisputable <span class="SpellE"><u>indicium</u></span>
of the uncertainty of a definite allocation of reparations goods in favor of a
parti­cular applicant end-user.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">All these considerations, relating to a mate­rial matter in the
Contract to Purchase the reparations goods applied for, the CMI apparently
overlooked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It failed to reckon with the
relative importance of these phases of the procurement program to the
qualification of the agreement it entered into with the <span style="">Commission as a complete one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 7 (b) <span style="">of </span>Republic
Act 1789, as amended, and Article 5 of <span style="">the
</span>Reparations Agreement spell out other details of <span style="">comparative </span>significant effect <span style="">on </span>the Contract to Purchase between the CMI and the
Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both section <span style="">7 </span>(b) and Article 5 provide that the
authority to conclude, on behalf <span style="">of the
Philippine government, any proposed repara­tions contract with any Japanese
national or </span><span style="">firm </span><span style="">for the manufacture, production or supply of
reparations goods resides with the Mission in Japan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 5, however, subjects the proposed
reparations contract, before its conclusion by the </span><span style="">Mission </span><span style="">with the Japanese national or firm, to
verification by the Japanese government as to its compliance with (a) the terms
of the Reparations Agreement; (b) the provisions of arrangements between the
two governments for the implementation of the said Agreement; and (c) the
applicable schedule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the said
Article requires the Japanese government to examine all aspects of the proposed
reparations contract and to determine their acceptability or non-acceptability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the favorable action taken, under such requirements by the
Japanese government on the proposed reparations contract -- which contract
provides for either the manufacture or production <span style="">or supply by the particular Japanese </span><span style="">national </span><span style="">or firm of the
specific reparations items verified as to their approved specifications --
finally rests the availability of the reparations goods subject of the
preliminary agreement between the applicant end-user and the Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the availability of the reparations
goods applied for definitely ascertained, the procurement of the said goods for
and in behalf of the applicant end-user becomes actually and absolutely
certain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This then qualifies the
transaction, evidenced by the Contract to Purchase, between the applicant
end-user and the Commission into a complete one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More importantly, such completion of the transaction
makes operative the essential commitment of the parties expressly stipulated in
the Contract to Purchase, which is, the execution of the contract of
conditional purchase and sale for the reparations goods "accordingly
procured."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant <span style="">case, </span>the
records clearly indicate the verification by the Japanese government of the
reparations contract for the procurement of the reparations goods applied for
by the CMI on 1 April 1963.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, on 1 April 1963, the definite availability of the said goods became
finally certain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The element of
completeness then accrued to the Contract to Purchase entered into between the
CMI and the Commission on 29 November 1961 and the comple<span style="">tion of the said transaction, in turn,
rendered in force the obligation of the parties to execute the contract of
conditional purchase and sale -- a contract to supersede the antecedent
agreement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><u>II</u></p>

<p class="BODY">The other point being challenged vehemently by the CMI relates to
the conclusion reached by this Court in its decision dated 22 February 1968 on
the appropriate use of the free market rate of exchange <span style="">of the Philippine peso to the United States dollar in fixing the peso
cost of the reparations goods requisitioned by the Commission from Japan for
allo­cation to the CMI.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this matter,
the CMI claims that the reparations goods it requested are payable in "a
sum in Philippine currency equivalent to the procurement cost at the exchange
rate of P2 for $1." This, insists the CMI, constitutes the express under­standing
and agreement of the parties at the time of the execution of the Contract to
Purchase.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The arguments the CMI proffers on this parti­cular point also
hardly warrant an extended discussion and this Court sees no valid reason to
adopt a different or modified stand in favor of the said CMI on the question
raised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, the CMI chooses a
rather inflexible stand on the problem instead of taking an approach fairly
consistent with the economic realities of the situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, inasmuch as <span style="">the question on </span>the applica­bility of
either the free market rate of exchange obtaining in the Philippines as of the
time of the procurement of the reparations items from Japan or the rate of
exchange of P2 for every $1 in ascertaining the peso cost of the goods
constitutes a matter of vital interest and importance not only to the CMI but
also to others similarly situated, this Court deems it peremptory to expound
on, although not at length, several additional considerations which underscore
the rejection of the said <span class="SpellE">CMI's</span> reiterated contentions.</p>

<p class="BODY">To start with, Article 1 of the Reparations Agreement fixes and
expresses Japan's reparations obligation as a definite amount in United States
dollars payable in such amount of Japanese yen equivalent to such amount of
dollars within the period and in the manner prescribed in the said
Agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Memorandum dated 30 April
1956 re the <u>Analysis </u><u><span style="">of the
Draft Agreements Negotiated by the Philippine and Japanese Technical Panels</span></u><span style=""> </span>provides an insight into the
particular reason for measuring Japan's obliga­tion in terms of a currency
foreign to both the Philippines and Japan.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Memorandum, in no uncertain terms, states:</p>

<blockquote>"Inasmuch as the yen is not a stable currency and one that may
be devalued any time, it is not safe to fix Japan's reparations obliga­tion in
yen because in the event of its devaluation, the Philippines would get less
reparations in Japanese services and products.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>As the
United States dollar is more stable in value than the Japanese yen, Japan's
obligation expressed in dollars is a more stable and reliable measure of such
obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should the yen be devalued
some time in the future, s<span style="">uch as
devaluation will have no effect on the quantity of the services and products
that the Philippines would get as reparations because under Article 1 … Japan
is obliged to set aside whatever amount of yen is necessary to discharge its
obligation thus expressed in United States dollars."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The said Memorandum also relates that the
original Japanese draft proposal for Article 1 specified the reparations
obligation of Japan in terms of the yen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Philippine Technical Panel did not find this proposal acceptable so
as to recommend its adoption by the Philippine Plenipotentiary Panel for the
main reason that this proposed version of Article 1 subjected the value of the
reparations obligation of Japan to the fluctuation of the then unstable yen.</p>

<p class="BODY">The expression thus of the monetary value of Japan's obligation
in US dollars -- then the foreign exchange considered established in its
convertibility as well as in its stability in value in relation to other
foreign currencies -- stems from the intention of the Philippine government to
obtain Japanese services and goods equivalent as nearly as possible in worth to
the true value of the said Japanese obligation as expressed and fixed in US
dollars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considered in the light that
the Philippines originally claimed from Japan the amount of $8,000,000,000<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
(although scaled down later to an "irreducible minimum" of
$1,000,000,000)<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
as reparations settle­ment, the observation that the Philippine govern­ment
assuredly aimed and intended -- by way of insisting on stipulating Japan's
obligation in US dollars in the Reparations Agreement -- to obtain for the
Philippines and the Filipino people Japanese services and goods worth not only
the total but also <span style="">the true value of
the considerably reduced amount of $550,000,000 becomes one of </span><span style="">utmost </span><span style="">importance and significance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, any transaction by the <span style="">Commis­sion </span>relating to the distribution of the reparations
goods, particularly the sale thereof to an applicant end-user -- in line with
the foregoing and to realize the discovered design of the Philippine government
to obtain the maximum benefit derived from either the utilization or the
disposition of the reparations goods -- necessarily calls for a recompense
equiva­lent to the true worth of the said goods as expressed in US dollars,
that is, a <u><span style="">quid</span></u><span style=""> <u>pro</u> <u>quo</u></span>
arrangement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Translated into terms
apposite to <span style="">the particular question </span>raised
by the case at bar, this requires the applicant end-user, the CMI, to <span style="">deliver </span>to the <span style="">Com­mission </span>the amount (referred to as the procurement cost) in
Philippine pesos <span style="">corresponding as
nearly as </span>possible to the true and exact value of the re­parations goods
procured -- machineries and equip­ment for an integrated cotton and rayon
textile plant -- as stated in US dollars.</p>

<p class="BODY">The concomitant dilemma as to the translation of the value of the
reparations goods expressed in <span style="">US </span>dollars
into Philippine pesos poses no real difficulty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The actual and exact procurement cost <span style="">of the reparations goods -- and this the </span><span style="">CMI </span><span style="">admits</span><a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> -- becomes known to the applicant end-user
and the Commission only </span><span style="">upon the
</span><span style="">submission and transmission by
the Mission to the said Commission of the Summary Statement of Costs covering
the reparations goods procured and already shipped to the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This statement quotes the procurement cost --
</span><span style="">fixed </span><span style="">and specified in </span><span style="">US </span><span style="">dollars -- of the reparations goods as reflected in the reparations
contract entered into between the Mission and the Japanese manufacturer,
producer or supplier concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plainly,
under the circumstances, the prevailing rate of exchange (of the Philippine peso
to the US dollar) at the time of that particular phase of the procurement
program when the procurement cost becomes fixed and certain as well as
definitely ascertained -- more specifically, upon the conclusion by the Mission
of the reparations contracts with the Japanese manufacturer, producer or
supplier concerned -- constitutes the appropriate measure for converting the
US-dollar-stated procurement cost of the reparations goods into the domestic
currency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, if the Commission
secures for an applicant end-user an animal feed plant with the procurement
cost of $1,500,000 per the Summary Statement of Costs as well as the
reparations contract, and the free money market at that time when the Mission
concluded the reparations contract with the Japanese supplier of the said plant
dictates a rate of exchange (of the Philippine peso to the US dollar) of P3 for
every $1, the peso cost of the said plant, after the proper translation, would
amount to P4,500,000.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This of course necessarily implies no determinate rate of <span style="">exchange </span>(of the Philippine peso to <span style="">the US </span>dollar) for use by the
Commission in fixing the procurement cost in Philippine pesos of all the items
it requisitions from Japan as reparations for applicant end-users.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any change -- rise or fall -? <span style="">in the purchasing power of the Philippine peso
in the foreign money exchange, particularly in relation to the US dollar, would
consequently affect the translation of the US-dollar-stated procurement cost of
the reparations goods into Philippine pesos.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In such wise, the conversion of the procurement cost -- ­stated in US
dollars -- into Philippine pesos definitely </span><span style="">rests on </span><span style="">whatever </span><span style="">rate </span><span style="">of exchange (of the Philippine peso to the US dollar) obtains -- to
repeat -- at the time of that particular phase of the procurement program when
the said cost becomes not only fixed and certain but also definitely
ascertained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For indeed, if Republic Act
1789, as amended, required the applicant end-user to pay the procurement cost
of the reparations goods it applied for in US dollars, the said applicant
end-user would have to purchase, with the necessary amount of Philippine pesos,
US dollars at no matter what rate of exchange (of the Philippine peso to the US
dollar) prevails at the time it would make payment to the Commission in order
to satisfy the said cost.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><u><span style="">Apropos</span></u><span style=""> </span>to all of these, the circumstance
that an applicant end-user chooses to acquire reparations goods on a credit
basis, preferring to pay on install<span style="">ments</span><a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the cost of the said goods according to a
schedule of payments, creates no effect on the said cost expressed in US
dollars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No justification exists for
demanding of the applicant end-user to shoulder an unwarranted burden:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that of requiring it, after splitting the
US-dollar-stated procure­ment cost into equal amounts, to make payment of every
installment in a sum in Philippine pesos cor­responding to the installment
amount stated in US dollars converted at the rate of exchange (of the
Philippine peso to the US dollar) obtaining at the time the said installment
payment falls due.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It suffices that the
translation exclusively involves the total US-dollar-stated procurement cost
and makes use of a single measure of conversion -- that rate of exchange (of
the Philippine peso to the US dollar) prevailing at the time of that particular
phase of the procurement program when the said cost becomes fixed and certain
as well as definitely ascertained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the controversy at bar, the Mission concluded reparations
contracts for the procurement of the reparations goods applied for by the CMI
with the corresponding Japanese suppliers sometime in April 1963.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
Consistency with all the foregoing demands the adoption of that money market
rate of exchange of the Philippine peso <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> the
US dollar prevailing at that time in the determination of the peso equivalent
of the procurement cost of the reparations goods expressed in US dollars.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">All told, this Court finds no compelling reason to disturb the
conclusions set forth in the decision promulgated on 22 February 1968 assailed
by the CMI.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court's extended dis­cussion<span style=""> of the considerations herein included more
than suffices to further dispose of and settle the issues raised and already

In sales of reparations goods on credit <span style="">basis,
</span>section 12 of Republic Act 1789, as amended, requires the first
installment to be paid at a prescribed period after complete delivery of the
goods, and the balance to be paid in equal annual installments with interest at
three per cent <u>per annum</u> within a period fixed by the Commission after
considering the economic life expectancy of the goods but in no case exceeding
10 years from the date the first installment becomes due in case of ordinary
capital goods and 20 years in case of ocean-going v<span style="">essels.</span></p>
