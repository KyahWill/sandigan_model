				<H3>LAURENTIO ARMENTIA, PLAINTIFF-APPELLANT, VS. ERLINDA PATRIARCA, FLORENCIA SOMECIERA, JULIANA ARMENTIA, JOSE SOMECIERA AND SOFRONIO FLORES, IN HIS CAPACITY AS THE REGISTER OF DEEDS FOR THE PROVINCE OF ILOILO, DEFENDANTS-APPELLEES.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>SANCHEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align=""><div align="justify"><br><p>Plaintiff Laurentio Armentia, and Juliana and Marta Armentia, were brother 
and sisters of the full blood. Jose Someciera is the acknowledged natural son of 
their deceased mother. Defendant Florencia Someciera is a daughter of Jose 
Someciera. Defendant Erlinda Patriarca is a grand-daughter of Juliana Armentia. 
Marta Armentia was married to Gregorio Bueno who died sometime in 1942.</p>
<p>By notarial document, Annex A of the complaint, dated July 22, 1955, Marta 
Armentia did two things: First, she adjudicated to herself a parcel of land [Lot 
5482, Pototan cadastre, (Iloilo)] with the improvements thereon, covered by 
Transfer Certificate of Title 21323—and which she inherited from her deceased 
husband—pursuant to Section 1, Rule 74 of the 1940 Rules of Court;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1] </sup>and second, for and in consideration of 
P99.00, which she acknowledged to have received from Erlinda Patriarca, 13 years 
of age, single, and Florencia Someciera, 20 years of age, single, she sold to 
them the property just mentioned. The foregoing document was, on July 22, 1955, 
recorded in the registry of deeds. Whereupon, Torrens title 21323 was cancelled 
by Transfer Certificate of Title 18797 in the names of Erlinda Patriarca and 
Florencia Someciera.</p>
<p>Marta Armentia died intestate and without forced heirs on May 28, 1960.</p>
<p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></sup>On September 17, 1960, Laurentio 
Armentia commenced suit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> against 
Erlinda Patriarca and Florencia Someciera as principal defendants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The complaint, as amended, and reamended, 
avers: That the sale made by Marta in favor of Erlinda and Florencia "is null 
and void because it is simulated and fictitious and if not null and void it is 
voidable because the said defendants were minors at the time the contract was 
executed and could not then have given their consent to the sale"; that "the 
said sale was fraudulently executed, and after the supposed sale, Marta Armentia 
remained in possession of the house and lot, as owner paying the taxes on the 
land until she died"; that "even assuming hypothetically that there was 
consideration in the supposed sale, the consideration was grossly inadequate"; 
that "plaintiff only came to know of the supposed sale in Annex A one week 
before the suit was filed"; that "at the time of the alleged sale in Annex A", 
the "house was already standing on the land", and that "after its execution 
Marta Armentia repaired the house"; and that "the defendants Erlinda Patriarca, 
Plorencia Someciera, Juliana Armentia and Jose Someciera are personally 
possessing the land and the house in question". The complaint further avers that 
Marta Armentia also left a "Singer" sewing machine. Paragraph 8 thereof says 
that said sewing machine is "now in the possession of Erlinda Patriarca and 
Florencia Someciera". However, paragraph 20 of the very same complaint speaks of 
said sewing machine as "now in the possession of the defendants Erlinda 
Patriarca, Florencia Someciera, Jose Someciera and Juliana Armentia".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p>
<p>The complaint winds up with the prayer that the deed of sale be "declared 
inexistent or in the alternative annulled"; that plaintiff Laurentio Armentia 
and defendant Juliana Armentia, as heirs of Marta Armentia, be declared owners 
of the land in dispute; that the Register of Deeds be directed to cancel Torrens 
title 18797 in the names of Erlinda Patriarca and Florencia Someciera, and, in 
lieu thereof, to issue a new title in the names of Laurentio Armentia and 
Juliana Armentia; that the house and lot and sewing machine be partitioned and 
plaintiff's share be delivered to him; and that should partition not be 
feasible, said properties be sold and plaintiff given his share.</p>
<p>The complaint was met by defendant's motion to dismiss upon two grounds: (1) 
lack of cause of action and (2) prescription.</p>
<p>On November 21, 1960, over plaintiff's opposition, the lower court dismissed 
the case for the reason that plaintiff's action to annul the sale had 
prescribed. A move to reconsider was thwarted by the court in its order of 
December 17, 1960.</p>
<p>The case is now before us on plaintiff's appeal <i>in forma pauperis</i>.</p>
<ol><li>Plaintiff's attack is primarily directed at the sale. Plaintiff charges that 
the contract therefor was fraudulently executed, but in the same breadth 
characterizes it as simulated and fictitious. These statements are but 
conclusions of law. Controlling, of course, is the statement of ultimate 
facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
<p>Let us then look at the factual-recitals. Particularly striking is the fact 
that plaintiff does not dispute the self-adjudication made by Marta Armentia in 
the deed. Plaintiff does not impugn the genuineness of Marta's signature 
thereon. He solely puts in issue that portion of the document where the sale 
appears to have been made to Erlinda Patriarca and Florencia Someciera.</p>
<p>To drive home his averment of nullity, plaintiff summons to his aid the 
following circumstances: At the time of the sale, the vendees were still minors 
and the consideration was grossly inadequate; after the sale, Marta Armentia 
repaired the house, continued possession of the premises, paid the taxes thereon 
until her demise.</p>
<p>Hypothetically admitting the truth of these allegations, the conclusion is 
irresistible that the sale is merely voidable. Because Marta Armentia executed 
the document, and this is not controverted by plaintiff. Besides, the fact that 
the vendees were minors, makes the contract, at worst, annullable by them. Then 
again, inadequacy of consideration does not imply total want of consideration. 
Without more, the purported acts of Marta Armentia after the sale do not 
indicate that said sale was void from the beginning.</p>
<p>The sum total of all of these is that, in essence, plaintiff's case is 
bottomed on fraud, which renders the contract voidable.</p>
</li><li>May plaintiff annul the sale on the theory of fraud? Plaintiff was but a 
brother of the deceased Marta Armentia. True, he is an intestate heir of Marta; 
but he is not a forced heir. Upon the other hand, Marta was free to dispose of 
her properties the way she liked it. She had neither ascendants nor descendants. 

<p>By Article 1397 of the Civil Code, "[t]he action for annulment of contracts 
may be instituted by all who are thereby obliged principally or subsidiarily". 
This must be construed in conjunction with Article 1311 of the same code 
providing that "[c]ontracts take effect only between the parties, their assigns 
and heirs except in case where the rights and obligations arising from the 
contract are not transmissible by their nature, or by stipulation or by 
provision of law", and that "the heir is not liable beyond the value of the 
property he received from the decedent". Plaintiff is not a forced heir. He is 
not obliged principally or subsidiarily under the contract. Marta Armentia did 
not transmit to him by devise or otherwise any rights to the property, the 
subject thereof. On the contrary, Marta voluntarily disposed of it. No creditors 
are defrauded; there are none. No legitimes are impaired. Therefore, plaintiff 
has no cause of action to annul or to rescind the sale.</p>
<p>In point is <i>Concepcion vs. Sta. Ana</i>, 87 Phil. 787. The facts there may 
well be analogized with those of the present. In the <i>Concepcion</i> case, 
plaintiff Monico Concepcion was the only surviving legitimate brother of 
Perpetua Concepcion, who died without issue and without leaving any will. In her 
lifetime, or more precisely, on June 29, 1945, said Perpetua Con- cepcion, "in 
connivance with the defendant and with intent to defraud the plaintiff, sold and 
conveyed three parcels of land for a <i>false and fictitious consideration</i> 
to the defendant, who secured transfer certificates of title of said lands 
issued under her name; and that the defendant has been in possession of the 
properties sold since the death of Perpetua Concepcion, thereby causing damages 
to the plaintiff in the amount of not less than two hundred (P200) pesos."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> On motion to dismiss, the lower court 
threw the complaint out of court upon the ground that "the plaintiff is not a 
party to the deed of sale executed by Perpetua Concepcion in favor of the 
defendant"; that even on the assumption "that the consideration of the contract 
is fictitious, the plaintiff has no right of action against the defendant"; that 
under Article 1302 of the old Civil Code, "the action to annul a contract may be 
brought by any person principally or subsidiarily bound thereby;" that 
"plaintiff is not bound by the deed of sale executed by the deceased in favor of 
the defendant"; and that he has "no obligations under the deed." </p>
<p>The following reproduced <i>in haec verba</i> from the <i>Concepcion</i> 
opinion is illuminating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(2) As to the appellant's second and last contention, under the law action 
to annul a contract entered into with all the requisites mentioned in article 
1261<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> whenever they are tainted with 
the vice which invalidate them in accordance with law, may be brought not only 
by any person principally bound or who made them, but also by his <i>heir to 
whom the right and obligation arising from the contract are transmitted.</i> 
Hence if no such rights, actions or obligations have been transmitted to the 
heir, the latter <i>can not</i> bring an action to annul the contract in 
representation of the contracting party who made it. In Wolfson <i>vs</i>. 
Estate of Martinez, 20 Phil., 340, this Supreme Court quoted with approval the 
judgment of the Supreme Court of Spain of April 18, 1901, in which it was held 
that 'he who is not a party to a contract, or an assignee thereunder, or does 
not represent those who took part therein, has under articles 1257 and 1302<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> of the Civil Code <i>no legal capacity to 
challenge the validity</i> of such contract.' And in Irlanda <i>vs</i>. Pitargue 
(22 Phil. 383) we held that 'the <i>testamentary</i> or <i>legal heir</i> 
continues in law as the juridical personality of his predecessor in interest, 
who transmit to him from the moment of his death such of his rights, actions and 
obligations as are not extinguished thereby'.</p>
<p>The question to be resolved is, therefore, whether the deceased Perpetua 
Concepcion has transmitted to the plaintiff any right arising from the contract 
under consideration in order that he can bring an action to annul the sale 
voluntarily made by her to the defendant with a false consideration.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion and so hold, that the late Perpetua Concepcion <i>has 
not transmitted</i> to the plaintiff any right arising from the contract of 
conveyance or sale of her lands to the defendant, and therefore the <i>plaintiff 
cannot file an action to annul</i> such contract as representative of the 
deceased.</p>
<p>According to the complaint the deceased, in connivance with the defendant and 
with intent to defraud the plaintiff, (that is, in order not to leave the 
properties above mentioned upon her death to the plaintiff) sold and conveyed 
them to the latter, for a <i>false and fictitious consideration</i>. It is, 
therefore obvious, that the conveyance or sale of said properties to the 
defendant was <i>voluntarily</i> made by the deceased to said defendant. As the 
deceased had no forced heir, she was free to dispose of all her properties as 
absolute owner thereof, without further limitation than those established by 
law, and the <i>right to dispose of a thing involves the right to give or convey 
it to another without any consideration</i>. The <i>only limitation</i> 
established by law on her right to convey said properties to the defendant 
without any consideration is, that <i>she could not dispose of or transfer her 
property to another in fraud of her creditors</i>. And this court, in Solis 
<i>vs</i>. Chua Pua Hermanos (50 Phil. 636), through Mr. Justice Street, held 
that 'a voluntary conveyance, without any consideration whatever, is <i>prima 
facie</i> good as between the parties, and such an instrument can not be 
declared fraudulent as against creditors in the absence of proof, that there was 
at the time of the execution of the conveyance a creditor who could be defrauded 
by the conveyance, 27 C.J., 470'.</p>
<p><br>"The reason why a <i>forced heir</i> has the right to institute an action 
of rescission is that the right to the legitime <i>is similar to a credit of a 
creditor</i>. As the same Spanish author [Manresa] correctly states in 
commenting on article 1291<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> of the 
Civil Code: 'The rights of a forced heir to the legitime are undoubtedly similar 
to a credit of a creditor in so far as the rights to the legitime may be 
defeated by fraudulent contracts, and are superior to the will of those bound to 
respect them. In its judgment of October 28, 1897, the Supreme Court of Spain 
held that the forced heirs instituted as such by their father to the latter fs 
testament have the undeniable right to institute an action to annul contracts 
entered into by the father to their prejudice. As it is seen the action is 
called action of nullity, <i>but it is rather an action of rescission</i> taking 
into account the purpose for which it is instituted and the confusion of ideas 
that has prevailed in this matter. The doctrine we shall expound in commenting 
on articles 1302 and 1306 [10] will confirm what we have just stated1. (Manresa, 
<i>Codigo Civil</i>, 4th edition. Vol. 8, pp. 667 and 668.)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Our opinion in <i>Concepcion</i> needs no further elaboration. It would suf- 
fice to say that plaintiff here has no cause of action.</p>
</li><li>But even if a right of action be conceded, plaintiff's case fails just the 
same. An action to annul a contract based on fraud must be filed within four 
years from the discovery thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> In 
legal contemplation, discovery must be reckoned to have taken place from the 
time the document was registered in the office of the register of deeds. For, 
the familiar rule is that registration is notice to the whole world, including 
plaintiff.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> As afore stated, the 
document in question was recorded on July 22, 1955. Action was started only on 
September 17, 1960, The four-year period has elapsed. And, plaintiff's cause of 
action, if any, is time-barred.<br>
</li><li>All that remains is the small item of plaintiff's share in the "Singer" 
sewing machine which was <i>not</i> the subject of the sale aforesaid. The Court 
may well take judicial notice<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> of the 
fact that such share does not exceed P5,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Plaintiff's separate action—if any he 
had—to obtain said share, should have been addressed to the Municipal Court. 
</li></ol><strong>PREMISED ON THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS</strong>, the 
appealed order of November 21, 1960 dismissing the second amended complaint is, 
as it should be, affirmed. No costs.

<h3><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">CONCURRING OPINION</h3>
<p><strong>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</strong></p>
<p>I concur with the main decision, but can not bring myself to agree to the 
proposition that the heirs intestate would have no legal standing to contest the 
conveyance by the deceased if the same were made without any consideration, or 
for a false and fictitious consideration. For under the Civil Code of the 
Philippines, Art. 1409, par. 3, contracts with a cause that did not exist at the 
time of the transaction are inexistent and void from the beginning. The same is 
true of contracts stating a false cause (consideration) unless the persons 
interested in upholding the contract should prove that there is another true and 
lawful consideration therefor (Ibid., Art. 1353).</p>
<p>If therefore the contract has no <i>causa</i> or consideration, or the 
<i>causa</i> is false and fictitious (and no true hidden <i>causa</i> is proved) 
the property allegedly conveyed never really leaves the patrimony of the 
transferor, and upon the latter's death without a testament, such property would 
pass to the transferor's heirs intestate and be recoverable by them or by the 
Administrator of the transferor's estate, should there be any. The cause of 
action of the plaintiffs would not be then on fraud of creditors at all, but 
upon the fact that the property in question is still part of the transferor's 
estate. In this particular regard, I think Concepcion <i>vs</i>. Sta. Ana, 87 
Phil. 787 and Soils <i>vs</i>. Chua Pua Hermanos, 50 Phil. 536, do not correctly 
state the present law, and must be clarified.</p>
<p>It is unquestionable that the owner of property has the right to convey it to 
another person, either for a consideration (onerous contract) or out of sheer 
liberality (gratuitous transfer). But it must not be overlooked that while the 
law does not limit the owner's right to convey away property in exchange of such 
lawful consideration as the transferor deems adequate (and he is the primary 
judge of its adequacy), gratuitous transfers are by no means equally 
untrammeled. The law, justifiably or not, looks with suspicion at gratuitous 
conveyances (perhaps considering them contrary to man's innate egotism) and 
subjects their validity to the observance of specific formalities designed to 
assure that the nature of the conveyance is well understood, and that it is not 
done impulsively, without due deliberation. It is well known that our law only 
recognizes two forms of gratuitous conveyances: <i>inter vivos</i> by way of 
donation and <i>mortis causa</i> by way of last will and testament. In either 
case, the validity of the transfer of ownership is subordinated to the 
observance of the formalities prescribed by law. Where lands or tenements are 
conveyed, a donation and its acceptance must appear in a public document, with 
the acceptance duly notified to the donor (Civ. Code, Art. 749); in case of 
movables, there must be at least a private writing unless the donation is 
accompanied by simultaneous delivery of the donated chattel (Art. 748). In last 
wills and testaments, the formalities ordained by law must be necessarily 
observed (Arts. 804 et seq.) and, in addition, the will oust be judicially 
allowed or probated (Art. 838, Civil Code).</p>
<p>It is a consequence of all the preceding considerations that a purported sale 
of property would not vest ownership in the transferee if it is established that 
the transfer was really gratuitous, and that the alleged price is non-existent. 
Such a "sale" would then either be void for lack of an essential requisite, or 
else be a disguised donation, that would not be operative unless the formalities 
prescribed for a valid donation are observed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> If they are not, then <i>no</i> title 
passes to the transferee, regardless of the voluntary accomplishment of the deed 
of conveyance by the transferor, because the naked intent to convey, without the 
required solemnities, does not suffice for gratuitous alienations, even as 
between the parties <i>inter se</i>.</p>Of course, in the case at bar, it has 
not been satisfactorily established that the price is non-existent, and for that 
reason the transaction, being onerous and not gratuitous, must be 
upheld.<br><br><br>
