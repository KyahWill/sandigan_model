in the form of a deed poll, drafted by Counselor Juan B. <span class="SpellE">Espolong</span>
who had been appointed by the <span class="SpellE">Villaricas</span> as their
agent to sell the lot, was acknowledged on <st1:date year="1951" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1951</st1:date>, before the same Juan B. <span class="SpellE">Espolong</span>
who was also a Notary Public.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The public

vendees.<span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>On the same day, <st1:date year="1951" day="25" month="5">May 25,
 1951</st1:date>, the spouses <span class="SpellE">Consunji</span> executed
another public instrument, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "D",
whereby they granted the spouses <span class="SpellE">Villarica</span> an option
to buy the same property within the period of one year for the price of P37<span class="GramE">,750</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In July, same

deed of sale, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">"B",
in consequence of which TCT No. 2786 in the names of the spouses <span class="SpellE">Villarica</span> was cancelled and a new TCT No. 3147 was issued

action in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
against the spouses <span class="SpellE">Consunji</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span>
S. Francisco <span style="">for
</span>the reformation <span style="">of the

"B"</span><span style="">, </span><span style="">into an equitable mortgage as a security for a usurious loan of P28<span class="GramE">,000</span> alleging that such was the real intention of the
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants answered that the
deed of absolute sale expressed the real intention of the parties and they also
alleged a counterclaim for sums of money borrowed by the plaintiffs from the <span class="SpellE">Consunjis</span> which were then due and demandable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After trial, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> rendered its decision holding that the instrument of
absolute </span><span style="">sale, </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Exh</span></span><span style="">. "B", was really intended as an
equitable mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judgment was
accordingly rendered reforming the deed of absolute sale into an equitable
mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judgment was likewise rendered
in favor of defendants <span class="SpellE">Consunjis</span> on their
counterclaim for sums of money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judgment
was also rendered </span>in <span style="">favor of
defendant Francisco </span>as purchaser in good faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both parties appealed to the Court of
Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="9"><span style="">September
 15, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Court
of Appeals rendered its decision finding that the </span>public instrument of
abso<span style="">lute sale, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"B", expressed the true intention of the parties and that the
defendants-appellants' (<span class="SpellE">Consunjis</span>) 'counterclaim for
sums of money was substantiated by the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly the Court of Appeals rendered
judgment </span>as <span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the judgment appealed from is reversed and the
complaint is dismissed as to the defendant spouses, and the plaintiffs are <span style="">ordered to pay to them their </span><span style="">remaining </span><span style="">indebtedness of fifteen thousand (P15<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>)

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1961" day="6" month="12"><span style="">December
 </span><span style="">6, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><span style="">the spouses <span class="SpellE">Villarica</span>, plaintiffs-appellants </span>in
<span style="">the Court of Appeals, petitioned the
Supreme Court for certiorari or review of the decision rendered by the Court of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition was given due
course and </span>the decision of the Court of <span style="">Appeals <span style="">is </span>now before
us for review on questions of law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners contend that the Court of Appeals erred in finding
that the public instrument of absolute sale, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Exh</span></span><span style="">. "B", expressed the true intention of the parties, arguing
that under Article 1604 in relation to Articles 1602 and 1603 of the Civil
Code, the instrument of absolute sale, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"B", should be presumed as an equitable mortgage on the grounds that
(1) the price of P35,000 was unusually inadequate; (2) the vendors remained in
possession of the property sold; (3) the period of one year for repurchase
granted in the instrument <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "D" was
extended for one month; and (4) the vendors pay the taxes on the land
sold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">unmeritorious in view </span><span style="">of
</span><span style="">the following considerations:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The price of P35<span class="GramE">,000</span> was not even inadequate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The land sold was assessed for tax purposes
at P8<span class="GramE">,870</span> effective 1950.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was purchased by the spouses <span class="SpellE">Villarica</span> from the Philippine Alien Property Custodian in
October, 1950, for the price of P20<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Villaricas</span>
borrowed P7<span class="GramE">,400</span> from <span style="">a </span>Chinese named Domingo <span class="SpellE">Lua</span> Chin Lam
and, with this borrowed money, made part payment of the price to the Philippine
Alien Property Custodian.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then they
mortgaged the land to the Philippine Alien Property Custodian as security for
the P10<span class="GramE">,000</span> unpaid balance of the purchase price.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One year later, on May 19, 1951, they sold
the land by means of the instrument of absolute sale <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>,
"B" to the <span class="SpellE">Consunjis</span> for the price of
P35,000, thus making a profit of P15,000 in one year without having invested
their own money in buying the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1953" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1953</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Consunjis</span> sold the land to <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span>
S. Francisco for the price of P47<span class="GramE">,000</span>, thus making
profit of P12,000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The price of P70<span class="GramE">,000</span> found by the <span style="">trial
court to be the market price of </span>the land at the time of the trial in
1956 was not the market price <span style="">in </span>1951
when the <span class="SpellE">Villaricas</span> sold the lot to the <span class="SpellE">Consunjis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it
<span style="">is </span>evident that the price of P35<span class="GramE">,000</span> stated in the instrument of absolute sale <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "B" was the market price of the lot in 1951.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The vendors did not
remain in possession of the land sold as lessees or otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On their request in order to help them in the
expenses of their children in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
the vendors were merely allowed by the vendees to collect the monthly rents of
P300 for five months up to October, 1951, on the understanding that the amounts
so collected would be charged against them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But thereafter the vendees were the ones who collected the monthly rents
from the tenants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It follows that the
vendors did not remain in possession of the land as lessees or otherwise.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Exh</span></span><span style="">. </span>"D" the <span class="SpellE">Consunjis</span> as new
owners of the lot granted the <span class="SpellE">Villaricas</span> an option to
buy the property within the period of one year from <st1:date year="1951" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1951</st1:date> for the <span style="">price of P37<span class="GramE">,750</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Said option to buy is different and distinct
from the right of repurchase which must be reserved by the vendor, by
stipulation to that effect, in the contract </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is clear from Article 1601 of the Civil
Code, which provides:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Conventional redemption shall take place when the vendor <u>reserves</u>
the right to repurchase the thing sold, with the<span style=""> </span>obligation to comply with the provisions of article 1616 and
other stipulations which may have been agreed upon."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">The
right of repurchase is not a right granted the vendor by the vendee in a
subsequent instrument, but is a right reserved by the vendor in the same
instrument of sale as one of the stipulations of the contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once the instrument of absolute sale is
executed, the vendor can no longer reserve the right to repurchase, and any
right thereafter granted the vendor by the vendee in a separate instrument
cannot be a right of repurchase but some other right like the option to buy in
the instant case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence Exhibits "B"
and "D" cannot be considered as evidencing a con­tract of sale with </span><span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span><span style=""> <u>de</u>
<u>retro</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Since <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> "D" did not evidence a right to </span><span style="">repurchase </span><span style="">but an option to buy, the extension of the period of one year for the
exercise of the option by one month does not fall under No. </span><span style="">3, </span><span style="">of Article 1602 of the Civil Code, which provides that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"When upon or after the expiration of the right to repurchase
another instrument extending the period of redemption or granting a new period
is executed."</blockquote>

<blockquote>(4)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The taxes paid by the
vendors were back taxes up to the time of the sale on <st1:date year="1951" day="19" month="5">May 19, 1951</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The vendors had the obligation to pay the back taxes because they sold
the land free of all liens and encumbrances.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The taxes due after the sale were paid by the vendee.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioners admit
that they cannot now question the finding of the Court of Appeals that they
fully received the price of P35<span class="GramE">,000</span> mentioned in the
instrument of absolute sale <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "B".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition, we noted that the petitioners
acknowledged in writing (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"4"-Consunji-Monteverde) dated </span><st1:date year="1951" day="28" month="5"><span style="">May 28, 1951</span></st1:date><span style="">, having received full payment of said price
of P35<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
view hereof and of the foregoing considerations, petitioners' contention that
Exhibits "B" and "D" were used </span><span style="">as a device </span><span style="">to cover a usurious loan, has absolutely no
merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The findings of the Court
