				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This <span style="">is </span>a petition to review the decision of the Court of Appeals in case
CA-G.R. No. 27561-R, <span style="">entitled
"Vicente Aldaba, et al., plaintiffs-appellants, versus Cesar Aldaba, et </span><span style="">al., </span>defendants-appellees",
affirm­<span style="">ing the decision of the Court of
First Instance of </span>Manila in its Civil Case No. 41260.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">When <span style="">Belen </span>Aldaba, </span>a rich woman of <span style="">Malolos, </span>Bula­can, died on February
25, 1955, <span style="">she </span>left as her pre­<span style="">sumptive heirs her
surviving husband Estanislao Bautis­</span>ta, and her brother Cesar
Aldaba.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Belen Aldaba was childless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among the properties that she <span style="">left were the </span>two lots involved in
this <span style="">case, </span>situated at 427
Maganda Street, Santa Mesa, Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners Dr. Vicente Aldaba and Jane Aldaba, father and
daughter respectively, lived during the last war in their house in Malate,
Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Belen Aldaba used to go to their
house to seek the advice and medi­cal assistance of Dr. Vicente Aldaba.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the latter's house <span style="">was </span>burned during the liberation of
Manila in 1945, Belen Aldaba invited Dr. Aldaba and his daughter, who was then <span style="">a </span>student in medicine, to live in one
of her two houses standing on the lots in question, and the Aldaba father and
daughter accepted the offer of Belen and they actually lived in one of those
two houses until sometime in 1957 when respondent Emmanuel Bautista filed an
eject­ment case against them in the city court of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Vicente Aldaba continued to act as a sort
of adviser of Belen, and Jane, after becoming a qualified doctor of medicine,
became the personal physician of Belen until the latter's death on February 25,
1955.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 24, 1955, the presumptive heirs, Estanislao Bautista and
Cesar Aldaba, executed a deed of extrajudi­cial partition of the properties
left by the deceased Belen Aldaba, by virtue of which deed the two lots in
question were alloted to Cesar Aldaba.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, on August 26, 1957, herein respondents Cesar Aldaba and Em­manuel
Bautista, the latter being a grandson of Estan­islao Bautista by his first
marriage, executed a deed whereby the two lots that were alloted to Cesar
Aldaba were ceded to Emmanuel Bautista in exchange of the latter's lot situated
at San Juan, Rizal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By <span style="">virtue of </span>the deed or extra-judicial
partition and the deed of exchange, Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 1334
and 1335 res­pectively covering lots Nos. 32 and 34 - now in question - both in
the name of Belen Aldaba, were cancelled by the Register of Deeds of Manila,
and Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 49996 and 49997 in the name of Emmanuel
Bau­tista were issued in lieu thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Emmanuel Bautista then required Dr. Vicente Aldaba to vacate the
lots in question and, upon the latter's refusal, filed an ejectment case
against him in the City Court of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Without awaiting the final result of the ejectment case, herein
petitioners filed, on August 22, 1959, a complaint in the Court of First
Instance of Manila, docketed as Civil Case No. 41260, against herein
respondents Cesar Aldaba and Emmanuel Bautista and the Register of Deeds of
Manila, alleging that they had become the owners or the two lots in question,
and pray­ing that the deed or partition entered into by Estanislao <span style="">Bautista and Cesar Aldaba be declared null
and void with respect to Lot No.32, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title
No. 1334, and lot No. 34 covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 1335;
that </span><span style="">said
</span><span style="">lots be declared the property of
therein plaintiffs (herein petitioners); and that the Register of Deeds of
Manila be ordered to cancel TCT Nos. 49996 and 49997 in the name of Emmanuel
Bautista and in lieu thereof issue two new TCT's in the name of therein
plaintiffs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> rendered <span style="">a </span>decis­ion
dismissing the complaint, and declaring, among others, that if the deceased
Belen Aldaba intended to convey the lots in question to Vicente Aldaba and Jane
Aldaba, by way of donation, the conveyance should be considered a donation <u>inter</u>
<u>vivos</u>, for the validity of which <span style="">a </span>public instrument was necessary pursuant
to Article 749 of the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
dispositive portion of the decision of the trial court reads <span style="">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW WHEREOF both complaint and counterclaim dismissed;
the Court holds Emmanuel Bautista to be the ab­solute owner of the property in
quest­ion, land and improvement, but <span style="">with
</span>the right of plaintiffs to stay until they should have been reimbursed
of P5,000.00 but without any obligation, until such reimbursement, to pay any
rental unto defendant Emmanuel Bautista.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No pronouncement as to costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From this decision, therein plaintiffs appealed to the Court of
Appeals, and the latter court rendered <span style="">a </span>decision, on June 21, 1963, raising from
P5,000 to P8,000 the amount to be reimbursed to plaintiffs-appel­lants, but
affirming in all other respects the decision of the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Herein petitioners' motion for
reconsideration of the decision having been denied by the Court of Appeals,
they forthwith <span style="">filed the present
petition in this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Before
</span>this Court, petitioners now contend that the Court of Appeals erred: (1)
in affirming the decision of the Court of First Instance; (2) in holding that
the donation, as found by the <span style="">Court of
First Instance of Manila, was a simple donation <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u> </span><span style="">and not a donation "con causa
onerosa" and so it was </span><span style="">void
for it did not follow </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">requirements of
Article 749 of the Civil Code; (3) </span><span style="">in
not holding that the </span><span style="">property </span><span style="">in question had already been donated to here­in
petitioners in consideration or the latter's services; (4) in not declaring
petitioners to be the absolute owners of the property in dispute; and (5) in
considering testimonies which had been stricken out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The errors assigned by petitioners being inter­related, We are
going to discuss them together.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners <span style="">contend that </span>petitioners
Dr. Vicente <span style="">Aldaba and Jane </span><span style="">Aldaba had rendered services to the deceased
Belen </span><span style="">Aldaba for more than ten
years without receiving any compensation, and so in compensation for their services
Belen Aldaba gave them the lots in dis­pute including the improvements
thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the stand of petitioners
that the property in question was conveyed to them by way of an onerous
donation which is governed by Article 733, and not Article 749, of the Civil
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Article 733 of the Civil
Code an onerous donation does not have to be done by virtue of a public
instrument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners point to the
note, Exhibit 6, as indicating that a donation had been made, which note reads
as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"June 18, 1953</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Jane,</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">Huag kayong umalis diyan.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Tala­gang iyan ay para sa inyo.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Alam nila na iyan ay sainyo.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 6in; text-indent: 0.4in;"><span style="">Belen A. Bautista."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Petitioners maintain that the note,
although it could not transmit title, showed, nevertheless, that a donation had
already been made long before its writing, in consideration of the services
rendered before the writing and to be rendered after its writing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the donation being with an onerous cause,
petitioners main­tain that it was valid even if it was done orally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners further maintain <span style="">that </span>if Exhibit 6 labors under some
ambiguity, this ambiguity is cured by Ex<span style="">hibit
7, which reads </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"June 27, 1956</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Dear Nana Tering,</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"Narito po ang notice tungkol sa amillaramiento na
pagbabayaran diyan sa lupa at bahay na kinatatayuan ninyo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sa Malolos po ito tinanggap.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ang pag­babayaran po ng Inkong <span style="">ay </span>bayad
na.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 454.5pt; text-indent: 0in;">"Gumagalang,</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 454.5pt; text-indent: 0in;">"Cely."</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The addressee, Tering, <span style="">was </span>the
wife of Dr. Vicente Aldaba, and the sender, Cely, was the wife of respondent
Emmanuel Bautista.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This note,
petitioners argue, proves that res­pondents had recognized the ownership of the
petitioners <span style="">of the house and lot, for,
otherwise, Cely should have sent the notice of real estate tax to respondent
Cesar Aldaba, to whom was alloted the property in question by virtue of the
extra-judicial partition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents, Cesar Aldaba and Emmanuel Bautista, on the other
hand, contend that the evidence of the plaintiff does not disclose clearly that
a donation had been made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents
point out that the note, Exhibit 6, as worded, is vague, in that it could not
be interpreted <span style="">as </span>referring to
the lots in question, or that which was given therein was given for a valuable
consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And finally, res­pondents
contend that if the property had really been given to petitioners, why did they
not take any step to transfer the property in their names?</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Court of Appeals, in
its decision, made the following findings and conclusions:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(1)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The
note Exhibit 6 did not make any reference to the lots in question, nor to the
services rendered, or to be rendered, in favor of Belen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The note <span style="">was </span>insuf­ficient <span style="">as a </span>conveyance,
and hence could not be considered <span style="">as
evidence of a donation with onerous cause.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This note can be considered, at most, as indicative of the intention to donate.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(2)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->There is no satisfactory explanation why from
1945 to 1955, no notarial document was executed by <span style="">Belen in favor of petitioners </span><span style="">who </span><span style="">were educated per­</span>sons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason given was "extremada
delicadeza" which reason the Court of Appeals considered as un­satisfactory.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(3)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The evidence regarding the value of the <span style="">ser­</span>vices (P53,000.00) rendered by
petitioners (father and daughter) to Belen does not improve the proof regard­ing
the alleged donation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If petitioners
believed that the gratuitous use or the <span style="">property
was not </span>sufficient to compensate them for their services, they could
have presented their claims in the intestate proceedings, which they themselves
could have initiated, if none was instituted.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conclusion of the Court or Appeals, as well as that of the
trial court, that there was no onerous donation made by Belen Aldaba to
petitioners <span style="">is based </span>upon their
appreciation of the evidence, and this Court will not disturb the factual
findings of those courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question to be resolved in the instant case is: Was there a
disposition of the property in question <span style="">made
by the deceased </span>Belen Aldaba in favor of herein petitioners?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The note, Exhibit 6, considered alone, was,
as held by the Court of Appeals, confirming the opinion of the lower court,
only an indication of the intention of Belen Aldaba to donate to the
petitioners the pro­perty occupied by the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with this conclusion of the trial
court and the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
note, in fact, expressed that the property was really intended for the
petitioners, "taIagang iyan ay para sa inyo." If the property was
only intended for peti­tioners then, at the time of its writing, the property
had not yet been disposed or in their favor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no evidence <span style="">in the
record that such </span>intention was ef­fectively carried out after the
writing of the note.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In­asmuch as the
mere expression of an intention is not a promise, because a promise is an
undertaking to carry <span style="">the </span>intention
into effect<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>,
We cannot, considering Exhibit 6 alone, conclude that the deceased promised,
much less did convey, the property in question to the peti­tioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the note, Exhibit 6, <span style="">was </span>only an
indica­tion of an intention <span style="">to </span>give
was also the interpretation given by petitioners themselves, when they said in
their memorandum, dated February 2, 1960, in the lower court<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Legally speaking, there was a con­tractual relation created
between Belen Aldaba and the plaintiff since <span style="">1945 </span>where­by the former <u>would </u><u><span style="">give</span></u><span style=""> </span>to the
latter the two parcels of land, together with the house standing <span style="">thereon, </span><u><span style="">upon the rendition </span></u><u><span style="">of
said services.</span></u><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">This
fact can </span><span style="">be gleaned </span><span style="">from the note (Exh. "6",
Plaintiffs) which in part </span><span style="">says:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>TALAGANG IYAN AY PARA SAINYO."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We have said that Exhibit <span style="">6
</span>expressed only the in­tention to donate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Let us suppose, for the sake of ar­gument, that previous to the writing
of the note there had already been a disposition or the property in favor <span style="">of </span><span style="">the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>This
disposition alone, would not <span style="">make the
donation a donation for a valuable consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We </span><span style="">still </span><span style="">have to ask:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was the </span><span style="">consideration </span>of such disposition?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">We </span>do not find in the record that <span style="">there </span>had been an express agreement
between petitioners and Belen Aldaba that the latter would pay for the ser­vices
of the former.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If there was no express
agreement, could it not be at least implied?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There could not be an implied contract for payment because <span style="">We </span>find in the record <span style="">that </span>Jane did not expect to be paid
for her ser­vices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the memorandum of
counsel for the petitioners in the trial court <span style="">We </span>find this statement:</p>

<blockquote>"For all she did to her aunt she expected not to be
paid."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">When a person does not expect to be paid
for his services, there cannot be a contract implied in fact to make com­pensation
for <span style="">said services.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"However, no contract implied in fact to make compensation for
per­sonal services performed for another arises unless the party furnishing the
services then expected or had reason to expect the payment of com­pensation by
the other party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To give rise to an
implied contract to pay for services, they must have been rendered by one party
in expectation that the <span style="">other party </span>would
pay for them, and have been accepted by the other party with knowledge of that
expectation." (58 Am. Jur. p. 512 and cases cited therein).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In the same manner, when the person
rendering the ser­vices has renounced his fees, the services are not demandable
obligations.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Even if it be assumed for the sake or argument that the services
of petitioners constituted a demandable debt, We still have to ask whether in
the instant case this was <span style="">the
consideration </span>for which the deceased made the (alleged) disposition <span style="">of </span>the property to the peti­tioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we have adverted to, we have not come
across <span style="">in </span><span style="">the record even a </span>claim that there was
an express agreement between petitioners and Belen Aldaba that the latter would
give the property in question in considera­tion of the services of
petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that peti­tioners could
claim regarding this matter was that "it was impliedly understood"
between them.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
How said ag­<span style="">reement
</span>was implied and from what facts it was implied, petitioners did not make
clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question of whether or not
what is relied upon <span style="">as </span>a
consideration had been knowingly accepted by the parties as a consideration, is
a question or fact<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>,
<span style="">and </span>the Court of Appeals has not
found in the instant case that <span style="">the </span>lots
in question were given to petitioners in consideration of the <span style="">services </span><span style="">rendered by them to
Belen Aldaba.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We find, therefore, that the conditions to cons­titute a donation
<u>cum</u> <u>causa</u> <u>onerosa</u> are not present in the instant case, and
the claim of petitioners that the two lots in question were donated to them by
Belen Aldaba cannot be sustained.</p>
