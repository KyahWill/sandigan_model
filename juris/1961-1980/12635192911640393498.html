SANTIAGO OSORIO AND THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal <span style="">from </span>a
decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 19970-R entitled Santiago
Osorio, Plaintiff-Appellant vs. Maria Ramos, assisted by her husband, Vicente
Cruz, Defendant-<span class="SpellE">Appellee</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 29, 1956, the Court of First Instance of Manila rendered a
decision in Civil Case No. 25421 entitled Santiago Osorio vs. Maria Ramos, et
al., dismissing plaintiff's complaint and, in relation to defendant's
counterclaim, sentencing him to pay said defendant the amount of P776.00, with
interest thereon at the legal rate from January 1, 1952 until full payment
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The P776.00, according to the
trial court, was the amount paid by Maria Ramos to Santiago Osorio in excess of
the legal rate, said court having found, in relation to the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
counterclaim, that the transaction between the parties was tainted with usury.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the above decision, Osorio appealed to the Court of Appeals
where on or before September 1959 the record of the case was lost (CA-G.R. No.
19970-R).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals, however,
was duly informed thereof only on <st1:date month="8" day="24" year="1962">August
 24, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is </span>not <span style="">disputed that on </span><st1:date month="7" day="12" year="1961"><span style="">July 12, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Court of Appeals dismissed Osorio's
appeal because of his failure to take the necessary steps for the completion of
the record within the time to him given for </span>that purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="18" month="8">August
 18, <span style="">1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, obviously because of a motion for
reconsideration filed by Osorio, the Court of Appeals issued a resolution
reaffirming its former resolution of </span><st1:date year="1961" day="12" month="7"><span style="">July 12, 1961</span></st1:date><span style=""> dismissing his appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears, however, that on October 12,
1961, resolving another motion filed by Osorio for the admission of the
transcript submitted by him </span>and <span style="">for
a reinstatement of his appeal, the Court of Appeals set aside its previous resolutions
of dismissal of July 12 and August 18, 1961, reinstated Osorio's appeal, and subsequently
rendered the appealed decision which modified that of the Court of First
Instance of Manila by setting aside that portion thereof providing for the
refund of usurious interests paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
present appeal interposed by petitioner Maria Ramos refers only to that portion
of the decision of </span>the Court of Appeals modifying the decision <span style="">of the trial court as above-mentioned,
claiming firstly, that </span>when said court issued its <span style="">resolution of October 14, 1961 setting aside
its</span> <span style="">previous resolutions of July
12 and August 18 of the same year, it had already lost jurisdiction over the
case because said resolutions dismissing Osorio's appeal had already become <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and, secondly; that the Court of Appeals likewise
erred in setting aside, on the ground of prescription, the decision of the
Court of First Instance of Manila insofar as it sentenced Osorio to refund to
petitioner the sum of P776.00, for the reason that Osorio had not pleaded said
defense in the Court of First Instance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span>record
discloses that one of <span style="">the affirmative
defenses interposed by petitioner Maria Ramos as defendant in Civil Case </span>No.
<span style="">25421 of the Court of First Instance of
Manila was that the transaction between her and the therein plaintiff Santiago
Osorio was usurious and that she had actually paid the latter interests above
the rate authorized by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also
interposed in her answer a counterclaim for the recovery of the usurious
interests paid by her to Osorio amounting to the total sum of P776.00 (Record
on Appeal, Pages 12-16).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Santiago </span><span style="">Osorio filed a reply to the answer of the
defendant, which included his own answer to the latter’s counterclaim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere in said pleading, however, did he
plead the defense of prescription as far as the amount of P776.00 claimed in
Maria Ramos' counterclaim was concerned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was only </span>in <span style="">the </span>Court
of Appeals (CA-G.R. No. 19970–R) that <span style="">he
</span>raised such de<span style="">fense in the third
assignment </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">error submitted in his brief as
plaintiff-appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is settled law in this
jurisdiction that the defense of prescription is <span class="SpellE">waivable</span>,
and that if it was not raised as a defense in the trial court, it cannot be
considered on appeal, the general rule being that the appellate court is not
authorized to consider and resolve any question not properly raised in the lower
court (<span class="SpellE">Subido</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> 55
O.G., 8281, 8285; Moran, Comments </span><span style="">on
</span><span style="">the Rules of Court, Vol. <span class="GramE">I, p. 784, 1947 Edition).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Our conclusion,
therefore, is that the Court of Appeals erred in setting aside the decision of
the Court of First Instance of Manila in Civil Case No. 25421 sentencing the
herein respondent Santiago Osorio to pay the herein petitioner Maria Ramos the
sum of P776.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the light of the above
conclusion, <span class="GramE">We</span> do not find it necessary to resolve the
other question </span><span style="">raised </span><span style="">by petitioner in her brief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the appealed decision is </span><span style="">modified by </span><span style="">eliminating <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the </span><span style="">portion </span><span style="">thereof setting aside the decision of the Court of </span><span style="">First </span><span style="">Instance of Manila sentencing herein respondent Santiago </span><span style="">Osorio to </span><span style="">pay petitioner Maria Ramos the sum of P776.00, and affirming instead
the decision of </span><span style="">said </span><span style="">Court of First Instance on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With costs.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
