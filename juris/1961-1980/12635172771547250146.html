APPEALS, HON. JUDGE AGUSTIN P. MONTESA, AS JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE
OF MANILA, ONG WAN SIENG AND THE SHERIFF OF MANILA, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The sole issue here is whether or not there has been legal
compensation between petitioner <span class="SpellE">Gan</span> <span class="SpellE">Tion</span> and respondent <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Wan <span class="SpellE">Sieng</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Wan <span class="SpellE">Sieng</span>
was a tenant in certain premises owned by <span class="SpellE">Gan</span> <span class="SpellE">Tion</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1961 the
latter filed an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case against the former,
alleging non-payment of rents for August and September of that year, at P180 a
month, or P360 altogether.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant
denied the allegation and said that the agreed monthly rental was only P160,
which he had offered to but was refused by the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff obtained <span style="">a </span>favorable judgment in the muni­cipal
court (of Manila), but upon appeal the Court of First Instance, on July 2,
1962, reversed the <span class="GramE">judgment</span> and dismissed the
complaint, and ordered the plaintiff to pay the defendant the sum of P500 as
attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That judgment became
final.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="10" month="10">October 10, 1963</st1:date>
<span class="SpellE">Gan</span> <span class="SpellE">Tion</span> served notice on <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span style="">Wan </span><span class="SpellE">Sieng</span> that he was increasing the
rent to P180 <span style="">a
month, effective </span>November 1st, and at the same time demanded the rents
in arrears at the old rate in the aggregate amount of P4<span class="GramE">,320.00</span>,
corresponding to a period from August 1961 to October 1963.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, over <span class="SpellE">Gan</span> <span class="SpellE">Tion's</span> opposition, <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Wan <span class="SpellE">Sieng</span> was able to obtain <span style="">a </span>writ of execution of the judgment
for attorney's fees in his favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gan</span> <span class="SpellE">Tion</span> went on certiorari to
the Court of Appeals, where he pleaded legal compensation, claiming that <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Wan <span class="SpellE">Sieng</span> was in­debted to
him in the sum of P4<span class="GramE">,320</span> for unpaid rents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellate court accepted the petition but
eventually decided for the respondent, holding that although "respondent <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> is indebted to the petitioner for unpaid rentals in an
amount of more than P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>" the sum of P500
could not be the subject of legal compensation, it being a "trust fund for
the benefit of the lawyer, which would have to be turned over by the client to
his counsel." In the opinion of said Court, the requisites of legal
compensation, namely, that the parties must be creditors and debtors of each
other in their <span style="">own
</span>right (Art. 1278, Civil Code) and that each one of them must be bound
principally and at the same time be a principal creditor of the other (Art.
1279), are not present in the instant case, since the real creditor with
respect to the sum of P500 was the defendant's counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is not an accurate statement of the nature of an award for
attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The award is made in
favor of the litigant, not <span style="">of </span>his counsel, and is justi­fied by way of indemnity for damages
recoverable by the former in the cases enumerated in Article 2208 of the Civil
Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
It is the litigant, not his counsel, who <span style="">is </span>the judgment creditor and who may enforce
the judgment by execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such credit,
therefore, may properly be the subject of legal compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Quite obviously it would be unjust to compel
petitioner to pay his debt for P500 when admittedly his creditor is indebted to
him for more than P4<span class="GramE">,000</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Wherefore</b>, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is
reversed, and the writ of execution issued by the Court of First Instance of
Manila in its Civil Case No. 49535 is set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against respondent.</span></p>
