				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. RODOLFO SANTOS, DEFENDANT. RURAL INSURANCE AND SURETY CO., INC., BONDSMAN AND APPELLANT.<br><br> D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">When on April 2, 1959, the case of People vs. Rodolfo Santos y Ale jo was 
called for trial, the accused failed to appear. The judge immediately issued an 
order for his arrest and for the confiscation of the bail bond previously posted 
for his provisional release by the Rural Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc. in the 
amount of P7,500.00. In the same order, the surety was given thirty days within 
which to produce the person of the defendant and to state the reasons, if any, 
why the bond should not be forfeited.
<p>On May 26, 1959, the bonding company filed its ex-parte motion requesting an 
extension of thirty days within which to produce the accused; but this was 
denied by the Court because it had been presented beyond the 30-day period 
granted to it. Wherefore, on June 11, 1959, the court rendered final judgment 
forfeiting the bond in favor of the Government. On the next day, the 
corresponding writ of execution was issued.</p>
<p>However, on July 20, 1959, the surety company surrendered the person of the 
accused; and two days later, it submitted a motion to lift the order of 
confiscation and execution. It was denied. Then, it moved for reduction of the 
amount so forfeited. Considering the circumstances, the judge reduced the amount 
confiscated to one-half of the original bail bond.</p>
<p>The bonding company brought the matter to the Court of Appeals, which 
forwarded the case to us after finding that there was no issue of fact.</p>
<p>The appellant company insists that the amount confiscated should be further 
reduced, if possible to P200.00 only. It alleges that immediately after 
receiving the order of confiscation, it took the necessary steps to locate the 
whereabouts of the accused; that it employed three agents for the purpose; that 
these exerted diligent efforts which were finally successful when in July 20, 
1959, the body of the defendant was surrendered to the Court; that the defendant 
had left his residence without notifying the company and had been very elusive, 
transferring from one place to another, etc.</p>
<p>The record discloses these circumstances which do not speak well of 
appellant's diligence and care in this matter: In the first place, having been 
given a 30-day period to produce or to explain, it made no explanation; instead 
it asked for an extension <i>more than twenty days</i> after the expiration of 
such period. In the second place, it neglected to explain at the first 
opportunity why it failed to produce the accused on the day of trial (Motion of 
July 21, 1959). And when it did so, it alleged it had given notice to the 
accused of the date of the trial "and likewise sent an employee * * * in the 
early morning of April 2 (trial) to fetch the accused and escort him" to the 
court, only to find that the latter had already left his residence. And, it 
said, the employee did not <i>bother</i> (sic) to insure the defendant's 
appearance in court. No wonder, His Honor, the judge declined to reduce its 
responsibility to the nominal amount which it now urges upon this Court to 
approve.</p>
<p>We fail to see a valid reason to interfere with the discretion of the lower 
court. Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>
<p><i>Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, 
Paredes,</i> and <i>Dizon, JJ.</i>, concur.</p></div>
