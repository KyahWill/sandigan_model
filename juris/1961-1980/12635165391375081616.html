				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">On appeal, by the People, from the
"order" of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span>
Norte, dismissing its Criminal Case No. 3993 upon motion of the accused, after
the presentation of evidence by the <span style="">prosecution.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
poses but one legal question:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Whether
or not such appeal - if allowed - would <span style="">place
the accused in double jeopardy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The proceedings </span>that
transpired in the court <span style="">below are not
disputed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused - Juan Acosta, <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> de
Leon and <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>
- were prosecuted for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> before the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u>,<span style=""> </span>under an Information
that substantially alleged as follows:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that the said accused, acting in conspiracy with one another, thru
fraudulent pretenses, obtained from Pedro M. Miguel, a lady's ring valued at
P16,500.00; that accused issued a check for $5,000.00 in payment thereof; and
that said check later turned out to be counterfeit, to the damage and prejudice
of said Pedro M. Miguel in the amount of P16,500.00.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At the trial, the
prosecution presented as its first witness, Pedro M. Miguel, the complainant,
who declared as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">That on December 24, 1961, Juan Acosta, <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>
de Leon and Domingo <span class="SpellE">Pimental</span> approached complainant,
telling the latter they were interested in buying jewelry; the complainant
showed a ring and told the accused that it belongs to <span class="SpellE">Banang</span>
Jaramillo, who en­trusted it to him to be sold on commission basis for the
price of P17,000.00; the buyers agreed to buy the ring; as payment of the ring,
Acosta, de Leon and Pimentel gave complainant a $5,000.00 dollar check drawn
against the Banker Trust Company of New York, by Companion Life Insurance Co.
payable to the order of accused <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>; the accused assured the complainant that the
check was good, and relying on that assurance, complainant accepted the check
after it was endorsed by <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>; after <span style="">receiving
</span>the check, complainant gave the ring to the accused; when the check was
presented to the Bank for encash­ment, it was dishonored because it was fake
and count­erfeit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution also
presented Exhibits A, <span style="">B, C, D, E, F and
G which were all admitted in evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After the prosecution had rested the case, the respective counsel
for the accused moved to dismiss the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They contended that in view of Pedro M. Miguel's admission that the ring
belonged to <span class="SpellE">Banang</span> Jaramillo, it was the latter who
suffered damage and not the complainant, and, therefore, one of the essen­tial
elements of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> - damage - is absent, rendering
the information defective and the prosecution's evidence insufficient to
convict the accused of the offense charged.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The assistant provincial
fiscal vehemently op­posed the motion to dismiss, contending that the </span><span style="">owner of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">ring </span><span style="">need not be the complainant, be­cause </span><span style="">in a </span><span style="">prosecution for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>, the complaint may </span><span style="">be filed </span>at the instance of the one
who has been swindled, whether or not he is the owner of the thing subject of
the deceit or breach of faith.</p>

<p class="BODY">In spite of the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> opposition,
the lower court dismissed the case, holding that while the information
mentioned Pedro M. Miguel as the offended party, it appeared from the evidence
that he was merely an agent of <span class="SpellE">Banang</span> Jaramillo who
was the owner of the ring subject of the <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court observed that <span style="">inasmuch as in </span><span class="SpellE">estafa</span>,
the value of the articles swind­led is not only the basis of the penalty but
also the amount of indemnity to the offended party, therefore, it becomes
necessary to know the real offended party, and to pay Pedro Miguel an indemnity
now will run counter to the evidence adduced, and it would go against the
wordings of the information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial
court fur­ther opined that to amend the information at that stage of the
proceedings will violate the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> constitu­tional
right against double jeopardy.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the order of dismissal, the assistant provincial fiscal has
appealed directly to <span class="GramE">Us</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Soli­citor General, however, has moved
for the dismissal of the appeal on the ground that it would place the accused
in double jeopardy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the
Solicitor <span style="">General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be seriously questioned that the
trial court had <span class="SpellE">grieviously</span> erred in his conclusion
and application of the law, and in dismissing outright </span>the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Admittedly, Miguel was merely an agent, but
as such, he had both the physical and juridical posses­sion of the thing
received in agency, and could vest title to the buyer of the subject <span style="">matter of the </span>trans<span style="">action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Miguel was bound to account for the proceeds thereof and failure on his
part to do <span class="GramE">so,</span> will render him liable for such value
to the owner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His posses­sion of the <span style="">jewelry, </span>therefore, was essentially
that of his principal; and any prejudice he suffered by reason of the fraud
perpetrated upon him would, like­wise, be suffered by his </span><span style="">principal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is elemen­</span><span style="">tary, for authorities have invariably held </span><span style="">that "the </span><span style="">crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> is committed, although the victim was not the owner
of the property, but the holder or broker simply, when it appears that the real
owner was prejudiced by the disappearance of the property." </span><span style="">(</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">U. S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> v. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Almazan</span></span><span style="">, 20 Phil. 225; </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> v. <span class="SpellE">Sotelo</span>, 28
Phil. 147, 156-157.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But then, the erroneous
dismissal of the case, notwithstanding, the error cannot now </span><span style="">be remedied by </span><span style="">the instant appeal because it would place the accused </span>in double
jeopardy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused, in the case at
bar, had been charged under a valid information, before a competent court which
had jurisdiction over both the subject-matter and the person of the accused;
they had stood trial under a plea of "not guilty", and the
prosecution, after the presentation of its evidence, had rested its case; the
trial court had thereafter dismissed the case and, that dismissal is on the
merits which amounted to an acquittal of said accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Un­doubtedly, to entertain the instant appeal
would place the accused in double jeopardy.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE AND UPON THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS</b><span style="">,</span> this appeal should be, as it is
hereby, dismissed, with costs <u>de</u> <u>officio</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>
