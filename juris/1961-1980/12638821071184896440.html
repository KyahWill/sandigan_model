				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">It must have been on the basis of the due process requirements so
emphatically stressed in Gutierrez v. Santos,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
of "every litigant [being] entitled to nothing less than the cold
neutrality of an impartial judge,"<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
that this petition, which on its face does not bear the earmarks of a thorough
preparation, was conceived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the
grievance set forth was the belief that respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Onofre</span>
A. <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
had displayed excessive zeal in investigating a complaint for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> against petitioner <span class="SpellE">Apolonia</span>
Angeles Go and thereafter issuing a warrant of arrest against her, leading to
her belief that there was pre-judgment and "that she cannot expect justice
from the respondent Judge, to try and decide her case."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
What was sought in the final analysis was the disqualification of respondent
Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents were required to
answer and a restraining order was issued by this Court in a resolution of <st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="9">September 17, 1973</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, a comprehensive memorandum was filed on their behalf,
the last paragraph of which reads:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"On the issue that respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Onofre</span>
<span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span> should inhibit himself from trying and
deciding the case for the reason that he has allegedly 'pre-judged' the case on
the merits in the light of his findings during the preliminary investigation,
we submit that this issue is <u>premature</u> because the petitioner never
requested the respondent Judge to inhibit himself from trying the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is our submission that the respondent
Judge should first be given the opportunity to inhibit himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the event that the respondent Judge, after
being requested to inhibit himself, refuses and continues to try the case, only
then may one come before this Court and raise the question of alleged
'pre-judgment' of the case."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">No memorandum was filed on behalf of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, a manifestation dated <st1:date year="1977" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1977</st1:date> was submitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It reads thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"1.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That this present case for <i>Certiorari</i> and Prohibition with
Preliminary Mandatory Injunction is now pending for the final resolution of the
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the respondent Judge, the Honorable <span class="SpellE">Onofre</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span> in his Order
dated February 25, 1977 in CCC-VII 1372-Rizal, 'People of the Philippines v. <span class="SpellE">Apolonia</span> Angeles Go,' has inhibited himself from further
trying and deciding this case (CCC-VII-1372-Rizal) and that in fact he has
forwarded the entire records of this case (CCC-VII-1372-Rizal) for this Court's
disposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>3.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That these favorable acts of the respondent judge have rendered the
matters involved in this case which are purely legal technical questions, moot
and academic."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The attached order of respondent Judge is worded in this wise:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"As prayed for in the motion, the
Warrant of Arrest issued for the apprehension of the accused is hereby
recalled. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Pursuant to Section 1, par. 2,
Rule 137 of the New Rules of Court, and in accordance with the case of "<span class="SpellE">Umale</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span>,' considering
that this court was the one who conducted the preliminary examination and
investigation of this case in accordance with Section 13, Rule 112 of the New
Rules of Court, the undersigned Presiding Judge hereby inhibits himself from
further trying and deciding this casa, as far as the accused Annie Go is
concerned."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
It may be added that <span class="SpellE">Umale</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
cited by respondent Judge, reiterated the principle set forth in a case decided
two months earlier against the same respondent Judge, Mateo, Jr. v. <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
It would seem, therefore, that there has been since then a fuller awareness on
the part of respondent Judge of the implications of the standard of strict
neutrality to be observed by occupants of the bench.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is as it should be.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, as prayed for in the manifestation of
petitioner, this petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition is
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records of CCC-VII-1372,
which responÂ­dent Judge transmitted to this Court, are remanded to the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> so that the Executive Judge
could take the necessary steps to have this case raffled and thereafter
proceeded with in accordance with the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Antonio, <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>,
Jr., <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>,
JJ., <span style="font-style: normal;">concur.</span></span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, J.,<span style="font-style: normal;"> reserves his opinion as to whether or not respondent judge may conduct
a preliminary investigation and thereafter share the case to regular court of
first instance, consistently with his opinion that Circuit Criminal Courts have
no power to conduct preliminary investigations.</span></span><br>
