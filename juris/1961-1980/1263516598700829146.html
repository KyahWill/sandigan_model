				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">This is a petition for
certiorari with preliminary injunction, petitioners being Jose L. <span class="SpellE">Lachita</span>, the candidate for the office of Congressman of the
other petitioner, Liberal Party, for the Second.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>District of the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="">Province</span></st1:placetype><span style=""> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Sorsogon</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="">, filed against respondent Judge, the
Honorable Juan E. Yap, of the Court of First instance of <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span>,
the chairman and members of the provincial board of canvassers as well as
Vicente L. Peralta, the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party candidate,
now deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was filed on December
2, 1965, </span>to <span style="">nullify an </span><span style="">order of November 29, 1965 of respondent
Judge denying the petition for recount, of the ballots cast in Precinct No. 7
of the Municipality of Bacon, Precinct No. </span><span style="">22, </span><span style="">of the Municipality
of <span class="SpellE">Casiguran</span> and Precincts </span>Nos. <span style="">48 and 58 of the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span> and thereafter </span>to <span style="">order respondent Judge to proceed with such judicial recount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the assumption that respondent Vicente L.
Peralta had already been </span>proclaimed, <span style="">it </span>was <span style="">likewise prayed
in the petition </span>that judgment be <span style="">rendered
</span>declaring the <span style="">same null and
void, so that the winner could be ascertained after such judicial recount and
thereafter declared </span>as such.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This Court, in a
resolution of </span><st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="12"><span style="">December 3, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, gave due course to the petition, requiring
respondents to answer within 10 days, No injunction was issued.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the answer of
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Vicente L. Peralta, he
asserted that there was no valid ground for a judicial recount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the order of respondent judge denying
such a plea was in accordance with law and judicial precedents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, he alleged in his special defenses
that his proclamation "has been made in the regular performance of duty by
the respondent Provincial Board of Canvassers [and] </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">now a consummated fact it is not tainted with illegality or irregularity
of any kind. </span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">The
prayer was for the dismissal of the petition for certiorari.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thereafter, in the
manifestation filed on January 14, 1966 by respondent Vicente L. Peralta, he
stated that this petition was set forth for oral argument for December 20,
1965, at which date counsel for the opposing parties appealed and argued for
the respective sides, petition being submitted for decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was like­wise alleged that he, having been
proclaimed previously, had "already taken his oath of office last December
30, 1965, and having effectively assumed and commenced the discharge of his
duties as the duly elected Congressman of the Second District of <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span>, the above-entitled petition of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Lachica</span> has now become a moot question." </span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The above manifestation
was noted in a resolution of January 19, 1966 of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no denial of such fact of
proclamation by petitioners in their counter-manifestation of January 18, 1966,
they would have however, this Court, the above proclamation notwithstanding,
still rule on the merits of their petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">According to the
Constitution: "The Senate and the House of Representatives shall each have
an Electoral Tribunal which shall be the sole judge of all contests relating to
the election returns, and qualifications of their respective Members. ***”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In the lead­ing case of <span class="SpellE">Angara</span>
v. Electoral Commission, </span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the scope of such authority was set forth
thus: "From the deliberations of our Consti­tutional Convention it is
evident that the purpose was to transfer in, its totality all the powers
previously exercised by the legislature in matters pertaining to contested
elections of its members, to an </span><span style="">independent
</span><span style="">and impartial tribunal." </span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The grant of power to the then Philippine
Senate and House of Representatives under the Jones Law was characterized by
this Court as "full, clear and complete." </span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">Moreover, as noted by </span><span style="">Justice
Laurel in the same <span class="SpellE">Angara</span> decision; "The grant
of power to the Electoral Commission to judge all contests </span><span style="">relating to the election, returns </span><span style="">and qualifications of members of the National
Assembly, is intended to be as </span><span style="">complete
and </span><span style="">unimpaired </span><span style="">as if it had remained </span><span style="">originally in the legislature." </span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To such a doctrine this Court has <span style="">remained committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power of
the Electoral </span>Tribunal remains fall, clear and complete.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">excludes
the exercise </span>of any authority on the part <span style="">of this </span>Court that <span style="">would
in </span>any wise restrict or curtail it or even affect the same. <a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Prior, to the proclamation of respondent Peralta, this Court
could <span style="">very well pass </span>on the validity
of the action of respondent Judge in an appropriate proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After such proclamation, and much more so
after the oath of office was taken by the candidate proclaimed, with his
exercise of the prerogatives vested in such position, it would not only curtail
the plenary grant of authority to the Electoral Tribunal but likewise could
result in an unseemly wrangling between such constitutional agency and this
Court if the matter were not left to the sole and<span style=""> </span>exclusive appraisal and judgment of the Electoral Tribunal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The resolution of this Court in <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
Party v. Commission on Elections, <a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
affords a precedent for the dismissal of this suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "* * *, acting on the motion to
dismiss filed by respondent <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, Jr. and petitioners' opposition <span style="">thereto; considering </span>that the
principal issue in this case involves the eligibility or qualification of said
respondent under Section 4, Article VI of the Consti­tution, which provides in
part that ‘no person shall be a Senator unless he be a natural-born citizen of
the Philippines and, <u>at the time of his election is at least thirty-five
years of ag</u><u><span style="">e,</span></u><span style=""> * * *’; </span>that Section 11 of the same Article makes the Senate
Electoral.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tribunal the sole Judge of <span style="">al </span><span style="">contests relating to the elections, returns, and qualifications of</span>
the members of the Senate; that inasmuch as respondent <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aguino</span>, <span style="">Jr. </span>has been proclaimed elected to that body
and has assumes<span style="">
</span>office as <span style="">member thereof the
determination of his eligibility or quali</span>fication properly and
exclusively pertains to the Senate Electoral Tribunal, where in fact a case
involving this issue has been filed and is now pending; and that the other
issues raised in the original petition herein as well, as in the other
pleadings subsequently filed by the parties, as summarized in petitioners'
opposition to the motion to dismiss, <span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="">are
merely incidental in character and have become moot </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">academic insofar as the main issue </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">concerned: the Court resolved to dismiss <span style="">the instant petition, without pronouncement </span>as
to costs."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
