<p class="BODY"><span style="">After due hearing on the application
of peti­tioners for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, the trial
court issued an Order, dated November 12, 1959, granting said application,
which Order reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The plaintiffs came to this Court asking for a writ of preliminary
injunction against the defendant corporation which illegally entered a portion
of the area covered by their ordinary tim­ber license, particularly, the place
called <span class="SpellE">Taga­baca</span> of Los Arcos, <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The concessions covered by the timber
licenses of both parties are ad­jacent to each other, and their common boundary

plaintiffs, located in the Province of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, while
east thereof is the concession of the defendant which lies within the province
of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The boundary between <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> is fixed by law, specifically by Sec. 1 of Act 1693
of the Philippine Commission which reads as fol­lows:</blockquote>

and <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The boundary line of the <span class="SpellE">subprovince</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span> shall be a line beginning at the northern
point of the present boundary line between the provinces of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> and extending in a general southerly
direction along this line to the eighth parallel of north lati­tude; thence due
east along said pa­rallel of latitude to the crest of the watershed between the
<span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> Ri­ver Valley and the Pacific Ocean; thence in
a northerly direction along the crest of this watershed to the northern
extremity of the Island of Mindanao; thence along the sea coast to its point of
origin; the general purpose in establishing this boundary line being to include
within it all municipalities and settlements in the <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>
River Valley and all settle­ments west of the crest of the water­shed in the
northern peninsula of the province of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>.'</p>

<blockquote>"From the above quoted legal provision, the crest of the
watershed between the <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> River Valley and the
Pacific Ocean is the boundary between the two provinces of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, and this crest which is the highest ridge
of the <span class="SpellE">Diwata</span> Mountain, was located by Mr. Justice
Labrador who personally went to the place to lay the cor­ner of the
northeastern boundary of the plaintiffs' concession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This ridge was recently loca­ted by the
District Forester of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> and act­ually measured as
8.501 kilometers from the <span class="SpellE">Lianga</span> beach (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">A-1 and A-2).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs constructed a logging camp west of
this ridge when the plain­tiffs began their logging operations in 1956 and
their possession and logging operation were continuous and peaceful until the
month of September, 1959, when the defendants unlawfully entered a portion of
the area on the side, west of the logging camp and began cutting trees thereon
from hauling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order to avert trouble,
the parties thru their respective representatives entered in­to an agreement,
Annex B to the petition, whereby they agreed not to touch the contested area
until after the same is finally adjudicated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But, be­fore steps could be taken for the settlement of the dispute, the
defendant in violation of the agreement reentered the area on <st1:date year="1959" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1959</st1:date>, thereby forcing the
plaintiffs to seek injunctive relief against defendant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The evidence clearly established the fol­lowing:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the contested area known as <span class="SpellE">Taga­baca</span> is part of the province of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>
being on 'the west of the crest of the watershed between the <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> River Valley and the Pacific Ocean; that this area
forms part of the timber conces­sion of the plaintiffs and that on October 8,
1959 the defendant in violation of the agreement, An­nex B to the complaint,
through the use of force and by taking the law into its own hands, entered the
place <span class="SpellE">Tagabaca</span> which had been in the possession of
the plaintiffs since 1956; that there is necessity of stopping the illegal acts
of intru­sion, invasion and usurpation of the defendant in order to prevent
irreparable damages to the plaintiffs because of their commitments to supply
tim­ber to foreign buyers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Injunction is
the only remedy here available to the plaintiffs to restrain the acts of
trespass and illegal interfer­ence of possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim of the defendant that the contested
area is part of its lumber con­cession is not supported by evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, its witness admitted that they do
not know the provincial boundary of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"WHEREFORE, it is
hereby ordered that upon the filing of the bond in the sum of P10,000.00, with
sufficient sureties approved by the Court, a writ of preliminary injunction
shall issue com­manding the defendant corporation, its agents, officers and
laborers to leave the contested area<span style="">&nbsp; </span>of <span class="SpellE">Tagabaca</span>, Los Arcos, <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> and

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Likewise, after due trial
on the merits, the trial court rendered a Decision, dated June 1, 1965,
declaring the contested area or the place invaded by the private respondent as
part of the timber con­cession of the petitioners and awarded damages in favor
of the petitioners amounting to P47,578.75.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said Decision reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Lianga</span> Lumber Co., is the
owner and possessor of an O. T. License No. 864-'59 <span style="">is­</span>sued for the year 1959, covering a forest conces­sion which
is situated in the province of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> while adjoining
it, is another forest concession which belongs to the defendant <span class="SpellE">Lianga</span> Timber Co., located in the province of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> and covered by <span style="">O.T. </span>License No. 804-'59, likewise issued for the year 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The common boundary of the two con­cessions
is the <span class="SpellE">interprovincial</span> boundary line of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>West of this line is the forest area of the
plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Lianga</span> Lumber Co., comprised within the
province of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, while east thereof, is the area
of the defendant <span class="SpellE">Lianga</span> Timber Co., which lies in the
province of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"By agreement between the <span class="SpellE">Lianga</span>
Lumber Co. and the North <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> Lumber Co., the
latter has been authorized to conduct logging operations in the concession of
the former without protest from any adjoining concessionaire and said
operations continued in the year 1959 on the area in the northeast corner of
the concession, west of the <span class="SpellE">Agusan-Surigao</span> boundary.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On September 13, 1959; the defendant cor­poration thru its
agents entered the concession of the plaintiffs at <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tagabaca</span>, Los Arcos, <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>,
and, on September 18, 1959, the defendant posted armed men in said <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> and, thru force, threats and intimidation, prevented
the laborers of the plaintiffs from entering and logging there in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Against these acts of trespass, the plain­tiffs
vigorously objected and protested.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Efforts were exerted to settle amicably the dispute in order
to avert bloodshed between the parties and, on September 22, 1959, the plain­tiff
<span class="SpellE">Lianga</span> Lumber Co., and the defendant <span class="SpellE">Lianga</span> Timber Co., thru their respective resident managers,
entered into an agreement whereby both par­ties agreed in writing to desist
from logging within the disputed area, pending the final set­tlement of the
conflicting claims, by proper authorities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Annex B to the complaint; Exhibit 7 of the defendant).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"By virtue of the above, agreement, there was cessation of
logging operations by the contracting parties in the disputed area but two
weeks later or to be exact on October 8, 1959, the def­endant corporation by
force and intimidation, again entered the said area and started building a road
for the purpose of logging therein, in gross violation of the conditions of the
agree­ment, thereby forcing the plaintiff to file this complaint to stop the
unlawful acts of trespass committed by the said defendant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The defendant answered the complaint, with general denial and
set up the defense that its logging operations had always been confined with­in
its concession area covered by its Ordinary Timber License No. 864-'59 and that
the area in question is definitely found in said concession area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It further stated that on October 8, 1959,
defendant built a road not for the purpose of logging but in order to gain
access to the other points of its concession, the same being conve­niently
accessible thru a road traversing the area in question; that the plaintiffs are
instead the ones guilty of invading and encroaching upon the concession area of
the defendant, thereby causing enormous damages to the latter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After an exhaustive hearing of the peti­tion for preliminary
injunction, it was found out that the contested area especially that place
known as <span class="SpellE">Tagabaca</span> is part of the province of <span class="SpellE">Agu­san</span> and west of the <span class="SpellE">Agusan-Surigao</span>
boundary line, the same being west of the highest mountain ridge or crest,
between the two provinces which divides the watershed flowing west into the <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> River Valley and that flowing east into the Pacific
Ocean, as defined by section 1 of Act 1693 of the Philippine Commission; that
the crest of the wa­tershed crosses the <span class="SpellE">Lianga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>-Los Arcos, <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> <span class="SpellE">interprovincial</span> road at kilometer 8.501 from <span class="SpellE">Lianga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This point
of crossing and a line drawn <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> southward is
the dividing line between the concession of the plaintiffs and the concession
of the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs constructed
a logging camp west of this ridge and be­gan their logging operation in that
place since 1956, and their operation was continuous and peaceful until the
month of September 1959, when the defendant and its men unlawfully entered a
portion of the area on the side west of the log­ging camp and began cutting
trees thereon.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Before the issuance of the injunction, the plaintiffs already
suffered damages because when the defendant corporation entered the contested
area in October 1959, it cut illegally 63 trees which were subsequently scaled
by the Bureau of Forestry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The total

<p class="BODY">We find that there is no necessity for the remand of the case to
the trial court for further proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It must be noted that the trial court, in its Order of November 12,
1959, granting the ap­plication for the issuance of a preliminary injunct­ive
writ, already found as clearly-established by the evidence that the contested
area known as <span class="SpellE">Taga­baca</span> is part of the Province of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, and that the claim of the defendant that the
contested area is part of its lumber concession is not supported by the
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, the trial court, <span style="">in </span>its decision on the merits of June
1, 1965, found as established by the evidence that "on September 13, 1959,
the defendant corporation, thru its agents, entered the concession of the
plaintiffs at <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tagabaca</span>,
Los Arcos, <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, and, on September 18, 1959, the
defendant posted armed men in said <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> and thru force,
threats and intimidation, prevented the laborers of the plaintiff from entering
and log­ging therein", and that "after an exhaustive hearing of the
petition for preliminary injunction, it was found out that the contested area;
especially that place known as <span class="SpellE">Tagabaca</span>, is part of
the Province <span style="">of </span><span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> * * *"<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
and "the evidence further estab­lished that the contested area is an
integral part of the lumber concession of the plaintiff, which 'the latter has
possessed since 1956 and the defend­ant corporation merely intruded therein
thru the use of force on October 8, 1959 * * *".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deci­sion of the Court of Appeals of
February 19, 1971, affirming <i>en <span class="SpellE">toto</span></i> the
appealed decision of the trial court of June 1, 1965, also stated "that
there is abundant proof to show that the common boundary lines between the two
forest concessions is that provincial boundary line of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>* * *" and that "the contested
area known as <span class="SpellE">Tagabaca</span> is part of the province of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> * *", which conclu­sion of the lower court
"is well supported by the evidence on record."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The decision of the Court

by the evidence that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"* * * the boundary line delimiting the two adjacent
concessions is the <span class="SpellE">Agusan-Surigao</span> Prov­incial
Boundary Line located at the highest ridge, 8.5 km. along the Los Arcos-<span class="SpellE">Lianga</span> Road (Exhibits 'A-1'; 'A-2').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The result therefore is that the disputed
area which is 9.7 km. along the road is within the plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' concession and within the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Agusan</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The foregoing conclusion finds support in the technical
description of the parties' conces­sions which shows that plaintiffs'
concession is in <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> while that of defendant is in
<span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the disputed area is in Los Arcos, <span class="SpellE">Agu­san</span>,
as is provided for in Section 40 of the Revised Administrative Code showing,
that Los Arcos is one of the municipalities within the territo­rial
jurisdiction of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Agusan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, there is the admission of
Senator <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> that <span class="SpellE">Tagabaca</span>
where the disputed area <span class="GramE">is,</span> is lo­cated in Los Arcos, <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 225, 229, <st1:date year="1962" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1962</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even the findings of Forester <span class="SpellE">Macabeo</span> of the Bureau of Forestry fixed the high­est point
of ridge marking the boundary between the two provinces at 8.501 <span class="SpellE">kms</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Exhibit 'A-2')
Finally, if the plaintiffs had really encroached on 420 hectares of valuable
timber land in April 1959, defendant would not have sought the dismis­sal of
the case (pp. 68-82, Rec. on <span class="SpellE">Ap</span>.), instead of having
the case tried and decided on the merits without any delay and thus soon
recover damages <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, unmasking thereby Justice
Labrador as trespasser and intruder.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, it is incompre­hensible why defendant did not initiate the pre­sent
case or another action for redress. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Finally, there is the strong presumption as to
the correct­ness of the decision appealed from, especially after it was
affirmed and the first motion for reconsideration thereof had been denied by
this Court." (<span class="GramE">at</span> pp. 6-7).</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Private respondent now
claims that it has been its theory even before the trial court that the
boundary between the two concessions is not the political boundary between the
provinces of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>
but the forestry boundary indicated in the control map of the Bureau of
Forestry, which may not actually coincide with the political boundary mentioned
by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private <span class="GramE">respondents</span>
position, in effect, is that the location of the political boundary of the two
provinces is not relevant to the issue since the area of its concession may ex­tend
beyond such political boundary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is,
however, not fully supported by the records.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Except for its statement in its Motion to Dismiss Proceed­ings which it
filed on February 19, 1960, private respondent has always insisted in the court
<i>a quo</i> that its timber concession was entirely located in the Province of
<span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>, while that </span><span style="">of petitioner </span><span style="">is
situated within the Province of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, It cannot be
denied that private respondent never alleged in their answer that its timber
concession extended to the province of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, since
its forestry bound­ary is not necessarily delimited by the political boundary
of the two provinces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in paragraph
5 of its amended </span><span style="">answer, private
</span><span style="">respondent speci</span><span style="">fically alleged that <i>"the </i></span><i><span style="">subject area is within defendant's concession

is further shown by the recitals contained in the orders issued by the court <i><span style="">a quo</span></i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, </span>in its Order of <st1:date year="1959" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1959</st1:date>, the trial court
specifically stated that the con­cessions covered by the timber licenses of
both parties "are adjacent to each other, and their com­mon boundary is
the <i>provincial boundary </i><i><span style="">line</span></i><span style=""> </span>of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>West of this line is the for­estry concession of the plaintiffs located
in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Agusan</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, while east thereof is

that "the contested area <i>is</i><i><span style="">

stated that "the lower court actually had no jurisdiction over the subject

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The complaint filed by

plaintiff, more particularly the place known, as <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tagabaca</span>, Los Arcos, * * * outside the limits of
defendant's concession * * *" which "<span class="SpellE">sitio</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Tagabaca</span> is in the Province of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>,
west of the <span class="SpellE">Surigao-Agusan</span> boundary, outside of def­endant's
concession, and within that of plaintiff's," As stated heretofore, private
respondent directly <span style="">traversed this, </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">insisting in </span><span style="">its answer of
Octo­ber 24, 1959, as well as its afore-quoted amended answer, that the
disputed area is within defendant's concession and is a territorial part of the

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Since the issue raised in
the court <i>a</i> <i>quo</i>, on the basis of the evidence presented and upon
which the court rendered its judgment, is whether or not the contested area is
located within the province of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>, such question

were not raised, in the lower court cannot be raised for the first time on

be raised on appeal, it is essential that it be within the issue made by the
parties in their pleadings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Con</span>sequently,
when a party deliberately adopts a cer­tain theory and the case is tried and
decided upon that theory in the lower court, he will not be per­mitted to
change his theory on appeal because to permit him to do so will be unfair to
the adverse <span style="">party.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Indeed, the petitioners would have no </span>more

in the province of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span></i> in accordance with the
provi­sions of Sections 38 and 40 of the Revised Administrative Code, It is
also important to note that the Court of Appeals in the same Resolution found
that "By and large, the evidence * * * tends to support the claim of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> * * *" and at the same time refused to give
credence to the For­estry Control Map (Exhibit "1") which was
submitted in support of private respondent's claim that their forestry boundary
is different from the political or statutory boundary of the two provinces,
considering that said document was obviously prepared only in the year 1959, or
some years after the issu­ance of the timber licenses to the parties,
"since appearing and reflected thereon are the areas cover­ed by licenses
issued as late as 1959, as O.T.-181­-59 of <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-top: 12pt;">Upon the other hand, this Court cannot
place much reliance on the so-called "Forestry Control Map" (Exhibit

respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, the
Ordinary Timber License of <span class="SpellE">Lianga</span> Lumber Company
(Exhibit "C") clearly and specific­ally referred to a grant to said
licensee of a for­ested area within the district of <span class="SpellE">Azpitia</span>,
Los Arcos and <span class="SpellE">Prosperidad</span>, in the Province of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, while the license of private respondent (Exhibit

Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Lianga</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>. Pursuant to Section 40 of the Revised
Administrative Code, <span class="SpellE">Azpitia</span>, Los Arcos, and <span class="SpellE">Prosperidad</span> are muni­cipal districts within the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Agusan</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,

the forestry officials was to include a part of a forested area in <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> in the timber license granted to private respondent,
no logical explanation had been given why such matter was not clearly and
specifically stated therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consider
also the fact that both licenses were subsequently renewed and yet no
correction or amendment in the description of the timber area granted to either
party to conform to the forestry control map was ever made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, Exhibit "C" was renewed on <st1:date year="1954" day="28" month="6">June 28, 1954</st1:date> (Exhibit

"C-5") without any changes or alterations of the description of the
forested area in the two timber concessions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, no less than private respon­dent's counsel, Atty. Arturo C. <span class="SpellE">Mojica</span>, admitted that the Forestry Control Map (Exhibit
"1") was not yet prepared when the boundary of the conces­sions of
both parties were laid allegedly on the ground.<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
Thirdly, it was found as an established fact by both the trial court and the
Court of Ap­peals that Exhibit "1" was not prepared earlier than 1959
and, consequently, could not have been the basis of the technical descriptions
appearing in the timber licenses originally issued to <span class="SpellE">Lianga</span>
Lumber Company on January 28, 1954 (Exhibit "C") or of the timber
license issued to <span class="SpellE">Lianga</span> Timber Company, Inc. on
August 28, 1956 (Exhibit "2").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither are <span class="GramE">We</span> persuaded that the phrase "<span class="SpellE">Agusan-Surigao</span> Provincial <span style="">Boundary" in the timber licenses (Exhibits "C" and
"2") was not intended to mean the <span class="SpellE">Agusan-Surigao</span>
provincial boundary line as provided by law but an artificial or imaginary line
fixed by the forestry officials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must
be noted that both timber licenses mentioned existing natural or other well
known monuments as landmarks to indicate the respective limits of each
concession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the Ordinary Timber
License of petitioners (Exhibit "C") refers to the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Sibung</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">River</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">, the </span><st1:street><st1:address><span style="">Los Arcos-<span class="SpellE">Lianga</span>
  Road</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="">
and <span class="SpellE">Tinanguanan</span> Creek, while the license of private
res</span>pondent refers also to the <st1:street><st1:address>Los Arcos-<span class="SpellE">Lianga</span> Road</st1:address></st1:street> and the mouth of
the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Wakat</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>
to indicate the boundaries of each concession.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering that the "<span class="SpellE">Agusan-Surigao</span>
boundary line" has already been fixed by law and is of public knowledge to
all con­cerned, since everyone is presumed to know the law, is it not more
logical to assume that when the Director of Forestry stated as the common
boundary of each concession the "<span class="SpellE">Agusan-Surigao</span>
boundary line" he was referring to the boundary line fixed by law, and not
to an imaginary line, the location of which is not known to the parties or to
the public?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the Director of
Forestry, at the time he issued the license, could not have been re­ferring to
the technical boundary in the Forestry Control <span style="">Map </span>considering that said document was not <span style="">yet </span>then <span style="">in existence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It </span>must be
presumed that official duty has been regularly <span style="">performed.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>There is also the report of Forester <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Maca­beo</span> (Exhibit

review only are the <span class="SpellE"><i>Gancayco</i></span><i> Resolutions</i>

We reverse the Court of Appeals in favor of the trial court's judgment.</p>

raised by them that the second motion for reconsideration of pri­vate
