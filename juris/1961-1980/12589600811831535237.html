				G.R. No. L-20016, April 29, 1966</h4>
				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION AS A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. EMMANUEL YU NAM, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR AND APPELLANT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The
Republic challenges the correctness of the decision of the Cebu Court
of First Instance granting the petition for naturalization of Emmanuel
Yu Nam.</p>
  <p>Several errors are assigned in its printed brief,
    the most important of which refers to petitioner's use
    of aliases without judicial authority.</p>
  <p>Indeed the petition alleges that applicant's full
    name is Emmanuel Yu Nam; and such petition was published
    under such name. However, his birth certificate show that
    he is Emmanuel Ong, and his school records listed him as
    Manuel Ong y Lim. These other names were not mentioned in
    his petition; and under our rulings, such omission taints
    the whole proceeding, to such extent as practically to deprive the court of jurisdiction over the matter.</p>
  <p>In a case<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> where the petition was filed in the
    name of Celerino Yu Seco, although the petitioner's real
    name was Celerino S. Yu, and the publication referred to the
    former name, this Court declined to approve the grant of
    naturalization explaining, through Mr. Justice J. B. L.
    Reyes.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "* * * his petition was, however, filed in the name of Celerino
      Yu Seco and accordingly, the publication of the notice of the filing
      of said petition shows the name of
      Celerino Yu Seco as the applicant
      and not Celerino S. Yu. We think
      this publication does not afford sufficient notice of the filing of the
      petition and is misleading to the
      public. The purpose of the requirement of publication is "to apprise
      the public of the pendency of the
      petition so that those who may know
      of any legal objection to it might
      come forward with the information in
      order to determine the fitness of
      petitioner for Philippine citizenship" (Ng Bui Kui <em>vs</em>. Republic, G. R.
      No. L-11172, Dec. 22, 1958). If petitioner's true name is Celerino S.
      Yu, while the notices published give
      his name as Celerino Yu Seco, persons
      who might have derogatory information
      against Gelerino S. Yu might not come
      
      forward with it in the belief that Celerino S. Yu Seco, the applicant, is some
      one else. The purpose of the publication would thus be defeated, and the
      road would be laid open to fraudulent
      subterfuges through the use of <em>aliases</em>. * * *"</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> The foregoing considerations are self-evident; and
      proper publication of the petition being a primordial step
      in proceedings of this nature, we are impelled to reverse
      the judgment. Without further going into the merit of the
      other objections raised by the Republic.</p>
  <p><strong></strong>Accordingly, the petition for citizenship is denied,
        with costs.</p>
