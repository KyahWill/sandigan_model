				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal on points of law from a judgment rendered by the Court of First
Instance of Manila in its case No. 56020.</p>

<p class="BODY">The essential antecedents of the case, as disclosed <span style="">by the</span> record and the stipulated facts,
are that on June 17, 1962, the SS "SUSAN MAERSK" discharged at Manila
142 cartons of books consigned from New York to the Philippine Education Co.,
Inc. and received in good order condition by the <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">arrastre</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>operator Manila Port Service, a
department of the Manila Railroad Company.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On June 21, 1962, less than four (4) days after discharge, the consignee
filed a provisional claim of loss and damage stating the marks and number of
packages, following it by formal claims on October 22 and 26, placing the value
of the damage at P601<span class="GramE">,78</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Bad Order Examination Report No. 1525,
dated August 14, 1962, issued by the Manila Port Service, showed 21 cartons as
having sustained shortages.</p>

<p class="BODY">The claims having been rejected, the Philippine Education
Company, Inc. brought action in the Municipal Court of Manila, <span style="">which </span><span style="">ordered the Port Service to indemnify the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant appealed to the Court of First
Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After hearing, the latter
affirmed the judgment of the Municipal Court, awarding the plaintiff P6</span>0<span style="">1.78 including for all damages suffered by
the consignee, plus P50.00 attorneys' fees and costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Dissatisfied with the decision
rendered, defendant again appealed, this time to the Supreme Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The first issue that <span class="GramE">appellant tenders is</span> the alleged insufficiency of the
provisional claim, for failure to state the money value of the damage
sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>We <span style="">have overruled this contention in numerous
decisions rendered previously, particularly Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co. vs.
United Lines and Manila Port Service, L-21546, March 31, 1966; State Bonding </span>&amp;
<span style="">Insurance Co. vs. Manila Port Service,
L-21838, Feb. 28, 1966 and Domestic Insurance Co. vs. Manila Railroad Co.,
L-24066, August 30, 1967, wherein we ruled that the purpose of a provisional
claim being to afford the <span class="SpellE"><u>arrastre</u></span> operator a
reasonable opportunity to check the validity of the claim while the facts are
still fresh, the absence of a statement therein as to the precise amount of the
loss does not render the claim invalid as a substantial compliance with the
terms of Section 15 of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> management
contract, so long as the claim is filed after the discharge of the cargo and
within 15 days thereafter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellant argues next
that the award should have been limited to P303.86, the established invoice
value of the damaged goods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
contention must be overruled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span> (Phil.) Inc. vs. Manila Port Service, L-21055,
August 31, 1966, it was held that the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operator is responsible, not only for the invoice value of the goods damaged or
lost, but also for all damages that may be suffered by </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">consignee on account of their loss,
destruction or </span><span style="">injury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">This case being a direct appeal from the
Court of First Instance, the review must be confined to points of law, and the
amount of damages found by the Court below is no longer debatable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant lastly protests
against the award of P50.00 attorneys' fees.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant has been systematically rejecting claims of the kind shown at
bar, as attested by numerous decisions of this Court </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">this and past years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such conduct renders the award of attorneys'
fees just and equitable, and the objection must be rejected (Civil </span>Code,
Art. 2208, No. <span style="">11).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision is affirmed with costs
against appellants, Port Service and Manila Railroad Company.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
