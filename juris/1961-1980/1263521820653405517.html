				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Complainant Evangeline <span class="SpellE">Argañoza</span> sent a
telegram to this Court on <st1:date year="1970" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1970</st1:date>
requesting that "the oath-taking of Atty. Benito P. <span class="SpellE">Tubaces</span>
be held in abeyance." It was therein further stated that the reason relied
upon was immorality and that a letter would follow. Subsequently, four days
later, a letter duly subscribed and sworn by the complainant was received by
this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was therein alleged:
"In 1966, I agreed to live with Benito who was then a sophomore student in
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place> and we had a child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Per his request, I left with our kid in July
1967 so he can muster the usual financial support from his parents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As agreed I sacrificed almost two years of
painful seclusion although, I received constant communication from him as he
likewise did from me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We saw each other
again in 1968 when he came to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
for his review and participation in the bar examinations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In November of the same year, however, he
returned to his home province, leaving me and the kid behind giving flimsy
excuse the uncertainty of his passing in the exams."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The next paragraph of such letter was worded thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"He did flunk in the first exam and
having decided to take the next, he further requested me to stop communicating
with me until the examination was over.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I wrote him several letters immediately after especially when I
delivered our second baby but I constantly faced a blank wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This never put me off, though.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, my eagerness to hear from him kept
on mounting until that eventful day came the - release of the results of the
bar examinations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He made the grade this
time and I was no more glad than my folks.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We sent him two congratulatory messages and again we were disappointed
to hear no word from him."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
This Court was likewise informed therein that they met accidentally, on which
occasion she tried to convince him that they should live together but instead
of agreeing, his proposal was just to get the two children to live with him and
for them to separate for good.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
She would plead then that "he be barred from membership in the Philippine
Bar."</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court, on April 16, 1970, resolved:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>" * * (a) to note the contents of the
telegram of Evangeline <span class="SpellE">Argañoza</span> requesting that the
oath-taking of Benito P. <span class="SpellE">Tubaces</span> be withheld on the
ground of immorality; (b) to require that a copy of the letter of Evangeline <span class="SpellE">Argañoza</span> be sent to Benito P. <span class="SpellE">Tubaces</span>;
and (c) to require respondent <span class="SpellE">Tubaces</span> to answer said
letter-complaint, within 10 days from notice hereof."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Instead of answering, respondent Benito P. <span class="SpellE">Tubaces</span>
waited until <st1:date year="1970" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1970</st1:date>
when he filed a petition alleging that complainant was retracting or
withdrawing her complaint and that therefore he should be allowed to take the
lawyer's oath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Enclosed in such petition
is a letter signed Evangeline <span class="SpellE">Argañoza</span> where, after
referring to the complaint filed by her against respondent, there was this
declaration of retraction or withdrawal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Without pressure nor
influence exerted upon me, I voluntarily, irrevocably, and unconditionally
retract or withdraw the said complaint on the ground that we have applied and
was granted a marriage license having agreed to get married on December of this
year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The marriage license was issued on
the 21st day of August, 1970 by the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Civil
Registrar."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Then came the resolution of this Court of August 31, 1970 to the
following effect:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Complainant is
required to comment, within 10 days from notice hereof, on the petition of the
respondent with the latter's affidavit attached thereto, praying that he be
allowed to take the lawyer's oath in view of the complainant's withdrawal of
her complaint."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The reply of complainant was received on <st1:date year="1970" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was stated therein:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In
reply thereto, I am hereby informing your good office that I am objecting to
said lawyer's oath-taking of Mr. Benito P. <span class="SpellE">Tubaces</span> on
grounds of immorality on one hand and deceit on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I hereby request that my letter
dated <st1:date year="1970" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1970</st1:date> to
your Office be withdrawn and considered without force and effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently, I am reviving my complaint against
Mr. Benito P. <span class="SpellE">Tubaces</span> on grounds of immorality
because of his refusal, upon my request, to put in writing the fulfillment of
his promise to marry me not later than <st1:date year="1971" day="21" month="12">December
 21, 1971</st1:date>."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
This Court, however, on September 28, 1970, considering the petition of
respondent <span class="SpellE">Tubaces</span> praying that he be allowed to take
the lawyer's oath in view of the withdrawal of the complaint filed against him
and the comment therein, denied the petition, respondent being further required
to file an answer on the charges lodged against him ten days from notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a motion for the reconsideration of
the above action taken by this Court filed by respondent on October 21, 1970,
wherein he justified his failure to file an answer thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The petitioner, in view of the
retraction or withdrawal of complainant, felt it needless to file his answer to
her complaint as required by the resolution of this Court as there is no more
to answer for the complaint was withdrawn and instead file this motion for
reconsideration which filing is delayed because of the honest and innocent
belief that the letter of withdrawal or retraction is already sufficient and
will serve as petition of the undersigned to take the oath of attorney."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
The prayer in such motion for reconsideration was a reiteration of his plea
that he be allowed to take the oath of an attorney.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The above motion for reconsideration was
referred to complainant for comment in a resolution of <st1:date year="1970" day="26" month="10">October 26, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The comment came on <st1:date year="1970" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1970</st1:date>, complainant "retracting
or withdrawing [her] complaint against Mr. <span class="SpellE">Tubaces</span> on
the reasons stated in [her] letter of withdrawal and [interposing] no objection
to his oath-taking in the earliest time possible, as prayed for in his
motion."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Both complainant and respondent were required by resolution of
this Court of November 18, 1970 to appear personally before it on <st1:date year="1970" day="16" month="12">December 16, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both complainant and respondent duly appeared
and informed the Court that they had settled their differences and were
intending to get married.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Five days
later, on December 21, 1970, in a pleading filed with this Court by respondent,
there was an allegation of such marriage having taken place on December 18,
1970 with City Judge Oscar A. <span class="SpellE">Inocentes</span> of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City having performed the ceremony, a <span class="SpellE">photostat</span> copy of the marriage contract accompanying such
manifestation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To satisfy itself, this
Court resolved, on <st1:date year="1971" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1971</st1:date>,
to require that both complainant and respondent appear before it on <st1:date year="1971" day="22" month="2">Monday, February 22, 1971</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At such a date, the parties appeared before
this Court with the additional information that they intended to get married in
a religious ceremony, such a marriage to take place on <st1:date year="1971" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1971</st1:date> in the Immaculate Conception Parish
Church with Rev. Fr. Emilio Castro officiating.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A <span class="SpellE">photostat</span> copy of the marriage contract was
submitted by complainant and respondent in an urgent joint motion praying that
the respondent be allowed to take the oath of attorney, filed with this Court
on March 3, 1971.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Included in such
motion is a <span class="SpellE">photostat</span> copy of the marriage contract
resulting from the religious ceremony.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court takes due cognizance that respondent Benito P. <span class="SpellE">Tubaces</span> appears to have mended his ways and that a
satisfactorily long period had elapsed from the time the results of the 1969
bar examinations were announced on March 5, 1970.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, it is of the opinion
that his plea to be allowed to take the lawyer's oath may be favorably acted
on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent is admonished to be duly
mindful of the standard of rectitude to which a member of the bar is expected
to live up to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The delay in his being
duly admitted to the practice of his profession, a matter traceable solely to
his far-from-exemplary conduct, ought to admonish him to observe with fidelity
its canons of behavior.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He must by this
time be fully cognizant that a failure to do so would be sufficient cause for
the appropriate disciplinary action.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the urgent joint motion of <st1:date year="1971" day="3" month="3">March 3, 1971</st1:date>, praying that respondent <span class="SpellE">Tubaces</span> be allowed to take the lawyer's oath, is granted.</p>
