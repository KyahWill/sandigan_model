<p class="BODY"><span style="">The facts are
undisputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February 1976, private
respondent Federation of Free Workers, La <span class="SpellE">Suerte</span>
Chapter, filed a petition for certification election alleging that out of a
bargaining unit of more or less 3,500, there were 1,068 signatories.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The previous certified collective bargaining
agreement between the employer La <span class="SpellE">Suerte</span> Cigar and
Cigarette Factory and petitioner labor union terminated on </span><st1:date year="1975" day="5" month="12"><span style="">December
 5, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was, eleven days later, a motion to
intervene filed by petitioner followed on March 1, 1976 by a motion </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">dismiss on the ground that respondent Union had not complied with the
thirty percent consent requirement and that the petition for certification was
filed beyond the sixty-day period to the expiration of the collective
bargaining contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When a few days
later the employer submitted a list </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the rank and file
employees numbering 4,055, private respondent countered with an additional </span><span style="">list </span><span style="">of signatories, 331 in number making a total of 1,399 signatories.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent thereafter opposed the
motion to dismiss, stating that there was compliance with the thirty percent </span><span style="">consent requirement </span><span style="">and that the filing was within the period allowed
by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1976" day="6" month="4"><span style="">April 6, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">, Med-Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>
M. Jimenez issued an order denying the motion to dismiss and granting the
petition for certification election filed by private respondent, the choice
being between petitioner and respondent unions, with employees likewise being
given the opportunity to vote for "No Union." An appeal was taken to
respondent <span class="SpellE">Noriel</span> as Director of the Bureau of Labor
Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then came on </span><st1:date year="1976" day="23" month="10"><span style="">October
 23, 1976</span></st1:date><span style=""> an order
from him, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which is to the
effect that the appeal was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
motion for reconsideration having proved futile, this petition for <i>certiorari</i>
was filed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As stated at the outset,
there is no showing </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">arbitrary or improvident exercise of
authority to </span><span style="">justify granting </span><span style="">the writ of <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition must be dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1. The present Labor Code, as the former Industrial Peace Act,
rightfully stresses the importance of a certification election to ascertain
which labor union should be the collective bargaining agent and thus assure the
success of the collective bargaining procedure.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This excerpt from the recent case of Philippine Association of Free
Labor Unions v. Bureau of Labor Relations<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
finds pertinence: "Petitioner thus appears to be woefully lacking in
awareness of the significance of a certification election for the collective
bargaining process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the fairest
and most effective way of determining which labor organization can truly
represent the working force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a
fundamental postulate that the will of the majority, if given expression in an
honest election with freedom on the part of the voters to make their choice, is
controlling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No better device can assure
the institution of industrial democracy with the two parties to a business
enterprise, management and labor, establishing a regime of self-rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was pointed out by Chief Justice Castro in
Rivera v. San Miguel Brewery Corporation, Inc., 'a collective bargaining
agreement is the <u>law of the plant</u>.' To the same effect is this explicit
pronouncement in <span class="SpellE">Mactan</span> Workers Union v. <span class="SpellE">Aboitiz</span>: 'The terms and conditions of a collective
bargaining contract constitute the law between the parties.' What could be
aptly stressed then, as was done in <span class="SpellE">Compania</span> <span class="SpellE">Maritima</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Compania</span> <span class="SpellE">Maritima</span> Labor Union, is 'the primacy to which the decision
reached by the employees themselves is entitled.' Further, it was therein
stated: 'That is in the soundest tradition of industrial democracy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For collective bargaining implies that
instead of a unilateral imposition by management, the terms and conditions of
employment should be the subject of negotiation between it and labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus the two parties indispensable to the
economy are supposed to take care of their respective interests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the very notion of industrial
self-rule negates the assumption that what is good for either party should be
left to the will of the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
contrary, there is an awareness that labor can be trusted to promote its
welfare through the bargaining process.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To it then must be left the choice of its agent for such purpose.' * * *
There is, it would appear, <span style="">a </span>decidedly
unsympathetic approach by petitioner to the institution of collective
bargaining at war with what has so often and so consistently decided by this
Tribunal."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The above principle <span style="">has </span>been
adhered to in subsequent decisions of this Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2. The objection of petitioner as to the alleged lack of the
thirty percent requirement in the number <span style="">of
</span>signatories according to the present Labor Code is with­out merit.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Private respondent, as noted in the comment, "filed the petition for
certification supported by 1,068 signatories of the employees of the employer
or more than 30% of the 3,500 rank and file employees of the employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the petition was filed, the employer
however submitted a list of its regular rank and file employees with <span style="">a </span>total number of 4,055.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent, in order to comply with
the 30% consent requirement, submitted an additional list of 331 rank and file
employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the signatories totaled
1,399 or more than 30% of the 4,055 employees."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">Even if, as contended by petitioner,
there were among the signatories submitted 105 falsified or double entries and
7 came from those not qualified to vote or a total of 112, that would still
leave 1,287 signatories or more than thirty percent of the 4,055 employees.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The matter is thus essentially factual in
character, the determination by respondent <span class="SpellE">Noriel</span>
being entitled to respect.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">3. At any rate, as again noted in the comment, petitioner did miss
the <span style="">point that </span>such a
requirement of thirty percent of all the employees in the bargaining unit is
relevant only when it becomes <u>mandatory</u> for respondent <span class="SpellE">Noriel</span> to conduct a certification election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So Article 258 explicitly provides.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner ignored that respondent <span class="SpellE">Noriel</span> is likewise possessed of <u><span style="">discretionary</span></u><span style=""> </span>power
whether or not a certification election should be held.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such a case, there is <span style="">no </span>such thirty percent
requirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it was held in the above
Philippine Association of Free Labor Unions decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "Petitioner would minimize its
failure to abide by what is settled law by invoking this provision in the New
Labor Code: 'Any <span style="">petition </span>for
certification election filed by any legitimate labor organization shall be
supported by the written consent of at least 30% of all the employees in the
bargaining unit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon receipt and
verification of such <span style="">petition, </span>it
shall be mandatory for the Bureau to conduct a certification election for the
purpose of determining the representative of the employees in the appropriate
bargaining unit and certify the winner as the exclusive collective bargaining
representative of all the employees in the unit.' It cannot change the
outcome.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not suffice to impress
the petition with merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * *
Petitioner's contention to the effect that the 30% requirement should be
satisfied suffers from an even graver flaw.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If fails to distinguish between the right of a labor organization to be
able to persuade 30% of the labor force to petition for a certification
election, in which case respondent Bureau is left with no choice but <span style="">to </span>order it, and the power of such
governmental agency precisely entrusted with the implementation of <span style="">the collective </span>bargaining process to
determine, considering <span style="">the likelihood </span><span style="">that there may </span><span style="">be several unions </span><span style="">with</span><span style="">i</span><span style="">n
</span><span style="">bargaining </span><span style="">unit, to </span><span style="">order </span><span style="">such </span><span style="">an </span><span style="">election precisely </span><span style="">for </span><span style="">the p</span><span style="">urpose o</span><span style="">f ascertaining
which of them </span><span style="">shall </span><span style="">be the exclusive collective bargaining
representative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">The decision of </span><span style="">respondent Bureau </span><span style="">of </span><st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="4"><span style="">April 14, </span><span style="">1975</span></st1:date><span style=""> was </span><span style="">intended for that purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * *
To reiterate a thought already expressed, what could </span><span style="">be more appropriate </span><span style="">than such </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">procedure if the goal
desired is to enable </span><span style="">labor to </span><span style="">determine which of the competing
organizations should represent it for </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">purpose of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">collective bargaining contract?"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">4. Nor was there any improvident or arbitrary exercise of
authority when respondent <span class="SpellE">Noriel</span> ordered the <span style="">Certification </span>election after the lapse
of the sixty-day period provided for by law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span style="">law </span>cannot <span style="">be </span>any clearer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It argues against the pretension of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According <span style="">to the </span>Labor Code: "No certi­fication election issue shall
be entertained by the Bureau in any collective bargaining unit if a collective
bargaining agreement exists between the employer and a legitimate labor
organization, except within sixty (60) <span style="">days
</span>prior to the <span style="">expiration of the
life of </span>such certified collective bargaining agreement."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
No other meaning can be attached to <span style="">such
provision, </span>as applied to the present situation, except that <span style="">the former collective bargaining </span>agreement
having expired on <st1:date year="1975" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1975</st1:date>,
<span style="">sixty </span>days prior to that date, a
petition for certification election could have been filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not mean that after <st1:date year="1975" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1975</st1:date>, no such petition
could be entertained by respondent <span style="">provided
there </span>was no certified collective bargaining agreement that had taken
its place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is undisputed <span style="">that </span>no subsequent certified
collective contract was in existence at the time the petition for holding the
certification election was filed by respondent union on <st1:date year="1976" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1976</st1:date>. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>There was no legal bar then to such a
move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the restrictive
interpretation sought to be fastened on such a provision by petitioner would
set at naught the basic objective of the Labor Code to institute <span style="">a </span>true system of industrial democracy,
through the collective bargaining process with the representative of labor
chosen after a free and honest certification election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court then is not prepared to accept the
theory of petitioner, which is not only unsound in theory but pernicious <span style="">in </span>its consequences.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for <i>certiorari</i> is
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Noriel</span> is directed to set the date for the holding of the
certification election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This decision is
