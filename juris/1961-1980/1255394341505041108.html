				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an original complaint filed with this Court charging respondents with 
unprofessional and unethical conduct in soliciting cases and intriguing against 
a brother lawyer, and praying that respondents be dealt with accordingly.<p></p>
<p>The facts which led to the filing of this complaint are as follows: In May, 
1952, petitioner was retained by Nieves Rillas Vda. de Barrera to handle her 
case (Sp. Proc. No. 2-J) in the Court of First Instance of Cebu, entitled 
"Testate Estate of Macario Barrera". By January, 1955, petitioner had 
contemplated the closing of the said administration proceedings and prepared two 
pleadings: one, to close the proceedings and declare Nieves Rillas Vda. de 
Barrera as universal heir and order the delivery to her of the residue of the 
estate and, second, a notice for the rendition of final accounting and partition 
of estate. At this point, however, the administratrix Nieves Rillas Vda. de 
Barrera refused to counter-sign these two pleadings and instead advised 
petitioner not to file them. Some weeks later, petitioner found in the records 
of said proceedings that respondent Atty. Fortunato Patalinghug had filed on 
January 11, 1955 a written appearance as the new counsel for Nieves Rillas Vda. 
de Barrera. On February 5, 1955 petitioner voluntarily asked the court to be 
relieved as counsel for Mrs. Barrera. On February 7, 1955, the other respondent, 
Atty. Francisco E. F. Remotigue, entered his appearance, dated February 5, 
1955.</p>
<p>Complainant here alleges that the appearances of respondents were unethical 
and improper for the reason that they had nursed the desire to replace the 
petitioner as attorney for the estate and the administratrix and, taking 
advantage of her goodwill, intrigued against the preparation of the final 
inventory and accounting and prodded Mrs. Barrera not to consent to petitioner's 
decision to close the administration proceedings; that before their appearance, 
they brought petitioner's client to their law office and there made her sign 
four documents captioned "Revocation of Power of Attorney" and sent the same by 
mail to several corporations and establishments where the estate of Macario 
Barrera is owner of certificates of stocks and which documents purported to 
disauthorize the petitioner from further collecting and receiving the dividends 
of the estate from said corporations, when in fact and in truth the respondents 
fully knew that no power of attorney or authority was given to the petitioner by 
his client, the respondents' motive being to embarrass petitioner to the 
officials, lawyers and employees of said corporations, picturing him as a 
dishonest lawyer and no longer trusted by his clientâ€”all with the purpose of 
straining the relationship of the petitioner and his client, Nieves Rillas Vda. 
de Barrera; and that Atty. Patalinghug entered his appearance without notice to 
petitioner.</p>
<p>In answer, respondent Atty. Patalinghug stated that when he entered his 
appearance on January 11, 1955 the administratrix Nieves Rillas Vda. de Barrera 
had already lost confidence in her lawyer, the herein petitioner, and had in 
fact already with her a pleading dated January 11, 1955, entitled "Discharge of 
Counsel for the Administration and Motion to Cite Atty. Casiano Laput", which 
she herself had filed with the court.</p>
<p>In answer, respondent Atty. Remotigue stated that when he filed his 
appearance on February 7, 1955, the petitioner has already withdrawn as 
counsel.</p>
<p>After separate answers were filed by the Respondents, the Supreme Court 
referred the case to the Solicitor General for investigation, report and 
recommendation. The Solicitor General recommended the complete exoneration of 
respondents.</p>
<p>It appears and it was found by the Solicitor General that before respondent 
Atty. Fortunato Patalinghug entered his appearance, the widow administratrix had 
already filed with the court a pleading discharging the petitioner, Atty. 
Casiano Laput. If she did not furnish Atty. Laput with a copy of the said 
pleading, it was not the fault of Atty. Patalinghug but that of the said widow. 
It appears that the reason why Mrs. Barrera dismissed petitioner as her lawyer 
was that she did not trust him any longer, for one time she found out that some 
dividend checks which should have been sent to her were sent instead to 
petitioner, making her feel that she was being cheated by petitioner.</p>
<p>Moreover, she found that withdrawals from the Philippine National Bank and 
Bank of the Philippine Islands have been made by petitioner without her prior 
authority.</p>
<p>We see no irregularity in the appearance of respondent Atty. Fortunato 
Patalinghug as counsel for the widow; much less can we consider it as an actual 
grabbing of a case from petitioner. The evidence as found by the Solicitor 
General shows that Atty. Patalinghug's professional services were contracted by 
the widow, a written contract having been made as to the amount to be given him 
for his professional services.</p>
<p>Petitioner's voluntary withdrawal on February 5, 1955, as counsel for Mrs. 
Barrera after Atty. Patalinghug had entered his appearance, and his 
(petitioner's) filing almost simultaneously of a motion for the payment of his 
attorney's fees, amounted io an acquiscence to the appearance of respondent 
Atty. Patalinghug as counsel for the widow. This should estop petitioner from 
now complaining that the appearance of Atty. Patalinghug was unprofessional.</p>
<p>Much less could we hold respondent Atty. Remotigue guilty of unprofessional 
conduct inasmuch as he entered his appearance, dated February 5, 1955, only on 
February 7, same year, after Mrs. Barrera had dispensed with petitioner's 
professional services on January 11, 1955, and after petitioner had voluntarily 
withdrawn his appearanceon February 5, 1955.</p>
<p>With respect to the preparation by Atty. Patalinghug of the revocations of 
power of attorney as complained of by petitioner, the Solicitor General found 
that the same does not appear to be prompted by malice or intended to hurt 
petitioner's feelings, but purely to safeguard the interest of the 
administratrix. Evidently, petitioner's pride was hurt by the issuance of these 
documents, and felt that he had been pictured as a dishonest lawyer; for he 
filed a case before the City Fiscal of Cebu against Atty. Patalinghug and the 
widow for libel and falsification. It was shown, however, that the case was 
dismissed.</p>
<p>No sufficient evidence having been submitted to sustain the charges, these 
are hereby dismissed and the case closed.</p> <em>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Paredes, Dizon, 
Regala,</em> and <em>Makalintal, JJ., </em>concur.</div>
