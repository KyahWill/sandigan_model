				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a direct appeal from the judgment of the Court of First Instance of 
Manila, Honorable Carmelino G. Alvendia, presiding, quoted hereunder:
<blockquote>
<p align="center">"DECISION</p>
<p>"This is an action, to recover damages arising from the seizure of thirty 
long tons of unprepared scrap iron by the defendant Sheriff of Manila at the 
instance of defendant Tan Tiong Tick.</p>
<p>"From the evidence presented by the parties, it appears that plaintiff is the 
owner of thirty long tons of scrap iron which was salvaged from the U. S. Navy 
Base at Sangley Point, Cavite (Exhs. A, B, and C). Said scrap iron was 
stockpiled at the scrap yard of Tan Tay Cuan at the Madrigal Compound on 
Cristobal Street, Manila.</p>
<p>"In April, 1958 defendant Tan Tiong Tick filed a replevin suit against Tan 
Tay Cuan (Civil Case No. 35804, C. F. I., Manila) for the recovery of the scrap 
iron allegedly belonging to Tan Tiong Tick and in the possession of Tan Tay Cuan 
(Exh. D-1). An order of seizure (Exh. D-2) was issued in due eourse and 
defendant Sheriff seized the scrap iron belonging to the herein plaintiff at the 
Madrigal Compound.</p>
<p>"Plaintiff filed a third party claim (Exh. E) but because defendant Tan Tiong 
Tick filed an indemnity bond in favor of the Sheriff (Exh. F), the scrap iron 
seized was not returned to plaintiff.</p>
<p>"In the course of the proceedings in this case, the plaintiff asked for the 
dismissal of the complaint insofar as the defendant Sheriff is concerned. This 
step on the part of the plaintiff automatically dismisses the complaint against 
the bonding company.</p>
<p>"The evidence by the plaintiff shows that the thirty long tons of scrap iron 
belonging to plaintiff was worth P50.00 per ton, after deducting the expenses of 
preparation. The value of the entire scrap iron of plaintiff which was taken by 
defendant Tan Tiong Tick is P1,400.00.</p>
<p>"WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered ordering defendant Tan Tiong Tick to pay 
plaintiff the value of his scrap iron in the sum of P1,400.00, plus compensatory 
damages which the Court fixes in the sum of P2,000.00; attorney's fees in the 
sum of P250.00 and costs.</p>
<p>"SO ORDERED."</p></blockquote>
<p>The Notice of Appeal announces that defendant will raise on appeal the 
following legal questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. Whether the act of the former counsel of the defendant of not pressing 
his request for continuance for the second day set for the hearing of this case 
to enable the herein defendant to testify and abruptly rested the case would 
constitute a confession of judgment and, hence, a valid ground to set aside the 
judgment and to reopen the case since counsel was not specially authorized to 
confess judgment.</p>
<p>"2. Whether the negligence of the former counsel for the herein defendant in 
not informing the defendant that he rested the case and the negligence of the 
defendant in not inquiring from his counsel about the status of the case is an 
excusable negligence and, hence, a valid ground to set aside the 
judgment."</p></blockquote>
<p>The brief of appellant contains but one single assignment of error: The trial 
court erred in denying appellant's petition to set aside judgment and reopen the 
case. This error, in the language of appellant himself, is predicated on the 
following grounds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. That the act of the former counsel of appellant of not pressing his 
request for postponement for the second day set for the hearing of the case to 
enable the appellant to testify and, instead, abruptly rested the case, is in 
effect a confession of judgment and hence a valid ground to set aside the 
judgment and to reopen the case since said counsel was specially authorized to 
confess judgment;</p>
<p>"2. That the negligence of the former counsel for the herein appellant in not 
informing the appellant that he rested1 the case and the negligence of the 
appellant in not inquiring from his counsel about the status of the case is an 
excusable negligence and hence a valid ground to set aside the judgment.</p>
<p>"3. That the appellant has a good defense inasmuch as he has evidence to 
prove that all the scrap iron seized by the Sheriff of Manila in Civil Case No. 
35804 belong to him; and</p>
<p>"4. That Exhibits 'A' and 'B' of the appellee, which formed the basis of his 
alleged ownership of thirty (30) tons of scrap iron, show that the alleged scrap 
iron of the appellee "were to be deposited at Bacood, Sta. Mesa, Manila, and not 
at Cristobal St., Paco, Manila, which is at the opposite bank of the Pasig 
River."</p></blockquote>
<p>The first two grounds relied upon by appellant involve questions of law; the 
last two require review of the evidence presented or offered. The appellant 
having chosen to appeal direct to this Court on the announced purpose of raising 
only legal questions posed by the first two issues, we shall limit this opinion 
and decision accordingly.</p>
<p>The antecedents pertinent to the legal questions raised by appellant are 
briefly these:</p>
<p>After the issues have been joined, the case was set for hearing for February 
3 and 5, 1959, as to defendant Tan Tiong Tick.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> On the first date mentioned plaintiff 
testified in his own behalf and was cross-examined by counsel for defendant. 
Several documents were presented as exhibits of plaintiff. Thereafter, plaintiff 
rested his case. Thereupon, defendant's counsel called on the Deputy Sheriff of 
Manila as his first witness. Two documents (Exhibits 1 and 2) were presented as 
evidence. At this juncture, the following proceeding took place:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Atty. Mapa: At this point I have another witness, the defendant himself, but 
he developed flu, and since this case is set for another day, the day alter 
tomorrow.</p>
<p>"Court: Why did you not bring a medical certificate?</p>
<p>"Atty. Mapa: I came to know of it this morning when I came to fetch him. I 
think it is for the 5th.</p>
<p>"Court: When, they set for two (2) or three (3) days tha purpose is not to 
enable the parties to ask for a postponement of the first two (days).</p>
<p>"Atty. Mapa: I realize fully the correctness, but owing to the fact that when 
I ... I was a little bit late because I came to fetch him he was indisposed. We 
request this Honorable Court, in the interest of justice, his testimony will not 
be very long, some identification only of certain matters.</p>
<p>"Court: Where are those? The plaintiff might be willing to admit the 
genuineness, of those documents, what are those?</p>
<p>"Atty. Mapa: As a matter of fact the testimony of ...</p>
<p>"Court: You said merely identification. Identification of the contract? Are 
you ready to pay fifty pesos (P50.00) to the plaintiff to reimburse him of his 
expenses for having to come again next time?</p>
<p>"Atty. Mapa: We respectfully rest our case by presenting only Exhibit 1 
diagram made by the plaintiff of the stockyard in which the alleged thirty (30) 
tons were deposited and Exhibit 2, which is also marked as Exhibits D-7.</p>
<p>"Court: Exhibit 2 is also admitted. Submitted." (Pages 58-60, t.s.n., 
Mallari.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Subsequently, on April 16, 1959, the court rendered the decision quoted 
earlier.</p>
<p>The first legal question propounded by appellant is: Is the act of the 
appellant's counsel of not pressing his request for postponement for the second 
day set for the hearing of the case to enable the appellant to testify and, 
instead, abruptly rested the case, in effect a confession of judgment and hence 
a valid ground, to set aside the judgment and to reopen the case since counsel 
was not specially authorized to confess judgment?</p>
<p>We do not think so. Appellant's attorney has not withdrawn his client's 
defenses, much less consented to an entry of judgment against his client. On the 
contrary, the records show that he extensively cross-examined the 
plaintiff-appellee and thoroughly scrutinized the documentary evidence for 
appellee, which were adduced and offered in evidence. After appellee had rested 
his case, appellant's counsel presented the Deputy Sheriff of Manila as witness 
for appellant and adduced documentary evidence, which he requested to be marked 
as Exhibits 1 and 2. He then asked for postponement because appellant was not 
present, but the trial court would not consent unless counsel would be willing 
to pay reasonable expenses to appellee for his having to come to trial again if 
postponed. Under the circumstances, counsel, who is not under obligation to pay 
the expenses imposed'Lby the court as a condition for the postponement, could do 
nothing. His resting the case with the evidence already introduced, whatever it 
meant, did not constitute confession of judgment. At most, it might be 
considered as a mistake or lack of foresight or preparation on the part of the 
attorney. But a client is bound by the action of his counsel in the conduct of a 
case and cannot be heard to complain that the result might have been different 
had he proceeded differently. (U.S. <i>vs</i>. Umali, 15 Phil., 33; Vivero 
<i>vs</i>. Santos, et al., 98 Phil., 500; 52 Off. Gaz., 1424) A client is bound 
by the mistake of his lawyer (Montes <i>vs</i>. Court, 48 Phil., 640; Isaac 
<i>vs</i>. Mendoza, 89 Phil., 279). As held in a case, "If such grounds 
(mistakes, lack of preparation, etc.) were to. be admitted as reasons for 
reopening cases, there would never be an end to a suit so long as new counsel 
could be employed who could allege and show that prior counsel had not been 
sufficiently diligent, or experienced, or learned." (De Flores <i>vs</i>. 
Reynolds, Fed. Case No. 3742, 16 Blatch [U. S.] 397, cited in Vivero <i>vs</i>. 
Santos, et al., <i>supra</i>.)</p>
<p>Appellant next inquires: Is the negligence of counsel in not informing 
appellant that he rested the case, and the negligence of appellant in not 
inquiring from his counsel about the status of the case an excusable negligence 
and, hence, a valid ground to set aside the judgment and reopen the case?</p>
<p>Again, we do not think so. Negligence is excusable where it is caused by 
failure to receive notice of the action or the trial, by a genuine and excusable 
mistake or miscalculation, by reliance upon assurances given by those upon whom 
the party had a right to depend, as the adverse party or counsel retained in the 
case, or a competent adviser, that it would not be necessary for him to take an 
active part in the case, or that the suit would not be prosecuted, by relying on 
another person to attend to the case for him, when such other person promised to 
do so, or was chargeable with that duty or by a well-founded belief that the 
case would not be reached for trial as it was in fact reached, or by other 
circumstances not involving fault of the moving party (34 C. J. 303, cited in 1 
(part II) Francisco, Rules of Court in the Philippines, 1957 Ed., pp. 774-775). 
The standard of care required of a defendant is that which an ordinarily prudent 
man bestows upon his important business (Gaylord <i>vs</i>. Berry, 169 N. C. 
733, 86 S. E. 623). None of these mentioned circumstances obtains in the case at 
bar. Here it appears that appellant himself as well as his counsel were duly 
notified, and had full knowledge that the case was to be heard on the date it 
was actually tried. Counsel was, in fact, present thereat and conducted the 
hearing thereof, resting the ease after cross-examining appellee as witness and 
scrutinizing the evidence presented by the latter and, thereafter, presenting 
evidence in support of appellant's defense. Considering that the client is bound 
by his counsel's conduct and handling of his case during the trial, appellant 
cannot now seriously contend that he was not notified that the case was already 
submitted for decision. Neither is appellant's failure to inquire from his 
counsel regarding the status of the ease, an excusable negligence as to justify 
rehearing or retrial. As far as the trial court is concerned, appellant was 
already duly notified, through his counsel, of the entire proceedings in the 
case. If he failed to inquire from his counsel as to said status, appellant 
alone was to blame. As a client he should have been in contact with his counsel 
from time to time, in order that he may be informed of the progress of his case, 
thereby exercising that standard of care "which an ordinarily prudent man 
bestows upon his important business" (Gaylord <i>vs</i>. Berry, 
<i>supra</i>.).</p>
<p>Furthermore, it appears that appellant's petition to set aside the judgment 
and reopen the case, is grounded on his alleged excusable negligence in failing 
to appear and testify during the hearing of the case on February 3, 1959, 
namely, his becoming ill with flu (influenza) on said date. We find, however, 
that appellant failed to accompany said petition with affidavits of merit 
showing the excusable negligence relied upon, and the facts constituting his 
good and substantial cause of action or defense, as expressly required under 
Section 3, Rule 38 of the Rules of Court. We have repeatedly held that such a 
defect is fatal (Abao <i>vs</i>. Virtucio, et al., 109 Phil., 821; Price 
Stabilization Corporation <i>vs</i>. Court of First Instance of Manila, et al., 
97 Phil., 153, which warrants the denial of the relief sought (Abao <i>vs</i>. 
Virtucio, et al., <i>supra</i>, citing Coombs <i>vs</i>. Santos, 24 Phil., 446; 
McGrath <i>vs</i>. Del Rosario, 49 Phil., 330; Villanueva, et al. <i>vs</i>. 
Alcoba, 101 Phil., 277. The reason for the rule is that it is the affidavits of 
merit which serve as jurisdictional basis for a court to entertain a petition 
for relief (Abao <i>vs</i>. Virtucio, et al., <i>supra</i>; Omandam <i>vs</i>. 
Director of Lands, 95 Phil., 450; Off. Gaz., 4840. Stated differently, where a 
petition to set aside a judgment or reopen a case pursuant to Rule 38 of the 
Rules of Court is not accompanied with said affidavits of merit, the court with 
which it is filed is not called upon to entertain the petition. Applied to the 
instant case, appellant's petition to set aside the judgment in question and 
reopen the case acquired no standing in court and, consequently, it was rightly 
denied.</p>
<p>With these conclusions, we find it unnecessary to discuss the other points 
raised by the parties.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order of the trial court dated May 19, 1959 denying 
appellant's petition to set aside the judgment of April 16, 1959 appealed from, 
is hereby affirmed, with costs against the appellant. So 
ordered.</p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., 
Paredes,</em> and <em>Dizon, JJ.,</em> concur. <br><br><br>

carried the dismissal of the complaint as to the bonding company which furnished 
the bond for the Sheriff.</div>
