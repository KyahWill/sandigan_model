Instance of Manila in its Civil Case No. 60607.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The case relates to a dispute over an International Crawler Tractor
Engine and a <span class="SpellE">Bullgrader</span>, covered by a chattel
mortgage executed by the <span class="SpellE">Lasam</span> Farmers' Cooperative
Marketing Association, Inc. in favor of the Agricultural Credit Administration,
but subsequently levied upon on execution by the Ex-<span class="SpellE">Oficio</span>
Provincial en Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> and bought by Martin
Tan Boon <span class="SpellE">Diok</span> in the execution sale thereafter
conducted by the said officer to satisfy a judgment secured by Martin Tan Boon <span class="SpellE">Diok</span> in another case (Civil Case No. 1179-A) against the <span class="SpellE">Lasam</span> Farmers' Cooperative Marketing Association, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law question raised revolves around the
prayer of appellant Martin Tan Boon <span class="SpellE">Diok</span> who wants
that his execution lien be declared superior to the mortgage lien of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Agricultural Credit Administration.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute about the material background facts,
succinctly stated in a portion of the decision appealed from, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The complaint alleges and the evidence shows that in May 1955
the defendant <span class="SpellE">Lasam</span> Farmers' Cooperative Marketing
Association, Inc., hereinafter referred to as the <span class="SpellE">Lasam</span>
<span class="SpellE">Facoma</span>, through its Manager, executed a promissory
note for a facility loan in the amount of P26,877.00 with interest thereon at
the-rate of 8% per annum payable in three equal yearly amortization (Exhibit
A).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To secure the full payment of the
principal and interest of the said facility loan, the <span class="SpellE">Lasam</span>

of the following described properties which defendant <span class="SpellE">Lasam</span>

Tan Boon <span class="SpellE">Diok</span>, one of the defendants in the instant

Engine No. 47267 and the 9 WG-2 <span class="SpellE">Bullgrader</span>, and their
accessories, two of the properties covered by the Chattel Mortgage, Exhibit B, so
that on February 21, 1963, plaintiff through its Officer <span class="SpellE">incharge</span>

Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Aparri</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>,
with an affidavit attached, dated February 21, 1963, informing said Deputy
Provincial Sheriff of plaintiff's prior lien and right to possess said tractor

Provincial Sheriff, <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Oñate</span>,
sold at public auction on March 29, 1963 the said Crawler Tractor and <span class="SpellE">Bullgrader</span> which are covered by the Chattel Mortgage, to
the judgment creditor Martin Tan Boon <span class="SpellE">Diok</span> for the

<p class="BODY">Thus, on April 14, 1965, the Agricultural Credit Administration

<p class="BODY">Martin Tan Boon <span class="SpellE">Diok</span> and the Ex-<span class="SpellE">Oficio</span> Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>
moved for the reconsideration of this decision but their motion was denied by
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> in an order dated October 17, 1966; hence, this
appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Our resolution of June 25, 1969, this Court resolved to
dismiss the said appeal as prayed for by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Agricultural Credit Administration in its motion dated May 28, 1969, on the
ground that appellants failed to serve copies of their brief to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> as required under Section 1 (f) of Rule 50 in
relation to Sections 1 and 2 of Rule 56 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It turned out, however, that before the
issuance of the said resolution dismissing the appeal, appellants personally
served copies of their brief upon <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> on June 3,
1969 and, thereafter, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed with this Court
copies of its own brief - a circumstance relied upon by appellants in their
subsequent motion for reconsideration of the resolution dismissing their appeal
as an implied abandonment or waiver of the -grounds relied upon by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> in its previous motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We opt therefore to set aside the
above-mentioned resolution and, in the interest of justice, reinstate the
appeal and decide the same on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only two errors assigned by appellants do not affect the
whole judgment of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> but only the portions thereof
declaring the Certificate of Sheriff's Sale null and void and the lien of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> mortgage on the tractor and <span class="SpellE">bullgrader</span>
and their accessories superior to that of the levy on execution made on the
same properties by appellant sheriff, which are paragraphs (b), (c) and (d)
only of said judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said two
assignments of error are as follows:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">"1.</span></p>

<blockquote>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN
DECLARING THE CERTIFICATE OF SHERIFF'S SALE (EXHIBIT 'E', AND '3') NULL AND

IN QUESTION IS <st1:city><st1:place>SUPERIOR</st1:place></st1:city> TO THE
EXECUTION LIEN OF DEFENDANT-APPELLANT MARTIN TAN BOON DIOK."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Reading the arguments advanced by both parties in their
respective briefs, <span class="GramE">We</span> can see that the said parties
are not clear as to the issue between them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Apparently, neither was the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The following statement of the issue made by His Honor is accepted by
both parties in their briefs:</p>

<blockquote>"Whose lien is superior - the mortgage lien of the plaintiff
over the properties in question created by virtue of the Chattel Mortgage
Contract, Exhibit 'B', which was duly registered in the Registry of Property x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> or the lien of defendant
Martin Tan Boon <span class="SpellE">Diok</span> which was created by the
execution of the decision of the Court of First Instance dated February 19,
1962 rendered by said court in its case No. 1179-A x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" (quoted from the
lower court's decision, page 30 Record on Appeal)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">To be accurate, however, the issue thus
stated need not be resolved here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do
not understand appellants to be denying the priority of the lien of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> mortgage over that of the levy on execution
invoked by appellants.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
As <span class="GramE">We</span> see it, the pretense of appellants is that this
action of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> founded on such priority has
either prescribed already or that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is guilty
of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> in prosecuting the same, hence, the
complaint herein should have been dismissed in so far as the enforcement of the
lien of said mortgage is concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the matter of prescription, the pose of appellant is that the
failure of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to file the present action
within the one hundred twenty (120) days from the filing of the bond referred
to in Section 15 of Rule 39 (1940 Rules, since this case was submitted under
the same) caused his action to prescribe.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said section reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 15.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Proceedings where property
claimed by third person.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- If
property levied on be claimed by any other person than the defendant or his
agent, and such person make an affidavit of his title thereto or right to the
possession thereof, stating the grounds of such right or title, and serve the
same upon the officer making the levy, and a copy thereof upon the judgment
creditor, the officer shall not be bound to keep the property, unless such
judgment creditor or his agent, on demand, indemnify the officer against such
claim by a bond in a sum not greater than the value of the property levied on,
and, in case of disagreement as to such value, the same shall be determined by
the court issuing the writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The officer is not liable for damages, for the taking or keeping of such
property, to any such third person unless such claim is made and unless the
action for damages be brought within one hundred twenty days from the date of
the filing of the bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But nothing
herein contained shall prevent such third person from vindicating his claim to
the property by any proper action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When,
however, the plaintiff, or the person in whose favor the writ of execution
runs, is the Commonwealth of the Philippines, or any officer duly representing
it, the filing of such bond shall not be required, and in case the sheriff or
attaching officer is sued for damages as a result of the attachment, he shall
be represented by the Solicitor-General and if held liable <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
the actual damages adjudged by the court shall be paid by the Insular Treasurer
out of such funds as may be appropriated for the purpose."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is explicit in this provision that the action that must be
filed within said period of one hundred twenty days is that against the sheriff
for damages on the bond of the judgment creditor and not an action for recovery
of the property or the enforcement of a superior lien thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, this question raised by appellants is
not new.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <st1:city><st1:place>Anderson</st1:place></st1:city>
vs. The Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, et al., 40 O.
G., 5th Supplement, 73, it was held:</p>

<blockquote>"The next question is one of law - whether <st1:city><st1:place>Anderson</st1:place></st1:city>'s
action to recover these properties has prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that it has, relying
upon Section 451 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as amended by Act No. 4108,
which says, 'No claim to property levied on by the sheriff shall be valid
against the latter, or shall be received or be notice of any rights against
him, unless a claim has been made to said property by a third party as provided
in this section and said claim has been enforced by the proper action within
one hundred and twenty days after the sale.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The present action was brought more than one hundred twenty
days from the date of the sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
the foregoing limitation refers solely to the sheriff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As against the judgment creditor or the
purchaser the general law on prescription governs. This is not only manifest
from the terms of the above-quoted provision, but so it is from the following
clause:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Nothing contained in this
section shall prevent the owner of the property levied on from vindicating his
claim thereto by any proper action within the period established by the laws
governing prescription.'"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, <span class="GramE">We</span> hold that the action of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> has not prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> brought
this action as one for the recovery of movables.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, its period of prescription would be
eight years (Art.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">1140,
C.C.)</span> Even on the assumption that this action is really one for the
foreclosure of a chattel mortgage, still the prescriptive period would be five
years (Art. 1149, C.C.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The present
action was filed<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
less than two years and two months from the filing of the bond of appellant
Martin Tan Boon <span class="SpellE">Diok</span> with appellant sheriff on <st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1963</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants present alternatively the contention that the failure
of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to file an action on the sheriff's
bond within the period already discussed bars any action to recover the
property sold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the
theory of appellants is that the action reserved in the last sentence of the
above-quoted Section 15 of Rule 39 to the effect that "nothing herein
contained shall present such third person from vindicating his claim to the
property by any proper action" does not apply when a third-party claim has
been filed, since the provision requiring the filing of an action to be filed
within one hundred twenty days after the filing of the bond is the only action,
so appellants claim, that may accordingly be filed whenever a third-party claim
has been filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To start with, again,
appellants overlook the fact that the action referred to in the provision is an
action against the sheriff only for damages on the bond and not the action for
the recovery of the property or the enforcement of any lien thereon in which
the purchaser is the principal defendant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, it cannot be true that the action on the sheriff's bond
and the action for the vindication of any claim of third-party claimant in the
property sold are mutually exclusive.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They are founded on different causes of action which are not
inconsistent with each other.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Incidentally, <span class="GramE">We</span> note that this alternative
issue now raised by appellants was not alleged as an affirmative defense in the
answer in the court below, albeit His Honor did casually make reference to it
towards the end of his decision by saying, in effect, that it is also its view
that such theory of appellants is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even then the same point has not been specifically assigned as error in
appellants' brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances,
this argument of appellants could have been totally ignored by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of appellants regarding alleged <span class="SpellE">laches</span> deserves less favorable consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants claim that the fact that they had
"no notice" or that they "lacked knowledge" "that
complainant (<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>) would assert the right on
which (<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>) bases (its) suit" together with
the fact that appellant Martin Tan Boon <span class="SpellE">Diok</span>
"had no knowledge that plaintiff would file the present case after the
lapse of more than two years from the date of the execution sale" make <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> guilty of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> has
absolutely no merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the right of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to bring the present action is based on provisions
of law already interpreted and construed previously by this Court, appellants'
posture only betrays that this appeal is, at best, half-hearted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The loose <span class="GramE">presentation of
obviously untenable arguments in appellants' brief notably convey</span> such
impression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This kind of appeal must be
discouraged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the trial
court erroneously declared the sheriff's sale in question null and void instead
of merely making it subject to the mortgage rights of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
does not alter this view of the Court as to the <span class="SpellE">untenability</span>
of this appeal because, from all that appears in the record the foreclosure by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> of his mortgage in question would, in effect,
leave nothing of the tractor and bull-grader and their accessories, so as to
make any subsequent execution sale thereof of any significance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, at its base, the position taken
by appellant Martin Tan Boon <span class="SpellE">Diok</span> from the inception
of this case in the trial court was legally <span class="SpellE">insustainable</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the foregoing premises judgment is hereby rendered modifying
Paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of the decision of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> in
the sense that instead of declaring the execution sale in question null and
void, the same is made subject to the mortgage rights of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Agricultural Credit Administration; in all other re­spects, the said judgment
is affirmed, with <u>double</u> costs against appellant Martin Tan Boon <span class="SpellE">Diok</span> in this instance, this appeal being dilatory.</p>

At any rate, if such were the real issue here, the same would have to be
resolved in favor of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can be no doubt that the lien of the
duly recorded chattel mortgage in favor of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
is superior to that of the levy on execution in favor of appellant Martin Tan
Boon <span class="SpellE">Diok</span> or, to put it the other way, the sale on
execution made pursuant to said levy must be, as it is by law, subject to the
lien of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> mortgage, for the simple reason
that <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> mortgage was registered and was already
existing at the time the levy on execution was made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sections 22 to 24 of Rule 39 of the Rules of
Court of 1940 provided very plainly, as Sections 25 to 27 of Rule 39, also, of
the current Rules do likewise provide, that all sales on execution of any kind
of property of the judgment debtor convey to the purchaser nothing more than
the rights of the judgment debtor over said property "on the day that the
execution or attachment (preliminary) was levied." To be clearer, said
sections provide textually thus in both the old and the revised Rules of Court:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 27pt;"><span class="GramE">SEC. 22.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Conveyance to purchaser of
personal property capable of manual delivery.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- When the purchaser of any personal
property, capable of manual delivery, pays the purchase money, the officer
making the sale must deliver to the purchaser the property, and, if desired,
execute and deliver to him a certificate of sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such sale conveys to the purchaser all the
right which the debtor had in such property on the day the execution or
attachment was levied.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 27pt;"><span class="GramE">SEC. 23.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Conveyance to purchaser of
personal property not capable of manual delivery.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- When the purchaser of any personal
property, not capable of manual delivery, pays the purchase money, the officer
making the sale must execute and deliver to the purchase a certificate of
sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such certificate conveys to the
purchaser all the right which the debtor had in such property on the day that
the execution or attachment was levied.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 27pt;"><span class="GramE">SEC. 24.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Effect of sale of real
property.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Certificate
thereof given to purchaser and filed with registrar.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Upon a sale of real property, the purchaser
shall be substituted to and acquire all the right, title, interest, and claim
of the judgment debtor thereto, subject to the right of redemption as
hereinafter provided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The officer must
give to the purchaser a certificate of sale containing:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.25in;">(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A particular description of the real property
sold;</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.25in;">(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The price paid for each distinct lot or
parcel;</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.25in;">(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The whole price by him paid;</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.25in;">(d)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The date when the right of redemption expires.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 27pt;">A duplicate of such certificate
must be filed by the officer in the office of the registrar of deeds of the
province.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 9pt; text-indent: 0in;">It is elementary
that a purchaser at the sheriff's sale acquires no better title or greater
right than the judgment debtor had in the property concerned (Villegas <i>vs</i>.
Tan, 57 Phil. 656, 666).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words,
the purchaser acquires only such right or interest as the judgment debtor had
on the property at the time of the sale (Cruz <i>vs</i>. Sandoval, 69 Phil.
736; <span class="SpellE">Barrido</span> <i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Barreto</span>,
72 Phil. 187), so it follows that if at that time the judgment debtor had no
more right to or interest in the property because he had already sold it to
another, then the purchaser acquires nothing (<span class="SpellE">Potenciano</span>
<i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Dineros</span>, 97 Phil. 196; See <span class="SpellE">Feria</span>, Civil Procedure, Annotated, 1967 ed., p. 761).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any doubt on the matter has been clarified in
the 1964 Rules, as Section 16, a new provision of Rule 39 now provides:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.5in; text-indent: 27pt;"><span class="GramE">SEC.
16.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Effect of
levy on execution as to third persons.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- The levy on execution shall create a lien in favor of the judgment
creditor over the right, title and interest of the judgment debtor in such
property at the time of the levy, subject to liens or <span class="SpellE">incumbrances</span>
then existing.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 9pt; text-indent: 0in;">Of course, there
is nothing here that declares null and void the sheriff's sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that is held is that the sale is subject
to the right of the superior lien holder.</p>
