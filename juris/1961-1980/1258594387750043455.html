<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appeal taken by the Republic of 
the Philippines from the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> (Civil Case No. 0-8) admitting <span class="SpellE">Tse</span> <span class="SpellE">Viw</span> alias <span class="SpellE">Tse</span> <span class="SpellE">Vew</span>, alias Pablo <span class="SpellE">Sia</span>, to Philippine citizenship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On January 14, 1960, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed a petition for naturalization alleging that 
he was born a citizen of Nationalist China on August 20, 1927 in Canton, China; 
that he arrived in the Philippines from <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> on 
July 10, 1938 on board the vessel S.S. TJISAROCA; that he had resided in the 
Philippines continuously ever since and for more than one year immediately 
preceding the filing of the petition in the City of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>; that he was an 
employee of Walter Johnson &amp; Co., an establishment in <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City, receiving a monthly salary of P250.00; that he 
was married to <span class="SpellE">Lucita</span> Villas, a Filipino citizen; and, 
finally, that he possessed all the necessary qualifications required to become a 
Filipino citizen and none of the disqualifications. Attached to the petition 
were the affidavits of character witnesses, Rafael Mejia and <span class="SpellE">Valeriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Daffon</span>, both residents 
of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City, wherein they alleged that they 
personally knew <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> for more than ten years prior 
to the filing of the petition; that the latter had been continuously residing in 
the Philippines during said period of time, and that, in their opinion, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had all the qualifications necessary to become a 
Filipino citizen and none of the disqualifications.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After proper publication and 
hearing, the court, on </span><st1:date month="2" day="15" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 15, 
1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
rendered the appealed judgment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner claims that for a good 
number of years he has been employed as bookkeeper by Walter Johnson and Co., at 
a monthly salary of P250.00, with free board and lodging. He has not shown 
affirmatively, however, that he has filed any income tax return for any 
particular year, as required by law. True, he presented Exhibit P, a certificate 
issued by <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Serafin</span>, 
Assistant Provincial Revenue Officer stationed at <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> City, to the effect that petitioner "has no 
outstanding tax obligation accruing to the Philippine government" as of October 
18, 1960, but this is not <span class="GramE">equivalent</span> to producing 
proof, for the purpose of this case, that petitioner had filed the income tax 
returns required by law. As has been held repeatedly heretofore, it is incumbent 
upon an alien applying for citizenship to prove affirmatively that during the 
period of his stay in this country he has complied with the 
law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Coming now to the character 
witnesses, <span class="GramE">We</span> find that their testimony is too general 
and unconvincing. It must be remembered that vouching witnesses stand as 
insurers of petitioner's conduct and character. For this reason they are 
expected to testify on specific facts and events justifying the inference that 
petitioner - as personally known to them - possesses all the qualifications and 
none of the disqualifications provided by law for purposes of naturalization. In 
this case it does not appear sufficiently that the nature of the association of 
the vouching witnesses with the petitioner is such as would have enabled them to 
acquire definite knowledge about his qualifications and/or disqualifications. 
Neither were they able to cite specific facts and events regarding petitioner's 
conduct and character.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Lastly, while the record 
discloses that Pablo <span class="SpellE">Sia</span> is the name given to 
petitioner upon being baptized in a catholic church and gave it in his 
application as one of his aliases, there is nothing in the record showing that 
he had been judicially authorized to use such name as an 
alias.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE,</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> the decision appealed from is 
hereby reversed, with the result that petitioner's application for citizenship 
is hereby dismissed, with costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
