of the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission in RO4-WCC Case No.
162523 which reversed the award of P6,000.00 made by the Acting Referee <span class="SpellE">Vivencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Escarcha</span> of Regional
Office No. 4 in favor of the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in October, 1966, petitioner was employed as a carpenter
by the private respondent Atlantic Gulf &amp; Pacific Co. of Manila, Inc.
(hereinafter referred to as respondent Company) with a salary of P8.00 a day
for six to seven days a week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In June
1968, petitioner was <span class="SpellE">was</span> found by respondent
Company's physician, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Bataclan</span>, to be suffering
from pulmonary tuberculosis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
subsequently diagnosed by his attending physician, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span>
Jorge, to be sick of pulmonary tuberculosis, moderately advanced, active with
cavity, <span class="SpellE">bronchiectasis</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
His employment with the respondent Company was terminated on <st1:date year="1968" day="6" month="6">June 6, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since that time, he has been out of work due
to his ailment.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1975</st1:date>,
he filed his claim for compensation together with the Physician's Report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said claim was granted by the Acting Labor
Referee, <span class="SpellE">Vivencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Escarcha</span>,
in a decision rendered on <st1:date year="1975" day="29" month="10">October 29,
 1975</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which
reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered
ordering the respondent Atlantic Gulf &amp; Pacific Co. of Manila, Inc., to
pay, thru this Office in lump sum:</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The Claimant the disability compensation in the
maximum sum of SIX THOUSAND PESOS (P6,000.00); and</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->To pay this Office the fee of SIXTY-ONE PESOS
(P61.00) pursuant to Section 55 of the Act, as amended."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On October 28, 1975, the respondent Commission acting on the
motion for reconsideration filed by the respondent Company, reversed the
decision of the Acting Labor Referee and dismissed the case for lack of merit
on the ground that the Physician's Report is not corroborated by laboratory
findings or chest x-ray conducted on the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition for review grounded on the sole issue as to
whether or not a Physician's Report is sufficient to support claim under Act
3428 as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">We reverse the decision of the respondent Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Physician's Report<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
does not require that an x-ray examination or laboratory findings be attached
thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Their absence in </span>the Physician's Report will not invalidate the
diagnosis appearing therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
from the attending Physician's Report, it can be logically inferred that a
previous x-ray examination was made otherwise the physician could not have
arrived at his diagnosis of the petitioner's illness,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>as in the case at bar wherein the
following appears in the Physician's Report:</p>

<blockquote>"Diagnosis: PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS, MODERATELY ADVANCED,
ACTIVE</blockquote>

<blockquote>Prognosis: GUARDED WITH CAVITY, BRONCHIECTASIS"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">With the findings that the illness of
petitioner is moderately advanced and active which could easily be determined
by means of physical examination, x-ray <span style="">or
</span>laboratory findings is not indispensable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the records show that the
respondent Company's physician, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Bataclan</span>, was the
first one who found the petitioner to be suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis,
which finding was the immediate cause of the termination of his services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Company is therefore <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from denying the said illness suffered by the
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, since
the petitioner has complied with the requirements under Section 23 of the
Workmen's Compensation Act<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
We find no reason to deny him the benefits provided for by the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the total disability of the petitioner resulting
from his illness has been duly established, he is therefore, entitled to compensation
under Sections 2 and 14 of the Workmen's Compensation Act.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">IN VIEW OF THE
FOREGOING</span></b><span style="">, the judgment of
the respondent Commission is hereby reversed and set aside and the decision of
the Acting Referee of Regional Office No. 4, revived and reinstated with the
further modification that respondent Company should also pay petitioner medical
and hospital expenses duly receipted for until full recovery and to his lawyer
the amount of P600.00 as attorney's fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

any reasonable time and under any reasonable conditions during his total disability
and period of rehabilitation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case an
injured or sick employee refuses to submit to, or does in any manner obstruct

SEC. 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="">Grounds for compensation</span></u><span style="">. - </span>When an employee suffers personal injury from any accident
arising out of and in the course of his employment, or contracts tuberculosis
or other illness directly caused by such employment, or either aggravated by or
the result of the nature of such employment, his employer shall pay
compensation in the sums and to the person hereinafter specified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right to compensation as provided in this

less than fourteen pesos per week, except in the case provided for in the next
following paragraph.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No compensation

weekly payments shall in no case continue after the disability has ceased, nor
shall the aggregate sum paid as compensation exceed in any case six thousand

case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the event that the total
disability begins after a period of partial disability, the amount of
compensation due for the latter and for any other disability shall not exceed
the maximum amount of six thousand pesos.</p>
