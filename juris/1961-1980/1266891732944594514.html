<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is an action to recover the 
possession of a house. It was filed following our decision in <span class="SpellE">Palileo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span>, 97 Phil., 919; 
51 Off. <span class="SpellE">Gaz</span>., 6181, in which <span class="GramE">We</span> ruled that the house in question had not been sold but had 
merely been given as security for a debt the <span class="SpellE">pacto</span> de 
retro sale between the parties being in reality a loan with an equitable 
mortgage. In a sense, therefore, this case is a sequel to <span class="SpellE">Palileo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span>. The parties are 
here this time to litigate on the issue of possession and its 
effects.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The house in this case, a 
two-story building, was formerly owned by <span class="SpellE">Felicisima</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Barza</span>. It is located at 25 (formerly 6) <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span> Street, <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City, on a 
lot belonging to the <span class="SpellE">Hospicio</span> de San Juan de <span class="SpellE">Dios</span>. On October 4, 1950, this house and the leasehold right 
to the lot were bought by respondent Cherie <span class="SpellE">Palileo</span> 
who paid part of the purchase price and mortgaged the house to secure the 
payment of the balance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It appears that respondent <span class="SpellE">Palileo</span> defaulted in her obligation, because of which the 
mortgage was foreclosed and the house was advertised for sale. Fortunately for 
her, however, respondent <span class="SpellE">Palileo</span> was able to raise 
money on December 18, 1951 before the house could be sold at public auction. On 
this date, respondent <span class="SpellE">Palileo</span> received from petitioner 
Beatriz <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span> de <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> the 
sum of P12<span class="GramE">,000</span> in consideration of which she signed a 
document entitled "Conditional Sale of Residential Building," purporting to 
convey to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span> de <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> the, house in question. Under this document, the right 
to repurchase the house within one year was reserved to respondent <span class="SpellE">Palileo</span> the same day, the parties entered into an agreement 
by respondent <span class="SpellE">Palileo</span> remained in possession of the 
house as tenant, paying petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span> de <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> a monthly rental of P250.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span> de <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> subsequently insured 
the house against fire with the Associated Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc. On 
</span><st1:date month="10" day="25" year="1952"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 25, 
1952</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
fire broke out in the house and partly destroyed the same. For the loss, 
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span> de <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> was 
paid P13<span class="GramE">,107</span> by the insurance 
company.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">At the instance of his sister, 
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span> de <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>, 
the other petitioner <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span> entered the premises and began the repair of the 
house. <span class="GramE">Soon after an action was filed by respondent <span class="SpellE">Palileo</span> against <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span> de <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> for the reformation of the deed of <span class="SpellE">pacto</span> de retro sale into a loan with an equitable 
mortgage.</span> This case was filed in. the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> on December 4, 1952. One week after (December 11), 
respondent <span class="SpellE">Palileo</span> filed another action in the 
Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City, this time seeking the 
<span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span> who, it was alleged, had entered and occupied the 
house without the knowledge and consent of respondent <span class="SpellE">Palileo</span>. Just the same, however, repair work went on and 
although at times interrupted it was finally completed in 1953 at a cost of 
P12<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Meanwhile the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit was dismissed by the Municipal Court. 
Respondent <span class="SpellE">Palileo</span> appealed to the Court of First 
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, but the case was again dismissed, 
this time for failure of respondent <span class="SpellE">Palileo</span> to 
prosecute. The dismissal of the case was subsequently made "without 
Prejudice."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the other case, respondent 
<span class="SpellE">Palileo</span> was successful. Both the lower court and this 
Court declared the transaction of the parties to be a loan with an equitable 
mortgage and not a conditional sale. It was found that the amount of P12<span class="GramE">,000</span>, which purported to be the price, was in fact a loan; 
that the amount of P250 paid every month as rent w in reality interest; and that 
the house allegedly sold was intended to be a security for the loan. 
Accordingly, this Court directed petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span> de 
<span class="SpellE">Rama</span> to return to respondent <span class="SpellE">Palileo</span> the sum of P810 which she had collected as interest 
in excess of that allowed by law. This Court likewise ruled that petitioner 
<span class="SpellE">Cosio</span> de <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> could keep the 
proceeds of the fire insurance but that her claim against respondent <span class="SpellE">Palileo</span> under the loan was to be deemed assigned to the 
insurance company.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As earlier stated, this suit was 
instituted to recover the possession of the house as a consequence of our 
decision that it had not really been sold but had merely been given as security 
for a loan. It was originally brought against petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span> who asked that the action be dismissed on the ground 
that it was barred by the judgment of the Municipal Court which dismissed the 
<span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case against him. The court denied the 
motion to dismiss. And so petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span> filed his 
answer. He was later joined by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span> de 
<span class="SpellE">Rama</span> who was allowed to intervene in the 
action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Thereafter the lower court 
rendered judgment finding petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span> de <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> to be a possessor in good faith with a right to retain 
possession until reimbursed for her expenses in repairing the house. The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of its decision 
reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In view of the foregoing, the 
Court hereby renders judgment declaring plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Palileo</span> as the lawful owner of the house No. 25 <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span> Street, <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City and 
entitled to the possession thereof" upon her paying to <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> defendant Beatriz <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span> 
de <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> the sum of TWELVE THOUSAND (P12.000.00) PESOS 
with interest at the legal rate from December 22, 1946 which is the date of the 
filing of <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>-defendant's counterclaim until 
paid. There's no judgment for costs."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Not satisfied, respondent <span class="SpellE">Palileo</span> appealed to the Com of Appeals and succeeded in 
having the lower court's decision modified. The appellate court ruled 
that—<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"<span class="GramE">by</span> 
virtue of the <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span><u> de retro</u> sale <span class="SpellE">intervenor-appellee</span> (Beatriz , <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span> de <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>) became the 
temporary owner of the house as such she was entitled to the possession thereof 
from the date of such conditional sale although appellant (Cherie <span class="SpellE">Palileo</span>) was its actual occupant as <span class="SpellE">intervenor-appellee's</span> tenant. * * * However, when appellant 
instituted the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> ease against <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> (<span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span>) and <span class="SpellE">intervenor-appellee</span> 
(<span class="SpellE">Cosio</span> do <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>) as early as 
December 1952, when the latter had just started to reconstruct the house, and 
she likewise commenced the action against <span class="SpellE">intervenor-appellee</span> in the same month of December, 1952, to 
have the deed of <span class="SpellE">pacto</span> de retro sale declared as one 
of loan with equitable mortgage, said <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> and 
<span class="SpellE">intervenor-apnellee's</span> title to the house suffered from 
a flaw. From that time both <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> and <span class="SpellE">intervenor-appellee</span> ceased to be considered possessors in 
good faith. <span class="GramE">(Art. 528, new Civil Code; <span class="SpellE">Tacas</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Tobon</span>, 53 Phil. 356; 
Lopez.</span> <span class="GramE">Inc. vs. Phil. Eastern Trading Co., Inc., 52 
Off.</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Gaz</span></span><span class="GramE">. 1452).</span> And if they chose to continue reconstructing the 
house even after they were apprised of a flaw on their title they did so as 
builders in bad faith."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Accordingly, it rendered judgment 
as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Wherefore, with the modification 
that appellant (Cherie <span class="SpellE">Palileo</span> is hereby declared the

thereof, without reimbursing <span class="SpellE">intervenor-appellee</span>

sum of P12,000 allegedly spent for the reconstruction of the same, and <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> (<span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span>) and <span class="SpellE">intervenor-appellee</span>

monthly rental of P300 during the time they actually occupied the house just 
mentioned as possessors in bad faith, the decision appealed from is hereby 
affirmed in all other respects. <span class="GramE">Without any pronouncement as 
to costs."</span><o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioners <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span> de <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> have appealed to Court by certiorari, citing Article 
526 of the Civil Code which states as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">“He is deemed a possessor in good 
faith who is not aware that there exists in his title or mode of acquisition any 
flaw which invalidates it,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">“He is deemed a possessor in bad 
faith <span class="GramE">who</span> possesses in any case contrary to the 
foregoing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Mistake upon a doubtful or 
difficult question of law may be the basis of good faith.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">They contend that they were not 
only possessors in good faith from the beginning but that they continue to be 
such even after this Court's declaration that their transaction was a loan with 
a mortgage and not a sale with a right of repurchase, because, as a matter of 
fact, this Court did not invalidate, but merely reformed, the supposed deed of 
sale. Petitioners likewise aver that neither can the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit be considered to be notice of any defect or 
flaw in their mode of acquisition because that case was after all 
dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We believe that both the 
petitioners and the Court of Appeals are in error in saying that the former had 
a right to the possession of the house under the deed of <span class="SpellE">pacto</span> de retro sale. Petitioners did not have such a right 
at any time and they knew this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In reforming instruments, courts 
do not make another contract for the parties (See Civil Code arts. 1359-1369 and 
the Report of the Code Commission 56). They merely inquire into the intention of 
the parties and, having found it, reform the written instrument (not the 
contract) in order that it may express the real intention of the parties (See 
<u>Id</u>., arts. 1365 and 1602). This is what was done in the earlier case 
between the parties. In holding that the document entitled "Conditional Sale of 
Residential Building" was in fact a mortgage, this Court said: "This document 
did not express the true intention of the parties which was merely to place said 
property (the house) as security for the payment of the loan." (<span class="SpellE">Palileo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span> 97 Phil., 919; 
51 <span class="GramE">Off</span>. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Gaz</span></span><span class="GramE">. 6181 at 
6184).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">If that was the intention of the 
parties (to conform to which their written instrument was reformed) then 
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span> de <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> 
knew from the beginning that was a mere mortgagee. For the same reason, she 
could not have been mistaken as to the true nature of their agreement. Hence, in 
bidding her brother, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span> enter the 
premises and make repairs and in later occupying the house herself, petitioner 
<span class="SpellE">Cosio</span> de <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> with this 
knowledge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As possessors in bad faith, 
petitioners are jointly liable for the payment of rental, the reasonable value 
of was found by the appellate court is P300 a month. (Art. <span class="GramE">549. See <span class="SpellE">Lerma</span> vs. de la Cruz, 7 Phil. 
581).</span> This finding is supported by the evidence and we find no reason to 
disturb it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">But even as we hold petitioner 
<span class="SpellE">Cosio</span> de <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> to be a 
possessor in bad faith we nevertheless believe that she is entitled to be 
reimbursed for her expenses in restoring the house to its original condition 
after it had been partly damaged by fire, because such expenses are necessary 
(Angeles vs. <span class="SpellE">Lozada</span>, 54 Phil. 184) and, under Article 
546, are to be refunded even to possessors in bad faith. As already stated, 
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span> de <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> 
spent P12<span class="GramE">,000</span> for the repair 
work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The error of the appellate court 
lies in its failure to appreciate the distinction that while petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span> de <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> is a possessor in 
bad faith, she is not a builder |n bad faith. Thus in describing petitioners as 
"builders in bad faith" and, consequently, in holding that they have no right to 
be reimbursed, the court obviously applied Article 449 which states that "he who 
builds, plants or sows in bad faith on the land of another loses what is built, 
planted or sown <u>without right to indemnity</u>." But article 449 is a rule of 
accession and we are not here concerned with accession. There is here no reason 
for the application of the principle <span class="SpellE"><u>accesio</u></span><u> 
<span class="SpellE">cedit</span> <span class="SpellE">principali</span></u>, such 
as is contemplated in cases of <u>accession continua</u> of which article 449 is 
a rule. For what petitioners did in this case was not to build a new house on 
the land of another. Rather, what they did was merely to make repairs on a house 
that had been partly destroyed by fire and we are asked whether they have a 
right to be refunded for what they spent in repairs. The land on which the house 
is built is not even owned by respondent <span class="SpellE">Palileo</span>, that 
land being the property of the <span class="SpellE">Hospicio</span> de San Juan de 
<span class="SpellE">Dios</span>. This case comes under article 546 which, as we 
have already indicated, provides for the refund of necessary expenses “to every 
possessor.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">And now we come to the last point 
in petitioners' assignment of errors. It is contended that the present action is 
barred by the judgment of the Municipal Court which dismissed the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case filed by respondent <span class="SpellE">Palileo</span> against petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span>. 
It is said that although that judgment was vacated when it was appealed to the 
Court of First Instance, the subsequent dismissal of the case was equivalent to 
the withdrawal of the appeal and therefore to a revival of the judgment of the 
Municipal Court. That judgment, to repeat, dismissed the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case against petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We note that this point, though 
raised in the Court of First Instance, was not properly assigned as error in the 
Court of Appeals. It was there taken up only in the "preliminary remarks" in the 
brief. Although petitioners were <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in the 
Court of Appeals, they should have assigned this alleged error if only to 
maintain the decision of the lower court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Apart from this consideration, we 
believe that this action is not barred by the prior judgment in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case. The pertinent provisions of the Rules of 
Court state:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Effect of 
appeals.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> A 
perfected appeal shall operate to vacate the judgment of the justice of the 
peace or the municipal court and the action when duly docketed in the Court of 
First Instance, shall stand for trial de novo upon its merits in accordance with 
the regular procedure in that court, as though the same had never been tried 
before and had been originally there commenced. <span class="GramE">the</span> 
appeal is withdrawn, or dismissed for failure to prosecute, the judgment shall 
be deemed revived and shall forthwith remanded to the justice of the peace or 
municipal court for executive." <span class="GramE">(Rule 40, sec. 9, Rules of 
Court.)</span><o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The following comment answers 
squarely petitioners’ arguments:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The case shall stand in the 
Court of First Instance as though the same 'had been originally there 
commenced.' Thus, if action is filed in an inferior court, and the plaintiff 
fails to appear and the case is dismissed, may the plaintiff file another 
complaint for the same cause? The Supreme Court hold that, since the appeal had 
the effect of vacating the judgment of the inferior court and, therefore, the 
case, when dismissed, wan in the Court of First Instance as if the same 'had 
been originally there commenced’ and since dismissals on the ground 
aforementioned, of cases coming within the original jurisdiction of the Court of 
First Instance, are without prejudice, the conclusion is that the plaintiff may 
file a new complaint for the same cause. (Marco <i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Hashim</span>, 40 Phil. 592) This ruling however, is affected to a 
certain extent by Rule 17, section 3, which provides that the dismissal of a 
case on the ground of plaintiff's failure to appear at the trial, is a final 
adjudication upon the merits, unless the court otherwise provides." <span class="GramE">(2 Moran, Comments' on the Rules of Court, 344-345 
1963).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Here the dismissal of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case for failure of respondent <span class="SpellE">Palileo</span> to prosecute was expressly made to be <u>without

another action like the present.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
