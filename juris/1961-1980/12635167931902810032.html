<p class="BODY">We turn to the factual milieu.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 7, 1961 <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span> filed a
petition with the Court of Agrarian Relations (Second Regional District, <span class="SpellE">sala</span> II, <span class="SpellE">Guimba</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>), praying, <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that (1) an interlocutory order be
issued to restrain <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> and Jose <span class="SpellE">Niegos</span> (the respondents below) from ejecting him from his
landholding pending resolution <span style="">of his
petition; and (2) after due trial, he be maintained as the law­ful tenant in
the disputed landholding.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span> alleged that he is a leasehold
tenant of <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> cultivating a <span class="SpellE">farmholding</span>
situated in the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Talugtug</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, of an area of four
(4) hectares devoted to rice culture, and that he has worked said land "as
a tenant for the last seven years;" that on March 2, 1961 he received a
letter from <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> and <span style="">his wife </span>advising him that the aforesaid landholding will be
given to another tenant, on the pretext that he (<span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span>)
"is con­tracting to be a tenant of another in said landholding;" that
forthwith, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> placed a new tenant, Jose <span class="SpellE">Niegos</span>, in the disputed land; that subsequently, <span class="SpellE">Niegos</span> repeatedly forbade him from working on said <span class="SpellE">riceland</span>; that in order to avoid trouble, he refrained from
forcibly entering the landholding, but with the advent of the planting season,
it became imperative that the agrarian court or­der his reinstatement and
restrain <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> and <span class="SpellE">Niegos</span>
from com­mitting further acts of dispossession.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his answer with counterclaim dated June 19, 1961, <span class="SpellE">Teo­doro</span> categorically denied that <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span>
was his tenant, claiming that "ever since he became the owner of around 39
hectares of <span class="SpellE">riceland</span> in <span class="SpellE">Kalisitan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Talugtug</span>, N. <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, he had
always leased all of it under civil lease and he had never given any portion of
it under tenancy." He further alleged that after the expiration of his
lease contract with <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span> in January, 1961, his
wife twice notified <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span> to renew his contract
for the then incoming agricultural year 1961-62, but the latter "verbally
told Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Teo­doro</span> that he was no longer interested
to work on the land and he was giving it up as he had left the place
already." <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> also claims that it was only
after <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span> had abandoned the farm­land that he
decided to lease it to <span class="SpellE">Niegos</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On his part, <span class="SpellE">Niegos</span> seasonably
answered, disclaiming any knowledge that <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span> is
the tenant of <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>, and averring that he
"entered the landholding in good faith clothed with the pro­per authority
from the other respondent (<span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>) and with the
consent and <span class="SpellE">confirmity</span> of the petitioner (<span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span>) who allowed him to work on the same;" and
that <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span> "has no more inte­rests in the
cultivation of the landholding as could be gleaned from his actuations, like
the failure to clean the land during the months of March and April, and his
failure to prepare his seedbed in the month of May which is the period for
broadcasting seedling in the community."</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 6, 1962, when the hearing of the present con­troversy
was nearing completion in the respondent agrarian court but before the case was
submitted for decision, <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span> filed a
"supplemental petition," claiming damages as a result of his dis­possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said petition was given due course by the
court com­missioner and the requisite hearing was set for March 9, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Both <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> and <span class="SpellE">Niegos</span> interposed
their respective answers, identically asserting that the same was filed out of
time and that the failure of <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span> to claim
earlier his alleged damages amounted to a fatal neglect which could no longer
be cured at that very late stage of the proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, hearing on the said petition was
held at which it was disclosed that as "a result of his (<span class="SpellE">Macaraeg's</span>) <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>, he became
destitute" since he had "income except from those derived from
transplanting and reap­ing wherein he earned the amount of P30.00." It was
further proved that "for the agricultural year 1961-62, Jose <span class="SpellE">Niegos</span> realized a gross harvest of 110 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span>
out of which he paid his rental to Fidel <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> in
the amount of 42 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span> and 23 kilos."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1962" day="7" month="9"><span style="">September

portion:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW <span style="">OF </span>ALL

and Jose <span class="SpellE">Niegos</span> in the tenor and disposition <span class="SpellE">hereinbelow</span> provided, to wit:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jose <span class="SpellE">Niegos</span> is
hereby ordered to vacate the landholding in question with an approximate area
of four (4) hectares, situated at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Kalisitan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Talugtug</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, in favor of herein petitioner and to refrain from
molesting or in any manner dis­turbing his peaceful possession and cultivation
there­of, subject to the condition that said respondent shall have harvested
and threshed his crop which he plant­ed for the current agricultural year;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conformably with the preceding para­graph,
Fidel <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> is hereby ordered to reinstate said
petitioner to his former landholding <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> and

a consequence hereof, Exhibit 4-Teo­doro and Exhibit 5-Niegos, i.e. contract of
leas <span style="">between Fidel <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>

legal effect; and<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dismissing petitioner's claim for damages as
embodied in his supplemental petition."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> and <span class="SpellE">Niegos</span>
filed separate motions for reconside­ration which were denied by the respondent
agrarian court in its resolution of <st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="11">November
 27, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, in the
same resolution, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u><span style=""> <u>reconsidered</u>, </span>upon motion of <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span>,
its ruling denying the latter's prayer for damages, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"With respect to petitioner's claim for damages as embodied in
his supplemental petition, wherein evidence was adduced in support thereof, we
believe that its admission is in accordance with Section 2, Rule 17 of the
Rules of Court of the Phi­lippines, same not being for the purpose of delay­ing
the proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, the fact that the
Court of Agrarian Relations shall not be bound strictly <span style="">by the technical rules of evidence but 'shall act according to justice
and equity and substantial me­rits of the case,' we believe that the evidence
to support the claim for damages received during the hearings before the court
commissioner is merito­rious (<span class="SpellE">Secs</span>. 10 and 11, RA
1267, as amended).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, petitioner is
entitled to recover damages claimed by him from his landholder in the amount of
85 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span> of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> which is
equal to the two years rental of his landholding less his earnings during the
same period in the amount of P30.00 only or is equivalent to 3 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span> of <span class="SpellE">palay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fine, Fidel <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
is liable to pay to petitioner the amount of 82 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span>
of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> or its cash value of P820.00, computed at
P10.00 per <span class="SpellE">cavan</span> plus interest at 10% until fully
paid."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After <span class="SpellE">Teodoro's</span> motion to reconsider
the foregoing resolution was denied, he interposed on <st1:date year="1963" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1963</st1:date> the present peti­tion, imputing to

dispossession, despite the fact that the claim for damages embodied in the
abovementioned "Supplemental Petition" was interposed out of time or
when the proceedings below were about to be terminated.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent provisions of the disputed "Contract of
Lease" between <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> and <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span>
read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That the <u>LESSOR is the registered owner</u> of a certain
parcel of land situated at <span class="SpellE">Talugtug</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> containing an area of
THIRTY NINE (39) HECTARES, more or less;</blockquote>

and the LESSEE hereby accepts an undivided portion of <u>4-1/2 Hectares</u> of
the abovementioned property under the following terms and conditions:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>That this contract of lease shall only be for
the agricultural year 1960-61</u>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the Lessee shall give a guaranty to
answer for the payment of the lease consideration of this contract;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the rental of 38.7 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span>
of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> per hectare shall be paid unto the LESSOR
not later than January, 1961;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the corresponding rental must be brought
to the <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, to be deposited to
any bonded Warehouse at the expense of the LESSEE and in the name of the
LESSOR;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>That the rental must be of the same va­riety
as that produced by the LESSEE</u>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the LESSOR shall pay for the real
property taxes corresponding to the property leased;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That violation of any of the terms of this
contract shall, be sufficient ground to termi­nate the same with damages
against the guilty party;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>That the property leased shall be used or
utilized for agricultural enterprise only</u>;<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That in case of default on the part of the
LESSEE to pay the lease consideration when the same becomes due and payable and
the collec­tion for the same reaches the court, the LESSEE hereby binds himself
to pay the cost of the suit in­cluding reasonable attorney's fees."
(emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">I.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
contends that the language and tenor of the afore­said contract clearly
manifest the intention of the parties to enter into an ordinary civil lease
contract, not a leasehold tenancy agree­ment as alleged by <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span>
and sustained by the agrarian court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
start with, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> stresses, the parties denominated
the said covenant as a "Contract of Lease," <span style="">which </span>assigned title discloses their mutual intention to execute
an ordinary lease contract, for, otherwise, if they had intended to create a
leasehold tenancy rela­tion, they could have accordingly captioned their
agreement "with the word tenancy or some other word of, similar
import." More­over, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> points out that
"in the contract of lease in question it is significant to note that the
words landlord and tenant were conspicuous by their complete absence."</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing stance assumed <span style="">by </span><span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> is patently unte­nable, in
the face of the principal featur<span style="">e</span>
s and stipulations of the contract in controversy and the pertinent provisions
of existing law on leasehold tenancy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
bears emphasis that the title, label or ru­bric given to a contract cannot be
used to camouflage the real im­port of an agreement as evinced by its main
provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it is basic that a
contract is what the law defines it to be, and not what it is called by the <span style="">contracting parties.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As correctly expressed by the respondent court, "viewed from
the four corners of Exhibit A, we have no doubt that the lease con­tract
entered into between petitioner (<span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span>) and Fidel <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> is a pure and simple leasehold tenancy <span style="">contract as </span>the <span style="">term is </span>under<span style="">stood under our tenancy laws." This observation of the agrarian
court finds anchor in the pertinent provisions of the Agricultural Tenancy
Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, section 4 of Rep. Act 1199,
as amended by Rep. Act 2263, provides that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"<u>Leasehold tenancy</u>
</span>exists when a person who, either personally or with the aid of labor
avail­able from members of his immediate farm house­hold, undertakes to
cultivate a piece of agricultural land susceptible of cultivation by a single
person to­gether with members of his immediate farm house­hold, belonging to or
legally possessed by another in consideration of a fixed amount in money or in
produce or in both."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Furthermore, section 42 of the
Agricultural Tenancy Act defines a landlord-<span class="SpellE">lessor</span> as</p>

<blockquote>"Any person, natural or juridical, either as owner, lessee, <span class="SpellE">usufructuary</span> or legal possessor of agricultural land, who
lets, leases or rents to ano­ther said property for purposes of agricultural
pro­duction and for a price certain or ascertainable ei­ther in an amount of
money or produce;"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">while a tenant-lessee is defined as</p>

<blockquote>"any person who, with the consent of the for­mer (landlord-<span class="SpellE">lessor</span>), tills, cultivates or operates said land,
susceptible of cultivation by one individual, personally or with the aid of
labor available from among his own immediate farm household."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Gleaned from the foregoing provisions, the following could be
synthesized as the principal elements of a leasehold tenancy contract or
relation:</p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="" times="" new="" roman="" ;="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The landlord-<span class="SpellE">lessor</span>,
who is either the lawful own­er or the legal possessor of the land, <u>leases</u>
the same to the tenant-lessee for a price certain or ascertainable either in an
amount of money or <u>produce</u>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Reverting to the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
"Contract of Lease," we are of the consensus that it indubitably
contains the foregoing essential elements of a leasehold tenancy agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">The landholding in dispute is unmistakably an agricultural land
devoted to agricultural production.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More
specifically, the par­ties stipulated that "<u>the property leased shall
be used or utilized for agricultural enterprise only</u>." (emphasis
supplied) Further­more, the parties also agreed that the farmland must be used
for rice production as could be inferred from the stipulation that "the
rental of nine (9) <span class="SpellE">cavans</span> of <span class="SpellE"><u>palay</u></span>
per hectare for one agricultural year ... must be of the same variety (of <span class="SpellE">palay</span>) as that produced by the LESSEE." (emphasis
supplied)</p>

<p class="BODY">The land is definitely susceptible of cultivation by a single
person as it is of an area of only four and a half (4-1/2) hectares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has held<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
that even a bigger area may be cultivated personally by the tenant, singly or
with the help of the members of his immediate farm household.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the stipulation that "the rental must be of the same
variety as that <u><span style="">produced </span>by
the LESSEE</u>," it can reasonably be in­ferred that the intention of the parties
was that <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span> perso­nally work the land, which he
did as found by the Agrarian Court, thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"In the instant case, <u>petitioner</u> (<span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span>)
<u>cultivated the landholding</u> belonging to said <u>respondent</u> (<span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>) for the agri­cultural year 1960-61 in consideration
of a fixed annual rental." (emphasis supplied) Moreover, there is no
evidence that <span class="SpellE">Maca­raeg</span> did not personally cultivate
the land in dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> allege, much less prove, that <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span>
availed of out­side assistance in the cultivation of the said <span class="SpellE">riceland</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> is the registered owner of the
disputed landhold­ing and he delivered the possession thereof to <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span> in consideration of a rental certain to be paid in
produce.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently, there was a valid
leasehold tenancy agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
the provision that the rental be accounted in terms of produce - 9 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span> per hec­tare - is an unmistakable earmark,
considering the other stipulations, that the parties did actually enter into a
leasehold tenancy re­lation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> further argues, however, that
the aforesaid, "Con­tract of Lease" cannot possibly be construed as
establishing a leasehold tenancy relation because the parties themselves
ignored and repudiated the very essence of tenancy - security of tenure - when
they stipulated that "this agreement shall only be for the agri­cultural
year 1960-61."</p>

<p class="BODY">This argument is unacceptable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The mere fact that the par­ties fixed and limited the duration of their
lease contract to only one agricultural year, does not remove the relationship
which they created from the purview of leasehold tenancy, considering the ge­neral
import of their agreement which irreversibly leads to and clearly justifies
tenancy coverage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is fundamental that
the tenant-lessee's security of tenure subsists notwithstanding the termina­tion
of the contract which initially established the tenancy relation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the language of the law, the
"expiration of the period of the con­tract as fixed <span style="">by </span>the

This is a "practical consequence of the distinction between the tenancy <u><span style="">contract</span></u><span style=""> </span>which is fixed by the parties, and the tenancy <u><span style="">relationship</span></u><span style=""> </span>which is maintained and governed by

Furthermore, section 49 of the Agricultural Tenancy Act provides that</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"<u>Notwithstanding
any agreement or provision </u></span><u>of law as to the period of future
surrender of the land</u>, in all cases where land devoted to any agricultural
purpose is held under any system of tenancy, the te­nant shall not be

hereinafter enumerated and only after the sane has been proved before, and the
dispossession is authorized by, the court." (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The <span class="SpellE">abovecited</span>
provision does not permit the parties to stipulate at what future time the
tenant shall leave or surrender the land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, this Court has held<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
that an agreement whereby the tenant was required to <span style="">return to </span>the landlord his <span style="">landholding
</span>after one crop year cannot justify the tenant's dispossession after the
said period because such agreement is expressly proscribed by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Still vehemently contending that he never intended to <span style="">enter into any </span>tenancy relation with <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span>, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> finally argues
that construing the abovementioned "Contract of Lease" as a lease­hold
tenancy agreement would amount to a judicial negation of his freedom to
contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">Needless to stress, this Court frowns upon and rejects any
attempt to nullify the legitimate exercise of the right <span style="">to contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>We agree
with <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> that as <span style="">a </span>landholder he has full liberty to
enter into a civil lease contract covering his property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What we want to indelibly impress, however, <span style="">is </span>that
once a landowner en­ters into a contract of lease whereby his land is to be
devoted to agricultural production and said landholding is susceptible of per­sonal
cultivation by the lessee, solely or with the help of labor coming from his
immediate farm household, then such contract <span style="">is </span>of the very essence of a leasehold
agreement, and perforce comes under the direct coverage of the tenancy
laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, it would be easy to
subvert, under the guise of the liberty to con­tract, the intendment of the law
of protecting the underprivileged and ordinarily credulous farmer from the
unscrupulous schemes <span style="">and pernicious
practices of </span><span style="">the landed gentry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">II.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We now come to the
second assignment of error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Teo­doro</span> posits that granting the establishment of a
leasehold tenancy relation between him and <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span>
by virtue of the aforesaid "Contract of Lease," the agrarian court
nevertheless erred in not finding <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span>, guilty of
abandonment, an act which terminates the tenancy relation and justifies the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of the te­nant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In support of his thesis, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> points out
that <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span> committed a positive act of abandonment
when he offered to vacate his leasehold in favor of a certain <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> Claus, and only after "he could not have his
own way of placing <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> Claus as his suc­cessor"
did he try to "recover the landholding." Assuming the ve­racity of
the foregoing allegation, a tenant's offer or intention to surrender his
leasehold on the condition that the person named by him should be accepted as
his successor, does not of itself consti­tute abandonment of his farmland.</p>

<p class="BODY">"The word 'abandon,' in its ordinary sense, means to for­sake
entirely; to forsake or renounce utterly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The dictionaries trace this word to the root idea of 'putting under a
ban.' The em­phasis is on the finality and the publicity<span style=""> </span>with which some thing or body is
thus put in the control of another and hence the meaning of giving up
absolutely, with intent over again to resume or <span style="">claim one's rights or interests.</span><span style="">"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">In
other words, the act of aban­donment constitutes actual, absolute and
irrevocable desertion of one's right or property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span>
merely intended to vacate his leasehold possession on the condition that a
certain Claus be taken as his successor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, his act did not constitute desertion of his leasehold as I was a
mere intended sur­render of the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And as correctly espoused by the counsel for the respondent court, it is
"only through the actual surrender of the land that tenancy relation
terminates no amount of intention to surrender severs the relationship."
Furthermore, the said act of <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span> was not an
absolute renunciation of his leasehold posses­sion, as it was in fact clearly
conditional.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">However, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> also claims, with characteristic certitude, that <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span> did actually abandon work on the land </span><span style="">in dis­</span><span style="">pute and that even the decision under review contains a finding to this
effect. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>We find no statement in the
agrarian court's decision sustaining <span class="SpellE">Teodoro's</span>
view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the country, we perceive truth
in the respondent court's counsel's manifestation that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The only times that the tenant herein did not work the land
were <span style="">(1) </span>during
the time it was undergoing its regular dry season fallow, and, ... (2) after he
was prohibited from Plowing the land <span style="">by
a certain <span class="SpellE">Niegos</span>, an agent of Petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failure to cultivate during the dry season
fallow definitely does not amount to abandonment (Cf. De la Cruz vs. <span class="SpellE">Asociacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Zangera</span> <span class="SpellE">Casilan</span>, et al., 83 Phil. 214).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, failure to cultivate the land by
reason of the forcible prohibition to do so by a third party cannot also amount
to abandonment, for abandonment presupposes free will."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Anent the charge of abandonment, it is also pertinent to note
that four days after <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span> received a letter from <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> and his wife advising him that the landholding in
question will be given to another tenant, he lost no time in inquiring from the
Tenancy Mediation Commission at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> about his rights as a
leasehold tenant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would appear
therefore that <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg's</span> immediate reaction to his
landlord's design to dispossess him negates <span style="">the act of abandonment imputed to him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro's</span> pretension that <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span>
had aban­doned the disputed landholding was squarely rejected by the agra­rian
court, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In the instant case, while petitioner had <u>intentions</u>
to surrender his landholding to respondent after the harvest for the
agricultural (year) 1960-61 which led the latter to advise the former not to
give his landholding to <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> Claus, <u>yet that
surrender did not materialize</u> because said petitioner had apparently
changed his mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For as early as <st1:date year="1961" day="6" month="3">March 6, 1961</st1:date>, petitioner went to the

said Commission wrote a letter to Fidel <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> and

from ejecting petitioner.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"During the intervening period, Fidel <span class="SpellE">Teo­doro</span>

<p class="NUM">III.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Toward the end of the
proceedings in the respondent court, <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span>
interposed a pleading which he denominated "sup­plemental petition,"
wherein he asked for damages as a result of his dispossession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said "supplemental petition"
was given due course by the hearing commissioner and <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span>
was allowed to present evidence in support thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of the evidence thus adduced,
the respondent court awarded damages to <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span> as
decreed in its abovementioned resolution of <st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> maintains that the respondent
court erred in admit­ting the said "supplemental pleading" on the
basis of section 2, Rule 17 (now section 3 of Rule 10 of the Revised Rules of
Court) which exclusively pertains to amendment of pleadings, and has nothing to
do with the interposition of supplemental pleadings which is sepa­rately
governed by section 5 of Rule 17 (now section 5 of Rule 10).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> avers,
moreover, that since <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span> filed his claim for damages
only when the hearing below was about to end, his inac­tion must be considered
as a waiver of such claim or that he should be considered guilty of fatal
negligence.</p>

<p class="BODY">In resolving this last assignment of error, attention must be

<p class="BODY">Since the abovementioned "supplemental pleading" was
filed without intent to delay the proceedings, the agrarian court exercised
sound discretion in giving it due course in order that "the real matter in
dispute and all matters in the action in dis­pute between the parties may, as
far as possible, be completely determined in a single proceeding."
Moreover, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> has no reason to complain, for he
was accorded every opportunity to controvert <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg's</span>
claim for damages, but apparently he did not, as in fact he does not here
traverse the substantiality of the award.</p>

<p class="BODY">Significantly, the Court of Agrarian Relations is not "res­tricted
to <span style="">the </span>specific relief claimed
or demands made by the par­ties to the dispute, but may include in the order or
decision any matter or determination which may be teemed necessary and ex­pedient

<span style="">In </span>other
words, the respondent court could have determined <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg's</span>
claim for damages even without his "supplemental petition," pro­vided
there was proof to substantiate such claim (and such requi­site evidence was
not wanting).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, if the agrarian
court could have awarded damages in favor of <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span>
even in the absence of a specific prayer, then there is no conceivable reason
to bar the respondent court from granting the same with the interposition of
the aforesaid "supplemental petition" which explicitly and
unmistakably prays for damages resulting from <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg's</span>
dispos­session.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hasten to modify, however, the award of damages in so far as
it deducts from the total amount recoverable by <span class="SpellE">Maca­raeg</span>
the sum of P30 or its equivalent of 3 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span> of <span class="SpellE">palay</span>, repre<span style="">senting
his earnings during the period of his unlawful <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This part of the award contravenes section
27(1) of the Agricul­tural Tenancy Act which makes the erring landlord
"liable to the tenant for damages to the extent of the landholder's
participation in the harvest <u>in addition</u> to the tenant's right under
Section twenty-two of this Act." And section 22(1) provides that the
"tenant shall be free to work elsewhere whenever the nature of his farm
obliga­tions warrants his temporary absence from his holdings."
Consequently, <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg's</span> measly earning of P30 <u>during
the period of his dispossession</u> should not be deducted from the total
amount of damages due to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Interpreting the <span class="SpellE">abovecited</span> section 27(1) in
