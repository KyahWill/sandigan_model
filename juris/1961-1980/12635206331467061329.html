Proceeding No. 1720.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent facts, culled from the stipulation of facts
submitted by the parties, are the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">The late Jose <span class="SpellE">Consuegra</span>, at the time of
his death, was employed as a shop foreman of the office of the District
Engineer in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del Norte</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his lifetime, <span class="SpellE">Consuegra</span>
contracted two marriages, the first with herein respondent Rosario Diaz, solem­nized
in the parish church of San Nicolas de <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>, on July 15,
1937, <span style="">out of </span>which mar­riage
were born two children, namely, Jose <span class="SpellE">Consuegra</span>, Jr.
and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Consuegra</span>, but both predeceased their
father; and the second, which was contracted in good faith while the first
marriage was subsisting, with herein petitioner <span class="SpellE">Basilia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Berdin</span>, on May 1, 1957 in the same parish and
municipality, out of <span style="">which </span>marriage
were born seven children, namely, Juliana, <span class="SpellE">Pacita</span>,
Maria Lourdes, Jose, Rodrigo, <span class="SpellE">Lenida</span> and Luz,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">*</span></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">Being a member of the Government <span style="">Service Insurance </span>System (GSIS, for short) when <span class="SpellE">Consuegra</span> died on Septem­ber 26, 1965, the proceeds of his

601801 were paid by the GSIS to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Basilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Berdin</span> and her children who were the beneficia­ries named
in the policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having been in the
service of the government for 22.5028 years, <span class="SpellE">Consuegra</span>
was entitled to retirement insurance benefits in the sum of P6,304.47 pursuant
to Section 12(c) of Commonwealth Act 186 as amended by Republic Acts 1616 and
3836.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Consuegra</span>
did not designate any beneficiary who would receive the retirement insurance

filed a claim </span>with the GSIS asking that the <span style="">retirement insurance </span>benefits be paid to her as <span style="">the only legal heir of <span class="SpellE">Consuegra</span>,
considering that the deceased did not designate </span>any beneficiary with
respect to <span style="">his retirement insurance
benefits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Basilia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Berdin</span> and her children, likewise, </span>filed a

policy of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Consuegra</span></span><span style="">, they are the only ones </span>entitled to
receive the <span style="">retirement insurance
benefits due </span>the deceased <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Consuegra</span></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Resolving </span>the conflicting claims, the
GSIS ruled that <span style="">the legal heirs of the </span><span style="">late </span><span style="">Jose <span class="SpellE">Consuegra</span> were Rosario Diaz, his widow by his first
marriage who is entitled to one-half, or 8/16, of the retirement insurance
benefits, on the one hand; and <span class="SpellE">Basilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Berdin</span>, his widow by the second marriage </span><span style="">and </span>their seven children, on the other
hand, who <span style="">are </span>entitled to the
remaining one-half, or 8/16, <span style="">each of </span>them

<p class="BODY">Hence the present appeal by herein petitioners-appellants, <span class="SpellE">Basilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Berdin</span> and her children.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the contention of appellants that the lower court erred in
not holding that the designated beneficiaries in the life insurance of the late
Jose <span class="SpellE">Cons­uegra</span> are also the exclusive beneficiaries
in the retirement insurance of said deceased.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, it is the submission of appellants that because the <span style="">deceased Jose <span class="SpellE">Consuegra</span>
failed to designate the bene­ficiaries in his retirement insurance, the
appellants who were the beneficiaries named in the life insurance should
automatically be considered the <span style="">beneficiaries
</span>to receive the retirement insurance benefits, to the exclusion of
respondent Rosario <span style="">Diaz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>From the ar­guments adduced by
appellants in their brief We gather that it is their stand that the system of
life insurance and the system of retirement insurance, are provided for in
Commonwealth Act 186 </span><span style="">as amended, are </span><span style="">simply
complementary to each other, or that one is a part or an extension of the
other, such that who­ever is named the beneficiary in the life insurance <span style="">is </span></span><span style="">also the beneficiary in the retirement insurance when no such
beneficiary is named in the retirement insurance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The contention of
appellants is untenable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that the law creating the Govern­ment Service
Insurance System is Commonwealth Act 186 which was enacted by the National
Assembly on <st1:date year="1936" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1936</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As originally approved, Commonwealth Act 186
pro­vided for the compulsory membership in the Government Service Insurance
System of all regularly and permanent­ly appointed officials and employees of
the government, considering as automatically insured on life all such officials
and employees, and issuing to them the corres­ponding membership policy under
the terms and conditions as provided in the Act.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Originally, Commonwealth Act 186 provided for life insurance
only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Commonwealth Act 186 was amended
by Republic Act 660 which was enacted by the Congress of the Philippines on
June 16, 1951, and, among others the <span style="">amendatory
Act provided that aside from the system of life insurance under the Government
Service Insurance System there was also established the system of retire­ment
insurance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, We will note in
Republic Act 660 that there is a chapter on life insurance and another chapter
on retirement insurance.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Under the chapter on life insurance are

amending section 12 of Commonwealth Act 186 as amended by Republic Act 660, by
adding thereto two new subsections, designated as subsections (b) and (c).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This subsection (c) of section 12 of Common­wealth
Act 186, as amended by Republic Acts 660, 1616 and 3096, was again amended by
Republic Act 3836 which </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">enacted
on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="6"><span style="">June 22, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent provisions </span><span style="">or </span><span style="">subsection (c) of Section 12 of Com­monwealth Act 186, as thus amended

employer's premiums described in sub­section (a) <span style="">or </span>Section 5 hereof, without interest, be only a gratuity
equivalent to one month's salary for every year of service, based on the
highest rate received, but not to exceed twenty four months; <u><span style="">Provided</span></u><span style="">, </span>That the retiring officer or employee has been in the service

<blockquote>"Elective or appointive officials and employees <span style="">paid </span>gratuity under this subsection
shall be entitled to the commutation of the unused vacation and sick leave,
based on the highest rate received, which they may have to their credit at the
time <span style="">or </span>retirement."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Jose <span class="SpellE">Consuegra</span> died on September 26,
1965, and so at the time of his death he had acquired rights under the
above-quoted provisions of subsection (c) of Section 12 of Com. Act 186, as
finally amended by Rep. Act 3836 on June 22, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Consuegra</span> died
on September 26, 1965, he had to his credit 22.5028 years or service in the
government, and pursuant <span style="">to </span>the
above-quoted provisions of subsection (c) of Sec­tion 12 of Com. Act 186, as
amended, on the basis of the highest rate of salary received by him which was
P282.83 per month, he was entitled to receive retire­ment insurance benefits in
the amount of P6,304.47.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the
retirement benefits that are the subject of dispute between the appellants, on
the one hand, and the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Rosario Diaz, on the
other, in the present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question
posed is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to whom should this retirement
insurance benefits or Jose <span class="SpellE">Consuegra</span> be paid, because
he did not, or failed to, designate the beneficiary of his retirement
insurance?</p>

<p class="BODY">If <span class="SpellE">Consuegra</span> had 22.5028 years of
service in the government when he died on September 26, 1965, it follows that
he started in the government service some­time during the early part of 1943,
or before 1943.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1943 Com. Act 186 was
not yet amended, and the only benefits then provided for in said Com. Act 186 <span style="">were </span>those that proceed from a life
insurance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon enter­ing the government
service <span class="SpellE">Consuegra</span> became a compul­sory member of the
GSIS, being automatically insured on his life, pursuant to the provisions of
Com. Act 186 which was in force at the time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>During 1943 the opera­tion of the Government Service Insurance System
was suspended because of the war, and the operation was resumed sometime in
1946.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Consuegra</span>
designated his beneficiaries in his life insurance he could not have intended
those beneficiaries of his life insurance as also the beneficiaries of his
retirement insurance because the provisions on retirement insurance under the
GSIS came about only when Com. Act 186 was amended by Rep. Act 660 on June 16,
1951.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it cannot be said that
because herein appellants were designated beneficiaries in <span class="SpellE">Consuegra's</span>
life insurance they automatically became the beneficiaries also of his retire­ment
insurance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rep. Act 660 added to Com.
Act 186 provisions regarding retirement insurance, which are Sections 11, 12,
and 13 of Com. Act 186, as amended.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsection (b) of Section 11 of Com. Act 186, as amend­ed by <span style="">Rep. Act </span>660, provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"(b)<span style=""> </span><u>Survivors benefit</u>. – Upon death before
he becomes eligible for retirement, his beneficiaries as recorded in the
application for retirement annuity filed with the System shall be <span style="">paid </span>his own premiums with interest or
three <u><span style="">per</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>centum</u><span style=""> <u>per</u> </span><u>annum</u>, compounded monthly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If on his death he is eligible for
retirement, then the automatic retirement annuity or the annuity chosen by him
previously shall be paid accordingly."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above-quoted provisions of subsection (b) of Section 11 of
Commonwealth Act 186, <span style="">as </span>amended
by Rep. Act 660, clearly indicate that there is need for the employee to file
an application for retirement insurance benefits when he becomes a member of
the <span style="">GSIS, </span>and
he should state in his application the beneficiary of his retirement
insurance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the beneficiary named
in the life insurance does nor automatically become the beneficiary in the
retirement insurance un­less the same beneficiary in the life insurance is so
designated in the application for retirement insurance.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 24 of Commonwealth Act 186, as amended by Rep. Act 660,
provides for a life insurance fund and for a retirement insurance fund.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no such pro­vision in Com. Act 186
before it was amended by Rep. Act 660.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, subsections (a) and (b) of Section 24 of Commonwealth Act 186, as
amended by Rep. Act 660, part­ly read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Life insurance fund</u>. - This shall
consist of all <u>premiums</u> for life insurance benefit and/or earnings and
savings <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I<span style="">t</span> shall meet death claims
as they may arise or such equities <span style="">as </span>any member may be entitled to, under the
conditions of his policy, and shall maintain the required reserves to the end
of guaranteeing the fulfillment of the life insurance contracts issued by <span style="">the </span>System...."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Retirement insurance fund.</u> - This shall
consist of all <u>contributions</u> for retirement insurance benefit and of
earn­ings and savings <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It shall meet <span style="">annuity payments and establish the re­quired reserves to the end of the
guaran­teeing the fulfillment of the contracts issued by the System...."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Thus, We see that the GSIS offers two
separate and distinct systems of benefits to its members – one is the life
insurance and the other is the retirement insurance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These two distinct systems of benefits are
paid out from two distinct and separate funds that are maintained by the GSIS.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case of the
proceeds of a life insurance, the same are paid to whoever is named the
beneficiary in the life insurance policy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As in the case of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">life
insurance provided for in the Insurance Act (Act 2427, as amended), the
beneficiary in a life insurance under the GSIS may not necessarily be an heir
or the insured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The insured in a life
insurance may designate any person as beneficiary unless <span style="">disqualified to </span>be so under the
provisions of the Civil Code.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> And in the absence of any beneficiary named
in the life in­surance policy, the proceeds of the insurance will go to the
estate of the insured.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Retirement insurance is primarily intended for the benefit of the
employee - to provide for his old age, or incapacity, after rendering service
in the government for a required number of years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the employee reaches the age of
retirement, he gets the retirement benefits even to the exclusion of the bene­ficiary
or beneficiaries named in his application for retirement insurance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The beneficiary of the retire­ment insurance
can only claim the proceeds of the retirement insurance if the employee dies
before retirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the employee failed
or overlooked to state the beneficiary of his retirement insurance, the
retirement benefits will accrue to his estate and will be given to his legal
heirs in accordance with law, as in the case of a life insurance if no
beneficiary is named in the insurance policy.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is Our view, therefore, that the respondent GSIS had correctly
acted when it ruled that the pro­ceeds of the retirement insurance of the late
Jose <span class="SpellE">Consuegra</span> should be divided equally between his
first living wife Rosario Diaz, on the one hand, and his second wife <span class="SpellE">Basilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Berdin</span> and his children
by her, on the other; and the lower court did not commit er­ror when it
confirmed the action of the GSIS, it being accepted as a fact that the second
marriage of Jose <span class="SpellE">Consuegra</span> to <span class="SpellE">Basilia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Berdin</span> was contracted in good faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court has correctly applied the
ruling of this Court in the case of Lao, et al., vs. Dee Tim, et al., 45 Phil.
739, as cited in the sti­pulation of facts and in the decision appealed from.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
In the recent case of Gomez vs. <span class="SpellE">Lipana</span>, L-23214, June
30, 1970,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court, in construing the rights of two women who were married to the same
man - a situation more or less similar to the case of appellant <span class="SpellE">Basilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Berdin</span> and <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Rosario Diaz - held "that since the
defendant's first marriage has not been dissolved or declared void the conjugal
partnership established by that marriage has not ceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor has the first wife lost or relinquished
her status as putative heir of her husband under the new Civil Code, entitled
to share in his estate upon his death should she survive him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, whether as conjugal partner in
a still subsisting marriage or as such putative heir she has an interest in the
husband's share in the property here in dispute...." And with respect to
the right of the second wife, this Court observed that although the second
marriage can be presumed to be void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span> as it was celebrated while the first marriage
