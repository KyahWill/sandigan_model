				<BR><STRONG>REGALA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case &nbsp;comes to Us for review from the Workmen's Compensation Commission. <p>The facts, as found by the Commission, are: </p> <blockquote> <p>"Previous &nbsp;to his employment with the &nbsp;respondent Itogon-Suyoc Mines, Inc., Fruto Dulay applied for work in the Antamok Mining Company on October 10, 1950, but was refused admission &nbsp;into the service by the management &nbsp; because he was found afflicted &nbsp;with lung" ailment. &nbsp;On &nbsp;September 22, 1951, &nbsp;he &nbsp;suffered the same &nbsp;fate of &nbsp;the chest. &nbsp;He worked as &nbsp;mucker &nbsp;performing &nbsp;the following results: &nbsp;'Far Advanced PTB, right lung, fibro-caseous with fraction (traction) of &nbsp;the heart to the right. &nbsp;Beginning &nbsp;infiltrations, left upper lung. &nbsp;&nbsp;However, seven months thereafter, or specifically on &nbsp;April 30, 1952, he was allowed to work by the herein respondent after passing the &nbsp;pre-employment physical &nbsp;examination conducted by &nbsp;Dr. Ramon Pellicer, &nbsp;a company physician. &nbsp;It &nbsp;should be noted that this medical check-up did &nbsp;not include &nbsp;an X-ray &nbsp;examination of &nbsp;the chest. &nbsp; He worked as &nbsp;mucker &nbsp;performing &nbsp;the following duties, to wit: (1) to muck and &nbsp; bore holes &nbsp;five feet deep by means of &nbsp;a stopper &nbsp;machine, &nbsp;weighing &nbsp;200 &nbsp;pounds &nbsp;more or less., &nbsp;and blast them &nbsp;with dynamites; and &nbsp;(2) to &nbsp; lift timber of &nbsp;varied sizes, which include some &nbsp;round posts that could hardly &nbsp;be carried &nbsp;by two persons. &nbsp;His &nbsp;place of work was hot as &nbsp;the company provided no electric &nbsp;fan for adequate ventilation. &nbsp;He worked either on the nightshift, &nbsp;starting from &nbsp;4:00 up to 12:00 p.m. &nbsp;or &nbsp;the day shift, starting from 7:00 a.m. up to &nbsp;3:00 p.m. &nbsp;On April 28, 1954, &nbsp;he was &nbsp;automatically separated &nbsp;from the &nbsp; employment &nbsp;&nbsp;because &nbsp;he exceeded &nbsp;his &nbsp;vacation leave without permission from &nbsp;the respondent (AWOL). &nbsp;Fortunately, &nbsp;after having requested &nbsp;the &nbsp;General Superintendent for &nbsp;his reinstatement, lie &nbsp;was readmitted &nbsp;to &nbsp;the employment on May 14, 1954. &nbsp;On July 7. 1954, &nbsp;he was &nbsp;X-rayed by Dr. Hugo A. &nbsp;Rosa, &nbsp;the company physician &nbsp;who took the place of Dr. Rampn Pellicer, &nbsp;and was discovered suffering from:</p> <blockquote> <p>'RL: Fibro-caseous &nbsp;all over<br>'LL: Fibroid Lesions &nbsp;LS-3, &nbsp;markedly retracted mediastinum to the right.</p> <p>REMARKS: For advanced &nbsp;chronic P.T.B.</p> </blockquote> <p>On July &nbsp;16, &nbsp;1954, &nbsp;he &nbsp;stopped working &nbsp;at the &nbsp; instance &nbsp;of the incumbent &nbsp;company &nbsp;physician &nbsp;and &nbsp;received medication from the respondent until September 12. 1955. &nbsp;From &nbsp;August &nbsp;2. &nbsp;to 30, &nbsp;1954, inclusive, &nbsp;he paid Dr. Jose Villamil P1.00 &nbsp;daily for the injections of streptomycin on him. &nbsp;He was X-rayed on November &nbsp;3, &nbsp;1954, but the result revealed &nbsp;'no apparent radio-graphic change.' When he sought &nbsp;employment &nbsp;in the &nbsp;Philippine &nbsp; Engineers' Syndicate &nbsp;on December 18, 1954, he &nbsp;was rejected because &nbsp;he was found to &nbsp;have been afflicted with 'R.L. Fibro-caseous lesion &nbsp;all over with retracted mediastinum. &nbsp;L.L.-00." At the time he was told to stop &nbsp;working by the company physician due to his illness, he &nbsp;was earning P24.00."</p> </blockquote> <p>From these facts, &nbsp;Commissioner &nbsp; Cesareo &nbsp;Perez concluded that Dulay's ailment was aggravated by the nature of his work and therefore was compensable. In addition, he held that the company had waived its right to contest the compensability of the disease on the ground that the company did not submit its employer's report within the time &nbsp;stated in Section &nbsp;45 of the Workmen's Compensation &nbsp;Act (Act No. &nbsp;3428, &nbsp;as &nbsp;amended). Accordingly, &nbsp;he &nbsp;ordered &nbsp;the companyâ€”</p> <blockquote> <p>"1. To pay the claimant, thru this Commission, the sum of TWO THOUSAND &nbsp;NINE &nbsp;HUNDRED &nbsp;NINETY-FIVE and 20/100 (P2.995.20) &nbsp;&nbsp;PESOS as compensation pursuant to Section 14 &nbsp;of the Act, as &nbsp;amended;</p> <p>"2. To reimburse to the claimant, thru &nbsp;this Commission, the sum of TWENTY-NINE (P29.00) PESOS which he spent &nbsp; for &nbsp;medical treatment and &nbsp;to provide him with continuous medical and hospital services and supplies until his illness &nbsp;is cured or arrested pursuant to Section. 13 &nbsp;of the Act; </p> <p>"3. To pay the claimant &nbsp;the sum &nbsp;of &nbsp;P224.64 as attorney's fee; and</p> <p> "4. To pay the Commission the &nbsp;amount of &nbsp;P35.00 as costs pursuant to Section 55 of the Act, as amended." Its &nbsp;motion for reconsideration &nbsp;having been &nbsp;denied by the &nbsp; Commission en &nbsp;bane, the company &nbsp;appealed to &nbsp;this Court.</p> </blockquote> <p> Section &nbsp;2 of the Workmen's &nbsp;Compensation Act provides: </p> <blockquote> <p>"When an employee &nbsp;suffers &nbsp;personal &nbsp;injury from &nbsp;any &nbsp;&nbsp;accident arising out &nbsp;of and &nbsp;in the course &nbsp;of his employment, &nbsp;or contracts tuberculosis &nbsp;or other illness directly caused by such &nbsp;employment, or either aggravated by or the result of &nbsp;the nature of such &nbsp;employment, &nbsp;his employer shall &nbsp;pay &nbsp;compensation in the sums &nbsp;and to the person hereinafter &nbsp;specified. * * *.</p> </blockquote> <p>In holding the case compensable on the ground of &nbsp;aggravation, the Commission &nbsp;stated:</p> <blockquote> <p>"* * * Here, claimant admitted &nbsp;that he was suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis far &nbsp;advanced, on &nbsp;September 22, 1951 &nbsp;(t.s.n. p. &nbsp;2, &nbsp;"hearing of &nbsp;December &nbsp;11, &nbsp;1959). &nbsp;<i>This illness &nbsp;must &nbsp;have improved at the &nbsp;inception &nbsp;of &nbsp;his work on April 30, 1952 &nbsp;which is quite probable because, &nbsp;aside &nbsp;from &nbsp;the medical treatment extended to him by &nbsp;Dr. Jose Villamil,, Fruto &nbsp;Dulay was at a &nbsp;complete rest for more than &nbsp;seven (7) months as he &nbsp;was not &nbsp;yet engaged in any &nbsp;work activities.</i> Moreover, &nbsp;the &nbsp;fact that he was &nbsp; admitted into &nbsp;the service, &nbsp;and allowed to work for more &nbsp;than two years after having passed the &nbsp;physical examination made by Dr. Ramon Pellicer sometime in April, 1952, is a strong indication that said illness &nbsp;was &nbsp;arrested &nbsp;and therefore &nbsp;inactive. &nbsp; However, due to the strenous work entailed by his being a miner * * * and his nighttime duties at the &nbsp;underground level where the &nbsp;atmosphere &nbsp;was hot, &nbsp;his &nbsp;ailment was reactivated and has progressed to a &nbsp;more disabling far advanced &nbsp;stage &nbsp;which ultimately &nbsp;necessitated his early separation from the employment. * &nbsp;* * " (Italics ours.) </p> </blockquote> <p>The company contends that there is absolutely no evidence that Dulay &nbsp;was &nbsp;under medical &nbsp;treatment &nbsp;after &nbsp;he &nbsp;was found &nbsp;sick &nbsp;of far advanced &nbsp;pulmonary tuberculosis &nbsp;on September 22, 1951 so as to warrant &nbsp;the conclusion that his &nbsp;illness had been arrested at the time of his employment on April 30, &nbsp; 1952 and then agravated and &nbsp;reactivated by the nature of his work.</p> <p>Be &nbsp;that as it may, &nbsp;the &nbsp;fact remains however that Dulay was given pre-employment physical examination and &nbsp;was obviously found fit by the company's own &nbsp;physician that is why he was admitted to work. &nbsp;&nbsp;As &nbsp;a matter of fact, he &nbsp;was allowed to work for more &nbsp;than two years and it was only when he was told to do so by the company physician that he stopped &nbsp;working. &nbsp;&nbsp;If he was later found sick of TB, it &nbsp;must be because of the nature of his work which consisted &nbsp;of &nbsp;boring &nbsp;holes by means &nbsp;of a machine &nbsp;that weighed 200 &nbsp;pounds and lifting timber of various &nbsp;sizes and which he did &nbsp;under conditions &nbsp;that &nbsp;could not but aggravate his illness.</p> <p>Neither was Dulay guilty of &nbsp;bad faith in allegedly not disclosing the fact of his illness at the time &nbsp;he presented himself to physical examination as required &nbsp;by the company physician who &nbsp;found him fit to work.</p> <p>The &nbsp;decision orders petitioner "to provide &nbsp;him (Fruto Dulay) with continuous &nbsp; medical and hospital service and supplies until his illness is cured or arrested, pursuant to Section 13 of the Act." &nbsp;Petitioner assails this portion of the decision on the &nbsp;ground that Dulay &nbsp;is no longer in its employ and that its &nbsp;liability for &nbsp;medical care can not extend beyond &nbsp;208 weeks. &nbsp;There is no merit in the contention. &nbsp;&nbsp;Section 13 does not require employer-employee relationship as a condition for the employer's liability. &nbsp;As long as the illness &nbsp;was &nbsp;contracted during the employee's employment, the &nbsp;employer's obligation subsists. &nbsp;This obligation lasts for as long as the employee is sick. &nbsp;The limit of 208 weeks, &nbsp;like the limit of P4,000, refers to the liability of &nbsp;the employer for &nbsp; <i>compensation</i> (Sees. 12, 14, 16, 18, Act No. 3428, as amended) and has no reference at all to the employer's liability for <i>medical care</i> (Sec. 13) which lasts &nbsp;during the &nbsp;"period &nbsp;of disability." &nbsp;See La Mallorca-Pambusco <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Isip, et al., G. R. &nbsp;No. L-16495, Oct. 19, 1961)</p> <p>Neither &nbsp;is there &nbsp;merit &nbsp;in &nbsp;petitioner's argument that Dulay cannot be said to have "contracted sickness" &nbsp;under Section 13 on the &nbsp;assumption that his &nbsp;lung &nbsp; ailment was aggravated &nbsp;by the &nbsp;nature of his work. &nbsp;Under Section 2 of the law, &nbsp; an &nbsp;employee may contract tuberculosis "either aggravated &nbsp;by &nbsp;or the result of the nature of such employment" and since we have shown that Dulay's TB condition was aggravated &nbsp;by the nature of his work, &nbsp;the &nbsp;decision correctly provides for his medical attendance.</p> <p>&nbsp;Another &nbsp;reason &nbsp;in support of &nbsp;the conclusion reached herein is the fact &nbsp;that both the hearing officer &nbsp;and the Commission <i>en banc </i>&nbsp;have found that &nbsp;the lung ailment of the defendant was aggravated as a result of his heavy work. &nbsp;In line with a long array of decisions, We conclude that there is &nbsp;evidence to support the finding or conclusion of &nbsp;the Workmen's Compensation &nbsp;Commission.</p> <p>Wherefore, the &nbsp;decision dated &nbsp;July &nbsp;18, 1961 &nbsp;and the resolution dated September 6, 1961 of the Commission are hereby affirmed, without &nbsp;pronouncement &nbsp;as to costs. </p> <p><i>Bengzon, &nbsp;C. J., Padilla, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon </i>&nbsp;and <i>Makalintal, &nbsp;JJ.,</i> &nbsp;concur.</p> </div>
