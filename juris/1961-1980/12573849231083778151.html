				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This &nbsp;is a disbarment proceedings against Atty. &nbsp;Napoleon O. Fontanosa of &nbsp;Kidapawan, Cotabato, for &nbsp;malpractice. <p align="JUSTIFY">It appears that on &nbsp;18 &nbsp;April 1958, &nbsp;the &nbsp;respondent &nbsp;on behalf of the complainant filed in &nbsp;the Justice of the Peace Court of Kidapawan, &nbsp;Cotabato, &nbsp;three &nbsp;separate complaints against &nbsp;Sergio &nbsp;Orfrecio &nbsp;(Case No. 151, Annex &nbsp;A), Mariano &nbsp;Abellera and &nbsp;Demetria &nbsp;Abellera (Case No. 152, Annex B) &nbsp;and Hadji &nbsp;Saed (Case No. &nbsp;153, Annex C) &nbsp;to collect from them P190.00, P280.00 &nbsp;and P150.00, &nbsp;respectively, the unpaid balance of the purchase price of sewing machines, interest thereon, attorney's fees and costs; that on &nbsp;20 April, the complainant and the respondent entered into written contracts whereby for and &nbsp;in consideration of P100 &nbsp;for &nbsp;each collection case, the latter undertook to represent the former in court in the three collection cases, and the &nbsp;complainant bound himself &nbsp;to &nbsp;pay the stipulated attorney's fees even &nbsp;if the cases be settled amicably before trial &nbsp;(Annexes A-l, B-l and C-l) ; that on 22 &nbsp;August, the complainant terminated the services of the respondent, engaged &nbsp;the services &nbsp;of another attorney and requested the respondent to return the documents and &nbsp;papers entrusted to him upon &nbsp;which the complaints in the collection cases are based; that the &nbsp;respondent &nbsp;refused &nbsp;to return the documents on which he claimed to &nbsp;have a lien unless his stipulated attorney's &nbsp;fees be paid; that in view of the respondent's &nbsp;refusal &nbsp;to return the documents, on &nbsp;29 &nbsp;September, the &nbsp;complainant &nbsp;asked the &nbsp;Justice of the Peace Court of Kidapawan, Cotabato, to issue a <em>subpoena duces tecum</em> &nbsp;requiring &nbsp;the respondent to appear and &nbsp;produce in court &nbsp;the documents &nbsp;referred to; that the Justice &nbsp;of the Peace denied the &nbsp;motion &nbsp;for the issuance of a &nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">subpoena duces &nbsp;tecum</span> on &nbsp;the ground that the documents are privileged and &nbsp;the respondent as attorney has &nbsp;a lien on them; that on 3 &nbsp;October, the complainant filed a motion for reconsideration of the order denying his motion for the issuance &nbsp;of a<em> sub-poena duces tecum</em>; that on 16 October, in Civil Cases Nos. 151 &nbsp;and 152, &nbsp;the Justice of the Peace Court entered an order requiring the &nbsp; respondent to appear and show &nbsp;cause why a <em>sub-poena duces tecum</em> should not be issued to compel him &nbsp;to bring to court the documents &nbsp;in his possession; &nbsp;that on 21 October, the respondent objected to the motion &nbsp;for reconsideration &nbsp;filed by the complainant on 3 October in &nbsp;Civil Cases Nos. 151 and &nbsp;152; that on 29 October, finding the objection &nbsp;well taken, the Justice of the Peace Court denied the motion for reconsideration; that as &nbsp;the then plaintiff, &nbsp;now complainant, could not &nbsp;proceed &nbsp;with the trial &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;cases because of the respondent's retention &nbsp;of the documents and papers which were his &nbsp;evidence in &nbsp;said Civil Cases Nos. 151, 152 and 153, the cases were dismissed without prejudice (Annexes I, &nbsp;J, K). </p> <p align="JUSTIFY">On 28 May 1959, the complainant Gervacio Dauz, filed in this &nbsp;Court a petition, dated and verified on the &nbsp;12th day of December &nbsp;1958, charging the respondent with malpractice and &nbsp;praying for his disbarment &nbsp;or suspension. </p> <p align="JUSTIFY">The &nbsp;charges &nbsp;are &nbsp;(1) &nbsp;respondent's &nbsp;refusal, &nbsp; without cause, to return &nbsp;or &nbsp;surrender the &nbsp;documents &nbsp;above referred &nbsp;to unless &nbsp;his attorney's fees be &nbsp;paid first; &nbsp;(2) laxity in the &nbsp;performance of his duties by asking for &nbsp;and agreeing to &nbsp;numerous postponements &nbsp;of &nbsp;the trial of the cases entrusted to &nbsp;him, to the damage and prejudice of his client; (3) an attempt by the &nbsp; respondent &nbsp;to induce the complainant's common-law wife to execute an affidavit and state therein that the complainant &nbsp;intended to &nbsp;kill the respondent if the latter would &nbsp;not return &nbsp;the &nbsp;documents; &nbsp;and &nbsp;failing in this attempt, the &nbsp;respondent succeeded &nbsp;in inducing for a consideration the complainant's common-law &nbsp;wife to &nbsp;run away with the &nbsp;trunk belonging to the &nbsp;complainant "containing valuables relative to his business" (Annex &nbsp;G); &nbsp;and &nbsp;(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;conspiring &nbsp;with &nbsp;the Municipal Treasurer &nbsp;of Kidapawan, Cotabato, to prosecute him (complainant) &nbsp;criminally, for his failure to &nbsp;pay his municipal license for the 2nd to the 4th quarters of 1958 (Annex H).</p> <p align="JUSTIFY">On &nbsp;28 October 1959, the &nbsp;respondent filed his answer denying the charges. &nbsp;&nbsp;On 30 October, this Court referred the case to the Solicitor General for investigation, report and recommendation. &nbsp;The Solicitor General in turn referred &nbsp;the case to the Provincial Fiscal &nbsp;of&nbsp; Cotabato for investigation.</p> <p align="JUSTIFY">On 17 December 1959, the day set for the investigation, both parties appeared; but the &nbsp;complainant moved for continuance &nbsp;on the ground that his witnesses were indisposed &nbsp;and his attorney was in Manila attending to some cases.</p> <p align="JUSTIFY">On &nbsp;18 January 1960, &nbsp;the &nbsp;complainant wrote &nbsp;to the Solicitor General asking that the Provincial Fiscal of Davao be assigned to conduct the investigation because his life was being threatened &nbsp;by the respondent. &nbsp;In support of &nbsp;his petition, the complainant &nbsp;attached a copy of an anonymous letter where he was warned that his life would be &nbsp;in danger should &nbsp;he appear &nbsp;in Kidapawan &nbsp;for the investigation. &nbsp;On 3 February, counsel for the complainant wrote to the investigator asking for another continuance of the investigation &nbsp;set for &nbsp;4 February, &nbsp;for the reason &nbsp;that he &nbsp;was to appear at the hearing &nbsp;of &nbsp;a &nbsp;civil case in the Court of &nbsp;First Instance of Davao. He also alleged that the petition for assignment of the &nbsp;Provincial Fiscal of Davao to conduct the investigation &nbsp;had not yet been acted upon by the Solicitor General.</p> <p align="JUSTIFY">Acting upon the petition of the &nbsp;complainant for assignment of the Provincial Fiscal &nbsp;of Davao &nbsp;to &nbsp;conduct the investigation, &nbsp;the &nbsp;investigator &nbsp; ruled that &nbsp;a mere &nbsp;anonymous letter informing &nbsp;the complainant that his &nbsp;life would be in danger &nbsp;should he appear at &nbsp;the investigation was not sufficient to justify &nbsp;his &nbsp;petition, &nbsp;the place of &nbsp;the investigation being Cotabato Gity, &nbsp;and &nbsp;not Kidapawan where the complainant's life was allegedly in &nbsp;danger.</p> <p align="JUSTIFY"> After failure &nbsp;of the &nbsp;complainant &nbsp;or his counsel to appear on the &nbsp;4th of February &nbsp;1960, the day &nbsp;set for &nbsp;the resumption of the investigation, the investigator heard the testimony of Atty. Juan &nbsp;Sibag, Datu Hadji &nbsp;Bagundang, Mario &nbsp;Palmones, Sr., and Justice &nbsp;of &nbsp;the Peace &nbsp;Felipe Eleosida of Kidapawan, Cotabato, presented by the respondent.</p> <p align="JUSTIFY">Upon the admissions made by &nbsp;the &nbsp; respondent in his answer and the evidence presented during the investigation, the investigator &nbsp; recommended the dismissal of the complaint. &nbsp;The &nbsp;Solicitor General is, &nbsp;however, &nbsp; of the opinion that the respondent violated his lawyer's oath by refusing without &nbsp;cause to return the documents entrusted to him in connection with the cases in &nbsp;which his service as attorney had been &nbsp;engaged unless his attorney's fees be paid first; and was lax or remiss in the performance of his &nbsp;duties &nbsp;by &nbsp;asking for &nbsp;and &nbsp;agreeing to numerous postponements of the hearing of &nbsp;the cases entrusted to him to the &nbsp;prejudice of his client's interest, and recommends &nbsp;that the respondent be reprimanded with &nbsp;a warning that a &nbsp;repetition &nbsp; of the &nbsp;acts &nbsp;or conduct &nbsp;complained of will be dealt &nbsp;with more severely. &nbsp;&nbsp;As to the other charges, the Solicitor &nbsp;General believes &nbsp;that &nbsp;there is &nbsp;no sufficient evidence to prove or support them. </p> <p align="JUSTIFY">The &nbsp;fact &nbsp; that the hearing of the cases had been &nbsp;postponed &nbsp;several times not all upon &nbsp;the petition of the respondent because &nbsp;it was also continued upon &nbsp;petition of the adverse party and in &nbsp;several instances &nbsp;upon joint motion of the parties is not enough to support the charge of laxity &nbsp;m the performance by &nbsp;the &nbsp;respondent of his duties &nbsp;as &nbsp; attorney.</p> <p align="JUSTIFY">Likewise, the refusal of &nbsp;the &nbsp;respondent to return the documents or receipts &nbsp;that had &nbsp;come into his possession as attorney, whose professional service had been engaged by the complainant to bring &nbsp;the action against the latter's debtors, &nbsp;may not be the proper &nbsp;conduct, but is not devoid of justification because the respondent &nbsp;believed he was entitled to retain them &nbsp;unless his &nbsp;fees agreed &nbsp;upon in writing &nbsp;be paid first. After requiring upon motion the respondent &nbsp;"to show cause why a <em>sub-poena duces tecum</em> &nbsp;should not be &nbsp;issued for his &nbsp;appearance &nbsp;in court relative to &nbsp;the documents in his possession" &nbsp;the Justice of the &nbsp;Peace, &nbsp;in whose court the collection cases &nbsp;had been filed, denied the motion for reconsideration &nbsp;of &nbsp; the &nbsp;order filed &nbsp;by the complainant. &nbsp;So &nbsp;that &nbsp;if the Justice of the Peace was of &nbsp;the opinion that the &nbsp;respondent &nbsp;could not retain possession or withhold production or presentation of &nbsp;the documents, he could have issued such &nbsp;<em>sub-poena duces tecum</em>, and if &nbsp;disobeyed by the respondent, &nbsp;could have punished &nbsp;him for &nbsp;contempt. Nothing appears to have been &nbsp;done further &nbsp;in the premises. According to the complaint &nbsp;(par. 9) &nbsp;the Justice &nbsp;of the Peace refused to &nbsp;issue the <em>subpoena duces tecum</em>. If such &nbsp;refusal &nbsp;by the Justice &nbsp;of &nbsp;the Peace was &nbsp;an error, the complainant should have appealed &nbsp;from the order of dismissal without prejudice &nbsp;of the complaints, and as such order of &nbsp; dismissal is &nbsp;vacated &nbsp;after &nbsp;the &nbsp;appeal had &nbsp;been &nbsp;perfected and the cases would be tried <em>de novo</em> in and by the Court of First Instance, the complainant could have renewed, &nbsp;repeated or &nbsp;reiterated &nbsp;his motion for &nbsp;the issuance &nbsp;of a <em>sub-poena duces tecum.</em> &nbsp;This the complainant &nbsp;or his &nbsp;attorney failed to do.</p> <p align="JUSTIFY">In view of the foregoing, the charges &nbsp;preferred against Attorney Napoleon O. Fontanosa by &nbsp;Gervacio &nbsp;Dauz are dismissed.</p> <p align="JUSTIFY"><em>Bengzon, C.J., Bautista Angelo, &nbsp;Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala, </em>and <em>Makalintal, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
