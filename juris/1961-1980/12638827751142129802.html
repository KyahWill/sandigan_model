				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is <span class="GramE">a litigation</span> over a parcel of <span class="SpellE">cornland</span> with an area of seventeen thousand square meters
located at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Tanuru</span>, <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> assessed in the name of <span class="SpellE">Celestina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gumabay</span> in the sum of three hundred pesos according
to Tax Declaration No. 17548-a dated <st1:date year="1956" day="24" month="8">August
 24, 1956</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A)<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She</span> paid the realty taxes on the said
lot for the years 1948 to 1956 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">B and B-1).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="3" month="3">March 3, 1960</st1:date>
<span class="SpellE">Celestina</span> <span class="SpellE">Gumabay</span> sued
Juliana <span class="SpellE">Baralin</span>, Santiago <span class="SpellE">Bunagan</span>,
Loreto <span class="SpellE">Bunagan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>
Mamba, <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> <span class="SpellE">Catabay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Arcadio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maggay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lupo</span> <span class="SpellE">Guiyab</span> and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Calimaran</span> in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> to recover possession of the said land.</p>

<p class="BODY">She alleged that the defendants forcibly entered the land on <st1:date year="1959" day="5" month="8">August 5, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She asked that, being poor and without means
to pay the docket fee, she be allowed to sue as a pauper litigant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court allowed her to sue <u>in forma
<span class="SpellE">pauperis</span></u> (11 Record on Appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that,
inasmuch as it alleged a cause of action for forcible entry, which occurred
within one year before the complaint was filed, the Court of First Instance had
no jurisdiction over the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should
be filed in the proper inferior court (Sec. 1, Rule 72, 1940 Rules of Court,
now sec. 1, Rule 70; <span class="SpellE">secs</span>. 44 and 88, Judiciary Law;
Art. 1147 [1], Civil Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">Without awaiting the resolution of that motion, <span class="SpellE">Celestina</span> <span class="SpellE">Gumabay</span> filed an
amended complaint wherein she alleged that the defendants claimed to be the
owners of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She transformed her
forcible entry action into an action to quiet title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A copy of that amended complaint was
personally served on defendants' counsel on <st1:date year="1960" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1960</st1:date> (28 Record on Appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court in its order of <st1:date year="1960" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1960</st1:date> admitted the amended complaint, ordered the
defendants to answer it, and denied the motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, a copy of that order was sent to the
defendants' counsel on <st1:date year="1960" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1960</st1:date>
only by ordinary mail.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Celestina</span> in her motion of <st1:date year="1960" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1960</st1:date> asked that the
defendants be declared in default for not having answered her amended
complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants opposed the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They denied having received a copy of the
court's order denying their motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They prayed that the plaintiff be ordered to serve upon them the amended
complaint or that a period be fixed within which they should answer it.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court in its order of <st1:date year="1960" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1960</st1:date> denied plaintiff’s motion and directed the
defendants to answer the amended complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A copy of that order was served on defendants' counsel by registered
mail on <st1:date year="1960" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1960</st1:date> (32
Record on Appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants did not answer the amended complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At plaintiff's instance, the lower court in
its order of <st1:date year="1960" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1960</st1:date>
declared them in default and commissioned the clerk of court to receive <span class="SpellE">Celestina</span> <span class="SpellE">Gumabay's</span> evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the <u>ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span></u> hearing, <span class="SpellE">Celestina</span> testified that the land in question was donated
to her by her father at the time of her marriage; that her father had possessed
that land since she was a child (she was forty-eight years old in 1960 when she
testified); that the land was cultivated by his tenants, Mateo <span class="SpellE">Luyun</span> and the latter's two sons; that the land was planted
to corn and tobacco; that on August 5, 1959 the defendants entered the land and
harvested the corn crop over the opposition of her tenants; that the defendants
harvested five carts of corn and took four rolls of barbed wire, and that the
defendants persisted in working on the land.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court in its decision declared <span class="SpellE">Celestina</span>
<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Gumabay</span></span><span class="GramE"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>the</span> owner of the land and ordered the
defendants to vacate it, restore its possession to her, and to pay her damages
in the sum of P620 plus P250 as attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">A copy of that decision was received by defendants' counsel on <st1:date year="1960" day="6" month="9">September 6, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1960" day="5" month="10">October
 5, 1960</st1:date> defendants' counsel filed a petition for relief praying
that the order of default and judgment by default be set aside and that their
answer be admitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They explained that
their failure to answer the amended complaint was due to the mistake and
neglect of their two lawyers.</p>

<p class="BODY">They attached to their motion a copy of Tax Declaration No.
18252-a in the name of <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Barlin</span>
(not a defendant herein) dated September 30, 1957 which refers to a parcel of
land with an area of twelve hectares located at Barrio <span class="SpellE"><u>Maddarulug</u></span>,
<span class="SpellE">Enrile</span> (the disputed land is located at Barrio <span class="SpellE"><u>Tanuru</u></span> and its area is only 1.76 hectares).</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court denied the petition for relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants appealed to the Court of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That Court in its resolution of
<st1:date year="1969" day="10" month="6">June 10, 1969</st1:date> elevated the
case to this Court because the appeal involves only legal issues (CA-G. R. No.
29202-R).</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants contend that the lower court erred in not
dismissing the original complaint, in admitting the amended complaint, in
assuming that it acquired jurisdiction over their persons on the basis of the
amended complaint even without service of new summons, in declaring them in
default, and in not granting them relief from the judgment by default.</p>

<p class="BODY">Those contentions cannot be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The original complaint for forcible entry
contained the basic prayer "that the plaintiff be declared the absolute
owner of the land in question".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
relief was retained in the amended complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The only difference between the original and amended complaints is that
the latter contained the additional allegation that the "defendants are
now asserting and claiming title and absolute ownership over the land in
question which is adverse and against the interest of the plaintiff".</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiff explained that she had to amend her complaint in
order that the "real matter in dispute", which is "the question
of ownership", may be "determined in a single proceeding, thereby
avoiding multiplicity of suits" (16 Record on Appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the trial court's order admitting the amended
complaint is in consonance with the object of the Rules of Court to assist the
parties in obtaining just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action
and proceeding (Sec. 2, Rule 1).</p>

<p class="BODY">To dismiss the original complaint and to require the plaintiff to
file another action to quiet title would have resulted in a circuitous,
dilatory and expensive proceeding which, in the case of a pauper litigant like <span class="SpellE">Celestina</span> <span class="SpellE">Gumabay</span>, should have
been avoided, as it was prudently avoided by the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the same reasons, defendants’ theory that new summons should
have been issued for the amended complaint is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court had already acquired
jurisdiction over the persons of the defendants when they were served with summons
on the basis of the original complaint and when they appeared and filed a
motion to dismiss.</p>

<p class="BODY">They were personally served with a copy of the amended
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court ordered <span class="GramE">them</span> two times to answer that complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under those circumstances, there is no basis
for defendants’ contention that the trial court should have ordered the
issuance of new summons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That would be a
supererogation or making a fetish of a technicality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Peng</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Custodio</span>, 111 Phil. 382,
385; Republic vs. <span class="SpellE">Ker</span> &amp; Co., Ltd., <span class="GramE">64 O.G. 3761,</span> 18 SCRA 207).</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants on page 9 of their brief cites the comment of
Chief Justice Moran that "if the defendant had already appeared in court
in response to the first summons, so that he was already in court when the
amended complaint was filed, then ordinary service of that pleading upon him,
personally or by mail, would be sufficient, and no new summons need be served
upon him".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1 Moran's Comments on
the Rules of Court, 1970 Ed., p. 441).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That comment shows that defendants' contention is wrong.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants’ two lawyers were given plenty of time to answer the
amended complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their failure to
answer was inexcusable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer
attached to their petition for relief from judgment does not contain any
meritorious defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">Therefore, to set aside the judgment by default and grant a new
trial would be an idle ceremony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
is no probability that defendants' evidence would justify a reversal of the
judgment by default (<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Yulo</span>
vs. Chua <span class="SpellE">Chuco</span>, 87 Phil. 448, 449; Gonzales vs. <span class="SpellE">Amon</span>, 98 Phil. 587; Miranda vs. <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>,
92 Phil. 290, 294; <span class="SpellE">Baquiran</span> vs. Court of Appeals, 112
Phil. 764, 771).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the lower court's judgment is affirmed with
costs against the defendants-appellants.</p>
