				<BR><STRONG>BARREDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">Appeal from the decision
dated September 11, 1964 of the Court of First Instance of Abra, in its Civil
Case No. 382, denominated as a case </span>of quo warranto and certiorari,
"declaring (herein respondent-appellant) <span style="">Jorge Barreras' appointment null and void and declaring (herein
petitioner-</span>appellee) Manuel V. Festejo <span style="">the rightful holder and incum­</span>bent of the position of Assistant
Provincial Branch Manager of the PVTA <span style="">(Philippine
Virginia</span> Tobacco<span style=""> </span>Administration)
<span style="">in </span>Abra <span style="">and, as such, entitled to remain with all the corresponding emoluments,
rights and </span>privileges <span style="">of that </span>office
<span style="">until he resigns, is removed for cause,
or the said posi­</span>tion becomes vacant as provided by and in accordance
with law."</p>

<p class="BODY">The following facts are undisputed:</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 13, 1961, petitioner, who is a member of the Philippine
Bar and as such, a civil service eligible, <span style="">was </span>appointed Tobacco Inspector II of the PVTA with an annual
salary of P3,108.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over a year
thereafter, or on July 30, 1962, <span style="">his </span>salary
was increased to P3,264 per annum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subse­quently,
he was permanently appointed PVTA Legal Officer with an increased salary of
P3,792 per annum effective Jan­uary 1, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On July 1, 1963, he was extended another ap­pointment, this time as
Assistant Provincial Branch Manager of the PVTA in Abra with an annual salary
of P4,404.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This appointment was approved
by the Commissioner of Civil Service "<u>under Sec. 24 (c) of Republic
Act<span style="">&nbsp; </span></u><u><span style="">No. </span>2260</u>."</p>

<p class="BODY">Nearly five months after petitioner's such last appoint­ment, the
General Manager of the PVTA, respondent Eduardo Bananal informed the said
petitioner, in a letter dated Nov­ember 27, 1963, that his services as
Assistant Provincial Branch Manager would be terminated at the close of office
hours on December 31, 1963.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meanwhile, on December 16, 1963, respondent Barreras, also
a member of the bar, was appointed to replace him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This appointment was confirmed by the PVTA
Board of Directors under its Resolution No. 355, <span style="">Series </span>of 1963, and <span style="">approved
by the Commissioner of Civil Service also <u>under section</u></span><u> 24 (c)
of R.A. 2260</u><span style=""> </span>on June 29,
1964, on which date petitioner was still holding office.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since respondent Barreras assumed office by virtue of said
appointment, on July 2, 1964, petitioner instituted a special civil action for
quo warranto and certiorari with preliminary injunction in the lower court
primarily question­ing the legality thereof and seeking to enjoin him from fur­ther
exercising the duties and functions of the office.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an order dated July 25, 1964, the lower court denied
petitioner's plea for a writ of preliminary injunction, but on September 11,
1964, after conducting a hearing on the<span style="">
</span>merits, it rendered the decision favorable to the petitioner which <span style="">is </span>now under review.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents-appellants contend that said decision should be
reversed because the lower court erred in holding that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) "there was no vacancy to which
respondent-appellant Barreras could be appointed"; (2) "a
non-eligible may not be replaced by another non-eligible"; and (3)
"an appointee with <span style="">provisional
appointment cannot be replaced until after </span>30 days from receipt by the appointing
officer of the certifi­cation of eligibles".</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no need to pass on all these assigned errors
separately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pivotal issue involved
in all of them is simple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>May the
services of an appointee to a position in the civil service who <span style="">is </span>a civil service eligible, although
not for the said position, and who, therefore, is appointed under Section 24(c)
of Republic Act 2260, the Civil Service Act of 1959, as a
"provisional" employee, be terminated at the pleasure of the
appointing authority and without his consent?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This question is not new.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In as
many occasions as it has been raised before, this Court has invariably ruled
that a "provisional appointment is good until re­placement by a civil
service eligible and in no case be­yond thirty (30) days from the date of
receipt by the appointing officer of the certificate of eligibles."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Accordingly, it is evident that the letter of November 27, 1963 sent by
appellant Bananal to petitioner advising him that his services were being
terminated as of December 31, 1963 is illegal and cannot have any effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no basis nor logic <span style="">in </span>appellants' contention that there is no
difference between a temporary appointment under Section 24(d) of the Civil
Service Act which reads thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Temporary Appointment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- A person may receive a temporary appointment to a position needed only
for a limited period not exceeding six months, provi­ded that preference in
filling such po<span style="">sition</span><span style=""> </span>be given to persons on appro­priate
eligible lists."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and a provisional appointment under
Section 24(c) which says:</p>

<blockquote>"Provisional Appointment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- A provisional appointment may be issued upon the prior authorization
of the Commissioner in accordance with the provisions of this Act and the rules
<span style="">and </span>standards promulgated in
pursuance thereto to a person who has not qualified in an appropriate
examination but who otherwise meets the requirements for appointment to a
regular position in the competitive <span style="">service,
</span>whenever a <span style="">vacancy </span>occurs
and the filling thereof is necessary in the interest of the service and there
is no appropriate register of eligibles at the time of appointment."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">According
to appellants, "while they may be different in the degree of permanence,
in that temporary appointments are generally for and within specified periods
of time, their nature as being subject to termination by the appoint­ing power
remains the </span><span style="">same." </span><span style="">Such contention is untenable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Even from a cursory reading of these two provisions, one can
readily see that each of <span style="">them </span>contemplates
an entirely different situation from the other.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">Indeed, as </span>pointed out by
His Honor, the trial judge, it is <span style="">contrary
</span>to the ordinary rules of legal hermeneutics to assume <span style="">that </span>the lawmakers intended these two
separate <span style="">provisions </span>in a
seemingly single enumeration of categories of <span style="">appointments </span>to have the same import or significance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereas <span style="">a
tempo­rary </span>appointment <span style="">is </span>designed to fill "a position needed
only for a limited period not exceeding <span style="">six
months," a pro</span>visional appointment, on the other hand, is intended <span style="">for </span>the contingency that "a
vacancy occurs and the filling there­of is necessary in the interest of the
service and there is no appropriate register of eligibles at the time <span style="">of appoint­</span>ment." In other words,
the reason for extending a provi­sional appointment is not because there is an
occasional work or job to be done which is expected to be finished in not more
than six months but because the interest of the service requires that certain
works be done or functions be performed by a regular employee, only that there
is no one with appropriate eligibility, who can be appointed to do it, hence
any other eligible may be appointed to perform such works or functions in the
meanwhile that a suitable eli­gible does not qualify for the position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is clearly implied by the mandate of the
provision that a provisional appointment may be extended only to "a person
who has not qualified in an appropriate examination but who otherwise meets the
requirements for appointment to a regular posi­tion in the competitive
service," meaning one who must anyway be a civil service eligible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, again, in the case of <span style="">a </span>temporary
appointment, all that the law enjoins is that "preference in filling such
posi­tion be given to persons on appropriate eligible lists." And merely
giving preference, of course, presupposes that even a non-eligible may be
appointed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, under
this provision, even if the appointee has the re­quired civil service
eligibility, his appointment <span style="">is </span>still temporary, simply because such is the nature of the
work <span style="">to </span>be
done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decisions<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="color: red;"> </span>cited by appellants are not <span style="">in </span>point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They all refer
to temporary appointments as such.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None
of them involves a provisional appointment like the one herein in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants also rely on the following indorsement of the
Commissioner of Civil Service: </p>

<blockquote>"Under the Civil Service Law and rules, <u>temporary </u><u><span style="">employees</span></u><span style=""> </span>are those appointed pursuant to the provisions of Section 682
of the Revised Adminis­trative Code, as amended, (<u>now </u><u><span style="">Section<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>24(c) of </span>Republic Act No. 2260</u>) or paragraph 3, Rule VI of
the Civil Ser­vice Rules (now Section 24(d) of Re­public Act No. 2260).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the pro­visions of Rule VI, 'whenever
the work to be done <span style="">is, in </span>the
judgment of the Commissioner (of Civil Service), tem­porary in character, he
may authorize temporary employment, giving prefer­ence to eligibles if
available, which employment may continue until the com­pletion of the work.'
Emergency, seasonal, or casual employees in the clas­sified service fall under
this provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A casual employee is
therefore legally and actually <span style="">a </span>temporary em­ployee because both may be
separated from the service at any time with or without cause." (See 3rd
Indorsement, Civil Service Commission, November 2, 1959).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Italics supplied) </blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Such reliance is unavailing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Much as We would want to accord the construction given by the
Commissioner of Civil Service the consideration due it as coming from the execu­tive
office established by law to enforce the civil service system, We cannot avoid
the conclusion that the foregoing view of the Commissioner is not in accordance
with the spi­rit of Section 24 which precisely provides for different
categories of appointments and expressly differentiates <span style="">a </span>provisional from a temporary <span style="">one.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>True it is </span>that the te­nures created by both appointments are
terminable by the appointing power, but <span style="">it
is </span>clear that whereas that under a temporary appointment may be
terminated at pleasure because the appointment does not involve any element of
permanence, that pursuant to a provisional one <span style="">is </span>terminable only upon the certification of an appropriate
eligible, since such appointment takes into account that the appointee should
necessarily be an eligible who <span style="">is </span>supposed to have a per­manent appointment
and the nature of the work is such that only eligibles may perform the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it will be noted that
the parity between the two mentioned appointments drawn in the above
indorsement appears more as something that can be assumed rather than as a well
studied conclu­sion, no reason at all being given why such parity is claimed to
exist.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor can respondents call to their aid, the 2nd indorse­ment of
the same Commissioner of July 18, 1962, cited in their brief, (pp. 7-8) and
which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Appointment proposed in a temporary or acting capacity and
those approved by this office as <span style="">provisional </span><span style="">under </span><span style="">Sec. </span>24(c) of R.A. 2260 or Sec. 682 of the Revised Adminis­trative
Code are temporary appointments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
enunciated by the Supreme Court in the case of Cuadra vs. Cordova, 54 O.G. 8063
and Mendez vs. Ganzon, 53 O.G. 4835, the essence of such appointment lie 'in
/their/ temporary character and /their/ terminability by <span style="">the </span><span style="">appointing </span><span style="">power.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>And one who bears such an appointment cannot complain if it is
termi­nated at <u><span style="">a moment's </span>notice</u>.'
Likewise, ap­pointments to positions which are confiden­tial in nature 'are
terminable at the will of the appointing officer, except where the law which
creates such positions provides at the same time a fixed term of office for the
incumbent thereof, in which case the incum­bent may only be removed for cause
as provided by law.' (CSC, 3rd Indorsement, March 8, 1960.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As to appointments proposed as perma­nent but approved by
this Office <span style="">in
</span>an Acting capacity, attention <span style="">is </span>invited to a 2nd In­dorsement of this
Office to the Director of Plant Industry dated April 3, 1962, in which it was
stated that 'In the case of Mendez vs. Ganzon, <span style="">53 O.G. </span>4835, <span style="">the Supreme Court, how­ever, ruled that
appointments in acting capa­city are </span><span style="">temporary in </span><span style="">character and </span><span style="">terminable </span>at
the pleasure of the appointing power so in the light of such opinion this
Office <span style="">has </span>held
that while certification of eligibles <span style="">is not </span><span style="">mandatory in such cases </span><span style="">the appointing power nevertheless has discretion to
replace such acting appointee </span>with a more qualified candidate who meets
all the requirements deemed necessary and proper by the appointing
authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, since the
appointment was not approved under the provisions of Section 24(b) of Re­public
Act 2260, it is not permanent and regular for purposes of compulsory insurance
pursuant to Section 4(a) Commonwealth Act 186, as amended, with­out prejudice
however to the continua­tion of any previous policy served un­der regular and
permanent appointment."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The cases of Cuadra vs. Cordova, 103
Phil. 391 and Mendez vs. Ganzon, 101 Phil. 48, referred to by the Commissioner,
like all the other cases cited by appellants involved appointments which are
not provisional but temporary.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is Our conclusion, therefore, that the termination of the
services of appellee Festejo <span style="">is </span>illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Corres­pondingly, the appointment of
appellant Barreras cannot stand.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of the lower court is hereby
affirmed with costs against appellants.</p>
