				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (RFC) now the Development
Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
<span style="">granted </span>a
loan to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Quirico</span> del Mar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As of <st1:date year="1957" day="26" month="3">March
 <span style="">26, </span>1957</st1:date>,
the amount due on the principal balance of said loan plus in­terest was
P4,423.04.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:state><st1:place>Del</st1:place></st1:state>
Mar, on such date, offered to pay the same with a <span class="SpellE">backpay</span>
acknowledgment certificate pursuant to Republic Act 897.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The RFC refused to accept said certificate as
payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:state><st1:place>Del</st1:place></st1:state>
Mar filed suit to com­pel it to accept the same (Civil Case No. R-5324, CFI of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>), and RFC was therein ordered to accept <st1:state><st1:place>Del</st1:place></st1:state>
Mar's <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> certificate in payment for his debt to
RFC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the decision in said case
became final.</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:state><st1:place>Del</st1:place></st1:state> Mar's aforesaid
<span class="SpellE">backpay</span> certificate was in the amount of P20,000.00,
more or less.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In accepting it as payment
of his obligation of P4,423.04, RFC discounted the certificate at the rate of
2% per annum in relation to its thirty-year maturity period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As of the date it was offered for payment,
315 months remained before it would mature.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to <span class="SpellE">RFC's</span> computation, at the
discount rate of 2% per annum, the discount for an obli­gation of P4,423.04,
with 315 months to go before date of maturity, is P4,888.62, resulting in a
total of P9,311.66<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">*</span></span></span></a>
to be assigned to RFC under the certificate to pay the aforesaid loan.</p>

<p class="BODY">Taking issue with <span class="SpellE">RFC's</span> power to charge
a discount on his certificate, <st1:state><st1:place>Del</st1:place></st1:state>
Mar filed another suit in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
against RFC, on <st1:date year="1960" day="21" month="1">January <span style="">21, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>to compel acceptance of his
certificate <u>with­out</u> discount.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>RFC opposed the same (Civil Case No. R-6455).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court, on June <span style="">28, 1963, </span>dismissed the peti­tion on the ground that Republic
Act <span style="">897 </span>authorized the charging
of 2% per annum discount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Del Mar
appealed to Us.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant now contends that the RFC is barred by the rule of
omnibus motion (Section 10, Rule <span style="">9, </span>now
Sec. <span style="">8, </span>Rule 15, Rules of Court)
from raising the point of dis­count because it did not do so in his first suit,
Civil Case No. <span style="">R-5324.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>This is untenable, since the right of
RFC to charge a discount was not at issue in said case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated, <st1:state><st1:place>Del</st1:place></st1:state>
Mar questioned said right only in the pre­sent case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The statute in question is Republic Act <span style="">897 </span>amend­ing Section 2 of Republic Act 304, to read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> [U]<span class="SpellE">pon</span>
application and subject to such rules and regulations as may be approved <span style="">by </span>the Secretary of Finance a
certificate of indebtedness may be issued by the Treasurer of the Philippines
covering the whole or a part of the total salaries or wa­ges the right to which
has been duly acknow­ledged and recognized, provided that the face value of
such certificate of indebtedness shall not exceed the amount that the applicant
may need for the payment of (1) obligations subsist­ing at the time of the
approval of this amend­atory Act for which the applicant may directly be liable
to the Government or to any of its branches or instrumentalities, or the corpo­rations
owned or controlled by the Government, or to any citizen of the Philippines, or
to any association or corporation organized un­der the laws of the Philippines,
who may be willing to accept the same for such set­tlement; (2) his taxes; <span style="">(3) </span>government hos­pital bills of the
applicant; (4) lands purchased or leased or to be purchased or leased by him
from the public domain; and (5) any amount received by the applicant as
gratuity or pension which he has to refund to the Government or to any of its
branches or instrumentalities:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>,
<u>further</u>, <span style="">That such settlement
shall be effected by <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> on the
instrument:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>, <u>fur</u>­<u>thermore</u>,
That no certificate shall be trans­ferred or ceded by <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>
more than once, nor at a discount rate exceeding two <u>per</u> <u>centum</u> <u>per</u>
<u>annum</u>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><u><span style="">Provided</span></u><span style="">, <u>furthermore</u>, </span><span style="">That
</span><span style="">in the case of members of</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">the Philippine Army and of recognized
guerrilla forces and the Philippine Scouts herein mentioned who may apply for
recognition of their back pay salaries, wages, <u>per</u> </span><u><span style="">diems</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">and/or allowances under the provisions of
this amendatory Act, such back pay acknowledgment shall certify that it shall
be redeemed by the Government of the Philippines within thirty years from the
date of its issuance without interest de­pending upon the availability of funds
which shall be determined by the Treasurer of the Philippines:"<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is rather obvious,
therefore, that the law per­mits a discount rate of not exceeding 2% on a
non-nego­tiable <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> certificate, such as in this
case, where the same is indorsed to pay an obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason for the discount is equally
clear:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the certificate is not yet due
and payable; it matures in thirty years from date of issue; until then, it is
not fully worth its face value.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Redemption thereof <u>at maturity</u> does not involve a discount
because by then it will have reached its full value stated on its face; it will
have matured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The present case, however,
does not involve redemption but <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> of the
certificate before maturity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
accepting said certificate prior to its due date, RFC is entitled to charge a
discount not exceeding that stated by the law, 2% per annum.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant's contention
that there should simply </span>be <span style="">compensation
of the debts involved, is not tenable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For compensation applies only where both debts are </span>due (Art. <span style="">1279[3], </span>Civil Code); in this case, <st1:state><st1:place>Del</st1:place></st1:state>
Mar's <span style="">debt to </span>RFC <span style="">is </span>due; but the National Government's liability
to redeem the <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> certificate <span style="">is </span>not yet due.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from <span style="">is </span>hereby affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
