				<H3>DATU BLAH SINSUAT, PETITIONER, VS. SALIPADA K.
PENDATUN, COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, AND THE PROVINCIAL BOARD OF CANVASSERS OF
COTABATO, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ZALDIVAR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A petition for the issuance of writs of certiorari, mandamus and
prohibition, with prayer for the immediate issuance of a writ of preliminary
injunction, filed by petitioner Datu Blah Sinsuat against respondent Salipa­da
K. Pendatun, the Commission on Elections -- herein­after referred to as
COMELEC, and the Provincial Board of Canvassers of Cotabato -- hereinafter
referred to as BOARD.</p>

<p class="BODY">The action for certiorari seeks to annul and set aside the
resolution of the Comelec, known as Case Reso­lution No. RR-692, and its
accompanying minute resolution, both dated January 19, 1970, in Case No. 692
entitled "Datu Blah Sinsuat vs. Salipada K. Pendatun"<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
insofar as said resolutions sustain the actions or the Board (1) in rejecting
and excluding from the canvass 22 elect­ion returns from 22 precincts located
in the municipa­lities of Dinaig, Ampatuan, Upi and Maganoy, province of
Cotabato; and (2) in including in the canvass 10 election returns from 10
precincts located in the municipalities of Datu Piang and Pikit, also in the
province of Cotabato, particularly the election return from precinct No. 15 of
Pikit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The action for prohibition seeks to prohibit res­pondent Comelec
from enforcing the two resolutions men­tioned in the preceding paragraph, and
also to prohibit respondent Board from giving effect to said resolutions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The action for mandamus seeks to compel respondent Board to count
the 22 election returns that were rejected by the Board, or, "in the
alternative, to compel respond­ent Commission to summon the Members of the
Boards of Election Inspectors in these precincts and to order the ballot boxes
in question to be brought before it so that the true result of the election can
be determined by re­sorting to the ballot box copies of the election returns or
to the Tally Sheets, or even to counting the votes in the ballots"<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>;
and to compel the respondent Board to reject the 10 election returns that were
included in the canvass, hereinbefore adverted to, or, in the alternative, to
order respondent Comelec to order the boards of elect­ion inspectors in the
precincts concerned to prepare genuine election returns, and in the particular
case of Precinct No. 15 of Pikit "to order that the ballot box copy be
retrieved for the purpose of determining the true result of the count it that
is possible"<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner finally prays that after what he seeks in his
petition had been granted by this Court, and had been complied with, that
respondent Board be directed to proclaim the winner as a result of the canvass.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the filing of the verified petition, this Court issued an
order requiring the respondents to answer and at the same time restraining the
Comelec from enforcing its resolutions of <st1:date year="1970" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1970</st1:date> (Case Resolution No. RR-692, and its
accompanying minute resolution), and also restraining respondent Board from
proceeding with the canvass and proclamation as directed in those resolutions.</p>

<p class="BODY">In due time respondents Pendatun and Comelec filed their answers
to the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Board filed
a manifestation, stating that its situation in the present case is similar to
that of respondent Comelec, and that it elects not to file an answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their answers, both respondents Pendatun
and Comelec insist in the correctness of the rulings and orders of the Comelec
in the two ques­tioned resolutions.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the record We find the following facts pertinent to the
resolution of the issues involved in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the national elections held on November 11, 1969, Datu Blah
Sinsuat and Salipada K. Pendatun were the official candidates of the
Nacionalista Party and of the Liberal Party, respectively, for the office of
Representative the lone representative district of Cotabato.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were two other candidates, Apolinario
Tolentino and Leopoldo Jalandoni.</p>

<p class="BODY">By order of the Comelec, the Board canvassed the elect­ion
returns for the office of Representative at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename>Crame</st1:placename></st1:place>, <st1:city><st1:place>Quezon
  City</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
canvass started on <st1:date year="1969" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1969</st1:date>
and lasted until <st1:date year="1969" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the Board did not proclaim the
winner in view of the directive of the Comelec not to make the proclamation in
order to enable the parties to appeal to the Comelec from any ruling of the
Board relating to the inclusion or the rejection of any election return in
connection with the canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the
termination of the canvass, although no proclamation of the winner would be
made, an unofficial tabulation of the votes was made by the Board, and it
appeared that candidate Pendatun obtained 76,466 votes as against 71,492 votes
for candidate Sinsuat, or a margin of 4,974 votes in favor of the former.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the canvass was in progress, Pendatun filed petitions with
the Comelec praying, among others for the rejection of all the returns in the
municipalities of Ampatuan and Maganoy upon the ground that said returns had
been prepared at gunpoint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Comelec
restrained the Board from making any proclamation until after the peti­tions of
Pendatun shall have been resolved.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1969</st1:date>
Sinsuat filed with the Comelec a petition questioning, or appealing from, the
action of the Board in rejecting the election returns upon the ground or
statistical improbability pursuant to the doctrine enun­ciated in the case of
Lagumbay vs. Comelec, et al.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>,

<p class="BODY">In the same petition or December 11, 1969 Sinsuat also questioned,
or appealed from, the action of the Board in including in the canvass 38
election returns from 38 precincts located in the municipalities of Nuling and
Pikit, which were the copies of the election returns furnished the Board by the
Provincal Treasurer, upon the ground that the Provincial Treasurers copies were
"tampered and spurious" and different from the copies which were
"clear, clean, regular and valid" that were furnished the Comelec and
the Nacionalista Party<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The precincts in question are the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">In his petition of December 11, 1969, Sinsuat prayed that the
election returns from Dinaig, Ampatuan, Maganoy and Upi, which were rejected
upon the ground of statistical improbability be included in the canvass; and
that in lieu of the Provincial Treasurer's copies of the election re­turns for
the 23 precincts from Nuling and 15 precincts from Pikit the Comelec copies of
the election returns be included in the canvass.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 16, 1969 Sinsuat filed a "Supplemental Petition
And Appeal" also questioning, or appealing from, the action or the Board
in including in the canvass the election returns from 6 precincts of Pikit,
namely: Pre­cincts Nos. 10, 16, 27, 31, 33, and 15, upon the ground that said
returns were obviously manufactured, because it appears in those returns that
there was an excess of votes over the number of voters who voted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same supplemental petition Sinsuat
questioned, or appealed from the action of the Board in including in the
canvass 4 election returns from 4 precincts of Datu Piang, namely: Precincts
Nos. 23, 13-A, 14 and 19 upon the ground that those re­turns are statistically
improbable under the doctrine laid down in the case of Lagumbay vs. Climaco, <u>supra</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, in the same pleading Sinsuat
questioned, or appealed from, the action of the Board in rejecting the election
returns from Precincts Nos. 6 and 35 of Upi, from Precincts Nos. 4-A, 6-B, and
14 of Maganoy, and from Precinct No. 31 of Dinaig, claiming that the doctrine
in the <u>Lagumbay</u> case is not applicable to said returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the supplemental peti­tion Sinsuat also
alleged that the election return from Precinct No. 54 of M'lang was not in the
possession of the Provincial Treasurer and the Board failed to include the same
in the canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sinsuat, therefore, prayed
the Comelec to order the rejection or the election returns from precincts Nos.
10, 16, 27, 31, 33, and 15 of Pikit, and of the election returns from Precincts
Nos. 23, 13-A, 14 and 19 of Datu Piang; the inclusion of the returns from
Precincts 6 and 35 or Upi, Precincts Nos. 4-A, 6-B and 14 of Maganoy, and
Precinct 31 of Dinaig; and the production of an authen­tic copy of the return
or Precinct No. 54 of M'lang and include the same in the canvass.</p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with the supplemental petition the Comelec points
out in its resolution of January 19, 1970 that Precinct No. 6 of Upi and
Precincts Nos. 4-A, 6-B and 14 of Maganoy had already been included in
Sinsuat's original petition of December 11, 1969, and with respect to Precinct
No. 35 of Upi the Board had actually included the election return of said
precinct in its canvass<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his answer to the original petition, filed under date of <st1:date year="1969" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1969</st1:date>, Pendatun insisted
in the cor­rectness of the actions of the Board complained of by Sinsuat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, regarding the 23 election returns
from Nuling and the 15 election returns from Pikit which Sin­suat claimed to be
the Provincial Treasurer's copies which were tampered with Pendatun manifested
in his answer that he interposed no objection to the use of the Comelec copies
of the returns in the canvass if said returns appear on their faces to be
authentic<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By way of a counterclaim Pendatun reiterated
his previous petitions for the reject­ion of all the election returns from the
precincts of Am­patuan and Maganoy upon the ground that said returns were
prepared at gunpoint; and at the same time he questioned the inclusion by the
Board in the canvass of the election returns from the 21 precincts in the
municipality of Upi, namely: Precincts Nos. 12, 15-A, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23,
24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29-A, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 38, and 38-A upon the ground that
on the face of said returns the same appear to be statistically improbable
although crude altera­tions had been made to break the pattern of uniform 100%
voting to avoid the application of the doctrine in the Lagum­bay case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pendatun prayed for the dismissal of
Sinsuat's petition; and, on his counterclaim, he prayed that the elect­ions in
Maganoy and Ampatuan be declared null and void, so that all the election
returns from all the precincts in those two municipalities should be rejected;
and that the Board be ordered to reject the election returns from the precincts
in Upi mentioned in his counterclaim.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 23, 1969 Pendatun likewise filed an ans­wer to the
supplemental petition of Sinsuat, traversing the pertinent allegations
contained in said supplemental petition, and by way of special and affirmative
defenses he alleged that the supplemental petition was defective for hot having
been verified and for alleging matters which were not new and which could have
been incorporated in the original petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">A hearing was held before the Comelec on December 24, 1969 on the
petition and supplemental petition of Sinsuat and on the counterclaim of Pendatun,
which plead­ings practically partook of the nature of an appeal from the
actions taken by the Board in either including or rejecting certain election
returns during the canvass, as the case may be.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>During the hearing the Comelec examined, in the presence of the counsel
for both parties, the copies for the Provincial Treasurer of the election re­turns
for the 23 precincts of Nuling and 15 precincts of Pikit which were questioned
by Sinsuat as having been tampered with.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a result of the examination of those returns the members of the
Comelec and the counsel for both parties actually found the returns to have
been tam­pered with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Comelec,
therefore, required the product­ion of the copies of election returns for the
23 precincts of Nuling and for the 15 precincts of Pikit which were furnished
the Comelec.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Comelec examined the
Comelec copies one by one, also in the presence of the counsel for both
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Comelec found the Comelec
copies to be clean and without any alteration, and were serviceable for the
canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In open court the Comelec
promulgated an order which directed the Board to use the Comelec copies of the
election returns of the 15 precincts of Pikit and of the 23 precincts of
Nuling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order also required both
parties to file simultaneously, until <st1:date year="1969" day="26" month="12">December
 26, 1969</st1:date>, their memoranda in support of their respective petition
in connection with the petition and supplemental petition filed by
Sinsuat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order further allowed
Sinsuat to file an amended petition to include precinct No. 39 of Pikit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his amended petition Sinsuat claimed that
the Provincial Treasurer's copy of the election return for that precinct was
also tampered with and the Comelec copy should instead be used in the canvass.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the promulgation of the resolution mentioned in the
preceding paragraph, the counsel of both parties, as­sisted by the personnel of
the Comelec, made a tentative canvass to find out the result after using the
Comelec copies of the election returns from the 38 precincts located in Nuling
ahd Pikit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The tentative canvass showed
that then votes of Pendatun were reduced by 2,779, leaving him a total of
73,687; whereas the votes of Sinsuat were increased by 668, giving him a total
of 72,160 votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The margin of Pendatun
over Sinsuat was thereby reduced from 4,974 to 1,527 votes.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because of this development, that after using the Comelec copies
of the election returns from 38 precincts, above-mentioned, Pendatun still had
a margin of some 1,527 votes over Sinsuat, the members or the Comelec were of
the view that the matter regarding the application of the doctrine of
statistical improbability with regards to election return which were questioned
on that ground would be decisive. In this connection, the Comelec says:</p>

<blockquote>"Such being the turn of events as a result of the use of the
COMELEC copies for the 23 precincts of NULING and 15 precincts or PIKIT, it
became crystal clear that the question or statistical improbabi­lity especially
in its application to Prec. No. 37 of DINAIG; Prec. Nos. 13-M, 23-A and 23-M of
AMPATUAN; Prec. Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4-A, 5, 6, 6-A, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 24-A,
29 and 31 of UPI, and its non-application to Prec. Nos. 10, 16, 27, 31, 33, and
15 of PIKIT; and Prec. Nos. 13-A, 14, 19 and 23 of DATU PIANG; has become the
crux of the case, resolution of which <i>was </i>completely determina­tive of
the outcome of the elections in the lone congressional district or
Cotabato.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason, the parties
have agreed that the Commission should rule on this particular question for if
the action or the Board of Canvassers in applying the doctrine of statis­tical
improbability as enunciated in <u>Lagumbay</u> vs. <u>Climaco</u> were to be
sustained by the Commission, there would be no further need to pass on the
questions involving remaining precincts dispute nor would there be need to rule
on the counterclaim and/or appeal of PENDATUN praying for the rejection of the
returns in the munici­palities of AMPATUAN and MAGANOY and in the 21 precincts
of UPI.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thus, it had been agreed that the case be submitted for
decision on this question of statistical improbability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties were then given time to file
their respective Memorandum."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the same day, <st1:date year="1969" day="24" month="12">December
 24, 1969</st1:date>, the Comelec directed the Board to reconvene on <st1:date year="1969" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1969</st1:date> at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename>Crame</st1:placename></st1:place> and to formally recanvass the
votes oh the basis of the Comelec copies of the returns from those 38 precincts
located in Nuling ahd Pikit.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="7" month="1">January 7, 1970</st1:date>
Sinsuat filed a motion for recon­sideration or the Comelec's resolution or <st1:date year="1969" day="24" month="12">December 24, 1969</st1:date>, praying that
precinct No. 15 of Pikit be excluded there­from and/or that the Board be
ordered to reject the election return for Precinct No. 15 of Pikit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is alleged in this motion for
reconsideration that during the canvass by the Board oh <st1:date year="1969" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1969</st1:date> "it was found out that
even the Comelec copy of the return for precinct 15 of Pikit was tampered with
and appeared obviously manufactured and/or statistically improbable"<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was further alleged that counsel for
Sinsuat had vigorously objected to the admis­sion of the same but the Board had
counted and tabulated said return.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1970</st1:date>
the Comelec issued a minute reso­lution denying Sinsuat's motion for
reconsideration of the resolution of <st1:date year="1969" day="24" month="12">December

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the decision or the Comelec, as embodied in
the two foregoing resolutions, Sinsuat filed before this Court the instant
petition for certiorari, prohibition and mandamus, with preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sinsuat now urges that the Comelec erred in its ap­plication, or
non-application, as the case may be, of the doctrine of statistical
improbability as enunciated in the Lagumbay case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection We consider it necessary
to restate the doctrine, in order to find out if the Comelec had acted rightly.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court, in the Lagumbay case, has classified into two sets

appear to have obtained no vote at all.</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"It appearing therein -- contrary to all statistical
probabilities -- in the <u>first set</u>, in each precinct the number of
registered voters equalled the number of bal­lots and the number or votes
reportedly cast and tallied <u>for each and every</u> candidate of the Liberal
Party, the party in power; where­as all the candidates of the Nacionalista
Party got <u>exactly zero</u>; and in the <u>second set</u>, -- again contrary
to all statistical probabilities -- all the reported votes were for candidates
of the Liberal Party, all of whom were credited with <u>exactly the same</u>
num­ber of votes in each precinct, ranging from 240 in one precinct to 650 in
another precinct; whereas, all the candidates of the Nacionalista Party were
given <u>exactly zero</u> in all said precincts."</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">1. We find that of the 22 election returns that were declared by
the Comelec as statistically improbable, thereby sustaining the action of the
Board in rejecting them, 19 fall under the first set and 3 fall under the
second set.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those that fall under the
first set are the returns from Precincts Nos. 1, 3, 4, 4-A, 5, 8, 10, 12, 14,
15, 16, 25-A, 29 and 31 of Upi; Precincts Nos. 6-B and 14 of Maganoy; and
Precincts Nos. 13-M, 23-A and 23-M of Ampatuan.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Those that fall under the second set are the returns from Precincts Nos.
2 and 6-A of Upi and Precinct 37 or Dinaig.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Regarding these 22 election returns, the Comelec, in its Case Resolution
No. RR-692, dated <st1:date year="1970" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1970</st1:date>,
made the fol­lowing findings:</p>

<blockquote>"In the returns for 17 precincts of UPI, to wit: Prec. Nos. 1,
2, 3, 4, 4-A, 5, 6, 6-A, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 25-A, 29 and 31, SINSUAT was
credited with all the votes registered or cast in said pre­cincts as against
zero for PENDATUN.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In precincts Nos. 13-M, 23-M, and 23-A of AMPATUAN, SINSUAT
received all of the votes registered or cast in said pre­cincts as against zero
for PENDATUN.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In Precinct No. 37 of DINAIG, SINSUAT got 208 votes as
against zero for PENDATUN.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In these 17 precincts of UPI, 3 pre­cincts of AMPATUAN and
one precinct of DINAIG, which have a total votes of 4,346 credited to SINSUAT
as against zero for PENDATUN, the returns showed a 100% voting for all of the
NP candidates from the President, Vice-Pre­sident, the eight Senatorial
candidates, Congres­sman and the provincial board member<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">12</span></span></a>
and uniform zero votes for all the LP candidates from President down to
Congressman, except in Precinct No. 6 of UPI, where NP Senatorial candidates
PADILLA and PALMARES did not receive any votes at all. In short, the pattern of
voting in said precincts falls squarely within the sphere of the <u>Lagumbay</u>
doctrine of 100% re­gistered or cast votes for all the candidates of one party
as against zero per cent for each and all the candidates of the other party and
the independent candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Commission, therefore, believes that the Board of Canvassers committed no error
in rejecting as statistically improbable or obviously manufactured the returns
in said precincts."</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In Prec. No. 14 of MAGANOY, there were 106 registered voters
and all of whom voted. President Marcos, the NP official candi­date, got 106
votes, Osmeña, got zero.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Diokno, Espina,
Palmares, Puyat, Tolen­tino, and Tamano got 106 votes; Lopez' vote had been
tampered with to make it ap­pear in figures as 104 and in words 100; Padilla's
vote had been altered also to make it appear to be 100 in words and
figures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>SINSUAT's vote had also been
tam­pered with to make it appear as 100.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It appears, however, that the original votes of all these candidates in
words and figures is 106 and the tampering in the votes was made obviously to
avoid the application of the doctrine or statistical improbability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The original writings which are still dis­cernible
should be read and thus read would show that all the candidates of the NP in
these precincts, namely, the President, Vice-President, eight Senators,
Congressman and member of the Provincial Board received uni­formly the same
number of votes as the number of registered votes in these precincts, whereas
all the other candidates uniformly got zero. Consequently, the returns for
Prec. No. 14 or MAGANOY should be rejected as sta­tistically improbable.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Similarly, in Prec. No. 6-B of MAGANOY, it appeared that
there are 75 registered voters in said precinct. All the candidates of LP
received uniformly zero votes. The votes in figures of Espina, Padilla,
Palmares, have been changed to 70. Their votes in words, however, had been
unchanged. Consequently, since in these returns there is a uniform 100% voting
or all the registered votes for all the candidates of the NP and uniform
blanking of all the candidates of the LP and the Independent candidates, said
returns must also be rejected as statistically improbable.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Parenthetically, it may be stated here that in the senatorial
canvass, the returns for Prec. Nos. 6-B and 14 were rejected for the same
reasons."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">13</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We have carefully examined the photostat copies of the 22
election returns in question<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">14</span></span></a>, and We find the foregoing
observations of the Comelec to be correct, except for the omission of the name
of candidate Lorenzo Sumulong which appears as one or the eight NP senatorial
candidates who also got 106 votes in the election return of Precinct 14 of
Maganoy<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">15</span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the state­ment in the resolution
"that all the candidates of the NP in this precinct namely, the President,
the Vice-Pre­sident, eight senators, congressman, member of the pro­vincial
board received uniformly the same number of votes as the number of registered
votes in these precincts, whereas all the other candidates uniformly got
zero" is correct.</p>

<p class="BODY">It will be noted, as shown in the record, that the Comelec and
the Board, in applying the doctrine of sta­tistical improbability, had strictly
adhered to the fact­ual premise that there should be 100% voting of the report­ed
votes cast and uniformly tallied for all the candidates of one party and a
uniform or systematic blanking of all the candidates of the other party. So
much so, that the Comelec did not reject the election return of precinct 6 or
Upi because it appears in this return that while all the candidates of the
Liberal Party received exactly zero, 100% of all the votes cast were uniformly
credited to the Nacionalista Party candidates from President down to member of
the provincial board (248 votes each), except two can­didates for senator
(Padilla and Palmares) who were not credited with any vote (blank - not zero)<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">16</span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise the Board did not reject the
election return of precinct No. 35 of UPI<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">17</span></span></a> because it appears therein that
all the candidates of the Nacionalista Party from the President down to member
of the provincial board, except senatorial candidate Ambrosio Padilla, were
each given uniformly 100% of the total votes cast (276 votes) and Liberal Par­ty
candidate Gerardo Roxas was also credited with 276 votes, and all the other
candidates (including Padilla) were given zero.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reason for not applying the doctrine of statistical improbability on
these two election returns (Precs. Nos. 6 and 35 of Upi) is obviously because
the factual premise, of 100% voting of the reported votes cast uniformly
credited to <u>all</u> candidates of one party as against zero vote for the
candidates of the other party, does not obtain in these two election
returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, it appears
that the election return from Precinct 8-A of Pagalungan was rejected by the
Board, upon the ground of statistical improbability as pleaded by Sinsuat,
because in this election return it appears that the number of votes reported
cast was 100% uniformly credited to all the candidates of the Liberal Party
while all the candidates of the Nacionalista Party were each given zero.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">18</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The doctrine of statistical improbability was enun­ciated by this
Court, in the Lagumbay case, in January, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In a number of election cases that came up to this Court after the 1967
and 1969 elections this doctrine had been invoked, but this Court has so far
not applied the doctrine because in those cases the factual basis laid down by
this court in declaring an election return to be statistically improbable, that
is, that 100% of the reported votes cast appear to be uniformly tallied for all
the candidates of one party as against zero vote for the candidates of the
other party, was not shown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court
has been very restrictive in the application of the doctrine<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">19</span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This attitude of the court was made explicit
in the language of Mr. Justice J. B. L. Reyes, in the case of Alonto vs.
Comelec<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">20</span></span></a>,
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“x x x We do not find in the returns here questioned that
uniformity of tallies in favor of candidates belonging to one party, and the
systematic blanking of the opposing candidates, that lead us to reject the

Sangki vs. Comelec, L-28359, <st1:date year="1967" day="26" month="12">Dec. 26,

doctrine without due regard to the factual basis upon which it was based. x x

<p class="BODY">The attitude of this Court is reaffirmed in the most recent case
of Ilarde v. Comelec, et al.,<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">21</span></span></a> where this Court, in a <u>per</u> <u>curiam</u>
decision, said:</p>

<blockquote>"Under Categories A, B-1, B-2 and B-3, petitioner seeks the
exclusion of the ques­tioned returns for being statistically im­probable while
admitting that they do not fall squarely within the doctrine of statis­tical
improbability enunciated in the case of Lagumbay v. Climaco, L-25444, January
31, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court finds that the
COMELEC adhered to its admonition to canvassers in subsequently decided cases
of proceeding with extreme caution in rejecting returns as ob­viously
manufactured because of statistical improbability, and of viewing the doctrine
restrictively so as not to result in the dis­enfranchisement of innocent
voters, and there­fore ruled properly against petitioner's urging to expand the
doctrine's application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The thrust of
all the subsequent cases is to restrict the doctrine of the Lagumbay case to
the unique uniformity of tally in favor of candidates and the systematic
blanking opposing candidates in the same locality</u>, such as to make the
fraud 'palpable from the return itself ... (and) there is no reason to accept
it and give it prima facie value', and leading to no other reasonable conclusion
than that the returns were obviously manufactured because they were as 'utterly
improbable and clearly incredible' as 'to win the sweepstakes ten times.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">22</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Implicit from the aforequoted pronouncements of this Court is the
view that if it is shown that in the elect­ion return there appears the unique
uniformity of tally of all the votes cast in favor of all the candidates belong­ing
to one party and the systematic blanking of all the candidates of the opposing
party then the doctrine of sta­tistical improbability enunciated in the
Lagumbay case must be applied.</p>

<p class="BODY">We believe that the situation of the 22 election re­turns, now in
question, fully warrants the application of the doctrine of statistical
improbability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In these 22 election
returns We have a clear case of the unique uniformi­ty of tallies of all the
votes reported cast in favor of all the candidates belonging to one party and
the systematic blanking of all the opposing candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have before Us a case where the doctrine
laid down in the Lagumbay case is squarely applicable.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. Sinsuat tries to differentiate the case of the 22 election
returns in question from the 50 election returns involved in the Lagumbay case,
pointing out that in the Lagumbay case no explanation was offered why even the
elect­ion inspectors of the Nacionalista Party did not vote for the candidate
of the Nacionalista Party, whereas in the case of these 22 election returns
there are affidavits of the election inspectors of the Liberal Party explaining
why Pen­datun obtained zero vote in their respective precincts where these 22
returns came from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1970" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1970</st1:date> Sinsuat attached to
the record of this case affidavits al­leged to have been executed by Liberal
Party Inspectors, poll chairmen and poll clerks, purportedly to show that it
was not improbable for him to have garnered all the votes in the precincts
where the 22 returns in question came from<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">23</span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pendatun claims that he was not given copies of these affidavits until
after the hearing of this case before this Court on <st1:date year="1970" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pendatun also claims that these affidavits were never formally offered
as evidence in the proceedings at Comelec level, and that the supposed affiants
were not called to affirm their supposed statements and were not made available
for cross-examination by the adverse party.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We do not find in the record that these claims of Pendatun are
contradicted by Sinsuat.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sinsuat invokes the decision of this Court in the case of Sangki
v. Comelec, et al.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">24</span></span></a>, claiming that in that case this
Court did not apply the doctrine of sta­tistical improbability on the election
returns where Pendatun as candidate for Governor was credited with all the
votes cast ih certain precincts in the province of Cotabato in the elections of
November 14, 1967 as against governatorial candidate Sangki who was given zero
vote because Pendatun presented affidavits of Nacionalista Party inspectors
explaining why they did not vote for Nacionalista Party official candidate
Sangki.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find in the decision,
however, that the reason why this Court did not apply the doctrine was because
the factual set­ting of the election returns assailed as statistically
improbable in the Sangki case is different from that of the 50 election returns
in question in the Lagumbay case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
returns involved in the Sangki case did not reflect a "unique
uniformity" of tally of all the votes cast in favor of all the candidates
of one party and the syste­matic blanking of all the candidates or the opposing
party, for while it appears in those returns that Sangki obtained zero the
other candidates of his party (Nacio­nalista) obtained scattered votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"As we go into the bases for the <u>sta­tistically improbable</u>
doctrine hammered out in <u>Lagumbay</u> vs. <u>Climaco</u>, supra, and assess
the merits of petitioner's and intervenors' position, we readily read meaning­ful
differences in factual setting between this case and that of <u>Lagumbay</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In L<u>agumbay</u>, the declaration that the election returns
therein questioned were 'utterly improbable and clearly incredible,' and thus,
should be reject­ed, emphasized that the number of regis­tered voters in about
fifty precincts equal the number of ballots reportedly cast and tallied for <u>each</u>
and <u>every</u> can­didate of one party only - the Liberal Party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, respondent Pendatun points out, which
is not denied by petitioner nor intervenors, that the number of re­gistered
voters in the questioned pre­cincts of Pagalungan and Pikit is <u>not</u> the
same as the number of ballots cast and tallied for the position of Governor,
Vice-Governor, <u>and</u> other candidates or the Liberal Party.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In <u>Lagumbay</u>, too, all the Liberal Party candidates
were credited with exact­ly the same number of votes while all the Nacionalista
Party candidates received nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here,
only candidates Abdullah Sangki and Constancia Saluda were shown to have
received zero votes; other candidates of the Nacionalista Party for other posi­tions
voted upon were not blanked in the disputed returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A fact which stands in bold relief is that
candidate Magnolia Antonino for Senator - who is not of the Liberal Party -
received in all the ques­tioned precincts a liberal share of the votes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In <u>Lagumbay</u>, there was uncertainty as to what happened
to the vote of the Nacio­nalista Party inspector in the disputed precincts, because
the absence of his vote was unexplained.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here, respondent Pendatun explained, through affidavits of a good number
of the Nacionalista Party inspectors them­selves attached to his answer, that
some did not vote because they were nor able to regis­ter as voters; that two
Nacionalista Party inspectors in Pagalungan did not vote for can­didates Sangki
and Saludo but for the Liberal Party candidates for Governor and Vice-Governor
because they 'are more qualified than the former two who are foreign to our
Muhicipality;' and that other Nacio­nalista Party inspectors believed that the
Liberal Party candidates 'are more quali­fied than the Nacionalista Party
candidates.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>These averments we are
constrained to say, reduce this particular point to a question of fact</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">25</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A reading of the last paragraph of the afore-quoted portion of
the decision in the Sangki case would apprise one that the offer of affidavits
by governatorial candi­date Pendatun was not the reason for not applying the
doctrine of statistical improbability as laid down in the Lagumbay case, for as
this Court said "these averments, we are constrained to say, reduce this
particular point to a question of fact"<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">26</span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, the matter regarding the submission of affidavits to
explain the zero vote obtained by an opposing candidate gives rise to a
question of credibility of the affidavits of which the Comelec, or any lower
tribunal, as the case may be, is more called upon to determine rather than this
Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, in connection with the affida­vits presented
by Sinsuat, the following is what the Comelec says:</p>

<blockquote>"SINSUAT submitted the affidavits of LP inspectors in several precincts
of UPI explaining why they have voted for him, the NP candidate, and not
PENDATUN, the LP official candidate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
submitted also the affidavits of several citizens and leaders from UPI and
chairmen and poll clerks in these precincts where he got 100% of all the votes
and the members of the Board of Inspec­tors of the Municipalities of AMPATUAN,
MAGANOY and DINAIG to bolster his contention that it was not impossible for him
to get all the votes in the question­ed precincts in said towns.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, PENDATUN contended that in all previous
elections where he had run for an elective office, he had consistent­ly
obtained substantial votes in the municipality or UPI, AMPATUAN, DINAIG and
MAGANOY and therefore, it was unbelievable that he did not receive a single
vote in said municipalities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also
claimed that as a matter of fact, in the municipality or UPI, CHRISTIANS,
TAUSAGS from JOLO and other natives tribes outnumber the Muslims to which he
and SINSUAT belong and the Joloanos of UPI have actually some cause to be
resentful against SINSUAT for his harrassments and abuses against them in the
past.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In any event, in the face of this con­flicting claims of the
parties on the probabilities or improbabilities of SINSUAT gar­nering all the
votes in said four municipali­ties and the blanking of PENDATUN the Commis­sion
believes that the presumption of the return being obviously manufactured in
view of its 100% pattern of voting is not overcomed by the affidavits submitted
by SINSUAT consisting of the affidavits of some LP inspectors and NP and
Muslims leaders in said municipalities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the contrary, the Commission is more inclined to believe that
considering that PENDATUN had in the past been elected as senator, governor,
congressman and during the last war was one of the outstanding leaders of the
resistance move­ment in Mindanao, a fact of history which the Commission can
properly take cognizance of, it would be too much strain on ones credulity to
accept that respondent would not have received any single vote in the 17
precincts of UPI, 3 precincts or AMPATUAN and one precinct or DINAIG as
mentioned above while his opponent in the same precincts received a total of
4,346 votes when in the past elections he had received substantial votes in
said municipalities."<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">27</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We have examined the affidavits ourselves and, like the Comelec,
We are of the view that those affidavits cannot be given the effect as intended
by Sinsuat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have noted that all the
affidavits of the Liberal Party inspectors<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">28</span></span></a> who explained why they voted for
Sinsuat and not for Pendatun were made either on November 25, or 26, 1969, even
before <st1:date year="1969" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1969</st1:date>
when the can­vassing had started.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
affidavits of the poll chair­men and poll clerks who stated that the elections
in their precincts were peaceful and regular<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">29</span></span></a> were made on <st1:date year="1969" day="30" month="11">November 30, 1969</st1:date> when the canvassing had hardly
started.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The wordings of the affidavits
cannot but give the impression that the affiants were only made to sign
statements already prepared and ready for their signatures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot give weight to affidavits under the
circums­tances obtaining in this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Affidavits may be manu­factured in the same way that election returns
can be manufactured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Affiants may be
made to sign affidavits at gunpoint, in the same way that election inspectors
can be made to sign election returns at gunpoint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An elect­ion case should not be decided oh
the basis of affidavits that are dubious, even if they are not contradicted by
counter-affidavits.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. Sinsuat likewise maintains that the doctrine of sta­tistical
improbability, enunciated in the Lagumbay case, is not applicable to a single
office involved in an election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
contends that: "it is the multiple office nature of the election that made
it inherently improbable for the returns questioned in Lagumbay to be
true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a situation cannot exist in a
single office election like one at bar; for there is nothing incredible in one
can­didate getting all the votes in the precinct as against his opponent."<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">30</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Sinsuat makes capital of the fact that the Lagumbay case involves
a senatorial election where there were eight candidates to be elected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, no particular mention was made
about the single office of President, or Vice President, or Representative, in
the Lagumbay case because not one of those three offices was involved in said
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sinsuat loses sight of the fact
that in dec­laring an election return to be statistically improbable, this
Court referred to the document as a whole.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"It appearing <u>therein</u> that - <u>contrary to all
statistical probabilities</u> - in the first set, in each precinct the number
of registered voters equalled the number of ballots and the number of votes
reportedly cast and tallied <u>for each and every</u> candi­date of the Liberal
Party, the party in power; whereas all the candidates of the Nacionalista Party
got <u>exactly zero</u>...."<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">31</span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It must be noted that this is not an instance wherein <u>one</u>
return gives to <u>one</u> candidate all the votes in the precinct, even as it
gives exactly <u>zero</u> to the other.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is not a case where <u>some</u> senatorial candidates <u>obtain
zero</u> exactly, while some others receive a <u>few</u> scattered votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, <u>all the eight</u> candidates or one
party garnered <u>all the votes, each</u> of them receiving <u>exactly the same
number</u>, whereas <u>all the eight candidates</u> of the other party got
precisely <u>nothing</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The main point to remember is that <u>there is no blockvoting
nowadays</u>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This Court, in the Lagumbay case, in declaring the election
returns therein questioned as statistically improbable "opined that the
election <u>result in said precincts</u> as reported was utterly improbable and
clearly incredible"; and "where the fraud is so palpable from the <u>returns
</u>itself (<u>res</u> <u>ipsa</u> <u>loquitur</u> -- the thing speaks for
itself), there is no reason to accept it and give it <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>
value."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear from the foregoing statements of this Court in the
Lagumbay decision that it is the entire election return, which necessarily
includes the report of votes obtained by candidates for all offices therein
indicated, that is not given <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> value and should be
rejected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, where a return
is statis­tically improbable the doubt is cast not only on one of­fice
mentioned in the return but on all the offices in­cluded therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">In some cases that came up to this Court involving the office of
Mayor, and one case involving the office of Governor, the doctrine of
statistical improbability was invoked for the obvious purpose of annulling the
election returns<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">32</span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In none of those cases did this Court apply
the doctrine, not because only a single office is involved and the doctrine is
not applicable to a single office like that of Governor or Mayor, but because
the attendant facts and circumstances in all those cases did not jibe with the
factual premise upon which the doctrine of sta­tistical improbability was based
in the Lagumbay case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can be implied
from the decisions of this Court that if, in the canvass or election returns in
connection with the elections where the office of Governor or of Mayor is in­volved,
it appears in the election returns that all candi­dates of one party (including
the candidate for Governor, or for Mayor) were credited with uniform number of
votes reported cast as against the opposing candidates who are all given zero,
the doctrine should apply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We fully
agree with the observations of the Comelec, in this connection, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“x x x Although only one is being voted for as Congressman this
fact does not make said election an election for a single office because it is
being held jointly with the election for President, Vice-President and the
eight Senators and only one return is prepared for all said offices after the
votes are counted for all the candidates in the proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A <u>fortiori </u>if the only one return
(which for this reason may also be called a 'single return') is actually
manufactured or fabricated because all the eight Senators of one party have
received all the votes, either registered or cast, in a par­ticular precinct,
whereas the eight Senatorial Candidates of the other party uniformly got zero,
then the return should be considered also manufactured where it appears that
the congressional candidate of one party got the same number of votes as the
eight senatorial candi­dates and the Presidential and Vice-Pre­sidential
candidates, while the congres­sional candidates of the other party got zero,
together with the Presidential, Vice-Presidential and the eight senator­ial
candidates of his party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is illo­gical
to suppose that the same return is manufactured for the senators but not with
congressman, that is that it lies for the senatorial results but tells the
truth for the congressional result.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Falsus</u>
<u>in</u> <u>unnum</u> <u>falsus</u> <u>in</u> <u>omnibus</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A manufactured return is no return and should
be rejected <u>in</u> <u>toto</u> as distinguished from a tampered return which
is a good return but had been altered hence, the need to restore the original
entries of the return."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, We hold that the Comelec did not err when it upheld
the action of the Board in rejecting the 22 election returns in question upon
the ground that those returns are statistically improbable and should be
considered as election returns that are "obviously manufactured",
and, therefore, should be rejected, in accordance with the ruling in the
Lagumbay case.</p>

<p class="NUM">4. In the alternative, Sinsuat urges that assuming that the 22
election returns in question are statis­tically improbable under the doctrine
of the Lagumbay case, the Comelec should not simply annul them outright but it
should first strain every effort to determine the true result of the elections
from the precincts concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
position of Sinsuat is that the Comelec should order the preparation or new
returns in lieu of the returns thus rejected.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Comelec, in its Resolution No. RR-692, says that even under its
broad powers under the Constitution it does not have the power to order the
preparation of a new return where a return was previously made but is found to
be manufactured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proposition of Sinsuat has no support in
law and the decisions of this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The thrust of the deicision in the Lagumbay case is to consider
an election return that is statistically improbable as of no value and should
be rejected, no votes in the precinct concerned be counted in the can­vass, and
the recourse of the party affected by the re­jection of the return is to file
an election protest before the proper court or tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This means that the rejected returns can not
be substituted by returns to be made anew by the boards of inspectors upon
order of the Comelec.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, this Court
said:</p>

<blockquote>"Hence, denying <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> recogni­tion to such
returns on the ground that they are manifestly fabricated or falsi­fied, would
constitute a practical ap­proach to the Commission's mission to insure free and
honest elections."</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At any rate, fraud or no fraud, the verdict in these fifty
precincts <u>may</u> <u>ultimately</u> be ascertained before the Senate
Electoral Tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All we hold now, is
that the returns show '<u>prima facie</u>' that they do not reflect true and
valid reports of regular voting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
contrary may be shown by candidate Climaco - in the cor­responding election
protest."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Sinsuat would have this Court modify the ruling in the Lagumbay
case, when he says that the Comelec should strain every effort to determine the
true result of the count, and this is to be done by resorting to other copies
of the election returns or to the tally sheets inside the ballot boxes, or it
may compel the boards of inspect­ors to gather again and count the votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no law, or jurisprudence construing
our election laws, which sanctions this procedure suggested by Sinsuat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, We have the decision in
the second Pacis case<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">33</span></span></a> where this Court upheld the action
of the Come­lec in rejecting an election return which it found that it was prepared
at the point of a gun and ordered that no vote should be counted in the
precinct where that re­turn came from.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"As deserving of serious considera­tion is the directive of
the Comelec rejecting the entries for Mayor in all election return copies for
Precinct 22.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will be recalled that in
Comelec's resolution of <st1:date year="1968" day="11" month="5">May 11, 1968</st1:date>
it was found that all the four copies of the election returns for this precinct
are clean in all respects. x x x But then Comelec found that it was prepared 'at
the point of a gun' and that 'other sur­rounding circumstances belie its
authenticity." x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We must now <i>say </i>that an election return prepared at
the point of a gun is no return at all; it is not one notch above a falsified
or spurious return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Comelec was
correct in ruling that there was no valid return for the office of Mayor at
Precinct 22 and that no vote should be counted for said precinct in the canvass
of votes for Mayor</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">34</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">An election return that is statistically improbable, otherwise called
an "obviously manufactured" return, is no return at all, like a
return prepared at the point of a gun.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Like a gunpoint return, a statistically improbable return is not valid
and no vote should be counted for any candidate in the canvass of votes in the
precinct where that return comes from.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sinsuat cites the decisions of this Court in the cases of Mutuc
v. Comelec<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">35</span></span></a>.
Pacis v. Comelec<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">36</span></span></a>,
and Macud v. Comelec<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">37</span></span></a>, to support his submission that
the Comelec should not have rejected outright the 22 returns in question but
should have strained every effort to find out if the returns are really
manufactured or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do hot find the
decisions in these three cases to be in point.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Not one of these three cases deals with an election return that was
declared statistically improba­ble.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These three cases deal with an election return that was either
incomplete, or tampered with, or prepared at gunpoint.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Mutuc</u> what was involved was an election return from
precinct 124 of <st1:city><st1:place>Makati</st1:place></st1:city>, Rizal that
was incomplete because while it contained the list of the names of the
candidates there was no entry of the votes cast for them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The copies of the return furnished the
municipal treasurer, the provincial treasurer and the Comelec were similarly
incomplete.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case this Court
directed the Comelec to order the board of inspectors of the precinct concerned
to open the ballot box of the precinct for the purpose of retrieving therefrom
a copy of the election return to be used in the new canvass by the municipal
board of canvas­sers if said ballot box copy had been properly accomplish­ed;
or, in the event that said copy is blank or incomplete, to count all the votes
cast in said precinct and then ac­complish a return based on the count.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ruling in <u>Mutuc</u> was applied by
this Court in the recent case of Tiglao v. Comelec<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">38</span></span></a>,
which involved the election returns from two precincts of Apalit, Pampanga,
where the name of candidate Rogelio Tiglao for the office of Representative was
not listed and no vote was credited to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this case this Court directed the Comelec to order the boards of
inspect­ors of the two precincts concerned to open the ballot boxes of said
precincts, to count the votes for Tiglao only if any, and then accomplish a new
election return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will thus be noted
that in <u>Mutuc</u> and <u>Tiglao</u> the only purpose of having the ballot
boxes opened, as ordered by this Court, was to complete the election returns
that appear on their faces to be incomplete because no votes were credited to a
particular candidate or candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
ruling of this Court in these cases is in consonance with Section 150 of the
Revised Election Code which provides that immediate­ly after the count the
board of inspectors shall make <u>complete</u> and sign a written statement of
the count, which shall include, among other things, the total number of votes
polled by each candidate, writing out the said num­ber in words and
figures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a mandatory duty of the
boards of inspectors, such that if the boards had not performed their duty
accordingly they could be compelled to do so, either by the Court or by the
Comelec, and for this purpose the ballot box may be opened in order to refer to
the tally sheet or to count the votes of the can­didate who is not credited
with votes on the face of the election return.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Pacis</u> were involved four election returns, from
Precincts 18, 19, 21 and 22 of Sanchez Mira, Cagayan, which were excluded by
the municipal board of canvassers in the canvass of votes for the office of
municipal mayor in the elections of <st1:date year="1967" day="14" month="11">November
 14, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These four elect­ion
returns were copies for the municipal treasurer or Sanchez Mira, which the
latter submitted to the municipal board of canvassers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of these four copies three appeared to have
been tampered with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Comelec
sustained the action of the board or canvassers in excluding those four
election returns, because it had earlier been shown to the Comelec that in the
early morning following the elect­ion day, at the time when the members of the
boards of inspectors in these four precincts -- the polling places being all
located in the school building of barrio Namuac -- were preparing the election
returns they were terrorized and coerced by armed men to change or alter the
election returns which they were then preparing, obviously to favor a
particular candidate for mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this
case this Court ruled that the municipal board of canvassers and the Comelec
should not have disregarded these four elect­ion returns without first
ascertaining it there are other copies of the returns that could be used in the
canvass, considering that there are four copies of the official election
returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court observed that
because the municipal treasurer's and Comelec's copies were alleged­ly tampered
with, the Comelec should have inquired about the copies of the returns for the
provincial trea­surer, and if these copies are also altered Comelec should get
the copies of the election returns inside the ballot boxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court said that "every effort then
should be strained to ascertain <u>the existence of serviceable returns</u>
from Precincts 18, 19, 21 and 22."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And so this Court ordered the Comelec "to conduct an investigation
to ascertain the true returns from Precinct 18, 19, 21 and 22 of Sanchez Mira,
and thereafter to instruct the board of canvassers to use the true returns for
the purpose of canvass in said precincts."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Complying with the directive of this Court, the Comelec conducted an
investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eventually the Comelec
made findings, which were embodied in a resolution: (1) that the ballot box
copy of the election return of precinct 18 was intact and clean; (2) that all
the copies or the election returns of pre­cincts 19 and 21, including those
inside the ballot boxes, had been tampered with, but somehow the Comelec, upon
a close examination of the ballots, and by expert testimony of an NBI
handwriting expert and testimonies of credible witnesses, was able to ascertain
the original entries of the votes for mayor in those election returns; and (3)
that all the copies of the election returns of precinct 22 were clean but were
prepared at the point of a gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Comelec then instructed the municipal board of canvassers to count the votes
for mayor appearing in the ballot box copy or the election return of precinct
18; to count the votes for Mayor as found by the Comelec to be originally
entered in the election returns for precincts 19 and 21, without ordering the
preparation of new returns; but not to count the votes for mayor appearing in
the four copies of the election return for precinct 22 because those copies
were prepared at the point of a gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
board of can­vassers canvassed the votes in these four precincts as directed by
the Comelec.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again the action or the
Comelec and the municipal board of canvassers was questioned before this Court
ih the second Pacis case.<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">39</span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We up­held the Comelec in the second Pacis case.</p>

<p class="BODY">It will be noted in <u>Pacis</u> that in complying with the
directive of this Court to secure the <u>serviceable copies</u> of the election
returns, the Comelec ordered the opening of the ballot boxes in the four
precincts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was certain­ly within the
power of the Comelec to order the opening of the ballot boxes to retrieve the
ballot box copies and determine if they can be used in the canvass, considering
that all the copies outside the ballot boxes were con­sidered unserviceable for
use in the canvass.<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">40</span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It will be noted, also, that in the directive of this Court to the
Comelec to conduct an investigation to ascertain the true returns, this Court
did not direct, nor even hinted, that it no serviceable returns could be
secured the Comelec may resort to the count of the votes as they appear in the
ballots inside the ballot boxes in order to ascertain the true results of the
election in those four precincts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unlike
in <u>Mutuc</u> and in <u>Tiglao</u> where this Court ordered the counting of
the ballots <u>only</u> for the purpose of completing the election returns in
so far as the candidates who were not credited with votes were con­cerned, in <u>Pacis</u>
this Court did not direct the Comelec to count the votes because the election
returns involved were complete on their faces.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because the copies of those four returns outside the ballot boxes were
impugned as tampered or falsified the Court simply directed the Comelec to
secure <u>serviceable</u> copies of the election returns, and in this
connection the ballot boxes had to be opened in order to ascertain if the
copies of the re­turns inside the ballot boxes were serviceable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Comelec could not go farther than to try
to secure ser­viceable copies of the returns.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If no serviceable copies could be obtained it can not order the board of
inspectors to prepare new election returns based on the tally sheets or on the
count of the ballots found inside the ballot boxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So much so that after the Comelec had found
that all the copies of the election returns in precinct 22 were prepared at
gunpoint it directed the members of the board of canvassers not to count any
vote for mayor in that precinct, and We upheld the action of the Comelec.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We did not order the count of the ballots in
precinct 22 in order to ascertain the true result of the election in that
precinct and the preparation of new election returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When all the copies of the election return
for a particular precinct are found to be <u>unserviceable</u> - either because
they are all tampered with, or obviously manufactured or prepared at gunpoint -
then no vote from the precinct should be counted at the canvass.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither do We find in <u>Macud</u> any ruling of this Court which
upholds the proposition or Sinsuat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is claimed by Sinsuat that in <u>Macud</u> this Court sustained the Comelec in
ordering an election return to be accomplished based on the tally sheet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not find any statement in the decision
regarding this matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We only find a
statement that the board of canvassers used an election return that was
prepared by the board of inspectors under the super­vision of the
representative of the Comelec.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
decision makes no mention of the circumstances that brought about the
preparation of the election return under the super­vision of the Comelec
representative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could be another case
of an incomplete return which had to be completed under the supervision or the
Comelec representative -- and in this connection the tally sheet might have
been con­sulted.</p>

<p class="BODY">The 22 election returns now in question are the copies or the
election returns corresponding to the Provincial Treasurer or Cotabato, which
the latter official submitted to the Board to be used in the canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These election returns are not questioned as
having been tampered with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is,
therefore, no ground for the Comelec to order the production of the other
copies -- the copies corresponding to the municipal treasurer and to the
Comelec, or to order the opening of the ballot boxes for the purpose of retriev­ing
the ballot box copies, to compare them with these 22 election returns in search
for "serviceable copies" to be used in the canvass, in consonance
with the ruling in the case of Cauton v. Comelec, <u>supra</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">These 22 election returns are complete on their faces - ­in the
sense that every candidate to be voted for appears listed in each and every
such return and opposite the names of the candidates there are entries of the
number of votes received, or zero vote, in words and figures, as the case may
be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so, there is also no ground for
ordering the opening of the ballot boxes in order to secure the needed data to
make these returns complete, in consonance with the ruling of this Court in the
cases of Mutuc v. Comelec, <u>supra</u> and Tiglao v. Comelec, <u>supra</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not pretended at all in the present case that discrepancies
exist between these 22 election returns and other authentic copies of the same
returns, as would war­rant a recount of the votes in accordance with the pro­visions
of Section 163 and 168 of the Revised Election Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither do We find any allegation in the record that the members
of the boards of inspectors committed an error in the preparation of these
election returns, as would warrant a correction or amendment of the returns
under Section 154 of the Revised Election Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sinsuat urges that the Comelec could even order the boards of
inspectors to recount the ballots inside the ballot boxes in the precincts
where these 22 election returns come from to ascertain the true results of the
elections in these precincts, and then order the prepara­tion of new
returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the ballots inside the
ballot boxes are to be counted, as Sinsuat wants done, in order to check if the
count of the votes tally with those that are reflected on the election returns
in question, then the proceeding would already be in the nature of a full-blown
election contest -- a proceeding that the Comelec has no power to initiate, and
much less has it the power to decide the true results of the election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sinsuat would want the Comelec to perform a
function which the law and the Constitution does not authorize it to
perform.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It certainly is not within the
broad powers of the Comelec in the enforcement and administration of the laws
relative to the <u>conduct of elections</u> to ascertain that every election
return reflects the true result of the election in a precinct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Comelec is concerned only in seeing to it
that the election return used in the canvass is one that is not manufactured,
nor falsified, nor tampered with, nor prepared under coercion or under circumstances
that affects its regularity or genuineness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The task of determining whether an election return ref­lects the true
result of the election in a certain pre­cinct pertains to the proper court of

contest that is properly brought before said body.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have held that canvassing boards will not be com­pelled to
canvass returns that are obviously manufac­tured.<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">41</span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case now before Us the Board rejected

that both the Board and the Comelec are right in their action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The useless­ness of these 22 election returns
has therefore been de­finitely pronounced.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A party that relies on election returns that are obviously manufactured,
as in the case of the 22 election returns now in question, must suffer the
consequences of his own act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all,
the law gives him another recourse, and, that is, to file the corres­ponding
election protest.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold, therefore, that the Comelec had not neglected to perform
an act which the Constitution and the law specifically enjoin as a duty
resulting from office when, after approving the action or the Board in
rejecting the 22 election returns in question, it did not order the pro­duction
of the other copies of those election returns, nor order the opening of the
ballot boxes in order to retrieve the ballot box copies, nor order the recount
of the votes, for the purpose of determining the true result of the election in
the precincts where those 22 election returns came from.</p>

<p class="NUM">5. It is next contended by Sinsuat that the Comelec erred in
upholding the action of the Board in including in the canvass the election
returns from precincts Nos. 13-A, 14, 19, and 23 of Datu Piang.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is claimed by Sinsuat that if the doctrine
or statistical improbability is applicable to a single office involved in an
election --­ like that of Representative -- these four election returns should
also be rejected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot sustain the
contention of Sinsuat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not find in
these four election returns the factual basis for the application of the doctrine
of statistical improbability, as enunciated in the Lagumbay case, that is, that
there should be 100% tally of reported votes cast uniformly credited to <u>all</u>
the candidates of one party as against uniform zero votes or systematic blank­ing
of the opposing candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find that
in these four returns the Liberal Party candidates for President,
Vice-President, Representative, and six for Senator (Cases, Ganzon, Liwag,
Roxas, Sagun and Ziga), along with two Nacio­nalista Party candidates for
Senator (Palmares and Tamano) and Nacionalista Party candidate for member of
the provin­cial board in the special election (Ampatuan), <u>all</u> obtained
uniform number of votes; as against zero vote given to the Nacionalista Party
candidates for President, Vice-President, Representative, six for Senator
(Diokno, Espina, Padilla, Puyat, Sumulong, and Tolentino), along with two
Liberal Party candidates for Senator (Ilarde and Mañalac) and the Liberal Party
candidate for member of the provincial board (Buenaflor).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In these four election returns We find NP
senatorial candidate Palmares and Tamano credited with the same number of votes
as the six LP senatorial candidates; while LP senatorial candidates Ilarde and
Mañalac did not get any vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
special election for board member NP official candidate Ampatuan garnered all
the votes while LP candidate Buenaflor for the same office got no vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Board and the Comelec, therefore, did not
commit error when they included these four elect­ion returns in the canvass,
because the Lagumbay doctrine is not applicable.</p>

<p class="BODY">We quote with approval the ruling of the Comelec re­garding these
four election returns, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In the returns for Prec. Nos. 13-A, 14, 19 and 23 of DATU
PIANG, it appeared that six LP senatorial candidates got uni­formly the same
number of votes as PALMARES and TAMANO, NP senatorial candidates, and ISKAK
AMPATUAN, NP official candidate for member of the Provincial Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason, the Board of Canvassers in­cluded
these precincts in the canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Commission upholds the action of the Board in the returns in these precincts since
there is no 100% voting for all the candi­dates of the LP as three candidates
of the NP, two for Senators and one for member of the provincial board, have
received the same number of votes as the LP candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the Supreme Court said in the <u>Alonto</u>
case, <u>supra</u>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘x x x We do not find in the returns here questioned uniformity of
tallies in favor of candidates <u>belonging to one party</u>, and the <u>systematic
blanking</u> of the opposing candidates, that lead us to reject the returns in
the Lagumbay case x x x' "<a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, as We have pointed out at the earlier part of this
decision, the Comelec did not apply the Lagumbay doctrine to the election
return in Precinct 6 of Upi, because in said return it appears that there was
no 100% voting for all the candidates of the Nacionalista Party even it all the
Liberal Party candidates got zero vote each.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All the NP candidates for President down to member of the provincial
board uniformly got 248 votes each, except senatorial candidates Padilla and
Palmares who was not credited with any vote (blank, not zero).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, the Board did not apply the
Lagumbay doctrine to the election return of Precinct 35 of Upi because in said
return it appears that all the NP candidates, except sena­torial candidate
Padilla, were uniformly credited with 276 votes along with LP senatorial
candidate Roxas who was also credited with 276 votes; while all the other
candidates, including Padilla, were given zero vote. So, it can be observed
that the Board and the Comelec had consistently applied the rule of
"uniformity of tallies in favor of candidates belonging to one party, and
the systematic blanking or the opposing candidates."<a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">43</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The action of the Board in not rejecting these four election
returns is but in line with the rulings of this Court restrictively applying
the Lagumbay doctrine to the factual basis that We have herein adverted to.<a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">44</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the ruling of the Comelec regarding these six election
returns, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Petitioner SINSUAT claims that the returns in six precincts
of PIKIT, to wit: Prec. Nos. 10, 16, 27, 31, 33 and 15 should have been
rejected by the Board on the ground that in these precincts there was an excess
of votes over those of the number of voters who voted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission, however, notes that, except
with respect to Precinct No. 16 where PENDATUN received 270 votes, while the
number of voters who voted was only 269, resulting in an excess of one vote,
the votes received by PENDATUN did not exceed the number of voters who voted.
What actually is claimed to be in excess of the number of registered voters are
the votes for the senatorial candidates.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since the Board is canvassing only the congressional votes there is actually
no excess of votes in these six precincts, except in Precinct No. 16.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Granting that to determine whether there is
an excess of votes in these six precincts we have to consider the totality of
votes cast for the other candidates, particularly the senatorial candidates,
the Commission believes that the excess of votes in these precincts is not very
great as to be ruled out as sta­tistically improbable following the doc­trine
of State ex rel Mitchel vs. Stevens, <u>supra</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Alonto </u>vs. <u>Comelec</u>, 22 SCRA 878
would appear to be more applicable where the court said:</blockquote>

enumerated in the petition) is adequate to support the conclusion that the re­turns
are obviously manufactured for reasons of statistical improbability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x x x'<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(On page 882)</p>

with regard to the instances cited where the COMELEC ruled against the

that on November 28, 1969 (the very day, when the canvass started at Camp

Precinct 15, were actually taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During
the canvass by the Board at Camp Crame, Sinsuat objected to the use in the
canvass of the Provincial Treasurer's copies of the election returns from the
municipality of Pikit, among them the Provin­cial Treasurer's copy for Precinct
15, because, according to Sinsuat, the Provincial Treasurer's copies were
tampered with, and he asked the Board that the Comelec copies which were clean
and untampered with be used instead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Board overruled the objection of Sinsuat to the use of the Provincial
Treasurer's copies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On December 11,
1969, Sinsuat filed with the Comelec a petition questioning, among others, the
action of the Board in including in the canvass the Provincial Treasurer's
copies of the election returns from thirty eight precincts located in the
municipalities of Nuling and Pikit, upon the ground that the Provincial Trea­surer's
copies were "tampered and spurious" and dif­ferent from the Comelec
copies of the same election returns which were "clear, clean, regular and
valid".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sinsuat prayed that in lieu
of the Provincial Trea­surer's copies for the 23 precincts of Nuling and 15
precincts of Pikit (which included Precinct 15) the Comelec copies of the
election returns for those pre­cincts be used in the canvass. In his answer to
that petition of Sinsuat, Pendatun manifested that he inter­posed no objection
to the use of the Comelec copies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
hearing on the petition of Sinsuat was held by the Comelec on <st1:date year="1969" day="24" month="12">December 24, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What transpired during this hearing may best
be gathered from the resolution of the Comelec which recites as follows:</p>

the appeal of SIN­SUAT and the counter-claim of PENDATUN, which actually
partook the nature of an appeal, the Commission examined in the presence of

returns for the 23 precincts of NULING and 15 precincts of PIKIT questioned by
SINSUAT as having been tampered with.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Examination of said returns by the members of the Commission and by counsel
of both parties confirmed the tampering.<span style="">&nbsp;

copies which it examin­ed one by one, also in the presence of coun­sel of both
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission found the

the Board, pursuant to the direc­tive of the Comelec, reconvened to recanvass
the election returns in accordance with the findings of the Comelec as embodied
in its resolution of <st1:date year="1969" day="24" month="12">December 24,

that recanvass Sinsuat, through counsel, raised for the first time ah objection
to the inclusion in the canvass of the Comelec copy of the election return of
Precinct 15 of Pikit upon the ground that it was a tam­pered return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Board, however, disregarded the objec­tion
of Sinsuat.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 7, 1970 counsel for Sinsuat filed with the Comelec a
motion, dated January 3, 1970, "for reconsidera­tion and/or appeal from
the order of the Board of Canvas­sers", and praying "that the
resolution of the Honorable Commission on Election dated December 24, 1969 be
recon­sidered, so that Prec. No. 15 be excluded therefrom and/or that the
Provincial Board of Canvassers be ordered to reject the election return for
Prec. No. 15 of Pikit, Cota­bato and the votes of Pendatun reflected thereon be
removed and deducted from the over-all count made in his favor."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ground for this motion was that it was
found out during the recanvass that even the Comelec copy of the election
return for Precinct 15 of Pikit was tampered with and appeared obviously
manufactured and/or statis­tically improbable, and that during the recanvass by
the Board Blah Sinsuat, through counsel, vigorously objected to the admission
of the same, but that the Board had unlawfully counted and tabulated said
return for Pre­cinct 15.<a style="" href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">50</span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp;

committee composed of Comelec personnel to examine the Comelec copy of the
election return for Precinct 15 of Pikit.<span style="">&nbsp;

states, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"For Prec. No. 15, Pikit, Cotabato, copy for the Comelec,
bearing Serial No. 47177, the following observations are made:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1. On Data on Voters -</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With respect to the entry on the number of voters registered
in precinct, it is noted that there are erasures made in the original entry
which with a mag­nifying glass could be read <i>as </i>692.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The words in the original entry 'six hundred
ninety-two' six and ninety-two have been erased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over the word 'six' is written the word
'seven'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the total number in figures
the original entry 692 could also be discerned and over which is super­imposed
the figure 700.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the entry on the
number of voters who actually voted the original entry has been erased but
which could still be read as 'two hundred fifty'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is observed that in the original entry in
words, the words 'two' and 'fifty' have been erased and over the word 'two' is
superimposed the word 'seven'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
entry on total number in figures there appears to have been a superimposi­tion
over the original entry which could not be appreciated with certainty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The superimposed figures written is 700.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2. On Data on Ballots -</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the entry on data on ballots, in the space ballots found
in the compartment for valid ballots the original entry appears to have been
erased and over which was written the words 'four hundred fifty'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also observed that over the
superimposed entry is written the words 'two hundred fifty plus'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the entry on total number in figures the
original entry which could be read <i>as </i>250 has been erased and over which
is written the figure 700.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the entry
for valid ballots withdrawn from the compartment for spoiled ballots, for
having been mistakenly placed therein it appears in the entry on total num­ber
in words the word 'none' has been writ­ten.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, with respect to the entry in total number in figure the original
entry which could be read as 1 appears to have been erased and the figures 0
was written.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3. For the Office of Representative in the entry for the votes for
candidate Salipada Pendatun the original entry appears to have been erased in
that the words 'two' and 'fifty' have been erased and over the word 'two' is
written the word 'seven'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The original
entry could be read however and 'two hundred fifty' as altered reads 'seven
hundred'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the total votes obtained in
figures the original entry which could be read as 250 has been erased and over
which is written the figure 700.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Committee also observes that the election return for
Prec. No. 15, Pikit, Cota­bato, copy for the Comelec, contains altera­tions in
the entries not only on the data on voters, data on ballots, and votes for the
Office of Representative as stated above but also for the Office of President,
Vice-President, Senators, and Special Election for Members of the Provincial
Board, with respect to the votes of candidates Osmeña, Lopez, Ganzon, Ilarde,
Liwag, Mañalac, Padilla, Roxas, Sagun, Ziga and Buenaflor, all of which
erasures or alterations are not authenticated by any initials of any members of
the Board of Inspectors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is observed
also that both the election returns, copy for Provincial Treasurer and for the
Comelec, bear the signatures of the members of the board of inspectors which
upon comparison of both copies appears to be similar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same observa­tion is made with respect to
the envelopes and seals of both election returns."<a style="" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">51</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A hearing on this motion for reconsideration was held before the
Comelec on January 9, 1970, with all the three members of the Comelec
present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the hearing the report
of the committee that examined the Comelec copy of the election return for
Precinct 15 of Pikit was submitted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Counsels for both parties appeared, and manifestations were made by the
counsels and also by the members of the Comelec.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without taking any evidence to ascertain how
it happened that the Comelec copy in question came to be tampered, the Comelec,
on January 19, 1970, issued a minute resolution denying Sinsuat's motion for
reconside­ration "for lack of merit".<a style="" href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">52</span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Comelec, in its Case Resolution No. RR-692, specifically ordered the
Board to use for Precinct 15 of Pikit "the Comelec copy in accordance with
the Resolution of the Commission of Decem­ber 24, 1969".<a style="" href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">53</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is contended by Sinsuat that the Comelec, in ordering the
Board to use in the canvass the Comelec copy of the election return of Precinct
15 of Pikit, "violated its clear duty to direct that only genuine returns
be counted".<a style="" href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">54</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court ordered the counsel for the Comelec to file with the
record of this case an enlarged pho­tostat copy of this Comelec copy in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have carefully examined
this enlarged photostat copy, and We find that there are really very visible
erasures and alterations thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
have also found the report of the committee appointed by the Comelec to examine
this Comelec copy to be correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court is at a loss to understand, how come that, if the original of this pho­tostat
copy was the one that was examined by the members of the Comelec, and by the
counsels for both parties, on December 24, 1969 that they could not have
noticed the erasures and the alterations that now appear on this photostat
copy, if those erasures and alterations were actually existing on the original
(Comelec copy) that was examined on December 24, 1969.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that on December 2, 1969
Sinsuat was authorized by the Comelec to secure photostat copies of the Comelec
copies of the election returns for precincts in Pikit (including Pre­cinct 15)
and that he had actually taken photostat copies and had those photostat copies
during the canvass by the Board which ended on December 10, 1969.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On December 11, 1969 Sinsuat filed a petition
with the Comelec precisely assailing as tampered and spurious the Provincial
Trea­surer's copies of the election returns from 15 precincts in Pikit
(including Precinct 15) and prayed that in lieu of the Provincial Treasurer's
copies the Comelec copies which were clean and untampered be used in the
canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that petition of December
11, 1969 Sinsuat did not make any assertion that the Comelec copy for Pre­cinct
15 of Pikit be not used in the canvass because it was a tampered copy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By that time Sinsuat, or his counsel, must
have seen the Comelec copy already and had in fact a photostat copy of the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And then, on December 24, 1969,
during an open hearing, when the members of the Comelec and the counsels for
both parties examined the Comelec copies of the election returns from Pikit
(which included that of Precinct 15) neither Sinsuat hor his counsel made any
objection to the use of that Comelec copy for Precinct 15 upon the ground that
it is a tampered copy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the
examination of the Comelec copies by the members of the Comelec and by the
counsels for both parties on that day, Sinsuat and his counsel even agreed to
the making of a tentative tabulation of votes based on the clean Comelec copies
which had then been examined, and these included the copy for Precinct 15 of
Pikit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only on December 31,
during the recanvass, when Sinsuat, for the first time, objected to the use of
the Comelec copy in the canvass upon the ground that it is tampered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And We have noted in the very allegation of
Sinsuat in his petition before this Court that he admits that on December 24,
1969 the Comelec copies of the election returns from 15 precincts of Pikit were
clean and untampered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in paragraph
9, Section V (The Facts) of his petition Sinsuat makes the following
allegation:</p>

<blockquote>"9. During the
hearing on December 24, 1969, the respondent Commission indeed found as true
the allegations of tampering of the Provincial Board's copies of the election
re­turns froth the twenty-three (23) precincts from Nuling and fifteen (15)
others from Pikit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>So, it ordered the
Comelec copy of these returns to be used (See pp. 5-6, Annex 'H') because it
found them clean as of then</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">55</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">What happened to that Comelec copy which the Comelec and the
counsel for both parties had examined on Decem­ber 24, 1969?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How come that on December 24, 1969 the
Comelec and the counsel for both parties examined and found the Comelec copy of
the election return for Pre­cinct 15 of Pikit to be clean and untampered, and
yet during the canvass by the Board on December 31, 1969 there appeared a
Comelec copy of the election return for that same precinct that was very
visibly tampered and altered?</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not doubt the veracity of the statements in the Comelec
resolution of December 24, 1969, as embodied in Case Resolution RR-692 of
January 19, 1970, to the effect that when the Comelec copies of the election
returns of 15 precincts of Pikit (which in­cluded the Comelec copy for Precinct
15) were examined it was found that all said copies were "clean, untam­pered
with, and, therefore, serviceable".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But it is also undeniable that when the Board met on December 31, 1969
to recanvass the returns it was found that the Comelec copy of the election
return for Precinct 15 bore very visible alterations, or signs of tampering, as
shown on the enlarged photostat copy of said election return which is now
attached to the record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court cannot
close its eyes to the realities that appear on this enlarged photostat
copy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so, granting that this Comelec
copy was found to be clean and untampered with on December 24, 1969, the
logical conclusion is that it was tampered with after December 24, 1969 but
before it was submitted to the Board for recanvass on December 31, 1969.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is Our considered view that when Sinsuat, in his motion of
January 7, 1970 for the reconsideration of the Comelec resolution of December
24, 1970, called attention to the fact that the Comelec copy of the election
return of Precinct 15 of Pikit was tampered with, the Comelec should have taken
steps to ascertain how the tampering came about, because that Comelec copy was
found to be "clean and untampered" by the Comelec itself on December
24, 1969.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not denied that when
this Comelec copy was brought before the Comelec during the hearing on January
9, 1970, it appeared to be really tampered with because of the erasures, alte­rations
and superimpositions found therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have said in the case of Pacis vs. Comelec <u>supra</u><a style="" href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">56</span></span></a>
that "the purpose of the Election Code 'to protect the integrity of the
election and to suppress all evils that may vitiate its purity and defeat the
will of the voters' gives Comelec <u>authority to ascertain whether the
genuineness of a given election return may be salvaged by an examination of the
said return</u>".<a style="" href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">57</span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Technically, the procedure should be to remand this case to the Comelec
to make a specific finding on the matter regarding the erasures, alterations
and superimpositions as they now appear on the Comelec copy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But because We have before Us the enlarged
photostat copy of the return in question and the report of the committee that
examined said return, We believe that what the Comelec had failed to do -- that
is, to examine carefully the return and ascertain what had been altered or tampered
with -- this Court may as well do in an effort to salvage the genuine­ness of
this election return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are brushing
aside technicality in order to expedite the resolution of the question
involved, because this case affects the public interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the original of the Comelec copy of the elect­ion return of
Precinct 15 of Pikit is not before this Court, We are satisfied that the
enlarged photostat copy can serve our purpose in the examination of the return
in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The erasures, alterations,
and superimposi­tions are visible to the naked eye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The original entries that have been erased
and superimposed are still dis­cernible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We have minutely examined the photostat copy, and have taken into
consideration the report of the com­mittee constituted by the Comelec to
examine the Comelec copy of the election return of Precinct 15 of Pikit, and We
agree with all its findings, specifically its finding regarding the votes of
Pendatun, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"For the office of Representative in the entry for the votes
for candi­date Salipada Pendatun the original entry appears to have been erased
in that the words 'two' and 'fifty' have been erased, and over the word 'two'
is written the word 'seven'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
original entry could be read however and 'two hundred fifty' as altered reads
'seven Hundred'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the total votes
obtained in figures the original entry which could be read 250 had been erased
and over which is written the figure 700."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is Our view that the true entry in the Comelec copy of the
election return of Precinct 15 of Pikit of the votes of Pendatun was 250 and
not 700; and so, while We uphold the Comelec ruling that the Comelec copy of
the election return of Precinct 15 of Pikit be used in the canvass, the Board,
however, should credit Pendatun with only 250 votes this precinct.</p>

<p class="NUM">8. It is stated in the main resolution, appealed from, that the
Comelec had rid opportunity to examine the election returns from Precincts 4-A
of Maganoy and Precinct 31 of Dinaig, and so it could not make a de­finite
ruling with respect to those election returns.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The resolution also states that the election return from Precinct 54 of
M'lang was not included in the can­vass of the votes.<a style="" href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">58</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon motion of Sinsuat, this Court, in a resolu­tion of February
6, 1970, authorized the opening of the ballot box of Precinct 54 of M'lang in
order to retrieve therefrom all the copies of the return which were al­leged to
have been placed by mistake inside the ballot box by the board of
inspectors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the memorandum of data,
or report, submitted by Sinsuat to this Court it is stated that per certified
copy of the Provincial Treasurer's copy of the election return of Precinct 54
of M'lang there were 35 voters who voted in the precinct, and Pendatun is
credited with 5 votes, Sinsuat with 18 votes, and the other candidates with 12
votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An enlarged photostat copy of the
Provincial Trea­surer's copy of the election return for this precinct is
attached to the record, and is not objected to by Pendatun.<a style="" href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">59</span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Board may, therefore, use the Pro­vincial
Treasurer's copy of the election return for this precinct in the canvass.</p>

<p class="BODY">The memorandum of data of Sinsuat also reports that, as certified
to by the Comelec, in Precinct 31 of Dinaig there are 123 votes involved, while
in Precinct 4-A of Maganoy there are 102 votes involved; but no certification
could be issued by the Comelec on the breakdown of the votes in these two
precincts due to the unauthorized alterations in the entry of votes cast for
the office of Representative both in the Comelec and in the Provincial
Treasurer's copies.<a style="" href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">60</span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is, therefore, need for the implementation of the order of the
Comelec to the Board to look for ser­viceable copies of the returns for these
two precincts, and if need be to open the ballot boxes solely for the purpose
of retrieving the ballot box copies, and should the Board not succeed in
finding serviceable copies, to report to the Comelec for further instructions.<a style="" href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">61</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING,</b> with the modification that in
using the Comelec copy of Precinct 15 of Pikit the Board should credit
respondent Pendatun with only 250 votes, Case Resolution No. RR-692 of
respondent Commission on Elections, and its accompanying minute resolution,
both dated January 19, 1970, appealed from, are affirmed in all other respects;
and the writs of certiorari, mandamus and prohibition prayed for are
denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The restraining order issued by
this Court on January 23, 1970 is lifted, and respondent Provin­cial Board of
Canvassers of Cotabato is ordered to immediately convene and implement the
orders of respondent Commission on Elections in its Case Resolution No. RR-692
as modified in this decision, complete the canvass of votes cast for the office
of Representative of the lone representative district of Cotabato in the
elections of November 11, 1969, and thereafter proclaim the winning candidate
for the said office.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BARREDO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">The lengthy, intensely searching and painstaking analysis made by
Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span> of the eight is­sues involved in
this case commends itself for serious and mature consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is at once a tribute to the sagacity and
industry of our esteemed colleague and constitutes another <span class="SpellE">incontestible</span>
evidence not only of his passion for seeking the truth but also of his firm
determination not to render judgment on any matter unless he is certain of the
justice of his decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has
thoroughly scrutinized all pertinent aspects of the case before Us and has seen
to it that all his conclu­sions are buttressed by all possible arguments that
can support them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I find no
difficulty in agreeing with and concurring in his resolution of the following
issues:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. <u>That the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> ruling applies
to a single office</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, there is
no plausible reason why the doctrine of statistical improbability enunciated in
the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> case, if applicable to a given return,
as herein-under explained, should not be applied to a single of­fice involved
in the election referred to in the said return.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To the very convincing arguments already ad­vanced by Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>, I can only add one ob­servation to answer the
contention of distinguished counsel that even if a return may be false or
manufactured as to the senatorial candidates, it does not ne­cessarily follow
that it is false also as to the candi­dates for a single office, in this case,
for congress­man.</p>

<p class="BODY">The true concept of a manufactured return is that it is prepared
without regard to the contents of the ballots cast in the precinct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More likely than not, the votes are not
counted at all and the return is fill­ed up without any other basis than what
the ones prepar­ing it wish to appear therein, or even if a count has been
made, the same is completely disregarded, so that if, in fact, the number of
votes entered therein purportedly for any candidate happens to be the same as
those actually cast for him, such would be a mere coincidence and not a
deliberate recording of such votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
these circumstances, it is easy to see that there could be no basis for giving
any of the votes entered in such return any <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> value
separately from the rest thereof. Besides, if the intent and purpose to falsify
are there, it is inconceivable that any degree of loyalty to truth can still be
left lingering in the minds of the malefac­tors, particularly when, as in this
case, the lone candi­date involved belongs to the same party as the senatorial
candidates favored by the falsification.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It must be em­phasized that the only reason why an election return is
accorded <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> status as evidence of the result of the
count of the votes in a precinct is because the same is prepared by election
inspectors who are specifically entrusted by the election law with the official
duty of counting and recording or entering the number of votes received by all
the candidates, hence it is to be pre­sumed <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> that such
official duty has been nor­mally complied with.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, once it is evident that in violation of such official duty,
the inspectors have prepared a return that is purely a product of their fancy
and not factual, the reason for giving such return <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>
value ceases as to the whole of it and as to all the votes entered therein.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. <u>That the "excess" of votes must be great to
warrant setting aside of return</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
also agree that the number of alleged "excess" votes appearing in the
returns for Precincts 10, 16, 27, 31 and 33 of <span class="SpellE">Pikit</span>
(The return for Precinct 15 is treated elsewhere in this opinion) are not as
great as to warrant the application thereto of the Mitchell precedent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do note that of these five pre­cincts, it
is only in Precinct 16 that respondent <span class="SpellE">Penda­tun</span>
appears credited with any vote in excess of the num­ber of voters who voted,
and, at that, by only one (1) vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
Precincts 10 and 33, the excess refers to the total of the votes for the two
vice-presidential candi­dates, 3 votes and 1 vote, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Precinct 37, the excess 28 votes are with
reference to the total of the votes for four candidates for member of the
provin­cial board, whereas in Precinct 31, there are only 19 votes appearing to
be in excess of the total votes for the senatorial candidates of the two major
parties, with <span class="SpellE">Palmares</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sumulong</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Tamano</span> getting 24, 4 and 4 excess votes each,
respectively. Definitely, under these circumstances, it cannot be said that the
results shown by said returns are palpably false, particularly as to the votes
of respondent <span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are instances which can readily be
explained as within the area of errors of computation or recording that not
very seldom occur due to the excitement and haste that quite often attend the
preparation and signing of the returns.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They may be grounds for correction but, surely, not of complete set­ting
aside of the returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is but a
reiteration of the rulings of this Court in <span class="SpellE">Alonto</span> v.
<span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, 22 SCRA 878 and <span class="SpellE">Ilarde</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, C. R. No. L-31446, <st1:date year="1970" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1970</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. <u>That the matters referring to certain precincts should be
subject of further action by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also cannot find any reason to disagree
with the way Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span> has disposed of the
matters relating to Precincts 54 of <span class="SpellE">M'lang</span>, 4-A of <span class="SpellE">Maganoy</span> and 31 of <span class="SpellE">Dinaig</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order to avoid confusion, however, it is
perhaps bet­ter to clarify that as regards Precinct 54 of <span class="SpellE">M'lang</span>,
the decision of this Court is not only to affirm the portions of <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> Case Resolution No. RR-692 referring to said
Precinct, but also to hold that the Provincial Treasurer's copy<i> </i>of the
election return for said precinct, <span class="SpellE">photostatic</span> copy
of which has been furnished this Court, be used in the canvass herein
involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of the decision should be so understood.</p>

<p class="NUM">4. <u>As to the use of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> copy
of the return for Precinct 15 of <span class="SpellE">Pikit</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am also in agreement with the majority's
resolution of the issue regarding the return for Precinct 15 of <span class="SpellE">Pikit</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While there
may really be some controversy as to what actually was the exact condition of
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> copy of the return for said precinct on
December 24, 1969 when it was first examined by the Chair­man and members of
the Commission as well as the parties or their counsel, there can be no doubt
as to what appears on the face of said copy as it is now, which in my view is
the fact that is decisive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it
hardly needs any evidence <span class="SpellE"><u>aliunde</u></span> for it to be
demonstrated and thereby determined by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is contended by respondent that from the start, the theory of
the petitioner has always been that said <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> copy
is clean and <span class="SpellE">untampered</span> and, as a matter of fact, it
is of record that such was the agreement and un­derstanding of all the parties
and the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> commission­ers as of said date
December 24, 1969.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As if to throw the
corpse to petitioner's side of the fence, respondent argues now that it was
only after petitioner had been permitted to photograph some returns, including
the one in question, and after having taken such photographs, which must have
been done after December 24th, that petitioner raised for the first time the
present issue of alleged tampering of said copy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, respondent is in­sinuating,
if not actually charging, that, if it is true that said return appears now to
have evidence of tamper­ing, petitioner cannot be entirely free from suspicion
of having had something to do with such tampering.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the main point of respondent is
that inasmuch as the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> has found as a fact that
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> copy in question was clean and <span class="SpellE">untampered</span> on December 24, 1969 and petitioner had always
been insisting that said copy should be the one used, there is no alternative
but to use said copy because petitioner is in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
to pretend otherwise.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, I have no quarrel with the conclusion that the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> copy should be used in the canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What needs to be clarified is, which of the
two numbers of votes for respondent both appearing legible in said copy, 250
and 700, should be considered as the legitimate one for the respondent, it
being unquestionable that although as found by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
the said copy was clean and <span class="SpellE">untampered</span> on December
24th, as it now appears, there are erasures, alterations and superimpositions
therein, and as to which of these figures superimpose the other, the only data
from which any conclusion can be drawn are those contained in the report of the
<span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> committee created for the express purpose of
examining the same, which report is textually as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"For <span class="SpellE">Prec</span>. No. 15, <span class="SpellE">Pikit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cota­bato</span>, copy for the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, bearing Serial No. 47177, the following obser­vations
are made:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1. On Data on Voters -</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With respect to the entry on the number of voters registered
in precinct, it is noted that there are erasures made in the original entry
which with a magnifying glass could be read as 692.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The words in the original entry 'six hundred
ninety-two' six and ninety-two have been erased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over the word 'six' is written the word
'seven'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the total number in figures
the original entry 692 could also be discerned and over which is superimposed
the figure 700.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>In the entry on the
number of voters who ac­tually voted the original entry has been erased but
which could still be read as 'two hundred fifty'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is observed that in the original entry in
words 'two' and 'fifty' in words, have been erased and over the word 'two' is
superimposed the word se­ven'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
entry on total number in figures there appears to have been a superimposition
over the ori­ginal entry which could not be appre­ciated with certainty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The superim­posed figures written in 700</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2. On Data on Ballots -</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>In the entry on data on ballots, in the space ballots
found in the com­partment entry appears to have been erased and over which was
written the words 'four hundred fifty'.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is also observed that over the superimposed entry is written the
words 'two hundred fifty plus'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
entry on total number in figures the original entry which could be read as 250
has been erased and over which is written that figure 700</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the entry for valid ballots withdrawn from
the compartment for spoiled ballots, for having been mistakenly placed there­in
it appears in the entry on total num­ber in words the word 'none' has been
written.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, with respect to the entry
in total number in figure the ori­ginal entry which could be read as 1 appears
to have been erased and the fi­gures 0 was written.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3. For the Office
of Representative in the entry for <u>the votes for candidate <span class="SpellE">Salisada</span> <span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span> the original
entry a ears to have been erased in that the r words 'two' and 'fifty' have
been erased and over the word 'two' is written the word 'seven'</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The original entry could be read however
and 'two hundred fifty' as altered reads 'seven hundred'</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>In the total votes obtained in figures the
original entry which could be read as 250 has been erased and over which is
written the figure 700</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Committee also observes that the election return for <span class="SpellE">Prec</span>. No. 15, <span class="SpellE">Pikit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, copy for the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
contains alterations in the entries not only on the data on voters, data on bal­lots,
and votes for the Office of Repre­sentative as stated above but also for the
Office of President, Vice-President, Senators, and Special Election for Mem­bers
of the Provincial Board, with re­spect to the votes of candidates <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>, Lopez, <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilarde</span>, <span class="SpellE">Liwag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mañalac</span>, Padilla, <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sagun</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Buena­flor</span>, all of which erasures or altera­tions are not
authenticated by any ini­tials of any members of the Board of Inspectors. It is
observed also that both the election returns, copy for Provincial Treasurer and
for the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, bear the signatures of the members
of the board of inspectors which upon com­parison of both copies appears to be
similar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same observation is made
with respect to the envelopes and seals of both election returns."</blockquote>

<blockquote>" --Annex 'F', Petition, at pp. 2-4, underscoring
supplied."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the light of these facts which I consider to be undisputable
because they can be readily perceived in the document itself which has the
nature of re­al evidence, (If the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> had only
granted petitioner's motion that it be re-examined, the mat­ter now in issue
would have been settled then and there.) the real issue for the Court to
determine is t really whether or not the said <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
copy should be used.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather, the
questions the Court must decide are: (1) did the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
commit a grave abuse of discretion in refusing to re-examine the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> copy in question, having in view the tendency of
the above-quoted report submitted by the committee it had created to
investigate the same, and (2) what was the number of votes for respondent <span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span> shown on said copy when the honorable
commissioners ex­amined it on December 24th?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Was it 250 or 700?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely, since
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> is certain that the said copy was clean
and <span class="SpellE">untampered</span> with at that time, only one of these
two figures now appearing therein must have been the one there then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Which was it?</p>

<p class="BODY">The truth is that on this particular point, there is no direct
testimonial evidence extant in the record.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have carefully read the transcript of the proceedings below, portions
of which are quoted in the opinion of Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
can the above ques­tion be answered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Very importantly to be noted is that what is very clear from the remarks
of Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Patajo</span>, sanctioned seemingly by the
silence of the other two com­missioners, is that when the said copy was
examined by them on December 24th, there were no alterations or era­sures
thereon and that the Commissioner was most emphatic in pointing out that the
danger in allowing a re-examina­tion of the document lay in the danger that a
bad prece­dent would be created whereby the door would be opened for
opportunity for parties to make alterations on docu­ments after the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> has already examined them and found them to be
clean and unaltered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the
position of the Commissioners is that once they have seen a return or a copy
thereof and have found it to be clean and <span class="SpellE">untampered</span>,
particularly, when they have done so in the presence of the parties, it is
improper to ask them to reexamine the same in order to determine whether or not
it is in reality a tampered one, on the ground, as We gather it, principally,
of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>, albeit Mr. Just­ice <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>
would add that it would amount to casting doubt as to the integrity and
veracity of the commission­ers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is
overlooked, however, is that what was more important does not appear to have
been done by the <span class="SpellE">Come­lec</span> or by any of the parties on
December 24th and, that is, to make of record what was the "clean and <span class="SpellE">untampered</span>" num­ber of votes of respondent shown in
the copy in question when it was examined by all of them on that momentous date
of December 24th, whether it was 250 or 700.</p>

<p class="BODY">If this Court has to be procedurally technical, the proper thing
to do is to return this case to the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> for a
specific finding of fact on this point.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even if it were possible to apply <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> to
petitioner, which We seriously doubt can be done, considering that this is an
election case, (but We do not deem it necessary to make here any express
holding to that effect) the <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> should be as to
number of votes of respondent which appeared on said copy on December 24th, and
that is pre­cisely what the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> did not determine
when it denied the re-examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
opt, however, not to insist on procedural technicalities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold that the above quoted report of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> committee furnishes enough basis for a safe
conclusion which, after all, cannot be altered even if We return this case to
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, it is still uncertain whether or not the number of votes in­volved
in this question will affect the result of the election in question, and since
the result in said Pre­cinct 15 is not the only one involved in this case, We
feel it is better that this Court resolve the point un­der discussion now even
without complying with such technicality.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the above-quoted report of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
commit­tee, the conclusion is inescapable that the original fi­gures entered on
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> copy in question before the same were
altered showed that respondent <span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span> obtain­ed
only 250 votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The report is definite
to the effect that the number 700 visible therein is a superimposed one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is true, not only as to entry of the
number of votes for respondent, as already stated, but also as to the number of
registered voters, the number of voters who actually voted and the number of
ballots found in the compartment for valid ballots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the obvious super impositions do not
appear only over figures but also over the corresponding numbers in words,
except as to the entry of the number of ballots found in the compartment for
valid ballots, as to which there was not only the superimposition of the words
"four hundred fifty" over an erasure, but there is also the detail
that the words "two hundred fifty plus" also appear written above the
superimposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The report is also
consistent to the effect that all the erased original figures which are still
legible indicate that the respective entries read two hundred fifty in words
and in figures, not only for the votes of respondent but also for all the other
items aforementioned, except the number of registered voters which is 692.</p>

<p class="BODY">All things considered, no other conclusion is really possible
except that the number of votes of respondent originally entered in the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> copy for Precinct 15 of <span class="SpellE">Pikit</span>
was 250 and that the board of canvassers should use in the canvass this
original figure and not the 700 which has been superimposed over it.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">5, 6, and 7. <u>The other issues relative to the application of
the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> decision as to pattern of manufactured
return</u>. The rest of the issues involve in one way or another the alleged
applicability or inapplicability of what is repeatedly being referred to as the
<span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> doctrine regarding the pattern of voting
which denotes manufacturing.</p>

<p class="BODY">To have a better perspective for our discussion of these issues,
it is perhaps best to start with a clarifi­cation of what is this that is being
repeatedly referred to as the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> doctrine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In truth, the real doctrine basically
involved in these issues is the one laid down in the case of <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
wherein the case of Mitchell vs. Stevens was cited with approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span>
decision was only an application of the doctrine already formulated in those
previously mentioned cases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Substantially and in essence, the doctrine may be stated as follows: Any
election return which on the basis exclu­sively of data found on its face
appears to be obviously and patently false is nothing but a manufactured return
which should not be accorded any <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> value as evi­dence
of the result of the count and should be disregarded in the canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in the Mitchell case, the data ap­pearing
in the return of a precinct showing that the votes credited to a candidate was
greatly in excess (by over 2,000) of the number of registered voters in said
pre­cinct, as shown in the same return itself, was considered as a manufactured
return and disregarded in the canvass.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> case, the 100% pattern of
voting for all the candidates of one major national party and the com­plete
systematic blanking of all the candidates of the other major national party,
appearing on the face of all the returns from 50 precincts, was considered as giving
rise to the presumption that said returns were false and manufactured, such a
pattern of voting being regarded by this Court as something statistically
improbable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the
conclusion of falsity in the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> case was a mere
inference drawn from the utter improbability, statistically speaking, of the
pattern of voting shown in the returns therein involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">There can be no question as to the wisdom and time­liness of the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> decision. As the Court said, "Hence, denying <u>prima</u>
<u>facie</u> recognition to such returns on the ground that they are manifestly
fabricated or falsified, would constitute a practical approach to the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> missions to insure free and honest
election". (See p. 28 of the main opinion) It is important to note,
however, that <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of this characterization, this
Court has taken care not to apply the same ruling in any other case that has
come before it since then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This attitude
of the Court is evidently due to the fact that the Court is aware that an
election return is in itself only a presump­tive document embodying no more
than a legal presumption of correctness in the appreciation of the ballots and
the counting and tallying of the votes made by the inspectors, for if it were
not so, and it were, on the other hand, a conclusive document, electoral
protests and electoral courts and tribunals would have no reason for
being.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the Court has chosen to be
very restrictive in holding that a return is manifestly fabricated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, the basis of the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> doctrine is also nothing more than a presumption
arising, if inescapably, from the face of the return itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The difference between these two presump­tions
is that whereas the first presumption is a legal one, the second is only one of
fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To set aside the legal pre­sumption
of correctness of the count borne by an election return by means alone of a
presumption of fact is, of course, something that is obviously delicate and
extremely dangerous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the very
nature of these two presumptions, the one of fact has to yield to the legal
one, if only be­cause the latter is ordained by law, and this is particularly
more logical whenever any reasonable indication ex­ists that the factual
presumption may not be altogether valid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Applying these considerations to the case at bar, We hold that the test
of statistical improbability applied in the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span>
case as basis for the presumption that the returns therein involved were
fabricated or manufactured has not been successfully hurdled in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is indeed not accurate to say that the factual setting of the
present case is on all fours with that of <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True, the pattern of voting in both cases is
identical, but unlike in the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> case where the
Court searched in vain for any explanation of the appar­ent statistical
improbability of the questioned returns, here, in this case, there are
explanations which more or less justify the pattern of voting shown in the
returns herein involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
explanations are found not only in the affidavits presented by petitioner and
discussed in the appealed resolution but also in the information furnished the
Court during the oral argument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereas
in the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> case, the Court was left guessing as
to what happened to the votes of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
inspec­tors in the precincts where <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> and the
other <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> candidates got zero, in the case
at bar, there are affidavits of the inspectors concerned as well as of other
persons explaining why they did not vote for the Liberal candidates..<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the oral argument, circumstances were
revealed by petitioner and not sufficiently denied, in my opinion, by
respondent indicating that the results appearing in the returns are not
improbable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent suggests, of course, that this Court pay no heed to
those explanations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The majority opinion
makes a long and admirable discourse on the inadmissibility of the affida­vits
relied upon by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seems to
me, however, that respondent's posture in this regard is off tangent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the doctrine of manufactured returns, as
I have already pointed out above, it is my view that it is not necessary to
inquire as to whether or not the explanation offered to destroy the presumption
of fabrication is entirely true or not.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The only question to determine is whether or not such an explanation is
such a reasonable one that if proven to be true, it would be sufficient to
offset the presumption of fraud arising from the data on the return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As long as there are indicia of evi­dence to
support the explanation, the better rule is to dis­regard the presumption of
fraud and recognize the legal pre­sumption of regularity in the performance of
official duty in­forming the return and leave it to the corresponding electoral
tribunal to determine, as in any other case, whether or not the return is
indeed falsified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, since
the put­ting up of a factual presumption against a legal presumption would
naturally leave the Court in an uncharted sea of conjec­tures and because this
dangerous venture does not square with the requirements of such a pragmatic
matter like the determi­nation of who has been given the popular mandate in an
election, it is no doubt the safer course to take that whenever there is
anything in the record or from the information duly given to the Court which,
if true, can serve to explain a unique or pec­uliar manner of voting which
bears earmarks of presumptive fraud, the effort should not be towards
minimizing the expla­nation, as respondent would want this Court to do, but
rather, towards giving due regard to the explanation, if it is feasibly
demonstrable and evidence, admissible in character, is shown to be available to
prove the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, resort to the
presumption of fraud should only be a last recourse.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apropos to this discussions are the following consi­derations on
which this Court, thru our venerated present Chief Justice, predicated its
decision in the recent case of <span class="SpellE">Rasid</span> <span class="SpellE">Lucman</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Macacuna</span> <span class="SpellE">Dimaporo</span>, G. R. No. L-31558, <st1:date year="1970" day="29" month="5">May 29, 1970</st1:date>:</p>

<blockquote>"Petitioner impugns the foregoing conclusion upon the ground
that: (1) the affidavits for Respondent are in­admissible as hearsay evidence,
because the affiants could not be cross-examined, the Commission having re­fused
to summon them, despite timely motions filed by Petitioner; (2) the testimony
of the election registrar is unworthy of credence; (3) the affida­vits for the
Petitioner include those of some members of the PC and CNEA wat­chers, which
are supported by the re­port of the Special Action Team of the Commission, and,
hence, should be ac­corded much weight; (4) the presump­tion of regularity is
inapplicable to the case at bar; and (5) the returns for Precincts Nos. 3, 4-B
and 15 of <span class="SpellE">Balabagan</span> had been excluded by the
Commission in its canvass of the re­turns for senators, as obviously ma­nufactured.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The first ground relied upon by Petitioner is untenable, for:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(a) The records
show that the Com­mission had indicated its intention to determine the case on
the basis of the affidavits and the documentary evidence introduced by the

 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Balabagan</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commis­sion has no such authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, when, upon denial of Petitioner's
motions for the issuance of <span class="SpellE">subpoenae</span> to the affiants
for Respondent herein, Petitioner instituted Case No. L-31430 of this Court -
to compel the Commission, by mandamus, to <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
issue the afore­mentioned <span class="SpellE">subpoenae</span> - We forthwith
dismissed the petition therein and, soon thereafter, denied Petitioner's motion
for reconsideration of our resolution of dismissal of the case.</blockquote>

</span>In fact, in his original petition for exclusion, filed with the Board,
petitioner quoted from <span class="SpellE">Dimafiles</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> (L-28396, December 29, 1967):</blockquote>

involved therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first set, 'in
each precinct the number of registered voters <span class="SpellE">equalled</span>
the number of ballots and the number of votes reportedly cast and tallied <u>for
each and every</u> candidate of the Liberal Party, the party in power; whereas,
all the candidates of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Par­ty got <u>exactly

whereas, all the candidates of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party

Court held that said returns were <u>'obviously</u> manufactured,' contrary to
all statis­tical probabilities,' <u>'utterly</u> impro­bable and <u>clearly</u>
incredible.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted that
this was not strictly an issue of fact.<span style="">&nbsp;

</span>In other words, there was <u>no dispute</u> as regards such
elements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dispute boiled down to the
proper conclusion to be drawn <span class="SpellE">there­from</span>, and, hence,
it partook of the na­ture of a question of law. (Joaquin v. Navarro, 93 Phil.

<blockquote>"Such is not the situation obtaining in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The irregularity pointed out by the
Petitioner is denied by Respondent, thereby raising a purely factual
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of settling the same,
the affidavits submitted by both parties merely stressed the conten­tious
nature of the issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the same
could not have been wiped out or even minimized by the presence and cross-
examination of the affiants for Respond­ent, had they appeared before the
Commis­sion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, unlike the
condi­tion of the returns involved in the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span>
case - which this Court considered <u>incontestable</u> - that existing as
regards the returns for <span class="SpellE">Balabagan</span> is clearly a <u>very
con­troversial one</u>, which the Commission has no power to decide with
finality.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(d) The
Commission could not, moreover, summon the affiants for Respondent, without
granting him the same right to examine the affiants for Petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would have entailed a full-dress
elucidation of the a­forementioned issue of fact, which, after all, the
Commission cannot settle authorita­tively.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Worse still, it would create a si­tuation fraught with possibilities, inimical
to the spirit of the laws establishing boards of canvassers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is well settled that the same are meant, not only to
discharge purely <u>ministe­rial</u> duties, based upon returns submitted
thereto in due form, but, also, to perform this function <u>summarily</u>, so
that winning can­didates could assume their office on the date set for the
commencement of their term.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main
role of the Commission in connection therewith is to see to it that such
objective be carried out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The theory
advanced by peti­tioner herein would, however, induce the can­didates who are
likely to lose, on the basis of said returns, to raise questions of fact
requiring the introduction of testimonial evi­dence thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If sustained, its effect would be to delay,
far beyond the time envi­saged by law, the proclamation of the winning
candidates and their assumption of office, thereby depriving the people, in the
mean­while, of the representation they are entitled to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, there would be an unnecessary du­plication
of the proceedings peculiar to elec­tion protests, with the consequent
possibility of having different results and the serious dangers concomitant
therewith."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, in my opinion, the affidavits offered by pe­titioner
are not really as worthless as respondent pictures them to be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that they are of one style or
wording is nothing unusual, since in actual practice, the words of an affidavit
are not necessarily those of the affiant and when the same matter is to be
attested to, almost invariably, the affidavits of several persons appear to be
identical <u>mutatis</u> <u>mutandis</u>, without minimizing in any significant
degrees their intrinsic worth for the purpose for which they have been
prepared) and the fact that they were taken even before this case arose only
proves that petitioner had anticipated the possibility which has in fact
materialized that the pat­tern of voting in the precincts concerned would be
likened to that in the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only natural, therefore, for
petitioner to prepare the ground for the position he would take and which he
has now taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the affidavits seem
to be irregular because of abnormalities in the data regarding the residence
certificates of the affiants and the numbers of entries in the <span class="SpellE">notarial</span> registers of the notaries public before whom they
are supposed to have been subscribed and sworn to, and even the fact that
copies thereof were served very late upon respondent's counsel do not really af­fect
their inherent veracity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of
fact, their truthfulness has not been challenged by respondent with any
counter-affidavits even up to this date.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is vital is that those affidavits exist <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <span class="SpellE">Sangki</span> case, this Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"In <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span>, there was uncertainty
as to what happened to the vote of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
Party inspector in the disputed precincts, because the absence of his vote was
unexplained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, res­pondent <span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span> explained, through affidavits of a good number of
the <span class="SpellE">Na­cionalista</span> Party inspectors themselves
attached to his answer, that some did not vote because they were not able to
register as voters; that two <span class="SpellE">Naciona­lista</span> Party
inspectors in <span class="SpellE">Pagalungan</span> did not vote for candidates <span class="SpellE">Sangki</span> and <span class="SpellE">Saludo</span> but for the
Liberal Party candi­dates for Governor and Vice-Governor because they 'are more
qualified than the former two who are foreign to our Municipality'; and that
other <span class="SpellE">Naciona­lista</span> Party inspectors believed that
the Liberal Party candidates 'are more qualified than the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
Party candidates.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>These averments,
we are constrained to say, reduce this parti­cular point to a question of fact</u>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[21 SCRA 1395-1396]<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Underscoring Ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The real import of this last statement is
that when affi­davits are offered in support of an explanation that will do away
with the presumption of fabrication, the issue be­comes one of actual, and not
presumptive, fact, hence, the factual presumption must be laid aside and the
issue of fact must be resolved no longer by the board of canvassers nor by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, but by the appropriate electoral tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As far as the canvassers are concerned, the
legal presumption of regularity in the performance of duty of the inspectors
must prevail and the return must be read as is.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, it is also relevant to consider that by its
very nature, the concept of statistical impro­bability is one that is rather
relative, depending on the circumstances of time, place and person as these are
judi­cially cognizable at the moment of its invocation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before <st1:city><st1:place>Columbus</st1:place></st1:city>,
the idea that the world is round was almost a heresy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even more, references to the whole earth in
the <span class="SpellE">Roly</span> scriptures, particularly the Old Testament,
may not be reconciled with what is actually known as the world to­day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man on the moon was merely a poetic expression
not so long ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Man's conduct and
attitudes <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> his fellowmen have never been
constant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Political ideologies,
principles and parties and adherence and loyalties thereto are as variable as
the demands of the people's welfare dictate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Alliances among men and nations depend on changes of circumstances not
always foreseeable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The United States
and Russia were allies in the last world war, only to be apparently
irreconcilable enemies today, while Japan whom Americans compelled to surrender
as a hated militaristic totalitarian state is presently one of Uncle Sam's
closest nephews even in the absorption, at least, apparently, of democratic
ideals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the very area of po­litics
which is under discussion, President Nixon con­founded <span class="SpellE">dopesters</span>
who foretold political doom for him af­ter his defeat in the gubernatorial
elections in <st1:state><st1:place>Califor­nia</st1:place></st1:state> in
1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our own President Marcos did an
unbelievable feat in winning not only a re-election but by being the first re-<span class="SpellE">electionist</span> to capture <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
the seat of the opposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Senator <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> once remarked to this Court, in the politics of
our country, what was improba­ble in 1965 may yet be the thing most probable
today.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The point is that extreme care
must be taken in adopting any presumption of improbability in electoral matters
and only whenever every probable or demonstrable possibility has been discarded
must it be accepted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Come to think of
it, it would not be illogical to realize that the <span class="SpellE">Lagum­bay</span>
case, adjudged as it was, and ought to be understood as it must be always, as
predicated on its own peculiar and particular circumstances, is not only the
one of its kind until now but the only one that will ever be.</p>

<p class="BODY">I need not dwell at length on the other cases dis­cussed by the
respondent and also in the majority opinion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Suffice it to say at this point that, as observed by the Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>, in all of them, this Court refused to apply the
doctrine under discussion, for the simple reason that in all of those cases,
the statistical improbability alleged to exist had reference to excess of votes
which could not be considered really great or to patterns of voting less than
100% for one party and 100% against ano­ther.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The present case is indeed the first one wherein the pattern of voting
is identical to that in the <span class="SpellE">Lagum­bay</span> case, but, as I
have pointed out earlier, the differ­ence between the two cases lies in that
here, unlike in the <span class="SpellE">Laaumbay</span> case, there are
indications of substantial and reasonable evidence of facts which if true would
remove the props of the factual presumption of improbability.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent these explanations, another question that arises is as to
whether they must appear on the face of the return itself or they may be based
on evidence <span class="SpellE"><u>aliunde</u></span> or on facts found outside
of the return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, it must be the
lat­ter, for if the explanation is apparent on the face of the return, then
there could not be any seeming or presumed improbability evident in the return
itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus in the case of Estrada vs.
Navarro, L-28340 and L-28374, December 29, 1967, 21 SCRA 1514, this Court
refused to draw the con­clusion that the return therein in question was
manufactured notwithstanding that the data appearing on its face bore enough
indications of excess votes on the ground that the minutes of voting justified
a contrary conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As can be
observed, the minutes of voting to which the Court re­ferred was a document
distinct from and outside of the re­turn.</p>

<p class="BODY">This was the same ruling conversely stated in the case of <span class="SpellE">Demafiles</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, Ts-28396,
Dec. 29, 1967, 21 SCRA 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that
case, this Court held that the conclu­sion of statistical improbability must be
drawn from data found in the return itself and not from external evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is thus clear that the rejection by this
Court of evi­dence <span class="SpellE"><u>aliunde</u></span> is not of evidence
that would prove an expla­nation offered to destroy the factual presumption of
fraud but of evidence that is intended to serve as basis for such factual
presumption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Naturally, this Court had
to rule that in the latter case, the evidence cannot be entertained, for the
obvious reason that the doctrine of manufactured return refers to a presumption
that arises exclusively from data on the face of the return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the Court has allowed
evidence <span class="SpellE"><u>aliunde</u></span> to rebut the factual
presumption of fabrication, as in the Estrada case, for the reasons I have
already discussed, the most important of which is to remove the basis of the
proclamation as far as possible from speculation, and, if necessary, to use
only those presumptions which are expressly provi­ded by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the Estrada case, <u>supra</u>, this Court
said:</p>

irrefutable, for it is mathematically impossible for 229 voters to cast 300

<blockquote>"However, a conclusion that an election return is obviously

data shown on the return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any plausible ex­planation,

a mere clerical error, and that the correct figure is 299 as shown in the

this figure is supported by the other en­tries in the return, and by the fact

<blockquote>"Everything considered, we find no justi­fiable ground on
which the return in question may be annulled."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Pp. 1519-1520)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon these considerations, it is our considered view and
conclusion that the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> erred or abused its dis­cretion
in sanctioning the rejection by the board of canvassers of the returns of the
22 precincts in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If I hold that
taking all relevant circumstances into account, particularly the explanations
offered by petition, this case may be differentiated from the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> case and so, the said 22 returns should be canvassed
as they are.</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming now to the returns from Precinct 6 of <span class="SpellE">Upi</span>
and Precincts 13-A, 14, 19 and 23 of <span class="SpellE">Datu</span> <span class="SpellE">Piang</span> which the <span class="SpellE">Come­lec</span> refused
to consider as falling within the doctrine of manufactured returns, I have a
different view, except as to 23.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
22 precincts involved in our previous discussion, we held that the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> doctrine is not applicable because although a
pattern of presumptive fraud­ulent voting is discernible on the faces of the
returns <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, petitioner has offered reasonable
and substantial explanations which, in our opinion, suffice to rebut such
presumption of fabrication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With regard
to the precincts now in question, not a single affidavit has been offered by
either of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We note, however,
that in Pre­cinct 23, according to Annexes 27 and 27-D of respondent, there was
no 100% voting for any party, so the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
resolution regarding the same should stand.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> held that the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> ruling is not ap­plicable to the said returns only
because instead of a 100<i>% </i>voting for all the candidates of one party as
against that of another, what appears is that two or three candi­dates of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party or the Liberal Party, as the case may
be, received the same votes as the candidates of the opposing party, at the
sacrifice, of course, of two or three corresponding candidates of the other who
were not credited with any vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To my
mind, this pattern of voting is even more statistically improbable than the
100% voting for one party in the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I main­tain that if it is well nigh
impossible to make all the voters of one precinct vote for the straight ticket
of one party, it is next to impossible to make them vote for a straight ticket
of candidates of different party affilia­tions, particularly if the variations
refer exactly to the same candidates.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, how can it be believed, in the absence of any factually
demonstrable explanation, that each and everyone of the 221 voters who voted in
Precinct 19 of <span class="SpellE">Datu</span> <span class="SpellE">Piang</span>
had decided to vote uniformly for the presidential and vice presidential
candidates of the Li­beral Party, the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
candidate for member of the provincial board and the same six Liberal
senatorial can­didates, namely, Cases, <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Liwag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sagun</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span> and abandon the same two other Liberals, <span class="SpellE">Ilarde</span> and <span class="SpellE">Mañalac</span>, in favor of
the same two <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> candidates <span class="SpellE">Palmares</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tamano</span>?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To top it all, this happened not only in one
precinct, but in three precincts.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The voting appearing on the face of the return from Precincts 6
and 35 of <span class="SpellE">Upi</span> follow the same pattern in the re­verse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In these returns, there were two Liberal
senatorial candidates joined with six <span class="SpellE">Nacionalistas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same result must follow, except that with
respect to Precinct 35, it is to be noted that the objection to the action of
the board of canvassers was not prosecuted in the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
much less in this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">I, therefore, vote to reverse the ruling of the res­pondent <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> as to Precinct 6 of <span class="SpellE">Upi</span>
and Precincts 13-A, 14 and 19 of <span class="SpellE">Datu</span> <span class="SpellE">Piang</span>, without prejudice to the parties offering reasonably
probable and demonstrable evidence, be­fore the canvass is finished, of any
explanation that can overthrow the factual presumption of improbability.</p>

<p class="NUM">8. <u>May the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> order the
preparation of another return</u>?</p>

<p class="BODY">The next question to resolve is one of the gravest
importance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming that the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> doctrine applies to the 22 returns above referred
to, can the board of canvassers prepare a certificate of canvass in complete
disregard of the possible result of the election in said precincts?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, can the board of canvassers
omit altogether in its canvass, the votes cast in those precincts?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Generaliz­ing the question, should the votes
in a precinct be ignored in a canvass only because the return <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> has been so illegally prepared that its contents
cannot be given <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> value or should a proper return be
ordered prepared for the purposes of the canvass?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the overall outcome of the election for
congressman herein involved cannot be affected by such possible precinct
results, it may perhaps be easy to simply say that in the interest of the
speedy announcement of the results of the election, it would not be of any
legal consequence to pay no attention to the said votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a fact, however, that such result will
be very materially altered, so it is imperative that we determine the right
answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent contends that since in the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span>
case the 50 precincts involved were not included in the canvass after the
returns <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> were found to have been fabri­cated,
the 22 precincts herein involved should suffer the same fate, as if that
decision had established a binding precedent on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The truth, however, is that it did not.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>As a matter of fact,
strictly speaking, this issue was not passed upon in the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span>
decision nor even dis­cussed in it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent's counsel himself observes that it was already in the motion
for reconsideration of the minute­-without-prejudice-resolution of this Court
declaring the questioned returns invalid that <span class="SpellE">Climaco's</span>
counsel raised for the first time the issue that instead of merely disregarding
the fabricated returns and excluding the precincts con­cerned from the canvass,
the corresponding boards of inspect­ors should be reconvened and ordered to
prepare new returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already
indicated, however, in the extended opinion of this Court which also denied <span class="SpellE">Climaco's</span> motion for reconsi­deration, not even a passing
mention was made of this argu­ment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Looking back, we can only say that the Court must have felt inclined to
leave things as they were after the pro­mulgation of the
minute-without-prejudice-resolution because at the time the motion for
reconsideration was resolved on January 31, 1966, Senator <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span>
had already been proclaimed, in virtue precisely of the said resolution, and
had further­more taken the oath and assumed office, and consequently, the whole
matter of the legality of his election, including, naturally, this particular
question, had already fallen more appropriately within the competence and jurisdiction
of the Senate Electoral Tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How
then can it be rightly said that in this case the court has no alternative but
to follow the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> "precedent"?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To attribute doctrinal value or the effect of
a binding precedent to the silence of the Court on a matter of transcendental
importance is not in keeping with the dignity and authority supposed to inform
decisions of tribunals of last resort. It is extremely improper to speculate
regarding the mind of the Court as to matters on which it has not made any
express ruling.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, under these circumstances, it would be tant­amount to
judicial dereliction for this Court to hold that the door is already closed to
this Court to now rule squarely on such a grave issue of far-reaching
significance, con­sidering specially that, to paraphrase an observation of Mr.
Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span> in the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span>
decision, the point is being pressed upon Us now in a more clear-cut man­ner,
as never before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Withal, what should
weigh heavily upon Us as a self-imposed responsibility is that by the trend of
our decisions subsequent to the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> case, this
Court has leaned towards a more practical, more expeditious and less technical
approach to the solution of electoral cases, with the end in view of striking
at the root of all controversies <u>sans</u> non-fundamental technicalities of
proced­ure, thereby effectuating as speedily as possible the ap­parent will of
the electorate and, as importantly, also giving flesh and bone to the necessary
power and jurisdict­ion of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> as the body
entrusted by the constitution with the sacred duty of making elections in this
country free, peaceful and orderly, and by clear implication, gen­uine and not
a mockery, whenever all these can be achieved by it without encroaching into or
corroding the equally cons­titutionally allocated jurisdiction of the
corresponding electoral tribunals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be it
remembered that the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> case was decided in 1965
and 1966; thereafter, We decided the case of <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
on February 10, 1968 and hardly two weeks later, on February 21, 1968, that of <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are the cases that are really relevant
to the present issue, because in them, Our decisions picked up, as it were,
from where <span class="SpellE">Lagum­bay</span> was unable to proceed because of
the jurisdictional rea­son already stated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is by the examination of these deci­sions, including the one lately
of <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>,
that tie can clearly see the trail We have been since pursuing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, how did this Court approach the issue
now before Us subsequent to <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span>?</p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be admitted that in the second <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>
case, there was no order for the board of inspectors of Precinct 22 to prepare
a new return notwithstanding that the return first prepared by them was found
to have been filled up at gun point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is obvious, however, that under the facts of that case, no new count could be
made, for the simple reason that the contents of the ballot box involved had
already been tampered with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> resolution in that case, "[n]either
would it be of any help if the ballot box will be opened and we were to look
for other election documents, since the tally sheet and the tally board were
missing and the ballot box itself was left open from the morn­ing of November
15, 1967 up to the afternoon of November 16, 1967".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Naturally, a new count would not have served
any le­gitimate purpose and would have been improper, even if judi­cially
undertaken (Resolution, <span class="SpellE">Chiongbian</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, G. R. No. L-19202, <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="2">February 20, 1962</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, this Court already gave an emphatic indication of the
efforts that should be made when copies of the election return are found to be
unserviceable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following words of
Mr. Justice Sanchez, speaking for the Court, should never be lost sight of,
full of wisdom, principle and practicality, as they are:</p>

<blockquote>"1. <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> broad power under the Constitution and the
statutes has gained judicial approval.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The rationale is that <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> is entrusted
with the 'enforcement and administration of all laws relative to the conduct of
elections' and the authority to decide 'all administrative questions, affecting
elections' - all of which rest upon the purpose of <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>:
to insure free, orderly and honest elections.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Sec. 2, Article X, Constitution).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the diversity of election frauds and anoma­lies that have been
concocted by rival par­ties, surpassing legislative anticipation and scuttling
the prescribed manner of con­ducting elections, necessitate resort to <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> general power of administration and supervision.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This Court has set down the rule that when returns are
obviously manufactured or palpably irregular, the canvassing board may reject
them (<span class="SpellE">Tagoranao</span> vs. Commission on Elections, L-28590
and <span class="SpellE">Cota</span> Cornell vs. Commission on Elections,
L-28598, March 2, 1968, 1968A Phil. 806, 813; <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> vs.

Party vs. Commission on Elections, 85 Phil. 149, 157, 158, and <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Climaco</span>, L-25444, <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1966</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The board's decision is open to review by <span class="SpellE">Com­elec</span> which has the power to investigate ir­regularities

<blockquote>"'Clean elections', we have said in the first <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> case, 'control the appropriate­ness of the

destroy the integrity of election returns must have to be discouraged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, they may eventually defeat the will of
the majority and, as Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> has

means to undergo the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Which, as
well observed by Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>, could only
result in a pyrrhic victory (<span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Climaco</span>, supra).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> then must strain every effort to ascertain the true
returns to be used in the procla­mation, a possible alternative being that the

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, it should be considered that in elections, the
significance of a regular and proper proc­lamation can never be
over-emphasized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the fact alone
that such a proclamation gives the person in whose favor it is issued the right
to possess and exercise all the prerogatives and attributes of the office in
dispute, one can easily see how important it is that every care must be taken
so that the proclamation may be as legal and complete as it is humanly possible
to make it so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True it is that in the
ultimate, the question of who has been duly elected may be decided in a
protest, but this is no reason why all controversies affecting the canvass and the
returns should immediately be shoved to the electoral tribunals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The final decision of these tribunals, no mat­ter
how fast and how correct, cannot replace or supersede the role of a
proclamation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Needless to say, a correct proclamation is as im­portant, if not
more so, than the final result of the pro­test, particularly, from the
practical standpoint because it is not unusual for the wrong candidate to be
proclaimed and the winner of the protest to be able to serve only an
insignificant balance of the term for which he has been elected. It is
precisely because of these considerations that the election law has elaborate
provisions specifying in detail who are to make the canvass and when and how it
should be made, stating categorically that such canvass "shall
proceed" on the basis of "all the statements" (re­turns) and
"all the votes in the province" (<span class="SpellE">Secs</span>. 158
et seq.,-particularly Sec. 160 of the Revised Election Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the proclamation is the first
proof, re­cognized by law, that a candidate has been elected, that is, that he
has garnered the required number of votes to be entitled to the office as
against his rivals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This proof cannot
have due weight unless it has been properly established; its basis is the
canvass; but if the canvass is incomplete, the proof is correspondingly
insufficient; and a canvass cannot be complete, unless the returns from all the
corresponding precincts are included therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The purpose of the canvass is to determine the result of the election as
shown by the official returns; necessarily, a canvass cannot be reflective of
the true vote of the elec­torate unless all the returns are considered and none
is omitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only exception to this
would be when there is no feasible and expeditious way of determining the votes
in a precinct, such as when the tally sheet appears to have also been tampered
with or manufactured in the same way as the return, or the ballots themselves
have either bee actually tampered with or there are indications that the sec­urity
and integrity of the same have been destroyed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The validity of these propositions are self-evident.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, eleven days after the first <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>
case, on <st1:date year="1968" day="21" month="2">Feb­ruary 21, 1968</st1:date>,
in the <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> case (supra), this Court ex­plained the
imperative need for taking all returns into ac­count in the canvass in the following
unequivocal terms:</p>

<blockquote>"It is now a settled doctrine that an incomplete canvass of
votes is illegal and cannot be the basis of a subsequent proc­lamation (see,
e.g., <span class="SpellE">Demafiles</span> vs. Commis­sion on Elections,
L-28396, Dec. 29, 1967; <span class="SpellE">Abes</span> v. Commission on
Elections, L-28348, Dec. 15, 1967; <span class="SpellE">Abendante</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Relato</span>, 94 Phil. 8 [1953]).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, it is the ministerial duty of a municipal canvassing body to
count the votes cast 'in the same manner as herein-before provided for the
provincial board [of canvassers],' (Rev. Election Code, sec. 168) which means
to say to count <u>all</u> the votes cast.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, section 160 of the Elec­tion Code enjoins provincial boards of can­vassers
as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'As soon as <u>all the statements </u>are before it but not later
than fifteen days next following the date of the elec­tion, the provincial
board of canvassers shall proceed to make a canvass of <u>all the votes </u>in
province for national, provincial and city candidates, and upon the comple­tion
of the canvass, shall make, as the case may be, separate statements of <u>all</u>
the votes received by <u>each</u> candidate x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x'
(Italics supplied)</p>

<blockquote>"A municipal board of canvassers must therefore count <u>all</u>
the votes cast in the elec­tion and, for this purpose, must consider <u>all</u>
returns presented to it by the municipal treas­urer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If material defects there are in the form of
the returns, it must send them back to the corresponding boards of inspectors
for cor­rection (Rev. Election Code, sec. 162).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If certain precincts have not sent in their returns, the board must send
for them, and the fiscal should forthwith institute criminal proceedings
against those who may be criminally responsible for the delay (<st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>
sec. 161).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If there is a discrepancy
between two authentic copies of an election return and the difference affects
the result of the election, the board may ask the proper court of first
instance to order a recount of the ballots (<st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>
<span class="SpellE">secs</span>. 163 and 168).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"All these serve to underscore the need to count <u>all</u>
the votes cast in an election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only when
the returns are palpably irregular or ob­viously manufactured may they be
rejected (E. g., <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> v. Commission on Elections,
L-25444, <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="1">Jan. 31, 1966</st1:date>, 16
3. Ct. Rep. Ann. 175; <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party v.
Commission on Elections, 85 Phil. 149 [1949]) but even then the board must
exercise 'extreme caution' (Estrada v. Navarro, L-28340 &amp; L-28374, Dec. 29,
1967).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And where a return is falsified,
the board may apply to the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> for authority to
use another copy which is genuine and authentic (<span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
v. Commis­sion on Elections, L-28415, Jan. 29, 1968; <span class="SpellE">Espino</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>, L-22325, Dec. 11, 1967).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why must all the votes be counted when there
is a need to finish the canvass on time so that proclamation can be made before
the beginning of the term of office?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because to disregard returns is in effect to disenfranchise the voters
(Estrada, v. Navarro, supra, note 8).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> was, under the circumstances,
bereft of power to order the board of canvas­sers of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city> to disregard the return
from precinct 124, even if it noted from its copy (which was likewise blank or
incomplete) that the number of votes cast in the precinct (263) was too small
to be of any significance to any candidate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This, because the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> has no power to
decide questions involving the right to vote, (<span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
Party v. Commission on Elections, supra, note 7) as to disregard a return is in
effect to deny the voters their votes."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above considerations, particularly, this Court's
rationalization in the cases of <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> and <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> should suf­fice to answer the argument that there is
neither law nor jurisprudence supporting the proposition that there should be a
new count.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The import and implications
of this Court's opinions in those cases are so logical and so <span class="SpellE">effectuative</span> of the principles underlying the popular
suffrage and elect­oral processes that one is left to wonder how anyone can
ever conceive that the law could be so inadequate as not to provide directly or
by necessary implication what should be done with votes that would otherwise be
left uncounted and ineffective merely because an attempt intended precise to
thwart the correct reporting of the genuine result of the election has been
made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be tragic to say the
least, if the broad powers of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> specially
de­signed in the constitution to prevent, as far as it is humanly possible to
do so, any repetition of previous ex­periences regarding conceivable tricks,
artifices and fraudulent practices in elections, were to be construed as short
of enabling that body to ascertain by reasonable means the result of the count
of votes, if only for pur­poses of a complete canvass, only because it has been
found that, in violation of the particular provisions of the election law and
the commission's circulars and regu­lations, something has been done with all
the copies of the return in a given precinct to make them completely
unserviceable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated differently, to
sustain the view that because the return for a precinct has been found to be
fabricated or manufactured, the result of the election in it should not be
included in the canvass, is the best encouragement to the perpetration of a new
"grab-the-pro­clamation" scheme, namely, manufacture the return and
thereby render useless the votes of the opponent in said precinct sufficient to
overturn the result: in which eventually, what this Court intended to achieve
in the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> case would be defeated and the remedy
thereby conceived and enunciated would turn out to be worse than the malady.
Indeed, the consequent disenfranchisement of electors by nullifying their votes
is worse than not al­lowing them to vote at all, because in the latter case, it
is yet uncertain who would have the palm of victory, whereas in annulment, the
votes they have actually cast to give their candidate the majority he has
obtained are set aside, at least, until after a long, cumbersome and expensive
protest and after the truly losing candidate has already enjoyed the Office for
sometime.</p>

<p class="BODY">With these considerations in mind, the challenges that confront
Us are clear and ineludible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Are We to
pursue the trend of the above decisions or are We going to backtrack?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Are We going to capitalize on the trifling
distinction that in the <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> case, the return was
merely blank, while in the present case the returns in question are being held
to be manufactured and false?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Are We
opting to disenfranchise the voters in the 22 pre­cincts in question whose
votes can be decisive of the election involved in this case, for no obvious
reason of logic or policy at all, and only because nothing of the sort has been
done before?</p>

<p class="BODY">It is alleged that in the <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> case,
this court held that all that can be done with 'palpably irregular or obviously
manufactured" returns is that "they may be rejected", albeit
with "extreme caution", and no votes should be counted for the
precinct concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is not
true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The whole text of the discussion
in the <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> case above-quoted clearly points towards
a single direct­ion, namely, that all efforts must be strained to deter­mine
the results of the election in every precinct "be­cause the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> has no power to decide the questions involving the
right to vote (as) and to disregard a re­turn (or the result in any precinct)
is in effect to de­ny the voters their votes."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To rely barely on the state­ment "Only
when returns are palpably irregular or obvious­ly manufactured may they be
rejected but even then the board must exercise extreme caution" for the
conclusion that no recount can be ordered is to read said statement out of
context.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is evident that said statement
taken together with the other portions of the opinion does not convey the
import that respondent wants to give it - namely, that the only thing that can
be legally done is to disregard the questioned return and not to count any
votes in the precinct involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then again, in the also recent case of <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, G. R. No. L-31566, February 18, 1970,
wherein the name of one candidate was completely omitted in the returns from
Precincts 35-A and 36 of <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>,
this Court ordered that "the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> should have
ordered the boards of inspectors of Precincts 35-A and 36, <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span>,
to open the ballot boxes, count the votes for petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span>,
if any, and make new returns."</p>

<p class="BODY">Comes now the majority and in a vain effort to evade the
necessary consequence of these doctrines ration­alizes that while the case of <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> involved a return which was blank and in the <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> case the questioned re­turns omitted the name of the
candidate <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span>, the situa­tion in the case at bar
is different because here there are returns which are neither blank nor faulted
with omis­sion; the returns herein involved are obviously manufac­tured ones,
hence, foregoing precedents do not apply.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I must say, with no little disappointment, that this Court has never
done this before - try to draw distinctions where none exist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Undeniably, the returns here in question are
not identical in form with those in <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span>, but since when has this Supreme Court ever bothered
about dis­similarities in form when the applicability of the same principle is
as apparent as logic and morality can ever make it?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Never!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, I am fully convinced that the fundamental considerations that
propelled the holdings of this Court in <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> make it impera­tive
and inevitable that We hold that blank returns or ones showing omissions of
names of candidates, returns made at gun-point and obviously manufactured or
fabricated returns all belong to the same legal category.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In all of these instances, it is as if no
return at all has been pre­pared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
the rule that applies to the first two should also apply to the last two.</p>

<p class="BODY">The clear implication of the ruling of the majority, as I see it,
is that the requirement of Section 160, which, according to this Supreme Court
in <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span>, means that <u>all</u> the returns or the
returns from <u>all</u> precincts must impera­tively be canvassed, as,
otherwise, disenfranchisement of the corresponding voters would result, should
be considered as legally complied with as long as <u>all</u> such returns are
before the canvassers, even if, as in this case, some of the said returns are
palpably unserviceable by standards laid down by this Court itself, such as,
"obviously manu­factured" and "gun-point" returns and
returns all the copies of which appear to have been so erased, altered or
forged beyond recognition that none of them can be utilized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, under the majority's theory,
where the law speaks of "all" the returns, it contemplates any kind
of return, so long as it is fully filled up as to the number of votes of all
the candidates, no matter if as so filled up, it is palpably illegal and
unserviceable by this Court's own standards.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Worse, the only alternative that the majo­rity suggests in such a
contingency is to disregard the defective return and count no votes for the
precinct con­cerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In good conscience,
I find it extremely diffi­cult to agree with such a view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I cannot admit that the existing electoral
laws and the pertinent constitutional provisions are that bad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My legal knowledge and experience, humble as
they are, revolt against the idea that "there is no law or
jurisprudence" authorizing any alternative other than to disregard the
returns here in question and count no votes - virtually hold there was no
election, which only the electoral tribunals can do - in the 22 precincts here
involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the present laws and
constitution have left such an alleged void in the electoral scheme of this
country is, to me, a conclusion that is impossible of accept­ance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True, Section 163 specifically allows a judicial
recount in cases of irreconcilable conflict between copies of the same returns
and there is no other provision in the revised Election Code authorizing such a
recount, but who is advocating a judicial recount in the present case?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear to me that the fact that Section
163 sanctions a judicial recount in its premises, cannot be considered as
indicative of any legislative intent to preclude the obliga­tion of the
inspectors to prepare another return in substitution of one found to be
unserviceable by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To start with, the preparation of an
appropriate return 14 such a case does not necessarily entail a re-reading of
the ballots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The truth is that in the
actual working out of the electoral procedure, the inspectors do not prepare
the returns on the basis directly of the ballots; the returns are filled up by
reading the result found in the tally sheets.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is wrong then with making the inspectors pre­pare a new return on
the basis of tally sheets?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer of
the majority is that the tally sheets may be as defect­ive as the returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Definitely, there is no evidence, much less
proof to that effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why must We decide
this case on the basis of conjectures?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Is it not Our own ruling that every effort must be strained to determine
the true result of the count of votes?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Why does not the majority want to strain efforts further in this
case?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the event the tally sheets in
the precincts here in question turn out to be as faulty as the returns, what
would be wrong anyway with requiring the inspectors to re-read the
ballots?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, if the integrity of the
ballots themselves happen to be ques­tionable, then, perhaps, there would be no
other recourse but leave out the corresponding precinct in the canvass. In such
a case, I would say that even if the wrong candi­date is proclaimed, it would
not matter very much because no one is expected to do something that is
physically and legally impossible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
conclusion on the point under dis­cussion, I submit that the absence of any
provision expressly authorizing a recount of votes when all the copies of the
returns are unserviceable is simply explained by the fact that such a remedy is
too obviously implicit in the exist­ing laws to require further specific
legislation.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is further argued that in the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span>
case, after holding that the fifty returns in question were fab­ricated, this
Court ruled that "fraud or no fraud, the verdict in these fifty precincts
(therein involved), may ultimately be ascertained before the Senate Electo­ral
Tribunal<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>All we hold now is
that<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>the returns<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>do not reflect
true and valid re­ports of regular voting.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The contrary may be shown<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>in the corresponding election protest",
hence, the same procedure should be followed here by leaving the results in the
22 precincts herein involved to the House Electoral Tribunal in an appropriate
election pro­test.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have already
explained that the supposed rul­ing thus referred to must have been due to the
fact that at the time the decision was rendered, the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span>
case was already within the orbit of the Senate Electoral Tri­bunal's
jurisdiction inasmuch as at that time, Senator <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span>
had already been proclaimed as a consequence of the minute-without-prejudice
resolution of this Court, taken the oath and assumed office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be that as it may, the above-quoted
statements of this Court in the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> decision had
no specific reference to the argument that there should be a recount.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, it is in the very nature of the electoral process that
the same matters affecting the election re­turns may be decided or passed upon
at different stages, from different points of view, for different purposes and
by different bodies or offices. In the ordinary scheme of this electoral
process there are three stages in deter­mining the legitimate result of an
election, namely, first, the counting of the votes by the inspectors; second,
the canvassing of the returns by the board of canvassers and lastly, in the
event of controversy as to the legality and regularity of the elections, the
electoral protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proper
preparation of the returns is undertaken by the board of inspectors and only
said board has the power to decide questions regarding what the returns should
contain, subject to control of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> and
ultimately of this Court, but whatever be the rulings of the board, they have
no bearing on the final determination of the true and le­gal result of the
election, said rulings being good only for purposes of preparing the returns
for submission to the corresponding officers so that the same may be submit­ted,
in turn, to the board of canvassers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Likewise, as to the canvass, it is the board of canvassers, subject
again to supervision and control of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> and
the final appellate authority of this Court, that has the ex­clusive authority
to pass on the authenticity of the re­turns, but part and parcel of the duties
of the said board is the obligation to see to it that all the corres­ponding
returns are before it; not before then does its power to canvass exist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the canvass and proclama­tion have been
legally made, the board of canvassers' and the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span>
functions in regard to canvassing become <span class="SpellE"><u>functus</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> and the jurisdiction of the electoral
tri­bunal ensues, only then but not earlier.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, all rul­ings of the Board of Canvassers and the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> and this Court at this stage are binding only in so
far as the canvass and the proclamation are concerned and have no compulsive
bearing on the issue of over-all legality of the election which is left to be determined,
in case there is a protest, by the electoral tribunals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the constitutional conferment upon the
House Electoral Tribunal of exclusive jurisdiction as "sole judge of all
contests relating to the election, returns and qualifica­tions of the (irrespective)
members" of the House of Representatives, should not preclude the board of
canvassers and the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> from doing and performing
all their duties to see to it that a complete and regular canvass is made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, in the scheme of the
electoral process, the boards of inspectors, the boards of canvassers and the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> as well as the electoral tribunals have their own
designated times to deal even on the same matter without any conflict of
jurisdiction, each deciding and resolving the matter for specific and distinct
purposes.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, there is no issue of legality or irregularity
of the voting nor any question of appre­ciation of ballots. Nobody is claiming
that there was no election or that the election in the 22 precincts in question
should be annulled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sole issue here
involv­ed refers to the contents of the returns for purposes of canvassing -
that is, whether or not they are authen­tic and can be given <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>
value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This question is not likely to be
taken up in any ensuing election con­test, since there the issue will go beyond
the returns to the ballots or votes themselves.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Clearly, this matter, by its very nature, belongs to the jurisdiction of
the <span class="SpellE">Come­lec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no reason to waive that jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is insisted, however, that, after all, the
ballots may be duly counted by the electoral tribunal and the true re­sults
known thereafter. Would that not be too late for the candidate who should have
been proclaimed, if the counting were made earlier?</p>

<p class="BODY">It is suggested that adopting the rule that when there is a
manufactured return, the votes in the corres­ponding precinct should be
disregarded would be giving the one who caused the illegality his just
desserts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first glance, this argument
does appear to administer poetic justice, but on deeper reflection, one will
rea­lize that, as earlier explained, the "manufacturing" may also be
done by the other party who would benefit by the complete disregard of the
votes in the precinct and not necessarily by the candidate or party that
appears fa­vored on the face of the return.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under these circums­tances, there is indeed no substitute for what is
most normal, logical and legal, which is none other than to have the inspectors
prepare a new return, on the basis of the tally sheet, if found to be regular,
otherwise, on a re­count of the ballots, unless the latter are themselves
unserviceable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Fear is expressed that if the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
is to be recognized to have the power suggested by petitioner, the likelihood
is that many proclamations will be held up because of the necessity of
recounting the votes in many precincts in which the returns are unserviceable
and thus, greater injury will be caused to public interest by the failure of
many elective officials to assume office at the inception of their terms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I believe that such ap­prehension has very
little reason for being.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The very fact
alone that all concerned are precisely being made aware by Our decisions that
this Court will never counte­nance the unnecessary delay of a proclamation and
the unwarranted disregard of the results of the election in any precinct and,
further, that We will not hesitate to order the prosecution of the guilty
parties, will have the effect of discouraging further ill-conceived schemes to
defeat the true vote of the people. Moreover, the proper pro­cedure is really
more simple than it is imagined to be.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After a return is declared unserviceable for any reason in the law, all
that has to be done is for the board of ins­pectors of the corresponding precinct
to meet and prepare a new return, on the basis, as already stated, of either
the tally sheet, if it appears to be regular, otherwise, the ballots
themselves, a procedure which need not take more than a day or two.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely, this slight delay is more than made
up for by the clear advantages I have already discussed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Given <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
officials who are properly, imbued with the necessary loyalty to truth, the
laws, the cons­titution and the country, and with this Court clarifying every
doubt in the statutes and past jurisprudence, as it should have done here, to
the end that the electoral pro­cess may be as simple and as fool-proof as human
genius can make it within the boundaries laid down by the laws and the
Constitution, we can be certain that, even if our burden of work be heavier for
sometime or some proclamations may suffer a little delay, earlier is this
country going to have more honest and free elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Withal, even grant­ing that the imagined fear
may indeed materialize, I can­not compromise with the pose that this Court must
adopt the interpretation that would avoid it, even if it is clear that a
construction more in consonance with the intent and spirit of the law is <span class="SpellE">undisputably</span> feasible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We all know that if ever there should be more instances hereafter of
unserviceable returns that would necessitate the con­sequence I advocate, it
will be because attempts may be made precisely to defeat the ends vie intend to
achieve by adopting the interpretation I propose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is it proper for Us to hold that our
construction should yield to such evil design?</p>

<p class="BODY">The ideal to approach is that every man's vote must count for all
purposes for which it is cast, principally, the proclamation and the final
outcome of the election; hence, any ruling to the effect that the votes in any
pre­cinct should not be counted, even if only for the purposes of the canvass
and proclamation, when it is obvious that the alternative to avoid it is still
legally open, should be farthest from the mind of this Court, for the simple
reason that it will cause irreparable injury to the popular will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the great comfort of our people, the trend
of Our decisions in electoral cases has thrown electoral male­factors into
confusion and given the citizenry a well-groun­ded hope that under the able
supervision of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, proclamations made by
boards of canvassers are presently as proximate as human capability can make it
to the best determined presumptive results of the elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is truly unfortunate and <span class="SpellE">regretable</span>, that after this Court has advanced so far, the
majority cannot now see its way onward, to the great impairment, I believe, of
the cause of clean and honest elections and the consequent disen­chantment, let
Us hope not, of those who only recently had reason to feel that this Court had
already traced in <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span>, and all its
other deci­sions of similar tendencies, an irreversible course to­wards the
most expeditious determination of the question of who should be proclaimed as
winner in an election, thereby eliminating as much as possible the chances of
error and even mischief in this respect.</p>

<p class="BODY">ACCORDINGLY, I vote to <u>reverse</u> the two <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
re­solutions now before Us in all respects that they are inconsistent with the
foregoing opinion.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J.</i>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">I concur with the extensive concurring and dissenting opinion of
Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, and wish to add the following
brief com­ments on the inapplicability of the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span>
case:</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To my mind, the
application by the majority of the <span class="SpellE">Lagum­bay</span> dictum
does not square with the consistent pronouncements of the Court in all
subsequently decided cases admonishing boards of canvassers to proceed with
extreme caution in rejecting returns as "obviously manufactured"
because of statistical improbability and to view the doctrine restrictively so
as not to result in the disenfranchisement of innocent voters.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court reiterated this restrictive view in two cases decided
this year.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Ilarde</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
it pointed out that "(T)he thrust of all the subsequent cases is to
restrict the doctrine of the <span class="SpellE">Lag­umbay</span> case to the
unique uniformity of tally in favor of candidates belonging to one party and
the systematic blanking of the opposing candidates in the same locality, such
as to make the fraud 'pal­pable from the return itself .. (and) <u>there is no
reason to accept it and give it prima facie value, and leading to no other
reason­able conclusion than that the returns were obviously manufactured
because they were as 'utterly improbable and clearly incredible’ as to win the
sweepstakes ten times</u>.'" In <span class="SpellE"><u>Lucman</u></span><u>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Dimaporo</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court cited the "peculiar situation" of the fifty returns ordered
excluded from the canvass in <span class="SpellE"><u>Lagumbay</u></span> as
"<u>utterly</u> improbable and <u>clearly</u> incredible."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted that this was not strictly
an issue of fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the main
elements essential to its determination appeared <u>on the face of the returns
themselves</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dispute boiled down
to the proper conclusion to be drawn <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, and,
hence, it partook of the nature of a question of law (cases cited).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, in the view of this Court, that
conclusion was "<u>clear</u>, <u>obvious</u>, <u>manifest</u> and <u>indubitable</u>.
" The Court further explicitly ruled, in not applying therein the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> doctrine, that "unlike the condition of the
returns in­volved in the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> case -- which this
Court considered <u>incontestable</u> -- that existing as regards the returns
for <span class="SpellE">Balabagan</span> is clearly a very <u>controversial</u>
one, which the Commission has no power to decide with finality."</p>

<p class="NUM">2. In <span class="SpellE"><u>Sangki</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court held that "a no-vote for a particular candidate in election
returns is but one strand in the web of circumstantial evidence that those
election returns are 'obviously manufactured.'<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Lagumbay</u></span><u>,</u> that circumstantial
evidence was overwhelming."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There,
the Court declined to reject the returns from 18 precincts of <span class="SpellE">Pagalungan</span> and 11 precincts of <span class="SpellE">Pikit</span>,
both of Northern <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, showing that all the votes
counted were in favor of <span class="SpellE">Salipada</span> K, <span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span> (then a candidate for gover­nor) while reporting
zero votes for his opponent, because <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
affidavits of the opposing party's inspectors explaining why they did not vote
for their party's candidate were submitted by <span class="SpellE">Pen­datun</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court ruled that the averments of the
inspectors' affi­davits "reduced this particular point to a question of
fact", which could only be resolved by the corresponding protest in the
proper forum.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. In the case at bar, affidavits of respondent <span class="SpellE">Pendatun's</span> party inspectors and of the poll chairman and
clerks explaining the zero vote for <span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span> as
against 4,346 votes for petitioner <span class="SpellE">Sinsuat</span> in the
questioned precincts, principally of <span class="SpellE">Upi</span>, his home­town,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
which stand <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span>, were this time presented by
his opponent, petitioner herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
must be counter-balanced as against the fact of respondent <span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span>
having received all the 5,809 votes cast in the 35 precincts of <span class="SpellE">Pagalungan</span>, his home­town, as against zero vote for
petitioner<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
(in the same manner that he garnered all the votes therein against zero vote
for his opponents in the 1961, 1965 and 1967 elections).<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The point is that against such a factual
background dealing with hometown votes, any conclusion of statistical improbability
on the basis of the <span class="SpellE">Lag­umbay</span> doctrine becomes
clearly inapt, because the results shown by the returns cannot be said to be
'utterly improbable and clearly incredible" and a conclusion of their
being "obviously manufactured" because of statistical improbability
cannot be considered "indubitable and incontestable."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether by design or otherwise, the other can­didates
of the opponent's ticket are systematically blanked or given a few stray votes
becomes of no legal significance for purposes of the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span>
dictum, because the issue becomes a very contro­versial one of fact, which
rules out the summary employment of statistical improbabilities and which is
beyond the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> power to decide with finality.</p>

<p class="BODY">As held by the Court in <u>Estrada vs. Navarro</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
in canvass proceedings, "(A)<span class="SpellE">ny</span> plausible
explanation, one which is acceptable to a reasonable man in the light of <span class="SpellE">experence</span> and of the probabilities of the situation, should
suffice to avoid outright nullification, with the resulting disfranchisement of
those who exercised their right of suffrage."</p>
