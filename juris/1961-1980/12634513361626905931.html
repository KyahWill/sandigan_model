				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from the order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> dis­missing the complaint in Civil Case No.
Q-5894.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Originally filed in the Court of
Appeals, it was certified to this Court for the reason that the issue being
raised is purely legal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Juan J. <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> was the owner of Lots
216, 228 and 125 of the <span class="SpellE">Tala</span> Estate Subdivision, with
a total combined area of 91,918 square meters, covered by TCT Nos. 11772, 11773
(<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>) and 10965 (<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City), registered in his name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
guarantee payment of goods consigned to him <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>
constituted on <st1:date year="1948" day="29" month="7">29 July 1948</st1:date>
a real estate mortgage on these 3 parcels of land in favor of H. E. <span class="SpellE">Heacock</span> Company.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> failed to comply with his
obligations; thus, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
in the foreclosure suit brought by H. E. <span class="SpellE">Heacock</span>
Company (Civil Case No. 947), ordered him to pay to the plaintiff the sum of
P11,517.75, with legal interest thereon, plus at­torney's fees, within 90 days
from notice, otherwise, decree of foreclosure of the mortgage shall issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Clemente once more failed to make payment,
writ of execution was duly issued and the prop­erties were sold by the
Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> at public auction on <st1:date year="1955" day="23" month="5">23 May 1955</st1:date> for P14,301.34 to the
highest bidder, the H. E. <span class="SpellE">Heacock</span> <span style="">Company.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This judicial sale was confirmed </span>by order of the court of <st1:date year="1956" day="17" month="9">17 September 1956</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears, however, that after the <span style="">public sale </span>but before its confirmation by the court, the
plaintiff company sold the same 3 parcels of land to <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span>
Belen de Guzman for P10,717.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
hearing this, <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span style="">instituted Civil </span>Case No. 4365 in the same court of first
instance, for annulment of this subsequent sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">On motion of therein defendants, H. E. <span class="SpellE">Heacock</span>
Company and the De Guzman spouses, the complaint was dismissed, the court
holding that the confirmation-order issued in Civil Case No. 947 constituted <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>juduicata</u></span> to
that later case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appealed to this Court,
the order of dismissal of Civil Case No. 4365 was upheld,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
thus:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>it must be apparent that plaintiff may com­plain
about <span class="SpellE">Heacock's</span> transfer only if the confirmation of
the auction sale is revoked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is so,
because after the approval of the auction sale, he had lost all interest in the
property, he had no right of redemption and had no business attacking the
transfer to the <span class="SpellE">Guzmans</span>, whether fictitious or <span style="">void </span>or illegal in any manner.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In this action, therefore, he must be deemed mainly to be
seeking the revocation (or reconsideration) of such approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, that is precisely the question admittedly
pending before the court in Civil Case No. 974 (foreclosure).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Consequently, this action should be dismissed, in view of the
<span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of another litigation between the same
parties <span style="">on identical issues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It makes </span>no difference that the Guzman
spouses were not <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> in the foreclosure
proceeding:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>they are successors in
interest of the plaintiff there, and they acquired the lands after the
commencement of such foreclosure."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> appealed from
the orders denying his motions for <span style="">reconsideration
and for </span>setting aside of the order of confirmation, first in the Court
of Appeals, and later to this Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
In the decision of 25 October 1960, this Court affirmed the ruling of the Court
of Appeals sustaining the validity of the confirmation-order and disregarding <span class="SpellE">Clemente's</span> allegations of lack of notice and hear­ing,
taking into consideration the finding of the Court of Appeals <span style="">that -?</span></p>

<blockquote>"The alleged collusion between the H. E. <span class="SpellE">Heacock</span>
Co. and <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> Belen de Guzman was not shown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant contends that he has been deprived
of the op­portunity to prove it, but such contention is untenable, as the
record fails to reveal that he had even attempt­ed to offer evidence <u><span style="">during the hearing</span></u><span style=""> </span>held to deter­mine whether or not the
sale should be confirmed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="7" month="7">7 July 1961</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Causapiencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>, et
al., heirs of Juan J. <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> who had since died,
filed the present complaint against the <span style="">H.

(Spouses) in the Court <span style="">of First <span style="">Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, </span></span>docketed

made by the Sheriff in favor of defendant H. E. <span class="SpellE">Heacock</span>

Title Nos. 33164 (<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City), 46923 and 46924 (<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>) issued by the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City and <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,

Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City and the Province of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, respectively;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(d) On the Third Cause of Action, ordering the defendants to
pay plaintiffs, jointly and severally, the sum of not less than P2,500.00, as
and for at­torney's fees and <span style="">expenses </span>of
litigation;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(e) For costs of this suit."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The action was based on the <span style="">allegations </span>that the purchase of the
lots by H. E. <span class="SpellE">Heacock</span> Company was null and void,
because at the time of the judicial sale, said defendant had no corporate
authority to acquire lands or any interest therein; that the consolidation of
the company's title over the lots was irregular and illegal for failure to
observe the legal proceedings specified in sections 63 and 78 of Act 496; that
the sale was null and void, because the purchase price of P14,301.34 was
unconscionably low for the properties allegedly worth P200,000.00; and that the
purchase <span style="">by <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span>
Belen </span>de Guzman of the same prop­erties for P10,717.00 <span style="">was </span>without valuable consideration, in
view of the great disparity between the said purchase price and the market
value of the properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">On defendants' motions, however, the court dismissed the com­plaint
on the ground of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs then interposed the present
appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In questioning the </span>correctness
of the application <span style="">by </span>the lower
court of the doctrine of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> to the present case, herein ap­pellants
claim that there is no identity of the subject matter and causes of action in
Civil Cases Nos. 947, 4365 and Q-5894, in that, while the subject matter in the
first were the indebtedness and mortgage, in the second, it was the premature
sale of the prop­erties to the De Guzman spouses; and, it was the extrinsic
fraud (allegedly consisting of the non-disclosure by the company of its
incapacity to purchase lands) which vitiated the foreclosure proceedings, in
the third case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, since the
test for deter­mining identity of causes of action is the materiality of the
same evidence to the present and former causes of action, and there was no
evidence received in both Civil Cases Nos. 947 and 4365, then, according to
appellants, there is no set of uniform evidence that would support the causes of
action in the three cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contentions are devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be pointed out that Civil Case No. 947
was not only for collection of an indebtedness, but also for foreclosure of the
mortgage constituted on the 3 parcels of land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The matter <span style="">or thing with </span>respect
to <span style="">which the </span>controversy arose <span style="">was </span>not only the amount collectible
from the debtor-mortgagor, but also the subject of the mortgage-contract, which
were the 3 par­cels of land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, in the
present action filed by appellants, it is evident that the things subject of
the litigation are the same lots.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the cause of action, H. E. <span class="SpellE">Heacock</span>
Company, as plain­tiff in Civil Case No. 947, had to establish not only its
right to collect the indebtedness, and to ask for the foreclosure of the mort­gage,
but also to show its right, as purchaser, to acquire the properties at the
public auction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Civil Case No.
Q-5894, on the other hand, it <span style="">was </span>clear
from the allegations of the complaint,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
as well as in its prayer, that the principal issue tendered by plaintiffs (and
the others depended upon it) was the annulment of the sale or award of the
properties to the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These matters were already finally passed
upon in Civil Cases No. 947 and 4365 of the court of first instance,
specifically in the order confirming the judicial sale, and in the decisions of
this Court in G. R. Nos. L-15233 and L-12786.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be true that the matter of the competency of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> company to acquire lands was not formally ruled on
in those 2 pre­vious cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, this is
so because appellants' predecessor never contested the corporate capacity of
said purchaser, which question properly should have been raised in Civil Case
No. 947, being germane to the approval of the sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therein defendants' failure to do so,
therefore, constituted waiver of that defense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, <span style="">when the judicial sale of
the properties was confirmed, the court </span>in effect recognized the
existence of all the elements for the valid­ity of the contract of <span style="">sale, viz., </span>the subject, consent (and capacity
of the parties), and consideration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After such confirmation of <span style="">the
sale, the mortgagor (and his successors, herein appellants) </span>lost the
right to redeem the foreclosed properties and to question the subsequent <span style="">conveyance </span>thereof to the De Guzman
spouses.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Clearly, the rulings in those 2 previous cases are <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> to the present action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well-settled that a change in the re­medy
sought or in the form of action is no bar to <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">res</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">(v. Moran, Rules of Court, 1963 ed., vol. 2, pp. 329, 330; Fran</span>cisco
vs. <span class="SpellE">Blas</span>, 93 Phil. 4).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The fatal flaw in
appellants' position lies in their inability (or unwillingness) to discern that
the foreclosure proceedings </span>(<span class="SpellE">Civ</span>. Case No.
947) in reality resolved two different issues: (1) the existence of the
mortgage indebtedness and the debtor's default, matters that were resolved by
the decree of foreclosure of the mortgage; and (2) the validity of the sale of
the mortgaged properties to the purchaser mortgagee, H. E. <span class="SpellE">Heacock</span>
Company, which <span style="">was </span>decided by
the trial court's order confirming the sale, and was finally upheld by the
superior courts. The validity of the sale to H. E. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Heacock</span></span><span style=""> necessarily involved the capacity </span>of the latter to <span style="">acquire </span>the land subject of the
foreclosure sale. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Hence, the
confirmation order concluded all future controversies about the sale to H. E. <span class="SpellE">Heacock</span> that appellants are seeking to <span class="SpellE">relitigate</span>
and revive in the present suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of
course, once the sale to H. E. <span class="SpellE">Heacock</span> is (as it was
in fact) adjudged valid, appellants lose all standing to question <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Heacock's</span></span><span style=""> subsequent transfers to the spouses </span>De
Guzman.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the foregoing conclusion, there is no necessity for us to
pass upon the issue of the timeliness or <span class="SpellE">untimeliness</span>
of the motion to dismiss of the defendants De Guzman also raised by appellants.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order appealed from is hereby affirmed,
