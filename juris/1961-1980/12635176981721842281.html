certiorari and prohibition with preliminary <span style="">injunction: one </span>filed by <span style="">petitioner
Pedro </span><span style="">M. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bermejo</span></span><span style=""> against City Judge Isidro Barrios and City
Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Quirico</span> <span class="SpellE">Abela</span> of </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Roxas</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">, docketed as Special Civil Case No. V-2721;

Civil Case No. V-2723.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No.L-23614, petitioner Pedro M. <span class="SpellE">Bermejo</span>
and Julia "Doe" (her identity at the time was unknown) were charged
in the city court of <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> City, on <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="8">August 22, 1963</st1:date>, of <span style="">the crime </span>of falsification of public
or official document in an information filed by the city fiscal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was alleged in the information that on or
about the 25th day of February 1963, in <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> City,
the two accused, being private individuals, conspired and confederated together
and mutually helped each other, and willfully and feloniously prepared and
executed a document consisting of an amended petition for <u>habeas</u> <u><span style="">corpus </span></u>entitled "Pedro <span style="">M. </span><span class="SpellE">Bermejo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> <span class="SpellE">Carmorin</span>,
petitioners, vs. Jose <span style="">M. </span><span class="SpellE">Bernales</span> and <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Bernales</span>, respondents", which petition Pedro M. <span class="SpellE">Bermejo</span> signed while Julia "Doe" placed her <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> over the name "<span class="SpellE">Jovita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Carmorin</span>", which petition was subscribed <span style="">and sworn </span>to by the two accused before
the Clerk of Court and filed in the Court of First Instance <span style="">of </span><span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>,
docketed as Special Proceeding No. 2669, thus the two accused stated and made
it appear in the amended peti­tion that the same was signed and sworn to by <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> <span class="SpellE">Carmorin</span> as one of the
petitioners when in truth and in fact the said <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Carmorin</span> never signed and swore to <span style="">it, </span>because it was in fact the accused
Julia "Doe" who signed and swore to that petition as Julia <span class="SpellE">Carmorin</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Relying on <span style="">the </span>certification
of the city fiscal that a preliminary investigation had been conducted by him
and <span style="">that </span>he had examined the
witnesses under oath before filing <span style="">the </span>information,
the City Judge, <span style="">Hon. </span>Isidro O.
Barrios, issued, on <st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1963</st1:date>,
an order <span style="">for the arrest of accused </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bermejo</span></span></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
prevent his incarceration, said accused put up the necessary bond.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bermejo</span></st1:place>
filed a motion to quash the information, alleging in substance: (1) that the
information did not charge an offense because the amended petition for <u><span style="">habeas</span></u><span style=""> <u>cor</u></span><u>p</u><u><span style="">us</span></u><span style=""> </span>(in Special Proceeding <span style="">No. </span>V-2669 of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>), allegedly falsified, is not a
document contemplated under the provisions of Article 172 of the Revised Penal
Code, and that in a previous judgment of the Court of First Instance <span style="">of </span><span class="SpellE">Capiz</span> in
the <u><span style="">habeas</span></u><span style=""> <u>corpus</u></span> proceedings <span style="">it was declared that the <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span>
in the amended peti­tion was that of <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> <span class="SpellE">Carmorin</span>; and (2) that the court did not acquire
jurisdiction over his person be</span>cause the warrant issued for his arrest
was illegal, Judge Barrios having issued the same without first examining the
witnesses under oath and in the form of searching questions and answers as
required under Repub­lic Act 3828.</p>

<p class="BODY">The city fiscal filed his opposition to the motion to quash,
contending that the petition for <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u> is a public
document; that the provisions of Republic Act 3828 are applicable only to
municipal <span style="">judges </span>and not to city
judges; and that the principle of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>, or conclusiveness of judgment, cannot be
invoked by the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After <st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bermejo</span></span></st1:place><span style=""> </span>had filed a supplement to <span style="">his </span>motion
to quash and a reply to the city <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> opposition,
respondent City Judge, on <st1:date year="1963" day="5" month="10">October 5,
 1963</st1:date>, issued an order denying the motion to quash.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1963</st1:date>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bermejo</span></st1:place> filed his motion for
reconsideration, but the same was denied for lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon he filed a petition for certiorari <span style="">and prohibition with preliminary injunction
before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>, naming
as respondents City </span><span style="">Judge </span><span style="">Isidro Barrios and City Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Quirico</span> <span class="SpellE">Abela</span>, contending that
City Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Abela</span> committed a grave abuse of discretion
in filing an information against him without conducting the proper preliminary
investigation, and that the City Judge committed a grave abuse of discretion in
denying his motion to quash, raising </span>practically the same issues <span style="">that </span>he raised in the motion to quash
before the city court, and praying that res­pondent City Judge be enjoined from
hearing the criminal case against him during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the special civil action <span style="">in the
Court </span>of <span style="">First Instance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In G.</span>R. No.
L-23615, <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> <span class="SpellE">Carmorin</span> <span style="">was </span>charged by respondent City Fiscal
<span class="SpellE">Quirico</span> <span class="SpellE">Abela</span> with perjury,
on August 23, 1963, in the same city court of <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
City (Criminal Case No. 4452) for allegedly having "subscrib­ed and swore
to an affidavit . . . . that she was really the one who signed with her <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> as <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> <span class="SpellE">Carmorin</span> . . . . <span style="">the
amended petition for <u>habeas corpus</u> . . . . when in </span><span style="">truth and in </span><span style="">fact, as she very well knew, she had not done such act of signing with
her <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> said peti</span>tion <span style="">and </span>it was another person, who signed
with a <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> said petition as <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Carmorin</span>. . . ." The city fiscal also certified
that he had conducted the preliminary investigation in accordance with law
before fil­ing the information.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the certification by the city fiscal that he had
conducted the proper preliminary investigation, respondent City Judge Barrios
issued <span style="">an order for the arrest of
accused <span class="SpellE">Carmorin</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After posting a bond, said accused, thru her counsel, Atty. Pedro M. <span class="SpellE">Bermejo</span> (the same person accused in the fal­sification
case), filed a motion to quash the informa­tion, alleging substantially, that
the court had not acquired jurisdiction over her person because the war­rant </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">arrest issued for her arrest was improvidently issued, the respondent
City Judge having issued the same without examining the witnesses personally in
the form of searching questions and answers in violation of Republic Act 3828,
and that no offense was commit­ted by the accused because it had already been
declared by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span> in
the </span><u><span style="">habeas</span></u><span style=""> <u>corpus</u></span><span style=""> case (Special Proceedings No. V-2669) that the <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span>
appearing in the petition for </span><u><span style="">habeas</span></u><span style=""> <u>corpus</u></span><span style=""> was the true <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> of accused <span class="SpellE">Carmorin</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After the city fiscal has filed his opposition to the motion to
quash, and the accused, her reply, on <st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="10">October
 15, 1963</st1:date>, City Judge Barrios issued an order denying the motion to
quash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Carmorin's</span>
motion for reconsideration having been denied, she likewise filed a petition
for certiorari and prohibition with preliminary injunction with the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>, also naming as respondents
City Judge Barrios and City Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Abela</span>, imputing
abuse of discretion on the part of City Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Abela</span>
in filing an information against her without conducting the proper preliminary
investigation, and on the part of respondent Judge Barrios in denying her
motion to quash, raising the same questions raised by her in her motion to
quash before the city court, and also <span style="">praying
</span>that respondent City Judge he enjoined from hearing the case pending
decision of the special civil action.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span>November 22,
1963, respondent city fiscal filed answers to the two petitions, admitting some
of the allegations in the petitions, and denying others; and setting up the
affirmative defense that the orders of respondent City Judge in the criminal
cases against the two petitioners can not be the subject of the peti<span style="">tions for certiorari and prohibition before
the Court </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>
because the city court of <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> City issued said
orders in the exercise </span><span style="">of its </span><span style="">concurrent jurisdiction </span><span style="">with </span><span style="">the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>, so that
the latter court has no jurisdiction to entertain the petitions for certiorari
and prohibition filed before it, pursuant to Section 87, </span><span style="">paragraph </span><span style="">(c) of Republic Act 296, as amended by Section 6 of Republic Act 3828.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Herein petitioners filed their replies to respondents' answers,
asserting that<span style=""> </span>the Court of
First Ins­tance of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span> has jurisdiction to take
cognizance of the two cases for certiorari and prohibition with preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the parties had filed their memoranda
in support of their respective contentions regarding the <span style="">jurisdiction of </span>the court, the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span> issued an order, on
January 6, 1964, declaring <span style="">that </span>it
had jurisdiction to take cognizance of the <span style="">two </span>special <span style="">civil </span>actions
for certiorari and prohibition with preliminary injunction, and the court set
the h<span style="">earing of </span>the two cases <span style="">for </span>January 24, 1964.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the hearing <span style="">of </span>the
two cases, which was held jointly, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Bermejo</span>
appeared and testified in his behalf and in behalf of his co-accused <span class="SpellE">Carmorin</span>, while Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Quirico</span> <span class="SpellE">Abela</span> testified for the prosecu­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the parties filed their
memoranda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="3" month="6">June 3, 1964</st1:date>, the Court of First Instance <span style="">of </span><span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>
rendered a decision dismissing the two petitions, with<span style="">out pronouncement as to costs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their joint motion for reconsideration having been denied, herein
petitioners brought the present appeals to this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Before resolving the questions posed in these appeals, We
consider it necessary to rule on the matter regarding the jurisdiction of the
Court of First Ins­tance of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span> to take cognizance
of <span style="">the </span>two petitions for
certiorari <span style="">and </span>prohibition with
preliminary injunction – a question that was properly raised by the res<span style="">pondents in the court below, although this
question is not now raised in the present appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">We
</span><span style="">hold that</span> the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span> erred in taking cognizance of
the two petitions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section <span style="">6 </span>of Republic <span style="">Act 3828, amending Section 87, paragraph (c) of the Judiciary Act of
1948, provides in part, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Justices of the peace in the capitals of provinces and
sub-provinces and judges of municipal courts shall have like jurisdiction as
the Court of First Instance to try parties charged with an offense committed
with­in their respective jurisdictions, in which the penalty provided by law
does not exceed <span class="SpellE">prision</span> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span>
or imprisonment for not more than six years or fine not exceeding six thousand
pesos or both, and in the absence of the dis­trict judge, shall have like
jurisdic­tion within the province as the Court of First Instance to hear
applications for bail.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"All cases filed under the next preceding paragraph with
justices of the peace of capitals and municipal <span style="">court </span>judges shall be tried and decided on the merits by the
respective justices of the peace or municipal judges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proceedings had shall be recorded and de­cisions
therein shall be <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> direct to the Court of
Appeals or the Supreme Court, as the case may be."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The crime of falsification of a public or official document by a
private individual, of which petitioner <span class="SpellE">Bermejo</span> is
charged in the city court of <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> City in Criminal
Case No. 4451, is punishable with <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">prision</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>cor­</u><u><span style="">reccional</span></u></span>
in its medium and maximum periods, while the crime of perjury of which
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Carmorin</span> is charged in Criminal Case No.
4452 before the city court of <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> City is
punishable with <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">arresto</span></u></span><span style=""> <u>mayor</u> </span>in its maximum period to

Undoubtedly, these two cases fall within the <span style="">concurrent </span>jurisdiction of the city court of <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
City and the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">Court, interpreting the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
provision of Re</span><span style="">public Act 3828,
ruled that "[w]here the municipal court (city court of Manila) has taken
cognizance </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">criminal </span><span style="">case in </span><span style="">its concurrent jurisdiction with </span><span style="">the Court of First Instance, appeal must be
taken </span><span style="">direct to the Court of
Appeals or the Supreme Court; and where the Court of First Instance has taken
cog­nizance of such appeal in its appellate jurisdiction and refused to elevate
the case to the Court of Appeals, said Court of First Instance acted without
jurisdiction.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> And this rule applies even if the order is
not a judgment on the merits because in cases of this nature the Court of First
Instance exer­cises no supervisory jurisdiction over the city court, and having
concurrent jurisdiction the city court acts with "like jurisdiction"
as the Court of First Instance.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It is Our view, therefore, that the decision
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span> in Special
Civil Cases Nos. 2721 and 2723, now appealed to this Court, is null and void
because said court has no jurisdiction to take cognizance of those cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two special civil actions against the
City Judge and the City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> City should
have been filed with the Court of Ap­peals in </span><span style="">aid </span><span style="">of the latter's appellate jurisdiction over
direct appeals from the decision or order of the city court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We note, however, that the decision of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span> is correct insofar
as it had dismissed the two petitions in question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Be that as it may, however, We believe that the error of the
petitioners in filing their petitions for certiorari and prohibition with
preliminary injunction <span style="">with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span> and the
error of the latter court in taking cognizance of those peti</span><span style="">tions should not deter Us from ruling on the
questions raised in the present appeals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The record shows that these proceedings have been pending for more than
six </span>years, and were We to remand these cases to the courts below so the
petitions for <span style="">certiorari should be
brought up to the Court of Appeals, our action would only cause further delay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We shall, therefore,
decide whether herein petitioners </span>are right in assailing the <span style="">correctness or lega­</span>lity of the
proceedings in the city court of <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> City in
connection with the two criminal <span style="">cases
filed against </span>them, as they now contend in the present ap­peals.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">While petitioners
maintain in the court below that the </span>City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
City has no power to initiate the investigation of cases without a previous
complaint by an offended party, they now admit in their brief that under the
existing laws he can commence such pre­liminary inquiry.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Nevertheless, petitioner <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bermejo</span></st1:place>
contends that before the city fiscal can conduct such preliminary
investigation, there must be a violation of the law, and in the instant case he
avers that there was no violation of law. Basis of his argument <span style="">is </span>that the petition for <u>habeas</u>
<u>corpus</u> not being a document as contemplated in Article 172 of the
Revised Penal Code, the city fiscal is precluded from conducting the
preliminary investigation, much less from filing the information, because <span class="SpellE">Bermejo</span> could not be prosecuted for falsification of the
alleged public or official document.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bermejo</span></st1:place>
is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The same principle also obtains in the

likewise complains that not­withstanding his request to be present at the preli­minary
investigation, the same was conducted in his absence or behind his back thus
denying him his day in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find,
however, in the record - and the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> so found too - that
on <st1:date year="1963" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1963</st1:date>, a <u>subpoena</u>
was issued to Atty. Pedro M. <span class="SpellE">Bermejo</span> requir­ing him
to appear at the office of the city fiscal of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Roxas</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
on <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1963</st1:date> in an
investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <u>subpoena</u> was
received by <span class="SpellE">Bermejo</span> on March 12, 1963, <span style="">and </span>on the same day he sent a letter
to the city fiscal, which was received by the latter in the afternoon of the
same day, requesting that the investigation be postponed to March 19, 1963
because he (<span class="SpellE">Bermejo</span>) had to attend to another case
which was scheduled to be heard on <span style="">the
same </span>date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The city fiscal
acceded to his req<span style="">uest, </span>but
because the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> office failed to notify him of
the hearing on <st1:date year="1963" day="19" month="3">March 19, 1963</st1:date>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bermejo</span></st1:place> was not present when
the investigation was conducted on that day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The preliminary investigation was conducted on the very day requested by
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bermejo</span></st1:place>, and after finding
that there was a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> case the city fiscal filed the
informa­tion against him on <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="8">August 22,
 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears, therefore, <span style="">that
</span>while the city fiscal failed to notify petitioner <span class="SpellE">Bermejo</span>
that his request for postponement was granted, which should have been done, it
can also be <span style="">said </span>that <span class="SpellE">Bermejo</span> was not entirely blameless it the preliminary
investigation was conducted in his absence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was he himself who set the date of the investigation in his request
for postponement, but he did not bother to come on the date he fixed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did he try to find out what action
the city fiscal had taken on his request for postponement, on any day before <span style="">the </span>date <span style="">of </span>the hearing set by him, although he is living in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Roxas</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
where the city fiscal holds his office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the information was filed five months later, and this
petitioner never inquired, at least as to the status of his case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This behavior of petitioner cannot merit Our
approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is obvious that he failed
to employ <span style="">the </span>standard of care
or reasonable diligence that is expected <span style="">of
</span>him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His unwarranted absence on
the <span style="">day of the hearing which he </span><span style="">himself </span><span style="">requested, coupled with his seeming indifference or unconcern about his
case, is a clear indication that he was guilty of gross negligence in the
protection of his rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he did not
have his day in court, it was because of his own negligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If </span><span style="">he </span><span style="">was really interested
to attend the investigation, as he now pretends, he should have taken </span><span style="">pains </span><span style="">to communicate with the city fiscal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court had ruled that in the application
of the principle of due process, what </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">sought to be
safeguarded is not lack of previous notice </span><span style="">but </span><span style="">the denial of
opportunity to be heard.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Since petitioner </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bermejo</span></span></st1:place><span style=""> was afforded the opportunity to appear at </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">preliminary investigation but did not take advantage of it, he has no
one to blame but himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, said
petitioner's rights can still be amply protected in the regular trial </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the case against him in the city court where he can cross-examine the

<p class="BODY">Having arrived at the conclusion that respondent city fiscal did
not abuse his discretion in conducting the preliminary investigations and that
he filed the <span class="SpellE">informations</span> against herein petitioners
in accordance with law, there is, therefore, no merit in the <span style="">assert­</span>ion of petitioners that <span style="">the warrants of arrest </span>issued <span style="">for their arrest were illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, granting </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">arguendo</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">that
the orders of arrest were tainted with irregularity, still the posting by
petitioners of their bail bonds amounted to a waiver of the effect of said
defects.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"There is merit in the assertion that the warrant of arrest
was irregularly issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 87 of
the Judiciary Act as amended by Republic Act 3828 requires that the Municipal
Judge issuing the same, <u>personally</u>, examine under oath the witnesses,
and by <u>searching</u> questions and answers which are to be reduced to
writing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, instead of searching
questions and answers, we have only the af­fidavits of respondent and her one
wit­ness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, said affidavits were
sworn to before Judge <span class="SpellE">Cabungcal</span>, not before Judge <span class="SpellE">Juntereal</span> who issued the warrant of arrest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"However, the giving of bail bond by petitioner constitutes a
waiver of the irregularity attending her arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, by her <span style="">other </span>personal appear­ances before the municipal court and the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, petitioner voluntarily <span style="">submitted </span>herself to <span style="">the
court's jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Hence, the
absence of preli­minary examination becomes moot already, the court having
acquired jurisdiction over the person of petitioner and could therefore proceed
with the preliminary <span style="">investigation
proper." (<span class="SpellE">Doce</span> v. </span><span style="">Branch II, Court of </span><span style="">First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, et al., supra; Luna-v. Plaza,

<p class="BODY">The other point raised by petitioners in their contention that
the respondent City Judge abused his discretion in denying their motion to
quash is that there was a judicial declaration in the <u><span style="">habeas</span></u><span style=""> <u>corpus</u> </span>case (Special Proceedings No. V-2669) that the <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> appearing in the petition was the genuine <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> of <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> <span class="SpellE">Carmorin</span>, and that pronouncement is now conclusive so that
they cannot be prosecuted for falsification or perjury, as <span style="">the </span>case may be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This particular question should rather be
submitted and <span style="">threshed out in </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">city court during </span><span style="">the
trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">The record of the <u>habeas</u> </span><u><span style="">corpus </span></u><span style="">proceeding is
not before </span><span style="">Us, </span><span style="">and We have no means of knowing what actually
transpired in that proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
proper determina­tion of this question </span><span style="">will </span><span style="">involve not only
the in­troduction and consideration of evidence, but also calls for a detailed
inquiry on the principle of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> by, or
conclusiveness of, jud</span><span style="">g</span><span style="">ment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Also devoid or merit is <span style="">the
</span>other error pointed to by petitioners with respect to the alleged <span style="">admis</span>sion by respondents that they acted
illegally, cap­riciously, or in excess of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A cursory examination of their answers would
reveal that what was admitted by respondent was the fact of the filing by
petitioners of their pleadings, but not the allega­tions contained therein,
for, as shown in <span style="">the </span>record,
respondents have staunchly defended their acts and insisted that their
actuations are legal or in accordance with law.</p>
