<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petition for 
review of a decision of the Workmen's Compensation 
Commission.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> Hernandez was employed by <span class="SpellE">respondent</span> Manila Electric Company, hereafter called MERALCO, 
on May 15, 1930, as automotive mechanic. The work entailed, among other things, 
the dismantling, repair and installation of transmissions, differentials and 
steering wheels of trucks. Admittedly, he was then in good 
health.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On January 15, 1953—after 23 
years continuous service-Hernandez was found to be suffering from pulmonary 
tuberculosis. From 1953 to 1959, his X-ray examinations indicated presence of 
"minimal, <span class="SpellE">fibrotic</span> infiltration of both apices". 
During said period he received treatment for said disease from <span class="SpellE">MERALCO's</span> physician at its clinic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Aside from pulmonary 
tuberculosis, Hernandez contracted inguinal hernia, and underwent operation 
therefore, in 1954. Still later, on September 18, 1959, he had carcinoma of the 
prostate, and was likewise operated on for it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Pursuant to its general circular 
on "Leaves and Retirement" providing that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"When an employee shall have (a) 
Completed 30 years of continuous, faithful and satisfactory service to the 
Company, or (b) Reached his 60th birthday, said employee shall be retired from 
the service and be paid the full amount credited to his 'Retirement 
Account’,”<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">MERALCO advised Hernandez on May 
8, 1959 that he will be retired on December 31, 1959 and be paid his "Retirement 
Account". At his own request, however, Hernandez was retired on November 25, 
1959 and was paid his retirement benefits. He was then 69 years 
old.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On March 10, 1960, Hernandez 
filed with the Department of Labor a notice of Sickness and Claim for 
Compensation. Subsequently, this was superseded by an Amended Claim filed on 
March 7, 1961. The claimant alleged, in brief, that due to illness suffered in 
the course of his employment he was forced to retire due to disability to work 
but respondent MERALCO did not pay him compensation as provided by 
law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After MERALCO filed its answer 
<span class="SpellE">controverting</span> the claim, the Department of Labor, 
Regional Office No. 4, heard the case. On February 1, 1962, the hearing officer 
decided that claimant was entitled to disability compensation, 
thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Wherefore the Manila Electric 
Company is hereby adjudged pay Mr. <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> Hernandez, 
through this Office, the sum of FOUR THOUSAND PESOS (P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>) as temporary total disability compensation pursuant 
to the instant Claim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Respondent is further ordered to 
pay to this Office the sum of FORTY One Pesos (P41.00) as fees pursuant to Sec. 
55 of Act No. 3428, as amended.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Counsel for claimant may not 
charge the latter, attorney's fees in excess of the limit provided for under 
Section 6 Rule 26 of the Rules of the Workmen's Compensation 
Commission.<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"So 
ordered."</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">A petition for review of the 
hearing officer's decision was filed by MERALCO before the Workmen's 
Compensation Commission. On June 25, 1962, the Associate Commissioner designated 
thereon rendered a decision reversing that of the hearing officer. On a motion 
for reconsideration by the claimant, the Workmen's Compensation Commission, 
<i>en banc</i>, affirmed the Associate Commissioner's decision, per its 
resolution of August 22, 1962. Accordingly, the claimant has 
appealed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The record shows that petitioner 
was forced to ask for retirement ahead of schedule not because of his old age, 
but principally because of his weakened bodily condition due to his illness. At 
the time of his actual retirement, on November 25, 1959, petitioner was still 
being treated for his pulmonary tuberculosis which was definitely pronounced 
arrested only on April 6, 1961. As the hearing officer found, and MERALCO does 
not dispute it, the Employer's Report of Sickness in fact stated that Hernandez 
retired due to "minimal PTB, bilateral, fibroid". There is therefore no denying 
the fact that petitioner's aforesaid sickness, contracted in the course of his 
employment, and not merely his age, was responsible for his untimely 
retirement—36 days ahead of schedule—from the service of 
MERALCO.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The reason given by the Workmen's 
Compensation Commission in rejecting compensation for petitioner's tuberculosis 
was that since it took 23 years for the disease to 'Manifest itself the same 
could not have been due to Petitioner's working conditions. Such a view runs 
counter to our ruling in Agustin vs. WCC, L-19957, September 29, 1964, that once 
the disease has been shown to have in the course of the employment, it is 
presumed by law, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, that it 
arose out of it Petitioner's tuberculosis admittedly arose in the course of his 
employment. The fact alone that 23 years had elapsed before the disease appeared 
is not substantial evidence that it did not arise out of the 
employment:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The Commission does not refer to 
any evidence showing that the disease of the claimant could not have been due to 
the conditions in which he had been working for so many years. It merely 
speculates that it could not have so originated, because after 23 years the 
tuberculosis was found to be minimal. We find this speculation insufficient to 
rebut the statutory presumption, since it does not exclude the probability that 
the conditions of work reduced the resistance of the laborer's body to the point 
that he was unable to withstand the infection. Also, the Commission's reasoning 
is faulty, in that the number of years, that elapsed before the disease became 
manifest merely tends to prove that the deterioration caused by working 
conditions was slow, but not that the working conditions did not cause such 
deterioration in the health of the laborer." (Agustin vs. WCC, 
supra)<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Since petitioner is entitled to 
compensation payments due to his pulmonary tuberculosis, we find it unnecessary 
and academic to resolve whether his inguinal hernia and carcinoma of the 
prostate likewise entitle him to the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner's compensation, 
however, should be for his inability to work during the remaining 36 days before 
his scheduled compulsory retirement. Since he was <span class="SpellE">retirable</span> on December 31, 3959 and has in fact received from 
MERALCO his retirement benefits, it cannot be said that <i>subsequent to said 
date</i> his inability to work was due to his sickness. There is no evidentiary 
basis to support an award for compensation payment even after December 31, 1959. 
From the record it could only be concluded that petitioner's earning capacity, 
independent of his sickness, ended on December 31, 1959, so that compensation 
payments, which are premised on loss or impairment of earning capacity due to 
illness or injury, cannot extend beyond that date. In this regard compensation 
differs from medical and hospital service and supplies. An employer's obligation 
to provide the latter subsists until the illness is cured or arrested, pursuant 
to Section 13 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as long as the illness was 
contracted during the employee's employment (<span class="SpellE">ltogon-Suyoc</span> Mines, Inc. <i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Dulay</span>, L-18974, <span class="GramE">September</span> 30, 
1963). The present case involves only compensation payments since MERALCO had 
voluntarily provided Hernandez with medical and hospital services and 
supplies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As to the alleged prescription, 
suffice it to say that by voluntarily furnishing medical service and supplies 
MERALCO dispensed with the need for petitioner to file his Notice of Sickness 
within the time limit therefore (Section 24, Workmen's Compensation Act). With 
regard to the two-month period for the filing of a claim for compensation, the 
same should be counted from the date when the disease or illness becomes 
compensable, that is, from the date the employee becomes physically disabled to 
work (Peter Paul Philippine Corporation vs. Workmen's Compensation Commission, 
L-19612, July 30, 1964). Petitioner herein was thus disabled only on November 
25, 1959. While his formal claim was filed on March 10, 1960, or beyond the 
two-month period, his request for retirement on November 25, 1959 predicated on 
sickness causing his disability from working until his scheduled retirement on 
December 31, 1959, substantially fulfills the requirement of a claim, for then 
the company cannot plead surprise in the preparation of its defense, which is 
the only reason for requiring an early filing of the claim on the part of the 
employee (Luzon Stevedores Co., Inc. <i>vs</i>. WCC, L-19742, January 31, 
1964).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner's applicable average 
weekly wage has been shown to be P69.60 (P11.60 x 6 days). Sixty per cent 
thereof is P41.76, so he is entitled to the maximum of P35.00 weekly 
compensation for the period from November 25, 1959 to December 31, 1959, 
exclusive of the first three days pursuant to Section 14 of the Workmen's 
Compensation Act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; text-transform: uppercase; font-family: Verdana;">Wherefore</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the decision appealed from is 
reversed and respondent Manila Electric Company (MERALCO) is hereby ordered to

</span><st1:date month="11" day="25" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 25,

exclusive of the first three days. Respondent is further ordered to pay to the 
Workmen's Compensation Commission the expenses provided for in Sec. 55 of Act 
No. 3428. No costs in this instance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
