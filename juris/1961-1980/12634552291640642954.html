<p class="BODY">Finding the foregoing joint petition to be "conformable to <span style="">law," the CFI (Judge Jose F. Fernandez,
presiding) issued an order on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="4"><span style="">April 27, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, rendering judgment (hereinafter referred to
as the compromise judgment) approving and incorporating <u><span style="">in</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>toto</u> their compromise agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In compliance with para­graph 4(e) of their
mutual agreement (par. 3[e] of the compromise judgment), the petitioner spouse
delivered all the four children to the respondent spouse and remitted money for
their support.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On May 7, 1963 the
respondent spouse filed in the JDRC a motion wherein she alleged that she
"entered into and signed the . . . Joint Petition as the only means by
which she could have immediate custody of the . . ; minor children who are all
below the age of 7," and thereafter prayed that she “be considered
relieved <span style="">of the . . . </span>agreement
pertaining to the custody and visitation of her minor children . . . and that
since all the children <span style="">are now in her
custody, </span>the said custody in her favor he confirmed <u><span style="">pendente</span></u><span style=""> <u>lite</u>." On </span></span><st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="5"><span style="">May
 24, </span><span style="">1963</span></st1:date><span style=""> the petitioner spouse opposed the said mo­tion
and moved to dismiss the complaint based, among other <span style="">things, on the </span>grounds of <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u> and <u>lis</u>
<u>pendens</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The JDRC, <span style="">on </span></span><st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="5"><span style="">May 28, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><span style="">issued
an order which sustained the petitioner <span style="">spouse's
plea of </span>bar by prior judgment and its </span><u>pendens</u>, <span style="">and dis­missed the case. After the denial of her
motion for reconsidera­tion, the respondent </span>spouse <span style="">interposed an appeal to the Court of Appeals
(CA-G.R. No. 32608-R) wherein she raised, among others, the issue of validity
or legality of the compromise agreement in connection only with the custody of
their minor children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1964" day="14" month="10"><span style="">Oc­tober
 14, 1964</span></st1:date><span style=""> the Court
of Appeals certified the said appeal to the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-23767),
since "no hearing on the facts was ever held in the court below - no
evidence, testimonial or do­cumentary, presented - only a question or law pends
resolution in the appeal."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The respondent spouse
likewise filed a motion dated May 15, 1963 for reconsideration of the <span style="">compromise judgment dated April 27, 1963
rendered in </span>special proceeding 6978 of the CFI, <span style="">wherein she </span>also alleged, among others, that </span><span style="">she </span><span style="">entered into the joint petition as the only means by which she could
have mediate custody of her minor children, and thereafter prayed <span style="">the CFI to reconsider </span>its judgment
pertaining to the custody and <span style="">visi­tation
of </span>her minor children and to relieve her from the said <span style="">agreement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The </span>petitioner spouse opposed the said <span style="">motion and, on </span></span><st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="6"><span style="">June 1, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, filed a motion </span><span style="">for execution of the compromise <span style="">judgment and </span>a charge for
contempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The CFI (Judge Jose R. <span style="">Querubin, </span>presiding), in its order
dated June 22, 1963, denied the respondent spouse's motion for <span style="">reconsideration, </span>granted <span style="">the </span></span>petitioner spouse's motion
for execution, and ordered that upon "failure on the part of Carmen San
Jose-Lacson to deliver the said children [i. e., to return the two older
children Enrique and Maria Teresa in accordance with her agreement with Alfonso
Lacson) to the special sheriff on or before June 29, 1963, she may be held for
contempt pursuant to the provisions of Rule 39 sections 9 and 10, and Rule 64
section 7 of the (old) Rules of Court." From the aforesaid compromise
judgment dated <st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1963</st1:date>
and execution order dated <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="6">June 22,
 1963</st1:date>, the respondent spouse interposed an appeal to the Court of
Appeals (CA.-G.R. No. 32798-R) wherein she, likewise questioned the validity or
legality of her agreement with the petitioner spouse respecting custody of
their children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="2">February 11, 1965</st1:date> the Court of Ap­peals also
certified the said appeal to the Supreme Court (G. R. No. L-24259), since
"no evidence of any kind was introduced be­fore the trial court and . . .
appellant did not specifically ask to be allowed to present evidence on her
behalf."</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent spouse also instituted <u>certiorari</u> proceed­ings
before the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. No. 32334-R), now the subject of au appeal
by <u>certiorari</u> to this Court (G. R. No. L­-23482). In her petition for <u>certiorari</u>
dated <st1:date year="1933" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1933</st1:date>, she
averred that the CFI (thru Judge Querubin) committed grave abuse of discretion
and acted in excess of jurisdiction in order­ing the immediate execution <span style="">of </span>the compromise judgment in its
order of <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="6">June 22, 1963</st1:date>,
thus in effect depriving her of the right to appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She prayed for (1) the issuance of a writ of
prelimi­nary injunction enjoining the respondents therein and any person acting
under them from enforcing, by contempt proceedings and other means, the writ of
execution issued pursuant to the order of the respondent Judge Querubin dated
June 22, 1963 in special proceeding 6978 of the CFI, (2) the setting aside,
after hearing, of the compromise judgment dated April 27, 1963 and the order
dated June 22, 1963, and (3) the awarding of the custody of Enri­que and Maria
Teresa <span style="">to </span>her, their
mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As prayed for, the Court of
Appeals issued ex <u>parte</u> a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining the
enforcement of the order dated June 22, 1963 for execution of the compromise
judgment rendered <span style="">in </span>special
pro­ceeding 6978.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner spouse
filed an urgent motion dated <st1:date year="1963" day="5" month="7">July 5,
 1963</st1:date> for the dissolution of the writ of <span style="">preliminary injunc­tion ex </span><u><span style="">parte</span></u><span style="">, </span><span style="">which urgent motion was denied </span>by the Court of <span style="">Appeals in</span> its resolution dated <st1:date year="1963" day="9" month="7">July 9, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner spouse likewise filed his
answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After hearing, the Court of
Appeals on May 11, 1964 promulgated in said <u>certiorari</u> case (CA-G.R. No.
32384-R) its decision granting the petition for <u>certiorari</u> and declaring
null and void both (a) the compromise judgment <span style="">dated <span style="">April 27, </span>1963 in
so far as it relates to the custody and right <span style="">of visitation </span>over the two children, Enrique and Teresa, and (b) the
order dated June 22, 1963 for execution of said judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner spouse moved to reconsider,

Court of Appeals erred in ruling that the compromise agreement upon which the
judg<span style="">ment is based violates article 363
of the Civil Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As heretofore adverted,
the aforecited three appeals converge on one focal issue; whether the compromise
agreement entered into by the parties and the judgment of the CFI grounded on
the said agreement, are conformable to law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We hold that the
compromise agreement and the judgment of the CFI grounded on the said agreement
</span><span style="">are </span><span style="">valid with respect to the separation of
property of the spouses and the dissolution of the conjugal partnership.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The law allows separation
of property of the spouses and the dissolution of their conjugal partnership
provided judicial sanction is secured <span style="">beforehand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Thus the new Civil Code pro­vides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>"In the absence of an
express declaration<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in the marriage <span style="">settlements,</span> <u>the separation
property between spouses during </u><u><span style="">the
</span>marriage shall</u> not <u>take place</u> save<span style=""> <u>in virtue of a judicial </u></span><u><span style="">it order</span></u><span style="">.” (Art. 190</span>, emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>The husband and the wife may agree upon the dissolution of
the conjugal partnership during marriage</u>, <u>subject to judicial approval</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the creditors of the husband and of the
wife, as well as of the conjugal partnership, shall be notified any petition
for judicial approval of the voluntary dissolution of the conjugal partnership,
so that any such creditors may appear at the hearing to safeguard his
interests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon approval of the petition
for dissolution of the conjugal partnership, the court shall take such measures
as may protect the <span style="">creditors and other
third persons.” </span><span style="">(A</span><span style="">rt. 191, par. 4, underscoring supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the spouses obtained judicial imprimatu<span style="">r of their separation of property and the
dissolution </span><span style="">of their</span><span style=""> conjugal partnership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not appear that they have creditors
who will be prejudiced by the said arrangements.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is likewise undisputed that the couple have teen separated in
fact for at least five years - the wife's residence being in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
and the husband's in the conjugal home in <st1:place><st1:placename>Bacolod</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, inasmuch as a lengthy separation
has supervened bet­ween them, the propriety of severing their financial and
proprietary interests is manifest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, this Court cannot constrain the spouses to live
together, <span style="">as<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"[It] not within the province of the courts <span style="">of </span>this country to attempt to compel
one of the spouses to cohabit with, and render conjugal rights to, the
other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * At best <span style="">such </span>an order can be effec­tive <span style="">for </span>no other purpose than to compel the
spouses to live under the same roof; and the experience of those countries
where the courts of justice have assumed to compel the cohabitation of married
couple shows that the policy of the practice is extremely questionable."
(Arroyo v. Vasquez de Arroyo, 42 Phil. 54, 60)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">However, in so approving
the regime of </span>separation of pro<span style="">perty
of the spouses </span><span style="">and the
dissolution of </span><span style="">their conjugal
partner­ship, </span><span style="">tilts </span><span style="">Court does not thereby accord recognition to
nor </span><span style="">lega­lize </span><span style="">the <u>de</u> </span><u><span style="">facto</span></u><span style=""> separation of the spouses, which again in the </span><span style="">language of <u>Arroyo </u></span><u>v.
Vasquez de Arroyo,</u> <u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style=""> - </span>is a "state which is abnormal
and fraught with grave danger to all concerned.” We would like to douse the
momentary seething emotions of cou­ples who, at the slightest ruffling of
domestic tranquility - brought about by "mere austerity of temper,
petulance of manners, rude<span style="">ness </span>of
language, a want of civil attention and accommodation, even occasional sallies
of passion" without more - would be minded to separate from each
other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this jurisdiction, the husband
and the wife are obliged to live together, observe mutual respect and fide­lity,
and render mutual help and support (art. 109, new Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is, therefore, virtue in making it as
difficult as possible for married couples - impelled by no better cause than
their whims and caprices - to abandon each other's company.</p>

<blockquote>"'* * * For though in particular cases the re­pugnance of the
law to dissolve the obligations of ma­trimonial cohabitation may operate with
great severity upon individuals, yet it must be carefully remembered that the
general happiness of the married life is se­cured by its indissolubility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When people understand that they must live
together, except for <span style="">a </span>very few
reasons known to the law, they learn to soften by mu­tual accommodation that
yoke which they know they cannot shake off; they become good husbands and good
wives from the necessity of remaining husbands and wives; for necessity is a
powerful master in teaching the duties which it imposes * * *.' (Evans vs.
Evans, 1 Hag. Con., 35; 161 <st1:country-region><st1:place>Eng.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
Reprint, 466, 467.)" (Arroyo vs. Vasquez de Arroyo, <u>Id</u>., pp. 58-59)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We now come to the question of the custody and support of the
children.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is </span>not disputed
that it was the JDRC which first acquired jurisdiction over the matter of
custody and support, of the children.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The complaint docketed as civil case E-00030 in the JDRC was filed by
the respondent spouse on <st1:date year="1963" day="12" month="3">March 12,
 1963</st1:date>, whereas the joint petition of the parties docketed as special
proceedings 6978 <span style="">in </span>the CFI was
filed on <st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, when the respon­<span style="">dent spouse </span>signed the joint petition
on the same matter of custody <span style="">and support </span>of the children and filed the
same with the CFI of Ne­gros Occidental, she in effect abandoned her action in
the JDRC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner spouse - who
could have raised the issue of lis pendens in abatement of the case filed in
the CFI, but did not do so - had the right, therefore, to cite the decision of
the CFI and to ask for the dismissal of the action filed by the respondent
spouse in the JDRC, on the grounds of lee <u>judicata</u> and <u>lis</u> <u>pendens</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the <span style="">acted
correctly and justifiably in dismissing</span> <span style="">the case for custody and support of the children based on those
grounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it is no defense against
the dismissal of the action that the case before the CFI was filed later than
the action before the JDRC, considering<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"* * * [That the Rules do not require as a ground for
dismissal of a complaint that there is a <u><span style="">prior </span></u>pending action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They provide only that there <span style="">is
a pending action, not a pending prior action.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the Court of Appeals, however, that the CFI erred
in depriving the mother, the respondent spouse, of the custody of the two older
children (both then below the age of 7).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Civil Code
specifically commands in the second sentence of its article 363 that "No
mother-shall be separated from her child under seven years of age, unless the
court finds com­pelling reasons for such measure,” The <u>rationale</u> of this
new provision was explained </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">the
Code Commission, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The general rule is recommended <span style="">in </span>order to avoid many a tragedy where a mother has seen her
baby torn away from her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No man can
sound the deep sorrows of a mother who is deprived of her child of tender <span style="">age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
exception allowed by the <span style="">rule has to be
for 'compelling reasons for the good of the child:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>those c</span>ases <span style="">must indeed be rare, if the mother's heart is not to be unduly
hurt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If she has erred, as in cases of
adultery, the penalty of impri­sonment and the (relative) divorce decree will
ordi­narily be sufficient punishment </span>for <span style="">her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, her moral

in article 363 of the Civil Code, Coupled with the observations made by the
Code Commission in<span style=""> respect to the said
legal provision, underscores its mandatory character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It prohibits in no uncertain terms the
separation of a mother and her child below seven </span><span style="">years, </span><span style="">unless such
separa­tion is grounded upon compelling reasons as determined by a court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The order dated April 27,
1963 of' the CFI, in so far as it awarded custody of the two older children who
were 6 and 5 </span><span style="">years </span><span style="">old, respectively, to the father, in effect
sought to separate them from their mother.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To that extent therefore, it was null and void because clearly violative
of article 363 of the Civil Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Neither does the said
award of custody fall within the ex­ception because the record is bereft of any

children's company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True, the stated in
its order dated June </span><span style="">22, 1963, </span><span style="">denying the respondent spouse's motion</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">for

<blockquote>"* * *If the parties <span style="">have
</span>agreed to file a joint petition, it was because they wanted to avoid the
exposure of the bitter truths which serve as succulent morsel for scandal
mongers <span style="">and </span><span style="">idle</span><span style=""> gossipers and to save their children from embarrassment and
inferiority complex </span><span style="">which may </span><span style="">inevitably stain their lives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * If the parties agreed to submit the
matter of </span><span style="">cus­</span><span style="">tody </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the minor children to
the Court for in</span>corporation in the final judgment, they purpose­ly
suppressed the 'compelling reasons for such measure' from appearing in the
public records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is for the sake and
for the welfare of the minor children."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But the foregoing statement is at best a mere hint that there
were compelling reasons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower
court's order is eloquently silent on what these compelling reasons are.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to state, courts cannot proceed on
mere insinuations; they must be confronted with facts before they can properly
adjudicate.</p>

<p class="BODY">It might be argued - and correctly - that since five years have
elapsed since the filing of these cases in 1963, the ages of the four children
should<span style=""> </span>now be as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Enrique - 11, Maria Teresa - 10, Gerrard - 9,
and Ramon – 5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the issue
regarding the award of the custody of Enrique and Maria Teresa to the petitioner
spouse has become moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
passage of time has removed the prop which supports the respon­dent spouse's
position.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nonetheless, this Court is loath to uphold the couple's agreement
regarding the custody of the children.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 356 of the new Civil Code provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Every child:</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(1)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Is entitled to parental care;</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(2)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Shall receive at least elementary edu­cation;</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(3)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Shall be given moral and civic training by the
parents or guardian;</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(4)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Has a right to live in an atmosphere conducive
to his physical, moral and intellectual development."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clear that the abovequoted legal provision grants to every
child rights which are not and should not be dependent solely on the wishes,
much less the whims and caprices, of his parents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His welfare should not be subject to the
parents' say-so or mu­tual agreement alone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Where, as in this case, the parents are already separated in fact, the
courts must step in to determine in whose custody the child can better be
assured the rights gran­ted to him by law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The need, therefore, to present evidence regarding this matter, becomes
imperative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A careful scrutiny of the
records reveals that no such evidence was <span style="">introduced in </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">CFI.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">This
latter </span>court relied merely on the mutual agreement of the
spouses-parents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be sure, this was
not a sufficient <span style="">basis </span></span><span style="">to </span><span style="">determine the fitness </span><span style="">of each parent to be <span style="">the custodian of the children.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Besides,
at </span><span style="">least one of the children -
En<span style="">rique, the eldest - is now eleven
years </span>of age and should be given the choice <span style="">of the parent he wishes to </span>live with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the clear mandate of <span style="">sec. 6, Rule 99 of the </span>Rules of Court
which states, <u>inter</u> <u>alia</u>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>“* * * When husband and wife
are divorced <span style="">or living </span>separately
and apart, from <span style="">each other, and the
question as to </span>the care, custody, ands control of a child or children of
their <span style="">marriage is brought before </span>a
Court of First Instance by <span style="">peti</span><span style="">tion or as an </span><span style="">incident to any other <span style="">proceeding, the </span></span><span style="">court,
upon </span>hearing testimony as may be perti<span style="">nent, shall </span>aware the care, custody, and control <span style="">of each such child as will be for its best
interests, </span><u><span style="">permitti</span>ng<span style=""> the child to choose which parent it prefers
to live </span>with if it be over ten years of age,</u> <span style="">unless the </span>parent so chosen be until to take charge of the child
by reason of moral depravity, habitual drunkenness or poverty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * *" (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">One last point regarding
the matter of support for the children - assuming that the custody of any or
more of the children will be finally awarded </span>to <span style="">the mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the spouses
have agreed upon the monthly support </span>P150<span style=""> to be given by the petitioner spouse for each child, still this </span>Court
must<span style=""> speak out its mind on the
insufficiency of this amount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We take
judicial notice of the devaluation of the peso in 1962 and the steady
skyrocketing of prices of all commodities, goods, and services, not to mention</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">the
fact that all the children are already of school age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe, there­fore, that the CFI may
increase this amount of P150 according to the needs of each child.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With the view that we
take of this case, we find it unnecessary to pass upon the other errors
assigned in the three appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
