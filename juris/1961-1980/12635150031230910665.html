petitioners manifested that they "would now have no objection to the

appraisal, to secure the payment of the entire compromise amount."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In view of the expiration
of the two-year period stipulated in paragraph 2 of the compromise agreement
with­out petitioners' having paid their indebtedness, respondent bank moved for
execution of the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
a writ of execution was issued by respondent Judge on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="21" month="8"><span style="">August
 21, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1964" day="3" month="9"><span style="">September
 3, 1964</span></st1:date><span style=""> petitioners
filed a motion to lift the attachment and any levy made by respondent sheriff
on two (2) parcels of land in question, invoking for the first time Section 8</span><span style="">, </span><span style="">paragraph one, of Republic Act. No. 477, which states:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Except in
favor of the Government or any of its branches, units, or institutions, land
acquired under the provisions of this Act or any permanent improvements thereon
shall not <span style="">be subject to encumbrance or
alienation from the date of the award of the land or the improvements thereon
and for a term of ten years from and after the date of issuance of the
certificate of title nor shall they become liable to the satisfaction of any
debt contracted prior to the expiration of such period."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge denied the motion in his Order <span style="">dated </span><st1:date year="1955" day="24" month="2"><span style="">February 24, 1955</span></st1:date><span style="">, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>, it
appears that the prohibition contained in the above quoted provision to the
effect that said lands shall not "become liable to the satisfaction of any
debt contracted prior to the expiration of such period" or "for <span style="">a term of ten years from and after the date
of issuance of the certifi­cate of title", is not annotated on the said
Transfer Certificate of Title Nos. 5049 and 5050.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Moreover, the herein defendants are now <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>
from raising the ille­gality of the levy in question by virtue of the fact that
said defendants in a compromise agreement entered into by them with the
plaintiff on July 21, 1962, placed as security for the payment of their
indebtedness the said two (2) parcels of land, and that when the same parcels
were levied upon under the writ of attachment issued by this Court, the
defendants never raised the legality of the levy but instead agreed to
guarantee their compliance with the same compromise agreement with the very
same parcels."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners moved to reconsider but were turned down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, on <st1:date year="1965" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1965</st1:date>, respondent sheriff of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>, in compliance with the writ
of execution previously issued by respondent Judge, levied upon the parcels of
land in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, before the
sheriff could proceed with the sale petitioners filed this petition for
certiorari, with a prayer for preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the first ground on which respondent Judge denied
the motion to lift the attachment, petitioners contend that the exemption of the
two (2) parcels of land from liability for any obligation contracted prior to
the expiration of ten years from and after the issuance of the certificates of
title is a right which arises from law and is therefore binding on respondent
bank even if not registered, citing paragraph 1, section 39 of Act No. 496,
which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 39.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every person
receiving a certificate of title in pursuance of a decree of registration and
every purchaser of registered land who takes a certificate of title for value
in good faith shall hold the <span style="">same free </span>from
all encumbrances except those noted on said certificate and any of the
following encumbrances which may <span style="">be </span>subsisting,
namely:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"First Liens, claim or rights arising or existing under the
laws or Constitution of the United States or of the Philippine <span style="">Islands which the sta­tutes of the Philippine
Islands cannot require to appear on record in the registry."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find no merit in
petitioners' position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first
place the prohibition in Section </span>8 <span style="">of
Republic Act. No. 477 is not a "lien, claim or right" arising or
existing under a law which cannot be required to appear on record in the
registry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact the certificate of
titles carried the annotation that "the vendee shall not sell and/or
encumber the property within a period of ten (10) years from the date of the
issuance of the Certificate of Title except by way of mortgage to a government
banking institution." However, no annotation was made as to the exemption
of the properties from "the satisfaction of any debt contracted prior to the
expiration" of the said period of 10 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the second place, respondents might be
charged with know­ledge, at least by presumption, as far </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">the law was concerned, but there can be </span><span style="">no similar presumption concerning the </span><span style="">origin of the lands, specifically the fact that they had been acquired
from the Board of Liquidators and therefore came within the purview of Republic
Act 477.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to that fact the requirement
of registration in order to effect third persons was not dispensed with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no suggestion in the record that
said respondent had knowledge of that fact such as to render the lack of
registration immaterial.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As to the second ground
stated by the lower court in the order complained of, petitioners contend that
they are not <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from invoking the illegality of
the levy by the compromise agreement or by their failure to object </span><span style="">seasonably </span><span style="">to the attachment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said
agreement, they </span><span style="">maintain, </span><span style="">in so far as it subjected the parcels of land
in ques­tion to the obligation specified therein and adjudged in the </span><span style="">decision, is null and void, being in
contravention of the express prohibition in Section </span><span style="">8 </span><span style="">of Republic Act </span><span style="">No. </span><span style="">477.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We believe that the
principle of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> applies in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The representation or omission that this prin­ciple
renders conclusive upon petitioners (Arts. 1431 and 1433, Civil Code; Rule 123,
Sec. 68(a), Rules of Court) is on a matter of fact, namely, the origin and
manner of acquisition by them of the lands in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They in effect led respondent Bank to believe
that the said lands proceeded from a source other than that contemplated in
Republic Act No. 477 and that they </span><span style="">were
</span><span style="">subject to levy and
attachment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judging from the
circumstances and considering that petition themselves were aware of the
exempting provisions of the law they concealed the vital fact from respondent
not only when they first moved for the dissolution of the attachment on a
different ground and then withdrew their motion, manifesting that they
"would now have no objection to the deferment of the dissolution of the
attachment until after the trial on the merits," but also when they
entered into the compromise agreement and asked the court to render judgment in
accordance therewith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed it was they
who offered, by their letter of </span><st1:date year="1967" day="28" month="6"><span style="">June 28, 1967</span></st1:date><span style=""> to respondent Bank's counsel, the security
of the lands in question to support their proposal for amicable settlement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Relying on the foregoing
conduct of the petitioners, respondent bank concluded the compromise agreement
with them, wherein it was stipulated that as security for the payment of the
indebtedness the attachment levied by the provincial sheriff on the two parcels
of land should remain in full force and effect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners even renounced any and all claims which they might have
against respondent bank</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">by reason of the procurement of the
writ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand they were able
to obtain the following concessions:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">Reduction of the actual in­debtedness of P34,148.79, with 7% interest
per annum from and after July 13, 1962 until fully paid plus an amount
equivalent to 20% of the total amount as and for attorney's fees, to P30,000.00
with 7% interest per annum from the date of the compromise agreem</span><span style="">ent until fully paid, plus </span>P500.00 <span style="">as and for attorney's fees.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR"><span style="">Extension of two (2) years for
the payment of the sums agreed upon.<o:p></o:p></span></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The doctrine of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> applicable to petitioners here is not only that
which prohibits a party from assuming inconsistent positions, based on the
principle of election, but that which precludes him from repudiating an
obligation voluntarily assumed after having accepted benefits <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
countenance such repudiation would be contrary to equity, and would put a
premium on fraud or misrepresentation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">From the procedural viewpoint, petitioners' motion to lift the
attachment came too late.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not
only a writ issued in the usual process prescribed in the Rules of Court, but
one that was subsequently embodied in the compromise agreement and therefore
became part of the judgment of <span style="">the
court approving the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The time to assail
the legal­ity of the attachment was before the judgment became final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>To <span style="">set aside the attachment thereafter would amount to altering or
amending the judgment which was already beyond correction, even assuming that
it contained an error which needed correcting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The writ prayed for is denied and the injunction is dissolved,
with costs against petitioners.</p>
