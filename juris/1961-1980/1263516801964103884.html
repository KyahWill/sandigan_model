First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, in its <span style="">Civil </span>Case
No. 819, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Choa</span> <span class="SpellE">Hai</span>
filed on <st1:date year="1963" day="17" month="10">17 October 1963</st1:date> a
motion to take oath and be issued the corresponding certificate of
naturalization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Provincial Fiscal
opposed the motion, on the grounds that (1) petitioner has failed to set forth
in his petition his former places of residence; (2) the two character witnesses
presented at the trial were not qualified to vouch for petitioner's moral
character; (3) petitioner made misrepresentations in the reporting (for
purposes of tax payment) of his income for 1962; and (4) petitioner was using
an alias without proper authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="11" month="6">11 June 1964</st1:date>,
the court set aside the decision of <st1:date year="1961" day="12" month="10">12
 October 1961</st1:date> and denied the latter's motion to take oath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner interposed the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court's order must be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">By his own admission during the hearing in the court below, it
was established that from December, 1921 to 1927, appellant was not residing in
<span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, but in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Justifying the allegation in the petition for naturalization that he has been a
resident of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>,
since December, 1921, petitioner-appellant claims that from June, 1921 (upon
his arrival in the Philippines) until December, 1921 (when he was cleared by
the <span style="">immigration authorities), he was in
Manila under bail, that from 1921 to 1927, being a minor,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">he
was under the custody of one Vicente Chua who owned a store in <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, Manila, where appellant stayed; that Vicente Chua
had also a residence in <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>,
which he and petitioner-appellant visited "sometimes two to four times a
month until 1927" (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., page 6, 7 April
1964).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is now contended for appellant
that, since the residence mentioned in the nat­uralization law refers to the
legal residence or domicile of an applicant, and that being a minor in 1921 to
1927 appellant's domicile was that of the person exercising parental authority
over him - which was <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>
- then, the lower court erred in holding that the omission to state the Manila
residence in the petition constituted a violation of section 7 of the Revised
Naturalization law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the first place, it is the rule established and adhered to in a long
line of decided cases that the requirement of section 7 of the Revised
Naturalization law to state in the petition the "present and past places
of residence" does not refer to legal residence or domicile, but to all
places where the petitioner had actually resided, whether the stay therein was
permanent or temporary.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Secondly, as stated in the appealed order, there is no proof, other than
appellant's bare declaration, that Vicente Chua was a resident of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, from 1921 to
1927, and that he was a ward of said person.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no proof of the guardianship other than the applicant's
uncorroborated testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even
assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> that for the period in
dispute appellant was a minor under the custody of Vicente Chua, that would not
improve his position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, as ruled by
this Court, where the law requires specification of <u>actual </u>and
substantial residence, as is done in section 7 of the Naturaliza­tion law, the
principle that a minor child follows the residence of the father would not
operate.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Neither is appellant's theory, that there was no necessity for
him to state in the petition his residence in Manila when he was a minor,
supported by our ruling in the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Dv</u></span><u>
Lam Go <span class="SpellE">vs</span>, Republic</u> (L-15858, 31 July 1962).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While we there said that "if the
applicant is a native child of aliens or brought to this country when he was an
infant, the period of infancy or childhood is not included in the phrase
'during the entire period of his residence in the Philippines", it was
elucidated in the same decision that the period of residence (during which an
ap­plicant for naturalization must have observed proper and irreproachable
behavior, and from which period the state of infancy or childhood is to be
excluded) refers <span style="">to that "when a
person becomes <u>conscious and responsible for his acts and conduct</u> in the
community where he lives".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
short, the period of infancy is not to be taken </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">synonymous to
minority, nor to cover the entire period before one becomes of age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the fact that a person is below 21
years normally does not make him unaware of his moral obligations to his
fellowmen, nor exempt him from being responsible for his deeds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, even under our penal laws, minority
does not exempt an offender from criminal liability, unless he is below 9 years
of age or, if he is above 9 but under 15 years, that he has committed the
criminal act without discernment (Article 68, Revised Penal Code).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Similarly, the fact that
appellant's failure to state in the petition his former residence was not
deliberate, but due to an honest misunderstanding of the legal requirements,
and that the true situation </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">brought
out during the hearing, does not cure that fatal defect.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> As this Court had said in one case - -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Likewise obvious it is that the good faith of the applicant
in omitting one or more of his 'present and past places of residence' in his
application, becomes and is irrelevant for the purposes of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether the omission be in good or bad faith,
the fact is that full inquiry as to the irreproachability of applicant's
behavior is thereby prevented, and the law's intent frustrated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this Court in a long line of deci­sions
has invariably held that such omission is fatal to the application for
naturalization." (Republic vs. <span class="SpellE">Cokeng</span>, G.R. No. L-19829,
<st1:date year="1968" day="4" month="5"><span style="">4
 </span>May 1968</st1:date>, 23 SCRA 559, 563).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In addition to the above, which is already sufficient to affirm
the lower court's order on appeal, there are other grounds equally valid and
forceful that go against appellant's petition for admission to Philippine
citizenship.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the court below correctly ruled that character witnesses
Juan C. Perez and <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>,
who testified having known petitioner-appellant in 1930 and 1927, respectively,
are not qualified to vouch on the latter's good moral charac­ter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their personal knowledge of petitioner should
be for the entire duration of his residence in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We also found that the petition for naturalization was published,
at peti­tioner-appellant's request,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>in the Official Gazette and the
"<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> Era" for 3 consecutive times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although there is an affidavit by its editor
attesting that the "<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> Era" is a
newspaper of general circulation in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
there is no proof that it is also of general circulation in <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this <span style="">regard,
the requirement of the law, that the petition be published in a news­paper of
general circulation in the province where the petitioner resides, has not been
complied with.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Then, it also appears that when the petition was heard in 1961,
three of petitioner's eight children - <span class="SpellE">Arsenia</span>,
Carlos and Patricia Chua - were enrolled at the Chiang Kai <span class="SpellE">Shek</span>
High School, whose principal was <span class="SpellE">Pao</span> Shih <span class="SpellE">Tien</span> (Exhibits K-K-1 and K-2), and the Philippine Chinese
Republican School, whose principal was <span class="SpellE">Phoa</span> <span class="SpellE">Siao</span> Hong (Exhibit K-3). This enrollment of his children in
schools which, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, are presumed to be
run by Chinese nationals and populated mostly by Chinese or foreigners, with
Filipinos forming the minority, runs counter to the requirement of the law that
petitioner must evince a sincere desire to embrace Philippine customs,
traditions and ideals and to mingle socially with the Filipinos.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But we have on record a more serious ground to declare
appellant's dis­qualification for citizenship of this country.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 26 March 1966, in reply to the <span class="SpellE">oppositor-appellee's</span>
brief, counsel for petitioner-appellant filed <span style="">a </span>brief wherein she insisted on the alleged irreproach­ability
of appellant's conduct, quoting at length from certain documents, photo-­static
copies of which were attached to the said reply brief as Annexes A, B, C, and
D.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This brief drew a motion from the Solicitor General to cite
appellant for contempt, for having used and submitted for consideration of this
Court forged do­cuments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Required by the
Court to produce the original of Annexes A, B, C, and D, and to show cause why
appellant should not be cited for contempt, counsel for ap­pellant did not
refute the forgery charge, limiting its defense to a disclaimer of authorship
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was merely alleged that
appellant received the original of the disputed documents either by mail or by
messenger, in his residence in <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, and that
said documents were only some of the many papers that came to him through such
c means.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Annexed to this
"Compliance" were some 30 notices, orders, memoranda and various
office communications of the Department of Justice, Solicitor General's Office,
and the Immigration bureau.</p>

<p class="BODY">The matter was thereafter referred to the Court-Investigator who,
after due hearing returned his findings that Annexes A, B, C, and D are
forgeries, and that appellant got them for a consideration from a man who
represented himself to be a lawyer from the Department of Justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be added, in this connection, that
even the documents attached to the "Compliance" filed by appellant's
counsel bear the earmarks of falsification.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One has only to take note of the consistent misspelling of the names of
the officials who allegedly signed the same; of the word "immigration"
in official communications supposedly coming from the Bureau of Immigration
itself; the glaring gram­matical and typographical errors that could be found
in practically every document, and the impertinence of some orders or
proceeding, to discern that these papers could not have been duly issued or
approved and signed by the officials whose purported signatures were affixed
thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be safely concluded that
these forgeries could not have been made without the participation of persons
or group of persons possessing at least a working knowledge of the procedure in
naturalization cases and having access to the office forms in the Department of
Justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, without sparing from
censure the perpetrators of these misdeeds that bring havoc to the workings of
government and undermine the confidence of the people in duly constituted
authorities, we are primari­ly concerned on the effect of this discovery of
forgery upon appellant's case.</p>

<p class="BODY">It needs no elaborate discussion to pronounce appellant's behavior,
in paying for documents and certifications of proceedings and investigations
which he (appellant) knew never took place, or stating facts which he was aware
were not true, to be far from moral and irreproachable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it is reflective of the mettle of
his moral character, making him unworthy of the privilege to become a citizen
of this country.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case should serve as a warning to attorneys to scrutinize
carefully the documents submitted by their clients to avoid their being used to
foist forgeries on the Courts.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style=""><span style="">FOR THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS</span></b><span style="">, the </span>order appealed from is affirmed,
and petitioner-appellant <span class="SpellE">Choa</span> <span class="SpellE">Hai</span>
is hereby declared not qualified to be admitted a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cost against petitioner-appellant.</p>
