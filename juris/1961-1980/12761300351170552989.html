				G.R. No. L-19555, May 29, 1964</h4>
				<H3>MATEO DE RAMAS, PETITIONER, VS. THE COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS AND GERONIMO B. RAMOS, RESPONDENTS.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>This is a petition for a writ of certiorari with prohibition to review and 
set aside a decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations, Hon. Guillermo S. 
Santos, presiding, approving a petition of Geronimo B. Ramos, tenant, against 
his landlord, Mateo de Ramas, for the change of their tenancy contract from 
share to leasehold tenancy. </p>
<p>Respondent Geronimo B. Ramos is the tenant of herein petitioner Mateo de 
Ramas on a 2-l/2 hectare land at Muzon, Naic, Cavite, under a verbal share 
tenancy contract at 70-30. On June 22, 1960, or one month before the beginning 
of the agricultural year 1960-1961, Ramos informed petitioner of his desire to 
change their contract from that of share tenancy to leasehold tenancy. 
Petitioner refused to grant the request insisting on the former 70-30 sharing 
basis, so on May 23, 1961 Ramos filed a petition with the Court of Agrarian 
Relations praying that he be allowed to change their tenancy contract from share 
to leasehold, in accordance with the provisions of Section 14 of Republic Act 
No. 1199, as amended. Petitioner opposed the petition as groundless and 
violating their gentleman's agreement. </p>
<p>During the pendency of the case respondent Ramos moved to suspend the 
proceedings on the ground that the constitutionality of Section 14 of Republic 
Act No. 1199 has been raised, among other issues, before the Supreme Court in 
the case of Juliano <em>vs</em>. CAR, et al., G.R. No. L-117627, and that to 
continue with the case would only result in loss of time, money, etc., if the 
Supreme Court declare Sec. 14 of Republic Act No. 1199 unconstitutional. This 
motion was denied in an order dated September 22, 1961. On December 14, 1961 
Ramos presented his evidence; but Ramas waived the presentation of his evidence; 
manifesting that he would appeal whatever decision the agrarian court might 
render. On March 1, 1962, respondent 1court rendered judgment upholding the 
constitutionality of Sec. 14 of Republic Act No. 1199, citing Our ruling in 
Pineda, et al. <em>vs</em>. Pingul and CIR, 92 Phil., 89, where We upheld the 
constitutionality or validity of Act No. 4054, as amended by Com. Act 178 and 
Republic Act 34. </p>
<p>Against the above judgment the present petition is brought before Us, 
petitioner praying that after proper hearing, Sec. 14 of Republic Act No. 1199 
be declared unconstitutional and that the writ of prohibition prayed for be 
granted. </p>
<p>Petitioner first questions the agrarian court's action in proceeding with the 
hearing of CAR Case No. 246 Cavite '6l, deciding the same, and ordering 
execution of its decision despite the pendency before Us of a similar case 
raising the constitutionality of Sec. 14 of Republic Act No. 1199. We find no 
error or irregularity in the court's proceeding with the case. The mere fact 
that the constitutionality of a law is raised in another case pending in the 
Supreme Court is not a valid reason for suspending the proceedings in this case. 
Laws are considered valid until declared unconstitutional, and until then courts 
are in duty bound to enforce them. (Magtibay <em>vs</em>. Alikpala, G.R. No. 
L-17590 and Juliano <em>vs</em>. CAR, G.R. No. L-17627, both promulgated on 
November 29, 1962) </p>
<p>The present suit, specifically concerns the validity of Section 14 of the 
said Act which is as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 14. Change of System. - The tenant shall have the right to change the 
tenancy contract from one of share tenancy to leasehold tenancy and vice versa 
and from one crop sharing arrangement to another of the share tenancy. If the 
share tenancy contract is in writing and is duly registered, the right to change 
from one crop sharing arrangement to another may be exercised at least one month 
before the beginning of the next agricultural year after the expiration of the 
period of the contract. In the absence of any registered written contract, the 
right may be exercised at least one month before the agricultural year when the 
change shall be effected." (As amended by Section 4, R.A. 2263.) 
</p></blockquote>
<p>The above provision is attacked on the ground of unconstitutionality in that 
it impairs the obligation of contracts, because after a contract of share 
tenancy has been adopted between the landlord and the tenant, the latter is 
empowered, notwithstanding said contract, to change it into leasehold tenancy. 
The question presented makes a review of tenancy laws useful in order to secure 
a correct perspective of the issue. </p>
<p>The promotion of social justice and of the well-being and economic security 
of all the people is a primary aim of the Constitution (Sec. 5, Art. II). In 
line with this, goal, the State encourages small landholdings as against large 
estates (Article XIII of the Constitution) and has taken upon itself the duty to 
protect the agricultural laborer and to regulate the relations between him and 
the landowner. (Sec. 6, Art. XIV, <em>Id</em>.) </p>
<p>Even before the approval of the Constitution the Legislature had already 
passed Act No. 4054, known as the "Philippine Rice Share Tenancy Act", approved 
February 27, 1933. The Act's aim is primarily to regulate the relations between 
landlords and tenants. Freedom of tenancy contract is allowed so long as it is 
not contrary to existing laws, customs, morals and public policy (Sec. 7). In 
the absence of contract the crop is divided equally between the landlord and the 
tenant, a system known as the share tenancy (Sec. 8). The contract is to last 
according to the stipulation of the parties, and in its absence it shall be in 
force only during one agricultural year. The landlord may not dismiss a tenant 
while a tenancy contract is in force, except for any just and reasonable cause 
as enumerated in Section 19 of Act No.4054. </p>
<p>On June 9, 1939, Commonwealth Act No. 461 was passed. This law further 
protects the security of tenure of the 1tenant, and provides that the tenant may 
not be dispossessed of the land except for any of the causes mentioned in 
Section 19 of Act No. 4054 and subject to the approval of a representative of 
the Department of Justice (Sec. 1). </p>
<p>On September 30, 1946, Republic Act No. 34 was approved, amending certain 
sections of Act No. 4054 and providing for a sharing ratio between the landlord 
and the tenant, depending on which of them furnishes the necessary implements 
and work animals and defrays all the , expenses for planting and cultivation 
(Sec. 3 Rep. Act No. 34, amending Sec. 8, Act No. 4054). </p>
<p>In the case of Tapang <em>vs</em>. Court of Industrial Relations, 72 Phil. 
79, the validity of Section 19 of Act No. 4054 (Sec. 19 provides that landlord 
may not dismiss tenant except for good cause) and of Commonwealth Act No. 461 
was questioned on the ground that they violate the constitutional guarantee 
against impairment of contracts. Overruling this argument, the Supreme Court 
said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"El argumento de que la Ley No. 461 del Commonwealth es contraria a la 
Constitucion porque altera obligaciones contractuales, no tiene ninguna fuerza, 
porque, x x x la misma Constitucion manda que se debe 'promover la justicia 
social a fin de asegurar el bienestar y la estabilidad economica de todo 
elpueblo', y que se debe proteger al mismo tiempo 'a todos los trabajadores, 
especialmente a las mujeres’ y no hay duda de que las dos mencionadas leyes 
tienden a dicho fin, protegiendo al aparcero y al propietario por igual, y 
estableciendo reglas que han de determinar las relaciones que deben existir 
entre los dos, para su propio beneficio." (Per Pablo, J., Tapang <em>vs</em>. 
CIR, supra) </p></blockquote>
<p>The argument that the tenancy relationship had ceased after the expiration of 
the agricultural year was declared by the Court to be without any validity 
because Section 25of Act No. 4054, the basis of said argument, must be 
understood to have been annulled or at least subject to the provisions of 
Commonwealth Act No. 46l (ante). Said this Court: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>" ‘No obstante todo contrato o disposicion en contrario de cualquier ley 
vigente, en todos los casos en que un terreno es ocupado bajo un sistema 
cualquiera de aparceria, no se ha de desposeer al aparcero del terreno cultivado 
por el mismo, sin la aprobacion de un representante del Departamento de Justicia 
debidamente autorlzado al efecto y como no sea por alguna de las causas 
expresadas en el articulo diecinueve de la Ley Numero Cuatro mil cincuenta y 
cuatro o por alguno otro motivo justificado.’ " (<em>Ibid</em>.) 
</p></blockquote>
<p>After the passage of the above laws the need was felt for an agency familiar 
with landlord-tenant problems and capable of effectively enforcing existing 
laws. So, a special division of the Department of Justice to act as compulsory 
arbiter was first set up; later the arbitration and litigation aspects of 
tenancy cases were transferred to the Court of Industrial Relations whose docket 
was already clogged with oases involving other labor legislation. Act No. 4054 
left much to be desired. It is not of universal application. Its principles were 
not in force throughout the Philippines, but only in localities where it was 
adopted or where it was put into effect by presidential proclamation. (C.A. 178, 
Sec. 4; Iburan <em>vs</em>. Labes, 87 Phil. 234) In other places, the standard 
of conduct laid down by Act No. 4054 was inapplicable. (De la Cruz <em>vs</em>. 
Asociacion Zanjera Casilian, 83 Phil. 214) Even under the law the oppressive 
conditions under which tenants theretofore found themselves were practically 
left unremedied; they still remained at the mercy of their landlords. </p>
<p>The latest attempt to remedy the miserable plight of tenants came with the 
passage of Republic Act No. 1199, otherwise known as the "Agricultural Tenancy 
Act of the Philippines," which repeals the old Tenancy Act (Act No.4054), 
Commonwealth Act No. 461, and various amendments of these laws. The purpose of 
this Act, according to Section 2 thereof, is "to establish agricultural tenancy 
relations between landholders and tenants upon the principle of social justice; 
to afford adequate protection to the rights of both tenants and landlords; to 
insure an equitable division of the produce and income derived from the land; to 
provide tenant-farmers with incentives to greater and more efficient 
agricultural production; to bolster their economic position and to encourage 
their participation in the development of peaceful, vigorous and democratic 
rural communities." </p>
<p>Later on, or on June 14, 1955, Republic Act No. 1267 was passed creating the 
"Court of Agrarian Relations", said to be a concomitant of the Agricultural 
Tenancy Act, and designed to provide the long-needed medium for deciding 
agricultural problems. (3 Philippine Annotated Laws, 72) </p>
<p>A study of the Agricultural Tenancy Act (Rep. Act No. 1199) discloses that it 
is an improvement of its predecessor Act 4054, as amended. Most of its 
provisions deal .with the regulation of the relations of the landlord and tenant 
(Secs. 6, 7, 8, 9), the fixing of the share of each in the products of the land 
cultivated by the tenant in general (Sees. 32, 33, 34, 35), the guaranteeing of 
the permanency of tenure of the tenant and his heirs on the land he and his 
predecessors cultivate (Sees. 6, 7, 9, 49, 50, 51). Its most important provision 
is the protection of the tenant against exploitation by the landlord, as it 
proscribes the utilization by the landlord of the personal services of the 
tenant and the members of his household without compensation (Sec. 23). It fixes 
interests on loans secured by the tenant from the landlord and prescribes the 
payment of such loans from the share of the tenant in the harvest at the current 
price, and requires the keeping of books of account showing the amounts received 
by the tenant as loans from the landlord, etc. (Secs. 16, 18, 48) </p>
<p>The above provisions are clearly an improvement of, Act No. 4054. They are 
intended to protect tenants from abuse and exploitation by their landlords. The 
validity of these provisions has not been questioned as they clearly fall within 
the province of regulatory provisions enjoined expressly in the Constitution 
(Art. XIV., Sec.6). The provisions are clearly of apparent wisdom and validity, 
evidently not subject to question as they do not appear to have ever been 
questioned in the short span of life of the law (approved August 30, 1954). </p>
<p>The history of land tenancy, especially in Central Luzon, is a dark spot in 
the social life and history of the people. It was among the tenants of Central 
Luzon that the late Pedro Abad Santos., acting as a saviour of the tenant class, 
which for generations has been relegated to a life of bondage, without hope of 
salvation or improvement, enunciated a form of socialism as a remedy for the 
pitiful condition of the tenants of Central Luzon. It was in Central Luzon also 
that the tenants forming the PKM organization of tenants and, during the war, 
the Hukbalahap, rose in arms against the constituted authority as their only 
salvation from permanent thraldom. According to statistics, whereas at the 
beginning of the century we had only 19% of the people belonging to the tenant 
class, after 60 years the prevailing percentage has reached 39%. It is the 
desire to improve the condition of the peasant class that must have impelled the 
Legislature to adopt the provisions as a whole of the Agricultural Tenancy Act, 
and particularly Section 14 of said Act. </p>
<p>The section in question (Sec. 14, Rep. Act No. 1199) permits a tenant who has 
accumulated savings to free him-self from obtaining the usurious loans for 
expenses needed in plowing, harrowing, planting, and harvesting. The tenant who 
has accumulated savings that would enable him to buy implements and farm animals 
is allowed by the provision in question to free himself from the bondage of 
permanent share tenancy by a change to leasehold tenancy. The tenant who is used 
to cultivating riceland cannot conceive of any form or manner in which he can 
invest his meager savings other than by the purchase of farm implements and work 
animals. In other words, the only avenue left to him to improve his lot is by 
permitting him to change his contract of tenancy from that of share system to 
that of leasehold system. The increase that he receives in his share as a 
consequence of the change is only 5% (under the share system the landlord 
receives 30% and under leasehold he receives only 25% if the land is first 
class, and 20% if the land is second class). But by the change the tenant is 
released from the stranglehold of the landlord, and becomes a semi-independent 
farmer. The provision in question is certainly justified by the directive 
contained in the Constitution to do justice to labor. By the change the laborer 
can improve his lowly lot. And if it cannot be justified as an act of social 
justice enjoined in the Constitution, it may be considered as an exercise of the 
police power of the State which tries to improve the situation of a great 
percentage of the people and preserve the security of the State against possible 
internal upheavals that the tenant class might be forced to create to improve 
their lowly lot. The tenant uprisings in Central Luzon from 1946 to 1952 must 
certainly have been the main cause or reason for the enactment of the 
Agricultural Tenancy Act in 1954 and of the particular section in question. The 
desire to improve the tenant class certainly has been impelled by the necessity 
of insuring the internal security of the country, a paramount aim and end 
justifying the exercise of the police power. </p>
<p>The legal question that is posed before Us is: Is the enactment of Section 14 
of Republic Act No. 1199 in virtue of the police power of the State limited by 
the fact that it violates a contractual right (existing in favor of the 
defendant-appellant in this case)? The general rule has been stated thus: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A police regulation, obviously intended as such and not operating 
unreasonably beyond the occasions of its enactment, is not rendered invalid by 
the fact that it may affect incidentally the exercise of some right guaranteed 
by the Constitution. For example, it is said that the proper exercise of the 
police power is not subject to restraint by constitutional provisions designed 
for the general protection of rights of individual life, liberty and property." 
(11 Am. Jur. 991-992) </p></blockquote>
<p>Is Section 14 of Republic Act No. 1199 legally justified in impairing the 
obligation of an existing contract between the tenant and the landlord? The 
answer to this again stated as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The constitutional prohibition against state laws impairing the obligation 
of contracts does not restrict the power of the state to protect the public 
health, the public morals, or the public safety. One or more of these factors 
may be involved in the execution of such contracts. Rights and privileges 
arising from contracts are subject to regulations for the protection of the 
public health, the public morals, and the public safety, in the same sense and 
to the same extent as is all property, whether owned by natural persons or 
corporations. Not all police legislation which has the effect of impairing a 
contract is obnoxious to the constitutional prohibition as to impairment." 
(Ibid., pp. 1000-1001) </p></blockquote>
<p>Obligations of contracts must yield to a proper exercise of the police power 
when such power is exercised, as in this case, to preserve the security of the 
State and the means adopted are reasonably adapted to the accomplishment of that 
end and are not arbitrary or oppressive, (11Am. Jur. 1002-1003) </p>
<p>The right granted to the tenant to change the contract from share tenancy to 
that of leasehold tenancy cannot be considered unreasonable or oppressive, 
because by the landlord's giving up of 5% of the harvest (the change from share 
to leasehold tenancy reduces the landlord's share from 30% to 25%) the tenant 
becomes more responsible, more competent, and financially prepared to comply 
with his obligations under the lease, to the ultimate benefit of the landlord, 
with the consequent improvement of a lot of a big segment of the population and 
thereby giving full meaning to the social justice directive contained in the 
Constitution. </p>
<p>Wherefore, in view of the above considerations We hold the disputed Section 
14 of Republic Act No. 1199constitutional and valid. The Judgment appealed from 
is affirmed. Without costs. </p><em>Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, 
J.B.L.,</em> and <em>Barrera, JJ.,</em> concur. <br><em>Bengzon C.J.,</em> 
concurs in the result. <br><br><br>
<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">

<p align="center"><em>CONCURRING OPINION</em></p>
<p><strong>BENGZON, C. J.:</strong></p>
<p>Without voting on the constitutional question, I concur in the result. 
According to the Agrarian Court's decision (p. 4), Ramos became the tenant of 
Ramas (Mateo de) sometime in 1959 or 1958, when Republic Act 1199 <em>was 
already in force</em>, and was consequently deemed to be a part of their 
contract of tenancy. So the landowner may not now be heard to complain about 
impairment of the contract. </p>
