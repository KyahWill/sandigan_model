				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal, taken by defendants Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Gondayao</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Anoy</span> <span class="SpellE">Gondayao</span>, from a
decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Panga­sinan</span>,
convicting them of the crime of murder, qualified by treachery, and sentencing
them to life imprisonment and to jointly and severally indemnify the heirs of
the deceased, Orlando <span class="SpellE">Piol</span>, in the sum of P<span style="">6,</span>000.00, and to pay two-fifths of the
costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">After grappling with Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Gondayao</span>,
near the market place, in the Barrio of <span class="SpellE">Paitan</span>,
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Sual</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>,
on November 14, 1965, between 11:00 and 11:30 a. m., Orlando <span class="SpellE">Piol</span> appeared to have - in addition to several lacerations
on the head - two (2) stab wounds on the back, 4 to 4-1/2 inches deep, in
consequence of which he died that same afternoon, due to a massive internal
hemorrhage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Immediately after the
occurrence, Benjamin assumed full responsibility for said injuries, which he
claimed to have inflicted in self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1965</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, Chief of
Police of <span class="SpellE">Sual</span>, filed, with the Municipal Court
thereof, a complaint charging Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Gondayao</span> with
homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Twelve (12) days later, <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> filed an amended complaint charging murder,
allegedly committed, not only by Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Gondayao</span>,
but, also, by his brother, <span class="SpellE">Anoy</span> <span class="SpellE">Gondayao</span>,
and Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Bersamina</span>, <span class="SpellE">Eto</span> <span class="SpellE">Agbayani</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jovencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yanday</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon
thereafter, the corresponding information for murder was filed, with the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, against said five
defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due trial, under a
plea of not guilty, said court rendered the appealed decision convicting
Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Gondayao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Anoy</span> <span class="SpellE">Gondayao</span> as charged and sentencing them as stated at the
beginning of this decision, as well as acquitting their three (3)
co-defendants, for insufficiency of the evidence, with three-fifths (3/5) of
the costs <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this appeal by the <span class="SpellE">Gondayaos</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main eyewitnesses for the prosecution were <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> and Police Chief <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first testified that, while he was
reading a newspaper, in front of the house of the Vice-Mayor, in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Paitan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sual</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>,
on November 14, 1965, between 10:00 and 11:30 a.m., he saw Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Gondayao</span> and his co-defendants, a few meters away, drinking
gin in front of the store of Segundo <span class="SpellE">Sevillena</span>, which
was alongside the house and store of the Vice-Mayor; that, after consuming a
bottle of gin, Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Gondayao</span>, repeatedly cursed
the "<span class="SpellE">Nacionalistas</span>" for not offering a
drink despite their vic<span style="">tory in </span>the
polls; that, as Orlando <span class="SpellE">Piol</span>, who was nearby, replied
by cursing the losers in the elections, an exchange of unfriendly utterances
followed; that, eventually, the group headed by Benjamin picked up stones and
threw them at <span class="SpellE">Piol</span>, who was hit several times on the
head; that, as the same began to bleed, <span class="SpellE">Piol</span> drew out
a dagger and approached Benjamin, who, forthwith, embraced him; that, grappling
with each other, they both fell down, with <span class="SpellE">Piol</span> on
top of Benjamin; that, at this juncture, <span class="SpellE">Anoy</span> <span class="SpellE">Gondayao</span> picked up a stone and hit <span class="SpellE">Piol</span>
with it on the head, and then wrested the dagger from him; that, upon a signal
given by Benjamin, who had meanwhile managed to get away from under <span class="SpellE">Piol</span>, <span class="SpellE">Anoy</span> stabbed <span class="SpellE">Piol</span> on the back and, then, leaving the dagger imbedded
therein, retreated; that thereupon Benjamin pulled out the dagger and sank it
again on the back of <span class="SpellE">Piol</span>, Who was still facing
downward, in a stooping position; and that Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Bersamina</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Eto</span> <span class="SpellE">Agbayani</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jovencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yanday</span> were then about 5
meters away.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
did not witness the beginning of the incident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was about 25 meters from the place of the occurrence, when he noticed
a commotion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rushing to the scene
thereof, he saw Benjamin and <span class="SpellE">Piol</span>, about 3 meters
away from him, rush at each other and grapple with one another, until they fell
together from a bamboo bed, locally known as "<span class="SpellE">papag</span>",
on which they were standing; that, inasmuch as the same and a wooden fence
between him and the combatants pre­vented him from going to them directly and
seeing what was going on after said fall, he walked about 10 meters, in order
to go around the fence and approach the fighting men; that, bidding them to
stop, he seized the hand of Benjamin which held a dagger, with which he was
poised to stab <span class="SpellE">Piol</span>, then lying down on his stomach,
under Benjamin; that <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> thereupon wrested from
him the dagger, which was stained with blood; and that Benjamin then said it
was he who had wounded <span class="SpellE">Piol</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Gondayao</span>
testified that his remark, about the failure to give a blow-out on the part of
the win­ner in the elections, was addressed to his nephew, Rudy <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span>; that, when <span class="SpellE">Piol</span>
resented said remark, Benjamin replied that the same was not aimed at him, and
that, perhaps, he (<span class="SpellE">Piol</span>) is a "<span class="SpellE">nacionalisto</span>"; that, after another exchange of
unfriendly remarks, <span class="SpellE">Piol</span> drew out his dagger and said
"I am going to kill you"; that Benjamin then tried to run away and
went up the "<span class="SpellE">papag</span>", with the intention of
jumping over the wooden fence beside it; that he was unable to do so because <span class="SpellE">Piol</span> followed him on top of the "<span class="SpellE">papag</span>";
that he, therefore, faced <span class="SpellE">Piol</span>, who thrust his dagger
at him (Benjamin), but he parried the thrust with the left arm, which was then
wounded slightly; that, by pressing the hand with which <span class="SpellE">Piol</span>
held the dagger, Benjamin succeeded in disarming him; that, as <span class="SpellE">Piol</span> grappled with and embraced him, they fell to the
ground, with <span class="SpellE">Piol</span> under him; that <span class="SpellE">Piol</span>
landed over the dagger - then held by Benjamin-which pierced his <span style="">(<span class="SpellE">Piol</span>' </span>s)
back; that, as they kept on wrestling with each, other, <span class="SpellE">Piol</span>
managed to roll over and place himself on top of Benjamin; that <span class="SpellE">Piol</span> then picked up a stone and with it struck Benjamin on
the face, thereby causing thereon a lacerated wound; that <span class="SpellE">Piol</span>
tried to hit him a second time with the stone, but Benjamin warded off the
blow; that he was then able to get another stone, with which he, in turn, hit <span class="SpellE">Piol</span> on the head several times; that <span class="SpellE">Piol</span>,
however, squeezed the neck of Benjamin, who let loose the stone and, pulling <span class="SpellE">Piol</span> down with his (Benjamin's) right hand, stabbed him (<span class="SpellE">Piol</span>) with his (Benjamin's) left hand, by thrusting the
dagger into his back; and that the Chief of Police then came and separated
them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Benjamin's co-defendants set up their respective alibis, but We
are not concerned with the three (3) defendants who were acquitted by the lower
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As regards appellant <span class="SpellE">Anoy</span> <span class="SpellE">Gondayao</span>, We note that the
Chief of Police did not even see him at the scene of the occur­rence, although
said officer admitted that he had not paid any attention to the persons who
were near the combatants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, it is
difficult to <span style="">see
</span>how <span class="SpellE">Anoy</span> <span class="SpellE">Gondayao</span>
could have, stabbed <span class="SpellE">Piol</span> without being noticed by
said peace officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection,
it is well to remember that, according to <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> - the only witness who testified to the alleged
participation of <span class="SpellE">Anoy</span> <span class="SpellE">Gondayao</span>
in the commission of the crime charged - this appellant stabbed <span class="SpellE">Piol</span> after the latter and Ben­jamin had fallen from the
"<span class="SpellE">papag</span>", in the course of their fight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chief of Police was only three (3) meters
away, looking at them, even before they had thus fallen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, he would have, in all pro­bability,
seen <span class="SpellE">Anoy</span>, had he done what <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>
imputed to him (<span class="SpellE">Anoy</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was, of course, the possibility that <span class="SpellE">Anoy's</span> intervention may have taken place as the Chief of
Police went around the fence that separated him from the combatants and his attention
was momenta­rily diverted from them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
a way, however, this circumstance is <span style="">offset </span><span style="">by
</span>the fact that as soon as the Chief of <span style="">Police </span>approached the combatants and bade them to stop, Benjamin
owned his responsibility for the injuries of <span class="SpellE">Piol</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This statement was made before Benjamin had
had time to reflect, and thus forms part of the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>gestae</u></span>, as well as carries much weight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All things being considered, We find that the
prosecution has not established, beyond reasonable doubt, the guilt of <span class="SpellE">Anoy</span> <span class="SpellE">Gondayao</span>, who should,
accordingly, be acquitted, for insufficiency of the evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to appellant Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Gondayao</span>,
his Honor, the trial Judge, found his testimony unworthy of credence and the
record before Us fully justifies such finding.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, Benjamin testified that, as he grappled with <span class="SpellE">Piol</span>,
on top of a "<span class="SpellE">papag</span>", they fell together <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, with him on top of <span class="SpellE">Piol</span>,
who landed on his back, over the dagger <u>held by Benjamin</u>, who had
wrested if from <span class="SpellE">Piol</span>, and that this was how <span class="SpellE">Piol</span> sustained the first stab wound on the back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This cannot possibly be true, for the Chief
of Police testified that <span class="SpellE"><u>Piol</u></span><u> was holding
the dagger when he and Benjamin fell down from the "<span class="SpellE">papag</span></u>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, had <span class="SpellE">Piol</span>'
s back been pressed against the dagger, which was allegedly held by Benjamin,
the resulting wound would have taken a markedly <u>slanting</u> direction,
instead of being almost at right angle with, or perpendicular to, the body, as
it turned out to be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, too, <span class="SpellE">Piol</span> was on top of Benjamin, when they fell from the "<span class="SpellE">papag</span>", according to <span class="SpellE">Macario</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, Benjamin's version is that, after this accidental injury,
on the back of <span class="SpellE">Piol</span>, the latter succeeded in rolling
over and being on top of him (Benjamin); that <span class="SpellE">Piol</span>
then struck him on the face with a stone; that, after fending off another
attempt of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Piol</span></span><span style=""> </span>to similarly hit him again, he
(Benjamin) picked up another stone and, in turn, struck him with it on the
head; that, as Benjamin squeezed him by the neck, he let the stone loose and,
pulling <span class="SpellE">Piol</span> down with his (Benjamin's) right hand,
he (Benjamin) stabbed <span class="SpellE">Piol</span> on the back - on which, ac­cording
to Benjamin, <span class="SpellE">Piol</span> was lying - by thrusting the dagger
with his left hand; and that, at this juncture, the Chief of Police came and
took the weapon from him.</p>

<p class="BODY">This story is manifestly <span class="SpellE">artificious</span>
and unworthy of credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be
noted that, according to Benjamin, <u>he held the dagger</u>, even before they
fell from the "<span class="SpellE">papag</span>"; that the dagger was
still in his hand when <span class="SpellE">Piol</span> allegedly struck his face
with a stone; and that he (Benjamin), in turn, took another piece of stone, and
hit <span class="SpellE">Piol</span> with it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This would have been impossible, however, unless Benja­min first <u>released</u>
the dagger, which he then held; but, We cannot believe that he, or anybody for
that matter, would have done so under the circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, when <span class="SpellE">Piol</span> allegedly squeezed the
neck of Benjamin, the latter threw the stone away and picked up the dagger once
more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would thus have Us believe
that, in order to get the stone with which he claimed to have hit <span class="SpellE">Piol</span> on the head, he put the dagger in a convenient place
from which, at the opportune moment, he got it back to conflict the second stab
wound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The context of Benjamin's story
does not convey the idea that he had such a control of the situation as to be
able to choose the place where he, would put the dagger and the time he' would
retrieve it.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>But, this is not all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of stabbing <span class="SpellE">Piol</span>
on the stomach, for, by this time, he was again lying down on his back -
according to the defense with Benjamin on top of him, he (Benjamin) thrust the
dagger, with his left hand, into the back of <span class="SpellE">Piol</span>,
causing therein another stab, wound almost at right angle with his body, like
the first.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just why, being in the
precarious condition he depicted himself, Benjamin chose to stab <span class="SpellE">Piol</span> in such an awkward, inconvenient and unbelievable
manner, the defense has not even tried to explain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Regardless of the foregoing, an injury
inflicted in this fashion on <span class="SpellE">Piol's</span> back, which was
allegedly pressed against the ground, would have necessarily been much more
slanting than the first, instead of being almost <u>perpendicular</u> to the
body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact of the matter - and this
has been established by the testimony of the Chief of Police, whose
impartiality and veracity are not contested - is that <span class="SpellE">Piol</span>
was then lying down, <u>not</u> on his back, but <u>on his stomach</u>, with
Benjamin on top of him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This explains
why and how he (Benjamin) managed to stab <span class="SpellE">Piol</span> on the
back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It, likewise, shows that <span class="SpellE">Piol</span> could not have struck Benjamin on the face with a
stone, much less squeezed his neck.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear, from the foregoing, that Benjamin stabbed <span class="SpellE">Piol</span> twice from behind, <u>after</u> disarming him.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Considering, moreover, that Benjamin had provoked the incident, by hurling
uncomplimen­tary remarks at his political opponents, one of whom was <span class="SpellE">Piol</span>;<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
that such remarks led to an altercation with <span class="SpellE">Piol</span>, in
consequence of which, stones were thrown at him, hitting him on the head; that
when, owing to the impact of said stone, which could have rendered him groggy,
and the lacerated injuries thus sustained by him, <span class="SpellE">Piol</span>
prepared himself to fight by drawing out his dagger, Benjamin <u>ac­cepted</u>
the challenge resulting from this act, by "rushing" to his encounter
and grappling with him; and that, accordingly, Benjamin cannot be given the
benefit of either complete or incomplete self-defense.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Although <span class="SpellE">Piol</span> was stabbed from behind, Benjamin did
not act with treachery, for this was merely an incident of their struggle,
which had begun with both contenders facing each other, each prepared for the fight
that ensued.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The crime committed by Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Gondayao</span>
is, therefore, that of homicide, and no modifying circumstance having attended
its perpetration, the penalty <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> (<u>reclusion
temporal</u>) should be imposed in its medium period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to the Indeterminate Sentence Law,
he should, accordingly, be sentenced to an indeter­minate penalty ranging from
8 years and 1 day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u>, as
minimum, to 14 years, 8 months and 1 day of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> as
maximum, with the corresponding accessory penalties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More­over, the indemnity due from him to the
heirs of Orlando <span class="SpellE">Piol</span> should be increased from
P3,000.00 to P12,000.00, pursuant to People v. Pantoja<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> and
subsequent cases,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a> apart from the fact that <span class="SpellE">Anoy</span> <span class="SpellE">Gondayao</span> should be
acquitted, for insufficiency of the evidence against him, with the proportional
part of the costs <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>With the foregoing modifications</b>, the decision appealed
from should be, as it is hereby affirmed, in all other respects, with one-fifth
(1/5) of the costs against appellant Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Gondayao</span>.</p>
