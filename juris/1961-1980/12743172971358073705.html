				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Prior to the presentation of the instant case, the
plaintiffs-appellants filed with the Court of First Instance of Maasin,
Leyte, Civil Case No. R-489, for recovery of ownership and damages
against the herein appellees, alleging—
<blockquote>
  <p>"6. That on account of these illegal acts of the
defendants, the plaintiffs have suffered damages in I ho amount of
P1,000.00 and will continue to suffer damages at P100.00 every 3 months
during the pendency of this action; </p>
  <p>and praying for judgment—</p>
  <p>"4. Ordering the defendants to pay the plaintiffs the damages suffered by the latter;</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="6"><li>Granting the; phiintiirs such other reliefs and remedies, which under our law and equity, they arc entitled to."</li></ol>
<p>The CFI of Maasin, in a decision dated May 28, 1951, declared
appellants herein, the absolute owners of the property in litigation,
and with regards to the damages claimed, it made the following
pronouncement: .</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"*** condenando ademas a I03 citados demandados a
pagar a los demandantes, en concepto de danos y perjuicioa, la cantidad
de P246.25 **".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The judgment in Civil Case No. 489 was appealed to the Court of
Appeals by herein appellees (CA-G.R. No. 8280-R) which Court affirmed
the same <em>in toto</em>. During the pendency of the appeal, appellee
Francisco Alas retained possession of the premises and allegedly
benefited from the fruits thereof. On May 15, 1955, appellants were
placed in possession of the property. The amount of P246.25 awarded by
the trial court, as <em>deños y perjuicios</em>, was also paid by the appellants.</p>
<p>Claiming that they (plaintiffs-appellants herein) were entitled to a
part of the fruits of the property during the pendency of the appeal,
until its delivery to them, appellants presented on October 8, 1955,
with the Justice of the Peace Court of Hinunangan, Leyte, the instant
case, against Francisco and Roman Alas (appellees) asking P720.00, as
the value of their shares in the fruits. Defendants presented separate
Answers, thru the same counsel. After admitting some and denying others
of the allegations, defendants claimed that <em>res judicata</em> had
already set in; that the value of the produce allegedly derived from
the property, was not correct, since during that period a number of
typhoons had come and gone, resulting in "no nut production", after the
last one typhoon Amy). Both defendants asked P200.00 each for
attorney's fees.</p>
<p>The case was set for hearing on November 15, 1955. Prior to the
scheduled date, however, defendants therein moved to dismiss the
complaint, reiterating the defenses set forth in their Answers. Under
date of November 6, 1955, defendant Roman Alas presented an amended
Answer, the only added portion being his counterclaim for P500.00 for
actual, moral and other damages and P400.00 by way of attorney's fees.
After trial, the Justice of the Peace of Hinunangan, Leyte, rendered
judgment, the pertinent portions of which read—</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the two defendants had been in possession
and enjoynif-nt of tho fruits of the coconut land during the four years
from Muy 28, 1951 to May 15, 1955, who will pay the value of one-half
of the produce, which pertains to the plaintiffs during such period?.
On the' time honored principle that 'no person shall be allowed to
enrich himself at the expense of another,' the defendants must pay
one-half of the value of the fruits corresponding to the off-stated
period.</p>
<p>FOR THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATION, this Court hereby renders judgment for the plaintiffs and against the defendants:</p>
<ol><li>Condemning the defendants Francisco Alas and Roman Alas,
jointly and severally to pay the plaintiffs the sum of P440.00, with
interest at six ((!'.;) percent.</li><li>Requiring said defendants to pay the costs of this suit."</li></ol>
<p>The above judgment was the subject of an appeal to the CFI of
I.laasin, Leyte, brought by the defendants. After the perfection of the
appeal, defendants presented with the CFI on January 3, 1956, a motion
to dismiss on two (2) grounds: First, the JP Court decision was a
nullity, having been rendered without due process of law, because
although defendants were represented by counsel, notice of the hearing
was sent to defendants themselves, and second, the cause of action was
barred by a prior judgment, because in Civil Case No. R—189, plaintiffs
prayed for adjudication of ownership plus damages, which they alleged
to be P1 ,000.00 and P100.00 every three months, during the pendency of
Hie action, but the court awarded them only P246.25, from which they
did not interpose an appeal.</p>
<p>The trial court ruling on the motion to dismiss, said—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"However, the defendants maintain that tlie counsel
for the defendants was not notified of the hearing of the case, and
therefore, the trial may be considered as a nullity for being done
without due process of law. The plaintiffs, however, counter that
although the attorney for the defendants was not served with the notice
of the trial yet the service was made upon the defendants themselves in
open court when this case was called on November 6, and set for the
last time on November 15th in the presence of the defendants. * *. The
notice to the defendants should not be considered as notice to their
counsel because the defendants are ignorant of court proceedings and in
this case, precisely the defendants asked for the postponement because
their counsel was not notified of the hearing of this case. It may be
recalled that when this case was called for the first time and
postponed, the notice of the trial set for October 25, 1955 was sent to
the counsel for the defendants addressed at Hinunangnn, Leyte, which
was forwarded to Maasin on October 27, 1955. The pleading showed that
the counsel for the defendants is a resident of Maasin, and in even the
letter of the Justice of the Peace, the residence for the defendants'
counsel is Maasin, Leyte, but the address in the envelope was
Hinunangan, Leyte, so that the counsel for defendants could not appear
at the trial on October 25, 1955 because the notice of hearing was
received only October 27, two days after at Maasin, Leyte, * * *.</p>
  <p>Going
to the second ground for dismissal, the parties have cited several
decisions of the Supreme Court especially the case of Solano <em>vs</em>.
Salvilla, 29 Phil. 66, where the plaintiff was allowed to present
another action for damages which damages accrued after the institution
of the first suit. But in the cases of Bossom &amp; Co. <em>vs</em>. Manila Gas Corporation, 55 Phil. 226, 237, 244; Santos <em>vs</em>. Moir, 36 Phil. 350; Pascua <em>vs</em>. Sidico, 24 Phil. 26; and Strong <em>vs</em>.
Repide, 22 Phil. 19, the Supreme Court held the contrary for it would
constitute a multiplicity of action which is abhorred by the provisions
of the new Rules of Court. * *."</p>
  <p>For the first ground to the
motion to dismiss the Court would have ordered to remand this case to
the Court of origin for trial on the merits <em>but inasmuch as there
will be no necessity for remanding this ease to the Court of origin in
view of the Court sustaining the second ground of the motion for
dismissal, this case is dismissed without pronouncement as to the cont
the action for damages being barred by thi former cam already decided
by the Court of Appeals</em>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plaintiffs appealed the . above judgment and the Court of Appeals,
certified the case to this Court, the issues involved being purely
legal in nature.</p>
<p>It has been held—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"*** a judgment between the same purtit-s is
conclusive, not only us to the subject-mutter in controversy in the
action upon which it is bused but also in all other actions involving
the same question, and upon sill matters involved in the issues which
might have been litigated and decided in the case, the presumption
being that all such issue were met and decided. * *."</p>
  <p>"An
adjudication is Anally conclusive not* only as to the matter actually
determined, but as to every other matter which parties might have
litigated and have had decided incident to or essentially connected
with the subject matter of litigation, and every matter coming within
the legitimate purview of the original action, both with respect to
matters of claim and defense." (Pua <em>vs</em>. Lupitan, 107 Phil., 95, and cases cited therein).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Encompassing the facts of the! case to the above authorities, it
becomes obvious that the damages under consideration had been passed
upon by the court in the former case. It will be recalled that aside
from claiming ownership and possession over the property, the
plaintiffs-appellants herein also asked for damages accruing at the
time of the complaint, which they computed at P1,000.00, plus P100.00
every three (3) months <em>thereafter</em>. Inspite of said claim, the
lower court only awarded P246.26 as damages. The judgment in the first
case which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, being without
condition, reservation or qualification as to what period the amount
awarded would cover, it is presumed that the same was all the value
assessed by the lower court for the damages. Appellants could have
appealed from that portion denying them their claim of Pl,000.00, plus
P100.00 for every three (3) months thereafter; but they did not.</p>
<p>With the conclusion reached, the determination of the other issue raised is deemed unnecessary.</p>
<p>CONFORMABLY WITH ALL THE FOREGOING, the decision appealed from is
hereby affirmed, in all respects, with cost against
plaintiffs-appellants.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Regala</em> and <em>Makalintal, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
