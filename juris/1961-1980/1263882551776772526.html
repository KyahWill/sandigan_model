MUNICIPAL JUDGE OF MOLAVE, ZAMBOANGA
DEL SUR, RESPONDENT.
<br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>ANTONIO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Respondent Municipal Judge <span class="SpellE">Prisco</span> N. <span class="SpellE">Pabatao</span>, of <span class="SpellE">Molave</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, is charged
with misconduct, dishonesty and ignorance of the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant's charges stemmed from respondent's Order of
dismissal dated <st1:date year="1974" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1974</st1:date>
in Criminal Case No. 2360 (for theft of two steel bars) wherein complainant
Juan <span class="SpellE">Oyao</span> is the offended party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that at the instance of Juan <span class="SpellE">Oyao</span>, the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Molave</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> filed a
complaint for theft against <span class="SpellE">Hospicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Geraldizo</span> and Judith <span class="SpellE">Geraldizo</span> on
<st1:date year="1974" day="20" month="3">March 20, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On April 23, 1974, after a "careful and
serious consideration" of complainant's affidavit and those of his
witnesses, respondent Judge "dismissed the case for lack of probable
cause", and remanded the records of the case "to the Clerk of Court
of First Instance, Pagadian, City, for the information and review of the * * *
Provincial Fiscal." <span style="">In </span>the
aforementioned Order, the respondent stated that on the basis of the
preliminary examination conducted by him, no witness testified that they saw
the two accused steal the two steel bars in question and that the reason why
the complainant charged them<span style=""> was that
he "assumed that it was <span class="SpellE">Hospicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Geraldizo</span> and Judith <span class="SpellE">Geraldizo</span>
who stole the two steel bars", and while the two steel bars were found in
the house of the accused <span class="SpellE">Hospicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Geraldizo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Hospicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Geraldizo</span> and Judith <span class="SpellE">Geraldizo</span>
were both engaged in the buying and selling of scrap iron.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to the reasoning of respondent, </span><span style="">it is </span><span style="">not necessary that the </span>accused has
been seen by a witness in the act of stealing the property, to create a
presumption of guilt from possession of stolen property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is enough to show that the property has
been stolen, and the stolen property is found in the possession of the accused,
who cannot satisfactorily explain his possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it is a well-established doctrine that
if the defendant cannot give a satisfactory explanation as to his possession of
stolen property, a <i>prima</i><i><span style="">
facie</span></i><span style=""> </span>case exists
against him for theft.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it has been
said that men who come honestly into the possession of property have no difficulty
in explaining the method by which they came to such possession.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
This rule is embodied in Section 5[j] of Rule 131 of the Revised Rules of
Court, on disputable presumptions, <span style="">to </span>wit:
"that a person found in possession of a thing taken in the doing of a recent
wrongful act is the taker and doer of the whole act; otherwise, that things
which a<span style=""> person possesses, or exercises
acts of ownership over, are owned by him."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It appears, however, that respondent Judge did not accord much
credence to the claim that the two steel bars, which were found in the
possession of the accused, were the very same steel bars which were allegedly
stolen from Juan <span class="SpellE">Oyao</span> "sometime in <span style="">the latter part of February, 1974"
(Annex "C-2").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Given this
doubt, how could he be charged with grave misconduct in his conclusion that
there is no reasonable ground to believe that the accused committed the offense
in question?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question of whether
probable cause exists or not must depend upon the judgment of the judge or
magistrate issuing the warrant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
sustain a finding of probable cause means that sufficient facts have been
presented to the judge issuing the warrant to convince him, not that the
particular person has committed the crime, but that there </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">probable cause for believing that the person whose arrest is sought
committed the crime charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no
fixed rule that can be established which will govern </span><i style=""><span style="">the
discretion</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">of the judge in this matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It all depends on the attend</span>ant
facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our attention has not been
invited to any fact in the records of the case from which We could adequately
conclude that respondent has acted arbitrarily.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, this dismissal of the case does not preclude the <span class="SpellE">refiling</span> of the case should the Provincial Fiscal, to whom
the records were referred for review, be of a different view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, Section 6, Rule 112 of the Revised
Rules of Court does not provide for appeal if the municipal judge <span style="">dis</span>misses the complaint after
conducting the investigation previous to arrest, because such dismissal does
not bar the filing of another complaint for the same offense, and there is no
accused to be released by the dismissal.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, even assuming that the dismissal of the case is erroneous,
this would be merely an error of judgment and not serious misconduct. The term
"serious misconduct" is a transgression of some established and
definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross
negligence by the magistrate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It implies
a wrongful intention and not a mere error of judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For serious misconduct to exist, there must
be reliable evidence showing that the judicial acts complained of were corrupt
or inspired by intention to violate the law, or were a persistent disregard of
well-known legal rules.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
We have previously ruled that negligence and ignorance on the part of a judge
are inexcusable if they imply a manifest injustice which cannot be explained by
a reasonable interpretation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not
so in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the respondent is EXONERATED of the charges.</p>
