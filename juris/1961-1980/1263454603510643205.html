				<h4>
				G.R. No. L-23936, September 13, 1967</h4>
				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF HAO GUAN SENG TO BE
ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES.

HAO GUAN SENG, PETITIONER, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR-APPELLANT.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by the Government from a decision of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, granting the petition of <span class="SpellE">Hao</span> Guan <span class="SpellE">Seng</span> for naturalization
as Philippine citizen.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant maintains that the lower court erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) in finding that petitioner is exempt from
filing a declaration of in­tention; and (2) in granting the petition for
naturalization, despite petitioner's failure to state in his petition one of <span style="">his former place of residence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The first alleged error is predicated upon the fact that,<span style=""> </span>although petitioner has resided in the
Philippines since 1933, or more than 30 years before he filed the petition for
naturalization, on April 22, 1963, he went abroad three (3) times during said
period of time, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) in 1946,
when he went to China, and stayed there for six (6) months; (b) in 1958, when
he went to Malaya, via <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>, to visit his wife
who is domiciled in the crown colony, where he stayed for three (3) months;
and, (c) in 1959, when he visited his wife in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>,
although the record does not show how long he was away this time.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is urged by appellant that petitioner is not exempt from the
obligation to file a declaration of intention, because the 30-year residence
required <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> must be "continuous,"
whereas <span class="SpellE">appel­lee's</span> residence in the Philippines has
been, it is averred, interrupted by his aforementioned trips abroad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
asserts that these trips did not legally affect the continuity of his residence
in the Philippines, which is not necessarily depen­dent upon physical presence
therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the second alleged error, petitioner's applica­tion
alleges that his residences in the Philippines have been:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Zam­boanga</span> City,
from 1934 to 1941; <span class="SpellE">Ipil</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, from 1942 to 1945; <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
City, from 1945 to 1950; and, eventually, the City of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>,
Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears, however, that
he arrived at the port of Manila, coming from China, on January 3, 1933, so
that, appellant concludes, he must have stayed in Manila from that date to the
year 1934 when he moved to <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> City, and his
failure to mention such former place of residence in his petition for
naturalization warrants the dismissal thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not deem it necessary, however, to pass upon these two
specific questions, for the following reason:</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 473 provides that a petitioner
for naturalization must have, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
the following qualification:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>Third</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He must
be of good moral char­acter and believe in the principles underlying the
Philippine Constitution, and <u>must have conducted himself in a proper and
irreproachable manner </u><u><span style="">during the
entire </span>period</u> of his residence in the Philippines in his relation
with the constituted Government, as well as with the community in which he
lives."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Moreover, Section 7 of the same Act
provides:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The
petition must be signed by the applicant in his own handwriting <u>and
supported by the affidavit of at least two credible persons</u> stating that
they are citizens of the Philippines and per­sonally know the petitioner to be
a resident of the Philippines for the period of time required by this Act, and
a person of good repute and morally irreproachable and <u>that said petitioner,
in their opinion, has all the qualifications necessary to become a citizen of
the Philippines</u>, and is not in any way disqualified under the provisions of
this <span style="">Act."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Inasmuch as one of the
requisite qualifications is that peti­tioner "must have conducted himself
in a proper and irreproachable manner <u>during the entire period of h</u></span><u><span style="">is </span></u><u><span style="">residence in the Philippines</span></u><span style="">," it follows necessarily that his attesting witnesses must be in
a posi­tion to establish this circumstance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case at bar, the
attesting witnesses were Dr. Ben­jamin <span class="SpellE">Lacsamana</span> and
Mr. <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span>, both
of whom claimed to have known the petitioner <u>in the year 1951</u>, and
testified to his good <span class="SpellE">behaviour</span> since then only, for
they could not supply any evi­dence about his conduct from 1933 to 1950.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, they were not in a position
to know whether or not petitioner had the qualification demanding a proper and
irreproachable conduct "<u>during the entire period of his residence</u>."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Furthermore, we have
repeatedly declared that the attest­ing witnesses must be "credible
persons," and that to fall under this category, as said term is used in
Section 7 of Commonwealth Act No. 473, it must be satisfactorily proven, not
only that the witnesses are not police characters, but, also, that they have
such a well-known reputation for honesty and integrity, in the community in
which they live, that their word can be taken on its face value.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> No proof to this effect, as regards
petitioner's aforementioned witnesses, has been introduced.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Accordingly</b>, the decision appealed from should be, as it
is hereby, reversed, and another one entered, dismissing the peti­tion, with costs
against the petitioner.</p>
