denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration, in RO4-WC Case No. 928.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Roberta <span class="SpellE">Rongavilla</span>, <span style="">hereinafter re­</span>ferred to as employee,
had been employed by the peti­tioner, National Development Company, <span style="">hereinafter re­ferred </span>to as the NDC,
in its textile mills since Octo­ber 23, 1946 until June 11, 1951 when she was <span style="">separated </span>from the service by reason
of ill health.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The employee worked as <span style="">a </span><span class="SpellE">pirm</span> winder from <st1:date year="1948" day="15" month="3">March

employee's work consisted mainly in operating the <span class="SpellE">pirm</span>
winding machine which had twenty spindles that wind the yarn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the yarn snapped the spindle would stop
spinning and the employee would connect the broken yarn and start the spindle
again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of the frequent breakage
of the yarn the employee had to be on her feet most of the time, connecting the
broken yarns and start­ing the machine.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In addition to operating the machine the employee, from </span><span style="">time </span><span style="">to time, had to get from the spinning
department the supply of yarn which she loaded on </span><span style="">a cab </span><span style="">about one-half meter square with four wheels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When no bobbin boys were available, the
employee had to push the cab herself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the yarn was wound into thread, the finished thread was again
loaded on a cab and brought to the warp section.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1950" day="16" month="10">October 16, 1950</st1:date>,
the employee was examined at the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Institute and
was found to have pulmonary lesions in the minimal stage, right and left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The employee was advised by the NDC physician
to rest for three months - which she did - and thereafter she returned to
work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1951" day="19" month="3">March 19, 1951</st1:date>, the employee returned to the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Insti­tute, complaining of chest and back pains with
coughing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was again subjected to an
X-ray <span style="">examination,
</span>and the findings indicated that the lesions in the left lung had
progressed into <span style="">a </span>moderately
advanced stage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the employee
underwent extensive treatment at the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
Institute.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1951" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1951</st1:date>,

after almost nine (9) years from the time when she was discharged by the NDC,
the employee, through counsel, filed with the Regional Office No. 4 of the

claim for disability compensation because of pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due hearing, the Hearing Officer of the <span style="">Regional </span><span style="">Office </span>No.

the compensability of the disability of the employee, and ruling at the same
time that the acceleration of a sickness of the employee is a ground for
compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">de­cision ordered the NDC:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“1. To pay the claimant through the Commission the amount of THREE
THOUSAND PESOS (P3,000.00) in one lump sum and without any reduction;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2. To pay claimant's legal coun­sel the amount of <span style="">TWO HUNDRED TWENTY
FIVE PESOS </span>(P225.00) as attorney's fees; and</blockquote>

SIX PESOS (P36.00) as decision fee and P5.00 as cost of this review pursuant to
<span style="">Sec. </span>55
of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1963</st1:date>,
the NDC filed a motion for reconsideration of the decision of <st1:date year="1963" day="10" month="6">June 10, 1963</st1:date>, above-men­tioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="9">September
 24, 1963</st1:date>, the Workmen's Compensation Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
denied the motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the decision and the resolution, mentioned in
the preceding paragraph, the NDC appealed to this Court.</p>

<blockquote><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is argued by the NDC in the
present appeal:</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(1) that the Workmen's Compensation Commission erred in holding
that the illness of the employee due to tuber­culosis and the aggravation of
that ill­ness, which had taken place before the enactment of Republic Act 772
(which amended Act 3428), is a ground for disability compensation; and</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">(2) </span>that the
Workmen's Compensation Commission had no jurisdiction to enter­tain the
employee's claim for compensation because the claim was not filed in ac­cordance
with the provisions of Section 24 of Act 3428 (the Workmen's Compensation Law).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">1. In connection with the first ground it raised, the NDC contends
that when the employee contracted tuberculosis, and during the period when that
ailment was aggravated, Section 2 of Act 3428 did not provide that tuberculosis
was a sickness that was compensable, and that the aggravation of that sickness
due to the nature of the employment was not a ground for compensa­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The NDC points out that the employee was
separat­ed from the service on account of her sickness of tuber­culosis on June
11, 1951, and it was not until June 20, 1952 when Section 2 of Act 3428 was
amended so <span style="">as </span>to provide that
an employee, who "contracts tuberculosis... <span style="">caused </span>by such employment" or whose tuberculosis or illness
is "aggravated by... the nature of such employ­ment,…", would be
entitled to compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The NDC
maintains that the amendments to Section 2 of Act 3428 should not be applied
retroactively to the disability of the employee that <span class="SpellE">occured</span>
prior to <st1:date year="1952" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1952</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The contention of the NDC
can not be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be
considered that even before Republic Act 772 took effect on </span><st1:date year="1952" day="20" month="6"><span style="">June 20,
 1952</span></st1:date><span style="">, it </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">already provided in Section 2 of Act 3428
that an employee is entitled to compensation if he "contracts </span><u>any</u>
<span style="">illness directly caused by such
employment, or the result of the nature of such employment."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In other words, even before Republic Act 772
went into effect on June 20, 1952 if it was shown that an employee contracted
an illness - be it tuberculosis or any other illness - caused by the employment
or is the result of the nature of the employment, such employee is entitled to </span>compensation.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">The findings of the Workmen's
Compensation Commission is that the employee in the case now before Us became
sick of tuberculosis because of the nature, or as a result, of her
employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We reproduce here the pertinent
portion of the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It should be recalled that it was on <st1:date year="1950" day="10" month="10">October 10, 1950</st1:date> when the claimant was first
found afflicted with minimal pulmonary tuberculosis and because of which <span style="">she <span style="">was
</span>advised </span>by the company physician to <span style="">rest </span>for three months.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While the re­cords do not indicate the specific date <span style="">she returned to work, she must have return­ed
sometime in January of 1951.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Barely two
months later, on </span><st1:date year="1951" day="19" month="3"><span style="">March 19, 1951</span></st1:date><span style="">, her lesions were found to be in the
moderately advanced stage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such rapid
acceleration </span>of claimant's illness could not be attributed to any other
cause except that of the nature of her work inasmuch as there was no evidence
in the record of causal relationship other than that of her employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The flare up of her <span style="">illness </span>usually occurred after the brief period of return to
work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be denied that
claimant's work required her to be constantly on her toes and involved a lot of
exertion of energy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As long as the
machine was in operation she could not take even a brief rest from her
labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is <span style="">also </span>evidence that from 1949 to 1950, the claimant worked on a
quota basis, meaning to say that if claimant could <span style="">finish more than her <span class="SpellE">al­lo<span style="">ted</span></span></span> quota of work, she was <span style="">paid extra for </span>that.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, we should not lose sight of the fact that the claimant
worked alternate­ly in three rotating shifts, as a result of which <span style="">she </span>had to be on duty two-thirds of
the time from late afternoon till early morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have time and again made observations on the
debilitating effect of night work upon the constitution of a worker
particularly women.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact all labor
laws protecting women and minors allow night work in a very limited degree
considering the dual nature of <span style="">a </span>woman's
work - the uncompensated task at home and employment in a factory."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The foregoing findings of
the Workmen's Compensation Commission are sufficient grounds to declare the
employee herein entitled to compensation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fact that at the time said employee contracted tuberculosis the word
"tubercu­losis" and the phrase "aggravated by" (the nature
of employ­ment) were not yet inserted in Section 2 of Act 3428 is of no moment
as far as the right of the employee to compensation in the present case is
concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What matters is that the
illness of the employee was caused by the employment or was the result of the
nature of the employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following </span>ruling
of this Court in the case of Blue Bar Coconut Company, et al. vs. Joaquin Boo,
95 Phil. 867, 873-874 (G. R. No. L-6820, September 28, 1952) has settled this
question:</p>

<blockquote>"The fact that the term 'tuberculo­<span style="">sis' </span>and the words 'either aggravated by' are inserted by Republic
Act No. 772, amending section 2 of the Workmen's Com­pensation Act (No. 3428,
as amended), which took effect on 20 June 1952 only, does not change the import
of the legal provisions concerning the employer's liability to give
compensation to a laborer who was disabled by an ailment which was the result
of the nature of his work or employment, as pro­<span style="">vided </span>for in the original Workmen's Compen­sation Act (No. 3428, <span style="">as </span>amended
by Act No. 3812).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already stated, if
the claimant was not infected when in 1946 he was engaged by the company as <span style="">a </span>dryer man
in its factory and he contracted the disease after the accident in October 1948,
from which he completely recovered according to the company's physician, it is
a logical inference that he contracted the illness as a result of the nature of
his work or employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no need
for the amendatory terms of section 2 inserted by Republic Act No. 772, <span style="">except </span>for the purpose of
clarification, because under the terms of the original section 2 of Act No.
3428, as amended by Act No. 3812, the com­pany <span style="">is </span>liable to pay the compensation
therein provided."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing ruling was re-stated in the decision of this Court
in the case of Manila Railroad Company v. Daniel Perez and Workmen's
Compensation Commission, G. R. No. L-21071, promulgated on <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="6">June 29, <span style="">1965</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">2. Going to the second ground raised by the NDC, the record shows
that the action for compensation was filed by the employee before the Workmen's
Compensation Commission, on <st1:date year="1960" day="31" month="5">May 31,
 1960</st1:date>, or almost nine years after she was discharged from her
employment by the NDC on ac­count of her illness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also appears that the employee failed to
file her claim <span style="">for compensation with </span><span style="">the NDC w</span><span style="">ithin two </span>months from the date of her discharge from employment
because of her illness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Discussing this
point, the NDC contends that the Workmen's Compensation Com<span style="">mission erred in not holding that the filing of
written claim for compensation within the period prescribed under section 24 of
Act 3428 is a condition precedent and </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">jurisdictional
requirement which must be complied with in order to maintain compensation
proceedings under the said Act, and that because the employee failed to comply
with said requirements the Workmen's Compensation Commission has no, and could
not have acquired, juris­diction over the instant case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner's contention
has no merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is now </span>a very
well settled rule that failure on the part of the employee to comply with the
requirements of Section 24 of Act 3428 - that <span style="">is, </span>the giving of notice to, and the
filing of claim with, the employer, within the time pres­cribed in said section
- is non-jurisdictional.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It is </span>also a
settled rule that failure or delay in giving notice to the employer, as
provided in Section 24 of the law, shall not be <span style="">a </span>bar to the proceedings in the claim
for compensa­tion if it is shown that the employer, his agent or rep­resentative,
had knowledge of the injury, sickness, or death, or that the employer did not
suffer by such delay or failure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
then, it is likewise the settled rule that even if a claim for compensation is
filed beyond the period prescribed in Section 24 of Act 3428, when it is shown
that the employer has not manifested to the Workmen s Compensation Commission
his intention to controvert the right to compensation, either on or before the
fourteenth day of disability or within ten days after he has knowledge of the
accident, the Workmen's Compensation Commission can proceed to determine and
decide the claim for compensation (Manila Railroad Company v. The Workmen's
Compensation Commission and Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Balmeo</span>, G.R. No.
L-21902, <st1:date year="1967" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1967</st1:date>).<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The record shows that it
was on </span><st1:date year="1950" day="16" month="10"><span style="">October 16, 1950</span></st1:date><span style="">, when the employee </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">first
found to be afflicted with minimal pulmonary tuberculosis and because of which
she </span>was advised by the <span class="SpellE">NDC's</span> physician to rest
for three months, which she did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
sometime the employee returned to work, and she was made to work by the NDC <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of the fact that at that time it was already known
by NDC management that the employee <span style="">was </span>suffering from pulmonary lesions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear that even before the actual date
of her discharge from employment on June 11, 1951 by reason of her illness the <span style="">NDC </span>had full knowledge of the illness,
and <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of this knowledge the NDC did not file
the required employer's report of accident or sickness as provided for in
section 37 of Act No. 3428 as amended, as well as the notice of its intention
to controvert the right to compensation as provided for in section 45 of the
same Act, and neither did the NDC seek the re­instatement of its right to
controvert.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear, therefore, that
for having failed to controvert the right of the employee to compensation
within the period pres­cribed in section 45 of Act No. 3428 and for having
failed to seek reinstatement of its right to controvert, the <span style="">NDC is </span>considered, under the law, as
having renounced its right to controvert the right of the employee to com­pensation,
and the NDC cannot now contest the employee's claim upon the ground of the
employee's failure to comply with the requirements of Section 24 of Act 3428,
as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the employer that must comply strictly with the
requirements of the law regarding the giving of notice of accident, injury or
sickness of his/its employee to the Workmen's Compensation Commission, and of
his/its intention to controvert the right of the injured or disabled employee
to compensation within fourteen days after his/its knowledge of the employee's
disability, or within ten days after his/its knowledge of any accident that
caused injury to the employee; and failure of the employer, or of the insurance
carrier, to comply with this requirement of the law shall constitute a
renunciation of his/its right to controvert the claim, unless he/it submits
reasonable grounds for the failure to make the required report and notice of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> to the Workmen's Compensation Com­mission, on
the basis of which grounds the Workmen's Compensation Commission may reinstate
his/its right to con­trovert.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Manila
Railroad Company v. Workmen's Compensation Commission and Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Balmeo</span>, <u>supra</u>).<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">It appearing that the NDC in the present case had not complied
with its obligation under the law, as pointed out in the preceding paragraphs,
the Workmen's Compensation Commission did not err when it entertained and
decided the claim of the employee.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact, that the claim for compensation was filed before the Workmen's
Compensation Commission almost nine years after disability had commenced, is
not <span style="">a </span>bar to the action of the
employee to recover compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
liability of the employer to pay compensation under the Workmen's Compensation
Act <span style="">is </span>an obligation created by
law, <span style="">and under paragraph (2) of Article
1144 of the Civil Code of the Philippines the action to enforce this obligation
can be brought within ten years from the tine the right of action accrues
