<p class="BODY">In the evening of <st1:date year="1971" day="22" month="12">December
 22, 1971</st1:date>, the provincial officials and employees of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename></st1:place> were having a Christmas
party in the quadrangle of the Provincial Capitol.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Esperanza <span class="SpellE">Sulleza</span>
had a cigarette stand in front of the Provincial Capitol, about seven (7)
meters from the repair shop for refrigerators and other appliances owned by
appellants Manuel Buena and Jose <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the afore-mentioned shop, <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegayan</span>, a nephew of Jose <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span>, was employed as helper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Early that evening of <st1:date year="1971" day="22" month="12">December 22, 1971</st1:date>, Manuel Buena, Jose <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegayan</span> were seen drinking beer in the repair shop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this point of time, Esperanza <span class="SpellE">Sulleza</span> was selling cigarettes in front of the Capitol, assisted
by her children — William, 7 years of age, Melanie, 10 years of age, and Lorna,
aged 12.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to Esperanza <span class="SpellE">Sulleza</span>, at
about <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 o'clock</st1:time> that evening, her
husband, <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> <span class="SpellE">Sulleza</span>,
Jr. arrived and asked for cigarettes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
he was stooping to light his cigarette from a kerosene lamp on the cigarette
stand, <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegayan</span>
suddenly stabbed him in the abdomen with a butcher's knife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Esperanza immediately grabbed <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegayan</span> and held him while
she shouted at her husband to run away.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The victim ran towards the <span class="SpellE">Bahay</span> Kubo Store in
front of the fountain, pursued by Jose <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span> and
Manuel Buena.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was, however, overtaken
by appellant Jose <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span> who stabbed him in the back
and then in the abdomen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This witness
further tes­tified that Manuel Buena held the two hands of <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span>
from behind, and <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span> again stabbed the
victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span>
had fallen to the ground and <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span> and Buena had
run away, Esperanza shouted:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Oh,
my husband is already dead." In the meantime, <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vegayan</span> had also extricated himself from the hold of
Esperanza and run away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jose <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span> ran towards the residence of <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sorongon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
victim, <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> <span class="SpellE">Sulleza</span>,
Jr., was brought to the <st1:city><st1:place>St. Paul</st1:place></st1:city>'s
Hospital but he died upon arrival.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
the policemen arrived at the scene of the incident, Esperanza told them that
the three — <span class="SpellE">Vegayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span>
and Buena — stabbed her husband.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lorna <span class="SpellE">Sulleza</span>, 12 years of age,
student, declared that while she was going to the dance hall, she heard her
mother shouting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She ran towards her and
saw her holding <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time, her father was running towards <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Iznart</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, pursued by
appellants Jose <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span> and Manuel Buena.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jose <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span>
overtook her father and stabbed him in the back with a kitchen knife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After Manuel Buena had gotten hold of the
hands of the victim, <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span> stabbed him again in
front.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Buena and <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span>
then ran away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The policemen were able
to apprehend Manuel Buena and Jose <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span> but failed
to apprehend <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegayan</span>,
who remains at large up to the present.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants Jose <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span> and Manuel
Buena admitted that they were occupying and renting a house at <st1:address><st1:street>No.
  15 Gen. Luna Street</st1:street>, <st1:city>Iloilo</st1:city></st1:address>
City, in front of the Provincial Capitol where they lived with <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ground floor was utilized as a repair
shop for refrigeration appliances owned and operated by Jose <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span> and Manuel Buena, wherein <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vegayan</span> was employed as a helper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> <span class="SpellE">Sulleza</span>, Jr. and his family lived in another house, about
seven (7) meters away from the house of appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to appellants' evidence, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date year="1971" day="22" month="12">December 22, 1971</st1:date>, PC Staff Sgt.
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Palmares</span> and Jose <span class="SpellE">Palabrica</span>
were drinking beer with Manuel Buena and Jose <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span>
in the house of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jose <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span> was then holding his three-month old baby, while
Manuel Buena was playing the guitar.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Jose <span class="SpellE">Palabrica</span> was singing.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Palmares</span>, while they
were thus engaged, he heard shouts to the effect that there was a fight going
on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He noticed a commotion at the street
about thirty (30) yards away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
noticing this, he went down the house, followed by Jose <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span>
and Manuel Buena, and they proceeded to the place of the commotion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Palmares</span>
arrived at the scene, he came upon Esperanza who was then shouting that her
husband was stabbed by <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also saw <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sulleza</span>, Jr. already wounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many people and peace officers were milling
around the place, but he did not notice the presence of appellants Jose <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span> and Manuel Buena.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He further testified that as the city police authorities were already at
the scene, he looked for <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegayan</span>
at the house which he was occupying and the adjacent houses but he could not
find him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span> and Buena, upon the
other hand, testified that they followed Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Palmares</span>
and when they arrived at the scene of the crime, they saw Esperanza <span class="SpellE">Sulleza</span> moving around shouting "<span class="SpellE">Delfin</span>
stabbed Junior." The victim at that moment was about eight (8) meters away
from them walking in a groggy manner as if he could not maintain his
balance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon seeing his condition, Jose
<span class="SpellE">Besorio</span> told Manuel Buena:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Let us help Junior for he is about to
fall." It was at that instance that Manuel Buena allegedly placed himself
behind <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> and after placing his left arm under
the left armpit of the deceased, tried to support him to prevent him from
falling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jose <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span>
declared that he placed himself in front of <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span>,
lifted his (<span class="SpellE">Nicanor's</span>) T-shirt and peered at his
abdomen and said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Oh, Junior is
wounded." At that moment, motorcycle policeman Julian de Jose arrived at
the scene, and upon noticing the condition of the victim, he suggested that
they make him sit on the chair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According
to appellant <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span>, he delivered the person of <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> <span class="SpellE">Sulleza</span>, Jr. to Pat. de
Jose and told him:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegayan</span> stabbed Junior <span class="SpellE">Sulleza</span>." Thereafter, he and appellant Buena went home
and slept.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning of <st1:date year="1971" day="23" month="12">December 23, 1971</st1:date>, some policemen came to the
house of appellants <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span> and Buena and arrested
them and they were brought to the police headquarters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that place, they saw Mrs. Esperanza <span class="SpellE">Sulleza</span> and Lorna <span class="SpellE">Sulleza</span> who
both pointed to them as the persons responsible for stabbing the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="6" month="1">January 6, 1972</st1:date>,
the City Fiscal of Iloilo City filed an Information with the Court, charging
the appellants with Murder, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 22nd day of December, 1971, in the City
of Iloilo, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Court, said accused,
<span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegayan</span> and Jose <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span> each armed with a butcher's knife, conspiring and
confederating with their co-accused Manuel Buena, working together and helping
one another, with deliberate intent and without any justifiable motive, with
treachery and evident premeditation, taking advantage of their superior
strength and number, did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>,
unlawfully and criminally stab, hit and wound <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sulleza</span> with the said weapons with which the accused
were provided at the time, hitting said <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> <span class="SpellE">Sulleza</span> on vital parts of his body which caused his death
few hours thereafter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"CONTRARY TO LAW."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegayan</span>,
until the present, remains at large, hence, only Jose <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span>
and Manuel Buena were tried and convicted of the offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1979" day="2" month="2">February
 2, 1979</st1:date>, during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of this
appeal, the case against Manuel Buena was dismissed insofar as his criminal
liability is concerned, in view of the death of said appellant on <st1:date year="1978" day="3" month="10">October 3, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this decision refers only to the
appeal of Jose <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue raised in appellants' brief is the credibility of
the testimonies of Esperanza <span class="SpellE">Sulleza</span> and her
daughter, Lorna <span class="SpellE">Sulleza</span>, in pointing to <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span> and Buena as the assailants of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the contention of appellants that it
was highly improbable for the appellants to have attacked <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sulleza</span> since neither <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span>
nor Buena had any misunderstanding with the victim and, therefore, had no
motive whatsoever to do him harm.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellants further contend that the testimonies of the prosecution
witnesses contained contradictions and inconsistencies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, appellants place much stress on the
alleged variance between the statement of Lorna <span class="SpellE">Sulleza</span>
before the Fiscal on <st1:date year="1971" day="23" month="12">December 23,
 1971</st1:date> (Exhibit "1"), and her declaration at the
trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the affidavit of
Lorna <span class="SpellE">Sulleza</span>, she was at the provincial building
observing the dance when she heard the voice of her mother shouting
"Help" and it was at that juncture when she saw her father being
stabbed, and when she was asked what she did, she answered:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Nothing, I merely looked at them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from that I did not at first know that
they were ganging up on my father." On the witness stand, she testified
that she saw her mother holding <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegayan</span>, while her father ran away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that juncture, appellants chased and overtook
her father, one stabbing him in the back while the other held both of his
hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This alleged contradiction is more
apparent than real.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted
that her testimony in court is more detailed than her affidavit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In both statements, she positively declared
that she saw her father being stabbed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The circumstance that she omitted some of those details in her pre-trial
affidavit does not render her testimony in court incredible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this Court observed in a previous case,
the omission in the pre-trial affidavits of some facts later testified to in
court by the affiants as prosecution witnesses does not necessarily impair
their credibility.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that Esperanza <span class="SpellE">Sulleza</span>,
the widow of <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> <span class="SpellE">Sulleza</span>,
Jr., was at the scene of the crime on the date and time in question and
actually saw the stabbing of her husband.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As stated by the trial court in its decision, it found no compelling
reason why it should not believe her testimony as appellants have not shown any
fact or circumstance from which it could be reasonably inferred that said
witness falsely testified or that she was actuated by improper motives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither has it been shown that Lorna <span class="SpellE">Sulleza</span> was actuated by improper motives in testifying
against the appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where no
improper motive has been shown, relationship of a witness to the victim does
not render the clear and positive testimony of said witness less worthy of
credence.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the trial court declared that it "cannot
believe both accused from their manner and demeanor on the witness stand, from
their facial expressions and tone of their voices while testifying, and the
circumstances of the case * * *." As observed in <i>People v. <span class="SpellE">Solaña</span></i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> a
witness' demeanor in the witness box is often better evidence of his veracity
than the answer he gives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not
disputed that the scene of the crime afforded clear and positive identification
of the assailants as it was then well lighted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellants were admittedly well known by said witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was, therefore, unlikely that either
Esperanza or her daughter, Lorna, were mistaken in their identification of
appellants and in describing the manner in which they attacked the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indicative of the sincerity of said witnesses is the fact that
immediately after the incident they pointed to the two appellants as the
assailants of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the
trial court found that in the evening of the incident, just a few hours after
the stabbing, Esperanza <span class="SpellE">Sulleza</span> and Lorna <span class="SpellE">Sulleza</span>, who were at the police headquarters pointed at the
two accused as the persons responsible for the death of <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sulleza</span>, Jr. the moment said accused arrived thereat
accompanied by policemen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"At that
moment Esperanza and Lorna did not think and they did not have in mind that <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegayan</span> would not be
apprehended."</p>

<p class="BODY">In summing up the evidence against appellant Jose <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span>, the trial court stated:</p>

<blockquote>"Did Jose <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span> stab <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> <span class="SpellE">Sulleza</span>, Jr.?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to Esperanza, <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vegayan</span> stabbed her husband at the stomach
(abdomen).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to <span class="SpellE">Herna</span> <span class="SpellE">Domanil</span> she saw <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegayan</span> stab and pull a
bloody knife from the abdomen of <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> <span class="SpellE">Sulleza</span>, Jr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
wound thus inflicted must be wound No. 3 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'B-4')
at the abdominal region described in Exhibit 'A'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This wound No. 3 in Exhibit 'A' or Exhibit
'B-4' is '2 cm. wide, 6.5 cm. long'.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Wounds No. 1 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'B-2') and No. 2, (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'B-3') described in Exhibit 'A' have the width of '8
mm'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the sharp pointed
knife which inflicted wounds Nos. 1 and 2 described in Exhibit 'A' (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 'B-2' and 'B-3' in Exhibit 'B') has the thickness of
'2 cm', i.e. one knife inflicted wound Nos. 1 and 2 and another knife inflicted
wound No. 3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wounds No. 1 and 2 described
in Exhibit 'A' or Exhibits 'B-2' and 'B-3' were inflicted by Jose <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span>; wound No. 3, described in Exhibit 'A' or Exhibit
'B-4' was inflicted by <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegayan</span>.
<span style="">&nbsp;</span>Wound No. 4 described in Exhibit 'A' or
Exhibit 'B-5' was inflicted by Jose <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span> when he
had overtaken <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> <span class="SpellE">Sulleza</span>
Jr. when he ran away after he received the stabbed blow from <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegayan</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellants pose the defense of alibi, yet both of them admitted
that they were in the vicinity of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their claim that they went there to help the victim is not corroborated
by competent evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Palmares</span> testified
that at the time of the stabbing the two appellants were drinking beer with
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This testimony, however, is
unpersuasive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although he claimed to be
present at the scene of the incident immediately after the stabbing and that as
a peace officer he pursued <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Vegayan</span>
because he was interested in arresting the assailant, he never bothered to
inform the police of what he knew when they arrived at the scene of the
incident to investigate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, he
stated that he lost interest in the case when he did not find <span class="SpellE">Vegayan</span> in the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If it were true that he knew that the two appellants who were his
friends were not involved in the crime, why did he not inform the police of
that fact after learning of appellants' arrest and detention by the police, or
the Fiscal, when he was investigating the case?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Certainly, such an unpersuasive testimony cannot prevail over the
positive declaration of the two witnesses for the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court <i>a quo</i> correctly held that the crime committed is
murder qualified by treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
records clearly disclose that the victim was already in the act of running away
when he was pursued by Jose <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span> and Manuel
Buena.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was, moreover, already
wounded, having been stabbed in the abdomen by <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vegayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
being overtaken by <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span> and Buena, he was stabbed
by <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span> in the abdomen and then in the back, and
while Buena held both his hands from behind, <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span>
stabbed him a third time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
apparent, therefore, that the victim was not in any position to defend himself,
that appellants took advantage of his wounded condition, and that in holding
both his hands from behind, Buena insured his defenselessness, thus enabling <span class="SpellE">Besorio</span> to stab him a third time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is settled that treachery is present where
the victim is rendered defenseless in order to insure the execution of the
crime without risk to the offenders.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

accompanying the commission of the crime, the penalty of <i>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></i> was properly im­posed.</p>
