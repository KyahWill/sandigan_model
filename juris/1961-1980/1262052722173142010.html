				<BR><STRONG>SANCHEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align=""><div align="justify"><br><p>Petitioner Rafael M. Abaya passed the civil service examination for patrolmen 
held on November 24, 1962. On March 3, 1964, he was appointed Manila patrolman 
by respondent mayor Antonio J. Villegas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The Commissioner of Civil Service,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> respondent Abelardo Subido, approved this 
appointment on May 20, 1964 with the following conditions: (a) subject to the 
usual physical and medical examination; (b) provided that there is no pending 
administrative case against the appointee; no pending protest against the 
appointment; and no decision by competent authority that will adversely affect 
the approval of said appointment.</p>
<p>On October 16, 1964, petitioner started service.</p>
<p>On May 18, 1965, the Commissioner addressed to the Mayor a communication 
advising that because petitioner gave a false answer to his application for 
patrolmen's examination, he (Commissioner) cancelled petitioner's civil service 
eligibility derived therefrom, and that accordingly petitioner's appointment was 
anchored on eligibility fraudulently obtained. He directed that petitioner's 
employment "be terminated immediately".</p>
<p>The false answer just adverted to is contained in petitioner's verified 
application aforesaid, dated November 15, 1962. Question No. 6 thereof 
reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"6. Have you ever been accused of, indicted for or tried for the violation of 
any law, ordinance, or regulation, before any court, or have you ever been 
charged with or tried for any breach or infraction of military, naval, or 
constabulary discipline before any military, naval, or constabulary tribunal or 
other authorities ? (If so, give the date and state fully the nature of the 
offense. A CERTIFIED COPY OF COURT PROCEEDINGS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED WITH 
APPLICATION. If already submitted, give date of submission and in connection 
with what examination)."</p></blockquote>
<p>To this question petitioner answered "No". The fact, however, was that at the 
time of the filing of the application there were cases pending against him in 
the Fiscal's Office and in the City Court of Manila. Cited were: Criminal Case 
No. F-016885, for sjight physical injuries;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Criminal Case No. D-095207, for trespass 
to dwelling;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Criminal Case No. 
J-064029, for violation of section 844, Revised Ordinances;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and I. S. No. 61-28520, for estafa.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></p>
<p>The Mayor sought the opinion of the City Fiscal of Manila. The latter, on 
June 7, 1965, opined that termination of petitioner's employment "without prior 
hearing on the alleged violation of law and civil service rules, would be 
violative of the due process clause and the security of tenure guaranteed civil 
service employees. (Sec. 1, Art. Ill and Sec. 4, Art. XII, Constitution; Sec. 
32, R. A. 2260)".</p>
<p>On June 9, 1965, the Mayor wrote the Commissioner, informing that in view of 
the City Fiscal's opinion he was proceeding administratively against 
petitioner.</p>
<p>But, on June 15, 1965, the Commissioner sent the Mayor another directive 
stating that a hearing would be "a useless act"; reiterating that petitioner's 
services be terminated; and reminding the city executive of the penal liability 
under Section 44 of the Civil Service Act of 1959 (Republic Act 2260) in the 
event of his failure to comply therewith.</p>
<p>The Mayor required petitioner to explain. In his answer, dated June 18, 
1965,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> petitioner admitted "having made 
a negative reply to Question No. 6" of his application for examination.</p>
<p>In a letter of October 18, 1965, the'Mayor terminated petitioner's services 
in the Manila Police Department, effective immediately.</p>
<p>Since May, 1965, respondent City Treasurer withheld petitioner's salary.</p>
<p>On November 2, 1965, petitioner went to the Manila court on prohibition and 
mandamus. Upon the petition therefor and the answer thereto, and the stipulation 
of facts, the trial court, on June 15, 1966, rendered judgment, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"WHEREFORE, the respondents are hereby ordered to reinstate the petitioner 
into the service, to pay his salaries accruing since May, 1965, without 
prejudice to initiating the proper proceedings for the removal of the 
petitioner. Respondents shall pay the costs."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>The case before us is <em>solely</em> upon appeal taken by the 
Commissioner.</p>
<ol><li>The constitutionally protected security of tenure is: "[N]o officer or 
employee in the divil service shall be removed or suspended except for cause as 
provided by law".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 
<p>Section 32 of the Civil Service Law of 1959 echoes this precept with the 
provision that "[N]o officer or employee in the civil service shall be removed 
or suspended except for cause as provided by law and after due process:" Said 
Section 32 adds that the officer or employee complained of "shall be entitled to 
a formal investigation if he so elects, in which case, he shall have the right 
to appear and defend himself at said investigation in person or by counsel, to 
confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him, and to have the attendance 
of witnesses and production of documents in his favor by compulsory process or 
<em>subpoena</em> or <em>subpoena duces tecum</em>. " A civil service employee 
should be heard before he is condemned. Jurisprudence has clung to this rule 
with such unrelentless grasp that by now it would appear trite to make citation 
thereof.</p>
<p>Two acts adverse to petitioner were done: Appellant Commissioner's 
cancellation of his eligibility, <em>and</em> respondent Mayor's order of 
dismissal, Concededly, however, there was no investigation prior to the 
cancellation of petitioner's civil service eligibility <em>and</em> before he 
was eased out of the service. Consequently, petitioner was denied due 
process.</p>
</li><li>But the thrust of appellant's argument is that formal investigation is 
unnecessary because petitioner has admitted that he made "a negative reply to 
Question No. 6 of his application for examination", heretofore transcribed. From 
this, appellant draws the conclusion that petitioner made a "false negative 
answer" and that formal investigation would be but an act of supererogation. 
<p>We go to the controlling principle. Rule II, Article 4, of the Civil Service 
Rules,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> in its proviso, reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That when an applicant for examination <em>intentionally</em> makes a false 
statement of any material fact in his application, or practices or attempts to 
practice any deception or fraud in connection with his examination, the 
Commissioner shall invalidate his examination <em>and</em> such offense shall be 
ground for his removal from the service."</p></blockquote>
<p>The accent is on the word <em>intentionally</em>. The fact that petitioner 
made an answer which is at war with the truth does not connote the idea that it 
was intentionally made. Conceivably, situations may exist which could bring up 
that answer to the level of one given in good faith. Without evidence, we are 
loathe to tar and feather petitioner as a perjurer. Short of an inquiry which 
proves that the false answer was intentionally made, we cannot attribute thereto 
a meaning which would make a felon out of petitioner. It should then go without 
saying that the vitality of the constitutional principle of due process cannot 
be allowed to weaken by sanctioning cancellation of an employee's civil service 
eligibility and/or his dismissal from service — without hearing — upon a 
<em>doubtful assumption</em> that he has admitted his guilt for an offense 
against civil service rules. It is pertinent here to recall that good faith is 
always presumed;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> In the context just 
presented, we are constrained to state that petitioner received less than a fair 
treatment. Due process, in the end, merely is "the embodiment of the sporting 
idea of fair play".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p>
<p>And again we say that petitioner was not accorded his right to due 
process.</p>
</li><li>The prematurity of petitioner's complaint is next relied upon by appellant. 
Appellant's thesis on this score is that petitioner has not exhausted 
administrative remedies — he did not appeal from the order of dismissal, but 
went straight to court. 
<p>Exhaustion of administrative remedies is not an iron-clad rule.</p>
<p>Such exhaustion is not necessary here. And for a number of reasons. 
<em>First</em>, because in the situation in which petitioner was found, 
dismissed from the job, denied his pay and with a family to support, it is easy 
to perceive that he had to look up to the courts for speedy relief. In this 
factual environment, administrative remedy — appeal to the Civil Service Board 
of Appeals — is not expeditious and adequate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <i>Second</i>, the question presented is 
"purely a legal one"; the controverted act is "patently illegal",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and "nothing of an administrative nature 
is to be or can be done".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> 
<i>Third</i>, petitioner was denied due process.<span class="style2"><sup>[16]</sup> </span>Each of the three instances just mentioned — 
and they are all present here — is an exception to the rule of exhaustion of 
administrative remedies. Petitioner's reinstatement becomes ministerial; payment 
of his back salary merely incidental to reinstatement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p></li></ol>
