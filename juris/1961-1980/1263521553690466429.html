				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">There is an element of ingenuity as well as of novelty in the
plea made by counsel <u>de</u> <u>oficio</u> in this appeal of the accused
Pableo Dramayo and Paterno Ecubin, who were sentenced to life imprison­ment for
the murder of Estelito Nogaliza.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
claim is vigorously pressed that because the information alleged conspiracy on
the part of seven defendants, with only the two appellants being convicted, two
having been utilized as state witnesses and the other three having been
acquitted on the ground of insufficiency of evidence as to their culpa­bility,
the judgment of conviction against the appellants cannot stand, there being a
reasonable doubt as to their guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
bolster such a contention, certain alleged deficiencies in the proof offered by
the prosecution were noted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A careful
study of the evidence of record would leave no other rational conclusion but
that the deceased met his death at the hands of the appellants in the manner as
found by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence the
appeal cannot prosper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY">The gory incident which was attended by a fatality started on the
morning of January 9, 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two
accused, now appellants, Pableo Dramayo and Paterno Ecubin, in the company of
the deceased Estelito Nogaliza, all of Barrio Magsaysay, of the Municipality of
Sapao, Surigao del Norte, saw its chief of police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their purpose was to shed light on a robbery
committed in the house of the deceased five days before by being available as
witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The response was decidedly in
the negative as they themselves were prime suspects, having been implicated by
at least two individuals who had confessed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At about 7:00 o'clock of the same day, while they were in the house of
their co-accused Priolo Billona, the accused Dramayo invited all those present
including the other accused Francisco Billona, Modesto Ronquilla, Cresencio and
Severo Savandal, for a drinking session at a place at the back of the school
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was on that occasion that
Dramayo brought up the idea of killing Estelito Nogaliza so that he could not
testify in the robbery case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The idea
was for Dramayo and Ecubin to ambush Estelito, who was returning from Sapao.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The others were to station themselves nearby.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Soon the unfortunate victim was sighted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was accosted by Dramayo with a request for
a cigarette.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was then that Ecubin hit
him with a piece of wood on the side of the head near the right ear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dramayo's participation consisted of repeated
stabs with a short pointed bolo as he lay prostrate from the blow of
Ecubin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was the former also, who
warned the rest of the group to keep their mouths sealed as to what had just
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His equanimity appeared
undisturbed for early the next morning, he went to the house of the deceased
and informed the latter's widow Corazon that he had just seen the cadaver of
Estelito.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The barrio lieutenant and the
chief of police were duly notified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
latter, upon noticing blood stains on the trousers of Dramayo, asked him to explain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer was that a skin ailment of his
daughter was the cause thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The death was due to the wounds inflicted, two in the epigastric
region, one in the right lumbar region, and another in the left breast.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was on the basis of the above testimony offered by the
prosecution that the lower court reached its decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its dispositive portion found the accused,
now appellants, Pableo Dramayo and Paterno Ecubin, guilty "beyond
reasonable doubt, of the crime of [murder], defined and penalized under Art.
248 of the Revised Penal Code, qualified by the circumstance of evident
premeditation and aggravated by night time, and imposes upon each of the said
accused, Pableo Dramayo and Paterno Ecubin, the penalty of [reclusion
perpetua]."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Reference was likewise made in such decision as to why the other co-accused
were not convicted, two of them, Crescencio Savandal and Severo Savandal being
utilized as state witnesses, and the other three, Priolo Billona, Francisco
Billona and Modesto Ronquilla acquitted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Why they should not be found guilty was explained in the appealed
decision thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"From the beginning
the accused Modesto Ronquilla maintained that he was not with the group but
that he was fishing in the sea during the night in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These facts that is, that none of the
prosecution witnesses has testified that any of these three accused actually
helped in the killing of the deceased, Estelito Nogaliza; that these three
accused were in­cluded in the case only much later after the filing of this
case against Pableo Dramayo and Paterno Ecubin; the consistent contention of
the accused Modesto Ronquilla that he was out in the sea fishing during the
night in question; and the testimonies of the accused Priolo Billona [and]
Francisco [and their witnesses,] Juan Billona, Esperanza Oposa-Billona,
Guillerma Ponce, and Anselmo Lisondra, given in a straight-forward manner,
without hesitation, revealing a clear conscience, and the fact that the
testimonies of these witnesses have not been refuted by the PC soldiers [whom
they accused of maltreatment] when they were available to the prosecution,
cause the Court to entertain a very serious doubt as to the guilt of the said
accused."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court was hardly impressed with the defense of alibi
interposed by now appellants Dramayo and Ecubin, and it must have been their
lack of persuasive character that must have led to the able brief of counsel <u>de</u>
<u>oficio</u>, Atty. Arturo E. Balbastro, stressing the absence of evidence
sufficient to convict, there still being a reasonable doubt to be implied from
the fact that while conspiracy was alleged, only two of the seven accused were
held culpable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To repeat, a meticulous
appraisal of the evidence justifies a finding of the guilt of the appellants
for the offense charged, thus calling for the affirmance of the decision.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. It is to be admitted that the starting point is the presumption
of innocence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it must be, according
to the Constitution.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
That is a right safeguarded both appellants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accusation is not, according to the fundamental law, synonymous with
guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is incumbent on the
prosecution to demonstrate that culpability lies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants were not even called upon then to
offer evidence on their behalf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their
freedom is forfeit only if the requisite quantum of proof necessary for
conviction be in existence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their guilt
must be shown beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To such a standard, this Court has always been committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is need, therefore, for the most
careful scrutiny of the testimony of the state, both oral and documentary,
independently of whatever defense is offered by the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only if the judge below and the appellate
tribunal could arrive at a conclusion that the crime had been committed
precisely by the person on trial under such an exacting test should the
sentence be one of conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
thus required that every circumstance favoring his innocence be duly taken into
account.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proof against him must
survive the test of reason; the strongest suspicion must not be permitted to
sway judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conscience must be
satisfied that on the defendant could be laid the responsibility for the
offense charged; that not only did he perpetrate the act but that it amounted
to a crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is required then is
moral certainty.</p>

<p class="BODY">So it has been held from the 1903 decision of United States v.
Reyes.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
United States v. Lasada,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
decided in 1910, yields this excerpt:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"By reasonable doubt is not meant that which of possibility may
arise, but it is that doubt engendered by an investigation of the whole proof
and an inability, after such investigation, to let the mind rest easy upon the
certainty of guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Absolute certainty
of guilt is not demanded by the law to convict of any criminal charge but moral
certainty is required, and this certainty is required as to every proposition
of proof requisite to constitute the offense."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
To the same effect is an excerpt from the opinion of the late Justice Tuason in
People v. Esquivel.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In this connection it may
not be out of place to bring to the attention of prosecuting attorneys the
absolute necessity of laying before the court the pertinent facts at their
disposal with methodical and meticulous attention, clarifying contradictions
and filling up gaps and loopholes in their evidence, to the end that the
court's mind may not be tortured by doubts, that the innocent may not suffer
and the guilty not escape unpunished.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Obvious to all, this is the prosecution's prime duty to the court, to
the accused, and to the state."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is understandable why the stress should be on the absence of
sufficient evidence to establish the guilt of appellants beyond reasonable
doubt, the defense of alibi inter­posed hardly meriting any further
discussion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be denied though
that the credible and competent evidence of record resulted in moral certainty
being entertained not only by the trial judge but by us as to the culpability
of appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The force of the
controlling doctrines, on the other hand, required that the other three accused
be acquitted precisely because, unlike in the case of appellants, the requisite
quantum of proof to show guilt beyond reasonable doubt was not present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no question as to the other two who
testified for the state being likewise no longer subject to any criminal
liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reference then to an opinion
of the late Justice Laurel, stressing the need for adhering to the fundamental
postulate that a finding of guilt is allowable only when no reason­able doubt
could be entertained, is unavailing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is evident from the very citation in the brief of appellants of the
opinion of Justice Laurel in People v. Manoji.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Upon the other hand, there
are certain facts which if taken together are sufficient to raise in the mind
of the court a grave doubt as to the guilt of the defendant-appellant, 'that
doubt engendered by an investigation of the whole proof and an inability after
such investigation, to let the mind rest easy upon the certainty of guilt.'
(U.S. v. Lasada [1910] 18 Phil., 90, 96.) The finding of the two gold teeth of
the deceased in the suitcase of Maradani, and the testimony of Erajio Ello that
he gave the hat * * * to Maradani not only engender serious doubt in our minds
as to the guilt of the appellant, but also seems to sustain the theory of the
defense and strengthen the suspicion of the trial court, that Maradani and
Salupudin are not foreign to, or entirely ignorant of, the killing of Seijin
Ige.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the light of the facts and
circumstances of record, we feel that it is better to acquit a man upon the
ground of reasonable doubt, even though he may in reality be guilty, than to
confine in the penitentiary for the rest of his natural life a person who may
be innocent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
The facts of the present case certainly do not fit within the above mold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reliance on the part of appellants on the
above decision is therefore futile.</p>

<p class="BODY">The judgment of conviction should not have occasioned any
surprise on the part of the two appellants, as from the evidence deserving of
the fullest credence, their guilt had been more than amply demonstrated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The presumption of innocence could not come
to their rescue as it was more than sufficiently overcome by the proof that was
offered by the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What would
have been a blot on the law is that if, on the facts as established, no
reasonable doubt being entertained, the two appellants would have been
acquitted likewise just because the other five defendants, for the reasons
above stated, were not similarly sentenced.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The principal contention raised is thus clearly untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be stated likewise that while
squarely advanced for the first time, there had been cases where this Court,
notwithstanding a majority of the defendants being acquitted, the element of
conspiracy likewise being allegedly present, did hold the party or parties
responsible for the offense guilty of the crime charged, a moral certainty
having arisen as to their culpability.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2. The brief for appellants did seek to fortify the allegation as
to their guilt not having been sufficiently demonstrated with the contention
that the lower court overlooked or did not properly consider material and
significant facts of record that ought to have substantially affected or
altered the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even the most
careful reading of such brief, however, with due recognition of the vigor in
which this particular point is pressed, would not destroy the credibility of
the facts as testified to concerning the manner in which the deceased was
killed and the motive that prompted appellants to put an end to his life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That such a version could not have been
concocted is shown by the undeniable fact that the two appellants were duly
convicted of robbery, with the deceased as the offended party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was understandable then why they would
want to do away with the principal witness against them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was thus a strong inducement for the
appellants to have committed this crime of murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the testimony of record pointing to no
other conclusion except the perpetration of the killing by them, the effort of
their counsel, while to be expected from an advocate zealous in defense of his
clients' rights, certainly should not be attended with success.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It suffices to reiterate the well-settled
principle that this Court has invariably respected the findings of facts of a
trial judge who was in a position to weigh and appraise the testimony before
him except when, as was not shown in this case, circumstances of weight or
influence were ignored or disregarded by him.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>
