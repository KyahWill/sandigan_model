rendered in <st1:date year="1966" day="22" month="4">22 April 1966</st1:date>,
resolving a conflict between the parties <span style="">about rights to use the </span>waters of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Taguan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and the <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span> Creek in <span class="SpellE">Tiaong</span>

<p class="BODY">For the proper understanding of the controversy, it is important
to recall the general topography of the region.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As shown in the defendants-appellants' sketch plan, Exhibit
"10", which was admitted and adopted by plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span style="">page </span>879), the main source of the
water for the areas in dispute is the <span class="SpellE">Taguan</span> River
that enters the region from the north and flows south.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span class="SpellE">Taguan</span> River
divides into two main branches, one that flows southeast (called by the court
below "<span class="SpellE">Taguan</span> Segundo" and "<span class="SpellE">Puntor</span>" by appellants) and <span style="">another branch called the <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span>, that
arches first southwest and later southeast, forming an arc with the concavity
to the east, </span>and rejoins the other branch further south at the juncture
with the <span class="SpellE">Aguirra</span> creek or canal, that continues
southward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another river which is
pertinent to this case is the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cabay</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place> which <span style="">is to </span>the East of the <span class="SpellE">Aguirra</span> Creek and
bounds the irrigated <span class="SpellE">riceland</span> of plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> Del Valle on the west and south.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1918, defendants were granted water appropriation rights on
The <span class="SpellE">Taguan</span> river by the Department of Commerce and
Communications, after due investigation (<span class="SpellE">Ehxibit</span>
"B").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But <span style="">in </span>1940, plaintiffs cons­tructed at
the mouth of the <span class="SpellE">Aguirra</span>, and across it, a concrete
dam (designated as Del Valle dam) that impeded and reduced the water flow into
the <span class="SpellE">Aguirra</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Later on, in 1952, plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
increased the height of this dam, shutting off completely the water supply of
the <span class="SpellE">Aguirra</span> creek (an old irrigation canal) so that
"only a flood or heavy rain can cause the water to overflow . . . . . the
crest of the concrete dam.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs are the owners of a parcel of irrigated <span class="SpellE">riceland</span> with an area of twenty (20) hectares, more or
less, situated in barrio <span class="SpellE">Kinatihan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Candelaria</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Quezon</span></span><span style="">, which
property was inherited from their deceased grandfather, Manuel del Valle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs, in their complaint dated 6
October 1955, allege having irrigated the above <span class="SpellE">riceland</span>
by means </span>of water coming from <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span> Creek
in barrio <span class="SpellE">Cabay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tiaong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, since Spanish times up to the present, and they
claim having acquired by prescription, to the exclusion of all others, the use
of all the volume of the <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span> creek's water
passing over the dam of one <span style="">Nicolas </span><span class="SpellE">Maralit</span> which is in the upper part of that creek.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> (otherwise
known as the <span class="SpellE">Cabay</span> irrigators) are the owners of
irrigated <span class="SpellE">ricelands</span> that abut the <span class="SpellE">Aguirra</span>
Creek below the dam in controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is their position that <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Noynoyin</span></span><span style=""> Creek is </span>part
of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Taguan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place> and, therefore, as prior <span style="">appropriators of the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Taguan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>
waters by virtue of the 1918 administrative <span style="">concession, Exhibit </span>"B", plaintiffs cannot deprive them
from the use of the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1955" day="27" month="9">27 September 1955</st1:date>, defendant <span class="SpellE">Melecio</span> Hernandez dug a ditch <span style="">on his property connecting </span>the <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Aguirra</span> Creeks to draw water <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This ditch <span style="">was </span>closed in the first week of January, 1956 when the parties
reached a temporary agreement in the case, by the terms of which the plaintiffs
on one hand, and the defendant and the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> on
the other, were to use the waters from the <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span>
Creek on a fifty-fifty <span style="">basis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs contend that <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span> Creek
is a waterway separate and independent of the <span class="SpellE">Taguan</span>
River, having its own sources of <span style="">water,
so that while </span>they wholly agree that defendant and the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> are listed in Exhibit "B" as prior
appropriators of the <span class="SpellE">Taguan</span> River waters, any such
right should not encroach on the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Noynoyin</span></span><span style=""> </span>Creek
waters which <span style="">are not part of the <span class="SpellE">Taguan</span> River.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
alleged by plaintiffs that the <span class="SpellE">Cabay</span> irrigators
availed of the use of a flume (<span class="SpellE">alulod</span>) over
plaintiffs' dam at the <span class="SpellE">Aguirra</span> Creek to catch all the
volume of </span>water from the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Taguan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place> bed to make it fall into and
flow through the said creek to irrigate their own lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This practice originated allegedly from time
immemorial up to the last time that the <span class="SpellE">Cabay</span>
irrigators made use of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Taguan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place> waters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It is
plaintiffs' further </span>contention that the <span class="SpellE">Cabay</span>
irrigators availed <span style="">exclusively of </span>the
said river waters for irrigation purposes and that with the digging of the
ditch by defendant Hernandez (already closed pursuant to a temporary agreement
between the parties) the whole volume of natural water of the <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span> Creek was diverted to the <span class="SpellE">Aguirra</span>
Creek, thus depriving plaintiffs of their own exclusive right to use the <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span> Creek waters.</p>

<p class="BODY">Alleging that if defendant will not be immediately enjoined to
desist from diverting and using the <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span> Creek
waters they would be unable to plow and prepare their above <span class="SpellE">riceland</span>
for the <span style="">planting </span>season and
would suffer damages of no less than <span style="">P </span>8,000.00
for <span class="SpellE">palay</span> crop that would not be harvested for the
year, the plaintiffs del Valle asked for P1,000.00 attorney's fees and other
damages suffered; prayed for the immediate issuance of a writ of mandatory
preliminary injunction against the de­fendant to maintain the <u>status</u> <u>quo</u>
and restore to plaintiffs the exclusive use of the water of <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span>
Creek and a writ of perpetual injunction to issue against defendant after the
trial of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lastly, plaintiffs
prayed that they and their predecessor-in-interest be declared as having
acquired a prescriptive right for the exclusive use of <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span>
Creek waters below the dam of Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Maralit</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant Hernandez and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>
contend that, prior to the cons­truction of the del Valle dam across the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Aguirra</span></span><span style=""> </span>Creek, there was plenty of water
flowing into the creek from two sources, namely: the <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span>
Creek and the bed of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Taguan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the construction of the dam, there is no
more water (not just scarcity) flowing into the <span class="SpellE">Aguirra</span>
Creek.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, however admitted by
defendant that plaintiffs and their predecessor-in-interest used to irrigate
their <span class="SpellE">riceland</span> <span style="">with water flowing along </span>the <span class="SpellE">Aguirra</span>
Creek by diverting the said water from <span style="">time
to time </span>through an old canal which was connected with, and in
perpendicular position to, the <span class="SpellE">Aguirra</span> Creek, about
100 meters below the present concrete dam.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This practice was allegedly due to an arrangement between plaintiffs and
defendant, his predecessor-in-interest and other <span class="SpellE">Cabay</span>
irrigators which was considered satisfactory and equitable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, defendant contends that all the said
parties shared a common interest, not adverse to each other, in the use of
water flowing along the <span class="SpellE">Aguirra</span> Creek coming from <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span> Creek and <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Taguan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The use of a flume is denied by both the
defendant and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because of the concrete dam constructed by plaintiffs (<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>), defendant and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>
asked that plaintiffs pay to them jointly and severally a total of <span style="">P165,000.00 </span>in moral damages and
P66,000 in exemplary damages; excluding such further damages which de­fendant
and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> may prove at the trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court decided the case against <span style="">the defendant and </span><span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>,
declaring that defendant Hernandez <span style="">had
no right to dig </span>his canal connecting the <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span>
to <span style="">the <span class="SpellE">Aguirra</span>
and enjoined him </span>from making any construction on his land <span style="">the effect of which would reduce the water
accumulating at the "del Valle" dam across the </span><span class="SpellE">Aguirra</span> Creek.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiffs were allowed to remove the water gate which impedes the flow
of water from the controversial dam to plaintiffs' <span class="SpellE">ricefields</span>
and "to restore the del Valle dam to its condition at the beginning of the
suit".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court dismissed
plaintiffs' claim for damages as well as the counterclaim of defendant and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>, but sentenced defendant to pay to plaintiffs
attorney's fees in the sum of P500.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendant and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> appealed
from the decision, raising both questions of fact and law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The value in controversy exceed P200,000.00,
exclusive of interest and costs, appellants' total claim for damages caused by
the alleged public nuisance (the controversial dam) alone being P339,936.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since this appeal was perfected prior to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of R. A. No. 5440 on <st1:date year="1968" day="9" month="9">9 September 1968</st1:date>, this Court still retains
exclusive appellate jurisdiction over the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants claim that the lower court erred in holding that (a)
the <span class="SpellE">Taguan</span> River enters the region from the north
flowing generally to the south thus excluding the <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span>
Creek; (b) the <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span> Creek is an independent and
separate natural waterway from the <span class="SpellE">Taguan</span> River; (c)
the natural waterways <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span> Creek and <span class="SpellE">Taguan</span> Segundo end at the controversial dam; (d) the <span class="SpellE">Aguirra</span> Creek is an old irrigation canal that has been dug
running southwards; (e) there was preponderant evidence that plaintiffs
acquired a prescriptive right to use the <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span>
Creek waters; (f) the cement dam across the <span class="SpellE">Aguirra</span>
Creek may be restored and continued in use by plaintiffs; (g) the remedy of
defendant and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> is not against plaintiffs
but to institute proceedings under sections 4 and 2 of Irrigation Act No. 2125;
and (h) defendant is liable to pay to plaintiffs attorney's fees in the amount
of P500.00 plus costs of suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The most important issue in this appeal is whether plaintiffs
indeed have acquired a prescriptive right over all the volume of the <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span> Creek waters that pass through the <span class="SpellE">Maralit</span> dam, to the exclusion of all others, as was in
effect held by the lower court when it found that "in 1925 and for more
than 20 years prior to 1912, plaintiffs had built the Valle and <span class="SpellE">Cabay</span> dams for the irrigation of plaintiffs' <span class="SpellE">ricefields</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
the Valle dam, the lower court obviously meant the controversial dam across the
Aguirre Creek<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and by the <span class="SpellE">Cabay</span> dam, the lower court expressly
referred to the dam further east across the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cabay</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">The trial court's conclusion is based
"(<span class="SpellE">i</span>) on the complaint in 1925 involving <u>those
dams</u></span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></u></span></a><span style=""> filed against
plaintiffs by Maria </span><span style="">Ramos Sales
and Juan G. Ramos who then appeared <span style="">to
have land </span>abutting on the <span class="SpellE">Aguirra</span>; (ii) on the
official reports of Government Engineers Fernando E. V. <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>
<span style="">(Exhibit "J-1") </span>and J.
V. <span class="SpellE">Bagtas</span> (Exhibit "J"); (iii) on the
affidavit of <span class="SpellE">Manue</span> d<span style="">el</span> <span style="">Valle (Exhibit
"I"); </span>and (v) on the easement of buttress (see <span style="">Solis v. </span><span class="SpellE">Pujeda</span>,
42 Phil. 697) which had existed for so many years <span style="">on defendant's </span>land without objection from his
predecessors-in-interest".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It can readily be seen in the foregoing that the lower court concluded
that the del Valle dam across the <span class="SpellE">Aguirra</span> Creek was
also a dam in dispute in 1925 when Maria Ramos Sales and Juan G. Ramos filed a
complaint against Manuel del Valle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
close examination, however, of Exhibit "J-1", dated 14 September
1925, which is the report of engineer <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> regarding
said dispute investigated by him on 11 September 1925, shows that the stream
referred to therein, and from which diversion of water was to be made, was (and
still is) locally and officially called the <span class="SpellE">Cabay</span>
River. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Several sources of water of the
1925 irrigation system are mentioned <span style="">in
</span>the report, and they are (a) the <span class="SpellE">ricefields</span> at
<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">sitio</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>(b)

<span style="">(a) that </span>water flowing through
the river above Dam B (which is the <span class="SpellE">Cabay</span> dam), and
through the irrigation canal Z <span style="">(which
flows to the east from the <span class="SpellE">Cabay</span> dam, </span>curving
to the south to connect <span style="">with the <span class="SpellE">Cabay</span> River)</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>are all coming from <span class="SpellE">ricefields</span>, and (b) <u>that <span style="">Talon Spring, under Dam B, </span>constitutes mainly the source of the <span class="SpellE">Cabay</span> River proper.</u><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While in the <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> 1925 Report, <span style="">Exhibit "J-1", </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cabay</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>
is repeatedly mentioned, and its <span style="">main source
of water used by del </span>Valle is emphatically stated to be the Talon
Spring, <span style="">no mention is </span>made of
the <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span> Creek (which was <span style="">already known to be such during the </span>Spanish times) as a
source.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the del Valle <span style="">dam across the <span class="SpellE">Aguirra</span>
</span>Creek was already an accessory to <span style="">the whole del Valle irrigation </span>system in 1925 and it was already
used to divert <span style="">waters of <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span> </span>Creek to irrigate plaintiffs' <span class="SpellE">riceland<span style="">s</span></span><span style=""> in <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span> (</span>as
subsequently reported by irrigation engineer <span style="">Escobar in 1955, Exhibit "A"), </span>engineer <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Sison</span></span><span style=""> could have readily mentioned <span style="">it in his </span>report, or at least
indicated the same in "Plan B", <span style="">attached thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In one con­cluding
</span>paragraph of his 1925 report, engineer <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>
said that "during the dry season, if the water available is not enough to
both the complainants and the respondent, privilege should be granted to Mr.
del Valle, the respondent, since he acquired the right of priority of
appropriations, having used the water uninterruptedly for more than 50
years".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the report was
confined only to the <span class="SpellE">Cabay</span> River, the <span class="SpellE">Cabay</span> dam and the sources </span>of water already
specified, of which <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span> Creek was never stated
to be one, it is erroneous for the trial court to conclude that the del Valle
dam in the present controversy was likewise existing, just like the <span class="SpellE">Cabay</span> <span class="SpellE">dam,”in</span> 1925 and for more
than 20 years prior to 1912".</p>

<p class="BODY">The main basis for engineer <span class="SpellE">Sison's</span>
conclusion that Mr. del Valle had been using the water uninterruptedly for more
than 50 years, and, consequently, also that of engineer <span class="SpellE">Bagtas</span>
when he approved engineer <span class="SpellE">Sison's</span> report (Exhibit
"J", "J-1"), was the attached statement of Mr. del Valle,
dated 9 September 1925.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">An analysis </span>of <span style="">this </span>statement will show that it
speaks of "a dam in question which is an old existing dam more than fifty
(50) years old".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. del Valle
stated as having repaired it and "extended both ends so as to close the <span class="SpellE"><u>Cabay</u></span><u> River</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
There is only <u>one</u> dam mentioned in the statement and the same clearly
referred to the <span class="SpellE">Cabay</span> dam, east of the <span class="SpellE">Taguan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, there
is no mention of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Noynoyin</span></span><span style=""> </span>Creek in Exhibit "L",
hence, there is no basis at all to conclude <span style="">that the <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span> </span>Creek waters were also
being referred to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, plaintiffs
have not acquired a prescriptive right over the said waters on the basis of
said Exhibit "L".</p>

<p class="BODY">The report of engineer Escobar (Exhibit "X") dated <st1:date year="1955" day="18" month="4">18 April 1955</st1:date> <span style="">was </span>presented by plaintiffs to <span style="">prove that an earthen dam across the </span><span class="SpellE">Aguirra</span>
Creek was already an accessory to the del Valle irrigation system in 1925.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The existence of such a dam was<span style=""> merely conjectured, </span>and the same
author of that report, engineer <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Dionisio</span></span><span style=""> </span>N.<span style=""> </span>Escobar (who was plaintiffs' own
witness in court) testified on <span style="">cross-examination

(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pages 493-494; 26 March1958).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same <span style="">witness categorically denied that the source of the <span style="">del Valle irrigation </span></span>system in
1925 was the <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span> Creek or the <span class="SpellE">Taguan</span> River, because he said that "according to the

thus reversed previous statements made by him on these material points in his

"Plan B" still appears.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
1925 report, engineer <span class="SpellE">Sison</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
had stated that "the water flowing thru X (see <span style="">attached plan B) comes </span>from the <span class="SpellE">ricefields</span>
at <span class="SpellE"><u>sitio</u></span> <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span>;
and the <span style="">water flowing </span>thru Y is
that of course from X in addition to that flowing from Talon Spring . . .
." This canal "X" is clearly different from the
"man-made-canal" shown on Exhibit "K" (marked "Exhibit
2" therein) connecting the <span class="SpellE">Aguirra</span> Creek and <span class="SpellE">Cabay</span> dams.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both, as
already stated, appear <span style="">on </span>Exhibit

Creek eastward towards the <span class="SpellE">Cabay</span> dam from the del
Valle dam across the mouth of the <span class="SpellE">Aguirra</span> Creek, its
existence in 1925 is by no means established; for the plan attached to the 1925
<span class="SpellE">Sison</span> report (Exhibit “4) does not </span><span style="">show it, </span><span style="">That connecting canal can not be the canal </span>"X" <span style="">in Exhibit "4", since the </span><span style="">arrows </span><span style="">indi­cate that the flow of water in the latter comes from the south and
not from the west.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, engineer Escobar testified that he could not definitely
say whether this "man-made-canal" (Exhibit "2", <u>supra</u>)
connecting the <span class="SpellE">Aguirra</span> Creek dam and the <span class="SpellE">Cabay</span> dam existed when "Plan B" was prepared in
1925.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that if that existed at
the time, it would have been placed on the said plan.</p>

<p class="BODY">Escobar's testimony is further strengthened by the report of
engineer Vicente <span class="SpellE">Alcañeses</span> dated <st1:date year="1955" day="11" month="4">11 April 1955</st1:date><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>

found it clear, as a result of his ocular inspection, that the dam <span style="">in controversy </span>in the present del
Valle-Hernandez case could not have been the dam under litigation in the
Ramos-Sales vs. del Valle case of 1925, inasmuch as the dam in controversy in
the present appeal was found <span style="">by him to </span>have
been cons­tructed only in 1940, with improvements and repairs done in April,
1952.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is indeed remarkable that among the concessionaires of
appropriators of water from the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Taguan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place> listed in the Govern­ment
concession of 1918 (Exhibit "B"), the name of del Valle does not
appear, while those of appellants are specified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The attempted explanation of <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, and their witnesses, that appellants drew water
exclusively from the <span class="SpellE">Taguan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Taguan</span>
Segundo (or <span class="SpellE">Puntor</span>) by means of a wooden flume (<span class="SpellE">alulod</span>) over the <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span> can not
be true, for the Government concession, Exhibit "B", makes no mention
thereof, despite its manifest importance for excluding the waters of the <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span> Creek from those of the <span class="SpellE">Taguan</span>
River granted to appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither is
any such structure mentioned in the <span class="SpellE">Sison-Bagtas</span>
report of 1925, or in the <span class="SpellE">Alcañeses</span> report of
1955.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an unusual device could not
have escaped the attention of the engineers that inspected the site in 1918,
1925 and 1955.</p>

<p class="BODY">Clearer still against the del <span class="SpellE">Valles</span>'
claim of exclusive use of the waters of the <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span>
Creek is the <span class="SpellE">undenied</span> fact that Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Maralit</span>, one of the water concessionaires of the Government
in 1918 (No. 2 in Exhibit "B") had his own diversion dam in the <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span> Creek above the mouth of the <span class="SpellE">Aguirra</span>
(shown in the Plan, Exhibit "10", with the label "<span class="SpellE">Sala</span> <span class="SpellE">Maralit</span>").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And there is no evidence that the <st1:state><st1:place>del</st1:place></st1:state>
<span class="SpellE">Valles</span> ever protested against the construction of
this dam.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, the abusiveness of the erection (and subsequent
elevation) of the del Valle dam across the mouth of the <span class="SpellE">Aguirra</span>,
to the detriment of appellants who derive from the latter the water for their
own <span class="SpellE">ricefields</span>, is the remark of plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' own witness<span style="">,
</span>engineer Escobar, in his report, Exhibit "A", paragraph 4:</p>

<blockquote>"But with the construction of the <span class="SpellE">Aguirra</span> dam, Mr. Del Valle is not only appropriating water
from the <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span> River <u><span style="">but also from the <span class="SpellE">Taguan</span> River</span></u><span style="">, </span>allowing only water which overflows
for the use of the irrigation (irrigators) below the dam in controversy."
(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The other basis for the lower court's conclusion that plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> acquired a prescriptive right over the <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span> Creek is the easement of buttress (Solis vs. <span class="SpellE">Pujeda</span>, 42 Phil. 697) which allegedly existed on the land
of defendant-appellant Hernandez for many years without objection on his
part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The easement of buttress is
specifically provided for under Article 143 of the Law of Waters, which states
that -</p>

<blockquote>"If the dam is for the use of public waters the Government shall
make an investigation of record, and upon granting <span style="">the concess</span>ion,<span style=""> </span>shall
after hearing the owner of the land, decree also the compulsory easement of
buttress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the waters <span style="">are of private ownership, the easement shall
be imposed by the governor of the province subject to the procedure established
for the easement of conduit."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the above-cited case of Solis vs. <span class="SpellE">Pujeda</span>,
it was held that, by Article 14<span style="">3</span>
of the Law of Waters, an easement of buttress can be imposed by administrative
authority with respect to land lying adjacent to public or private waters; but
in such case <u>it is</u><u><span style=""> </span>required
that an investigation of record shall be made before the easement of buttress
is decreed.</u><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court further said that -</p>

<blockquote>"F<span style="">or </span>the
purpose of this decision it <span style="">may be
taken for granted that the Bureau of Lands is the proper repository of the
administrative authority conferred in said article with respect to the
decreeing of the easement in case of public waters, and the Director of Lands
may be assumed to be the proper official to conduct the investigation and make
the appropriate order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Nevertheless,
the making of the investigation of record is an essential prerequisite to the
exercise of the power</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This implies
that the interested parties shall have an opportunity to be heard and that
record be made of the proof adduced with reference to the proposed servi­tude
and the damage to result <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>These for­malities are essential;
otherwise, the decreeing of the servitude would be </u></span><u><span style="">obnoxious to </span></u><u><span style="">the constitutional provision which forbids
the taking of property without due process of law</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
administrative in­vestigation contemplated in article 143 of the Law of Waters
must proceed along the lines of a judicial inquiry, at least to the extent of
giving the parties an opportunity to be heard and making record of the proof
pertinent to their respective contentions." (Underscoring supplied)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This Court finds no clear, preponderant evidence that plaintiffs
have been using the waters of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Noynoyin</span></span><span style=""> Creek </span>uninterruptedly
for twenty years or more, much less to the exclusion of all others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, they cannot be declared <span style="">to have acquired a </span>prescriptive right

the 1918 Government grant of water rights <span style="">in </span>favor of appellants herein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs' theory that the Aguirre Creek dam was an accessory to
the whole del Valle irrigation system <span style="">in
</span>1925 must be rejected as without basis.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The only clear proof is that <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> del
Valle started to appropriate <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span> Creak waters
exclusively for themselves only in 1940 when a concrete dam was constructed at
the mouth of the Aguirre Creek.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since
only about 15 years have elapsed from the time the waters were first
appropriated by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in 1940 up to the
filing of the complaint in October, 1955, it is this Court's opinion that the
parties shared jointly in the use of <span class="SpellE">Noynoyin</span> Creek
waters before 1940 and, therefore, the use by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
del Valle was not ex­clusive nor adverse to others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the facts, defendant Hernandez must be
absolved from the liability to pay attorney's fees to plaintiffs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' claim for damage to their crops must be denied for
the reason that they are already sharing in the use of the waters pursuant to
an arrangement agreed upon during the trial of the case in January, 1956, and
their evidence of crop losses during the previous years is far from satisfactory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not only the shares of the tenants that
must be deducted from the value of the crops allegedly lost, but also the land
taxes and production costs shouldered by them, and there is no proof of their
import.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the law places on the shoulders
of the party suffering loss or injury the duty of exercising the diligence of a
good father of a family to minimize his damages (Civil Code of the Philippines,
Article 2203, <span class="SpellE">Castelvi</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>
General de <span class="SpellE">Tabacos</span>, 49 Phil. 998); and it is clear
from the record that <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> herein <span style="">only </span>sought remedy in December,
1954.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, considering that
plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> del Valle, not content with
reducing the water available for the appellants' fields by the cons­truction of
the dam in controversy, deliberately blocked totally their water supply by
increasing the elevation <span style="">of </span>the
dam in 1952, without appellants' consent and without government authorization,
this Court finds that said appellants are entitled to recover moral damages
pursuant to the first part of Article 2220 of the Civil Code of the
Philippines, <span style="">providing </span>that -</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"ART. </span>2220.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Willful injury to property may be legal
ground for awarding moral damages if the court should find that under the
circumstances such damages are justly due."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">These damages are assessed at P2,000.00 for each of the
appellants, defendant as well as <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, justice and equity demand that plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> be further sentenced to pay appellants P5,000.00
by <span style="">way </span>of attorneys’ fees,
since appellants, who are small landholders, were forced to enter into a <span style="">litigation </span>that they could ill afford
