<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
facts, as shown </span><span style="">in the record, are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">During his lifetime, <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> Jose
married three times. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>In his first
marriage with <span style="">Sabina <span class="SpellE">Vidad</span> he had a son with her, </span>the herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Esteban Jose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sabina died <span style="">in </span>1927.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His second marriage was with <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Emilia</span></span><span style=""> </span>de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
Reyes, by whom he had no child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During
their marriage <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cipriano</span></span><span style=""> Jose </span>and <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span>
de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes acquired a parcel of land with an area
of 150 square meters, situated in <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span>, Manila,
and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 41711 <span style="">issued by the office of </span>the Register of Deeds of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes died in 1937, leav­ing no ascendant, descendant
or collateral relatives, and so <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> Jose became
the sole owner of the said parcel of land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His third marriage, which was contracted on <st1:date year="1941" day="23" month="7">July 23, <span style="">1941</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>was with Carmen Blue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During their mar<span style="">riage, <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> Jose and Carmen Blue acquired
a piece of </span>land also situated in <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Sampaloc</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, with
an area of 150 square meters, and covered by Transfer Certificate <span style="">of </span>Title No. 63565.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="6" month="9">September
 <span style="">6 </span>1962</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> Jose died in the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
leaving as his estate the <span style="">two lots
herein mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surviving him were his
widow, Carmen Blue, and his son by the first marriage, Esteban </span>Jose.</p>

<p class="BODY">The widow, Carmen Blue, representing <span style="">that the owner's </span>duplicates of TCT Nos. 41711 and 63565 were
lost, applied for, and was issued, second duplicates of TCT Nos. 41711 and
63565, covering the two lots above-mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Armed with these duplicate certificates of title, and repre­senting that
<span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> Jose had left no ascendant, descen­dant, nor
collateral relatives, and that she was his only <span style="">legal </span>heir, Carmen Blue was able to have the two lots ad<span style="">judicated to </span>her <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span>,
and so new TCT Nos. 70427 <span style="">and 70428
were issued in her name, subject to the legal encumbrance provided for in
Section </span>4 <span style="">of Rule </span>74 <span style="">of the Rules of Court with respect to the
right of any heir or <span class="SpellE">distributee</span> who might have been
unduly deprived of his lawful participation </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the estate to question the </span><span style="">award within two years from the date of such
adjudication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That legal encumbrance was
</span><span style="">annotated at the back of those
two </span><span style="">new
</span><span style="">certificates of title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having the certificates of </span><span style="">title in her </span><span style="">name, Carmen Blue sold the lot covered by TCT
</span><span style="">No.
70427 to <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis on July 27, </span><span style="">1963, for the </span><span style="">sum of P3,000.00, and so TCT No. 70427 was
cancelled </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">TCT No. </span>71944
<span style="">was issued in the name of <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>On </span><st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="1"><span style="">January
 28 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, Carmen Blue
also sold the other lot, covered by TCT No. 70428, to the spouses Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Pardo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> de <span class="SpellE">Dios-Pardo</span> for the sum of </span><span style="">P</span><span style="">14<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>,
and so TCT No. </span><span style="">70428 was cancelled and TCT No. </span><span style="">73924 </span><span style="">was issued in the names of said spouses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Unaware of what Carmen Blue had done, Esteban Jose instituted
intestate proceedings of the estate of his father in the Court of First
Instance of Manila (Special Proceeding No. 51940), and in said proceeding he
was dec­lared the sole heir of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> Jose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Esteban Jose <span style="">was about to cause the titles of the two lots to <span style="">be trans­ferred </span>to his name, he
discovered that the two lots had <span style="">been </span>adjudicated
to Carmen Blue and that she had sold those lots -- one to <span class="SpellE">Julita</span>
Luis, and the other to the spouses <span class="SpellE">Pardo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, on March 25, 1964, Esteban Jose filed a
complaint against Carmen Blue, <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis and the
spouses <span class="SpellE">Pardo</span> in the Court of First Instance of
Manila</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">, which complaint was later amended, praying,
among others, that the adjudication of the two lots to Carmen Blue, and the
sales made by her of the two lots to her co-de­fendants, be declared null and
void, and that the titles, that were obtained by Carmen Blue in her name and
sub­sequently by her co-defendants as the result of the sales, be cancelled. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Esteban Jose, as plaintiff, caused a notice of
<span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">pendens</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">to
be annotated on TCT Nos. 71944 and 73924, the first in the name of <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis, and the second in the names of the spouses <span class="SpellE">Pardo</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1964</st1:date>,
defendants Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Pardo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Dios-Pardo</span> filed their answer containing affirma­tive
defenses, a counterclaim against the plaintiff, and a cross-claim against their
co-defendant Carmen Blue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis failed to file her answer, and so she was dec­lared
in default.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1966" day="22" month="11"><span style="">November
 22, </span>1966</st1:date>, plaintiff Esteban Jose and defendants Carmen Blue
and the <span class="SpellE">Pardo</span> Spouses, assisted by their respective
counsel, submitted a compromise agreement which provided as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That it is agreed that the land covered by
Transfer Certificate of Title No. 63565 of the Registry of Deeds of the City of
Manila belonged to the conjugal partnership between <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
Jose, who died in 1962, and the defendant Carmen Blue, while the land covered
by TCT No. 41711 belonged to the conjugal partnership bet­ween <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> Jose and <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes; that on the death of <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span>
de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes in 1937 without issue, the land covered
by TCT 41711 became the exclusive property of <span class="SpellE">Cip­riano</span>
Jose; and that on the death of <span class="SpellE">Cipria­no</span> Jose, Carmen
Blue became entitled to 1/2 of the land covered by TCT No. 63565 as her share
of the assets of the conjugal partnership between her and <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
Jose and to her share as surviving spouse.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That the estate of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> Jose con­sists of the land covered by TCT No.
41711, 1/2 of the land covered by TCT No. 63565, and cash amounting to P5<span class="GramE">,076.60</span> which the plaintiff withdrew from the bank in which
it was deposited.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That Carmen Blue will receive 1/2 of the land
covered by TCT 41711 3/4 of the land covered by TCT No. 63565 and 1/2 of the
sum of P5<span class="GramE">,076.60</span>, while the plaintiff will receive 1/2
of the land covered by TCT No. 41711, 1/4 of the land covered by TCT No. 63565,
and 1/2 of the amount of P5,076.60.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That Carmen Blue will refund to Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Pardo</span> the sum of P3<span class="GramE">,065.00</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pardo</span> will furthermore receive 3/4 of the land covered by
TCT No. 63565 while Esteban Jose will receive 1/4 thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That Esteban Jose hereby sells, transfers and
conveys his 1/4 share of the land covered by TCT No. 63565 to Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Pardo</span> for the sum of P9,375.00 payable after Esteban Jose
and all per­sons claiming under him vacate the pre­mises and that they agree to
leave them within 15 days from the date of this compromise.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That Carmen Blue will not de­mand from Esteban
Jose the payment of 1/2 of the amount of P5<span class="GramE">,076.60</span>, or
P2,538.30, and Esteban Jose accepts that sum in full settlement of whatever
liability Carmen Blue may have incurred for selling the land covered by TCT No.
41711 to <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis, without prejudice to the right
of the plaintiff to pro­secute this case to judgment as against her and to
obtain from her whatever re­lief may be proper.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And that the parties mutually renounce all
other claims to damages and attorney's fees they have against one
another."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1966</st1:date>,
the trial court, on the basis of the above-mentioned compromise agreement,
rendered a decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which
reads as fol<span style="">lows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the foregoing compro­mise agreement <span style="">is </span>approved and judg­ment <span style="">is </span>rendered in accordance there­with,
without any pronouncement as to <span style="">costs."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1967" day="3" month="2"><span style="">February
 3, 1967</span></st1:date><span style="">, the lower
court rendered </span>a de­cision against defendant <span class="SpellE">Julita</span>
Luis who <span style="">was previously declared in
default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Pertinent portions of
the decision read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Although Carmen Blue is entitled to only 1/2 of the land
embraced in Transfer Certificate of Title No. 41711, she, however, transferred
the whole of it to the defendant <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis in whose
name the land is now registered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Trans­fer
Certificate of Title No. 71944 (Ex­hibit "E"), issued to her on July
29, 1963, bears, however, the annotation that <span style="">it </span>is subject to the claims of creditors, heirs and other
persons unlawfully deprived of their participation in the estate of <span class="SpellE">Cip­riano</span> Jose for a period of two years, pursuant to
Section 4, Rule <span style="">74, of the Rules of </span>Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The transfer to <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis having
been made without the plaintiff's know­ledge and consent, it and the title
issued to her are null and void, with respect to his share of the property
conveyed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered declaring that the
transfer of 1/2 of the land covered by Transfer Certifi­cate of Title No. 41711
to <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis is null and void and ordering the
Transfer Certificate of Title No. 71944 be cancelled and another issued in lieu
thereof in the names of <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis and Esteban Jose
as co-owners in equal shares and commanding further that <span class="SpellE">Julita</span>
Luis pay the plaintiff P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as attorney's fees
together with the costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The decision against </span>defendant
<span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis, however, could not be implemented
because, plaintiff Esteban Jose discovered that <span class="SpellE">Julita</span>
Luis had sold the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> property to Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Agraviador</span> who had secured the <span style="">is</span>suance in his name of TCT No. 75408, and that <span class="SpellE">Agraviador</span> had mortgaged the lot to Catalina <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span>, which mort­gage was foreclosed and TCT No. 85491
was issued in the name of Catalina <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span> who was
the highest bidder in the public auction sale.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So, plaintiff Esteban Jose filed an omnibus motion, on June 7, 1967,
which was later amended, praying that TCT No. 84591 in the name of Cata­lina <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span> be cancelled and another be issued in the names of
<span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis and plaintiff, share and share alike, and
that a writ of execution be issued against the un­divided portion of the lot
corresponding to <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis to satisfy the judgment
in favor of the plaintiff for attorney's fees and the costs of the suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Notified of this omnibus motion, Catalina <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span>,
through counsel, filed her opposition under date of <st1:date year="1967" day="21" month="7">July 21, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Catalina <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span> averred that to grant what <span style="">is </span>prayed
for in the omnibus motion would be to deprive her of her property without due
process of law, because she was never <span style="">a party </span>to the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, she alleged that since plaintiff
Esteban Jose had already entered into a compromise agreement with Carmen Blue <span style="">waiving whatever
liability Carmen Blue may have incurred for sell­ing the land originally
embraced under TCT No. 41711 (now </span>TCT No. 85491), such renunciation
redounded to the benefit of <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis and in effect
recognized the transfer of the lot to her as well as to the subsequent
purchasers including Catalina <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Resolving the opposition, the lower <span style="">court issued its
order of </span><st1:date year="1967" day="28" month="7">July 28, 1967</st1:date>,
<span style="">in the </span>fol­<span style="">lowing tenor:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"As a judgment of the kind rendered <span style="">in </span>this case is conclusive not only be­tween
the parties but <span style="">also </span>their <span style="">succes­sors in interest </span>by title subsequent to the commencement of
the action (Rule 39, Sec. 49 [b], Rules of Court) and a <span style="">notice of ‘<span class="SpellE">lis</span> <span class="SpellE">pendens</span>’ charges a stranger with notice of the litigation
referred to there­in so that a third person who acquires the property affected
by the '<span class="SpellE">lis</span> <span class="SpellE">pendens</span>' takes
it subject to the eventuality of the litigation (Atkins, Kroll, &amp; Co. v.
Domingo, 46 Phil., 362), and it not being true that Esteban Jose has recognized
the </span>validity of the sale or transfer of the land to <span class="SpellE">Julita</span>
Luis because the very com­promise entered into by the parties, which was
prepared in thy presence, expressly reserves to him the right to prosecute this
case to judgment as against <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis and obtain
from her whatever relief may be proper that is, the annulment of the sale in
her favor, including whatever subsequent transfer she may have executed, if
permissible under the law as prayed for, the Register of Deeds of Manila is <span style="">ordered to cancel Transfer Certificate of
Title No. 85491 in the name of Cata­lina <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span> and
issue another, in lieu thereof, in the names of Esteban Jose and <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis, share and share alike, and it is further
ordered that a writ of execution issue against the share of <span class="SpellE">Julita</span>
Luis for the satisfaction of the sum of P1,000.00, together with the costs, </span><span style="">awarded in Esteban Jose's favor."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Her motion for reconsideration of the
foregoing order having been denied, <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>
Catalina <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span> appealed directly to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Catalina <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span> assigns
four errors, al­legedly committed by the trial court, which boil down to the
question of whether or not the lower <span style="">court

present case, on March 24, </span>1964, to <span style="">assert his claim </span>over the lot, formerly, covered by TCT <span style="">No. </span>70427 and later covered by TCT No.
71944, <span style="">he had exercised his </span>right
within two years from the date of the extra-judicial adjudication pursuant to
Section 4 of Rule 74 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is clear that when <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis bought the
lot in ques­tion from Carmen Blue she had knowledge of the encumbrance under
Section <span style="">4 of Rule 74 </span>of the
Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed the complaint in the present case, he caused
the notice of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">lis</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">pendens</span></u></span> to be inscribed in
the certificate of title that was already in the name of de­fendant <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Likewise, when Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Agraviador</span> bought the <span style="">land from <span class="SpellE">Julita</span>
Luis he had knowledge of the two encumbrances which were annotated on the
certificate </span>of title of <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same encumbrances were anno­tated on the
certificate of title that was issued in the name of Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Agraviador</span>, so that appellant Catalina <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span>
also had knowledge of the same encumbrance when <span style="">she bought the lot covered by the certificate of title in the name of
Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Agraviador</span> in a public auction sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, the same encumbrances
were annotated on the certificate of title that was issued to </span><span style="">appellant </span><span style="">Catalina <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear, therefore, that appellant Catalina <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cayetano</span></span><span style=""> </span>is a successor in interest by title
subsequent to the commencement of the action filed by herein <span class="SpellE">ap­pellee</span>, so that her acquisition of the lot in question
was subject, and must yield, <span style="">to the </span>superior right of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
who was an heir of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cipriano</span></span><span style=""> Jose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>The <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed an action based on a
right reserved for him under Section 4 of Rule 74 of the Rules of Court, and
when he filed this action he caused a notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">pendens</span></u></span><span style="">,</span> to be annotated on TCT No. 71944 in
the name of <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis, which was the certificate of
title <span style="">covering </span>the lot in
question at the time when the <span style="">action was </span>filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The notice of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">lis</span></u></span><u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">pendens</span></span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">is intended to protect the real rights of the party
causing the regis­tration </span>thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With the notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span> duly recorded, a party can rest assured that
his claim or right over the <span style="">property in
</span>litigation <span style="">is </span>safe-guarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The notice
of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">lis</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>p</u><u><span style="">endens</span></u></span></span> is an
announcement to the whole <span style="">world </span>that
a particular real property <span style="">is </span>in litigation, and serves as a warning that one who acquires an
interest over said property does so at his own risk, or that he gam­bles on the
result of the litigation over said property.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Since appellant herein bought the
land in question <span style="">with </span>knowledge
of the existing encumbrance thereon, <span style="">she cannot invoke the </span>right of a purchaser in
good faith, and she could not have acquired better rights than those of her
predecessors in interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">The predecessors in interest of herein appellant were Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Agraviador</span>, <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis, and
Carmen Blue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inas­much as it was
declared by the lower court in its decision that Carmen <span style="">Blue </span>was only entitled to the undivided one-half share of the
lot in question, because the other half is the undivided share of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Esteban Jose, and that the sale by Carmen Blue of
the whole lot to <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis with­out the consent of <span style="">the </span><span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
was null and void, and the <span style="">certificate
of </span>title that was issued in the name of <span class="SpellE">Julita</span>
Luis was also null and void, that declaration of the court had affected the
interest not only of <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis, who was <span style="">a defendant in </span><span style="">the case, </span><span style="">but also the
interests of all other persons who succeeded <span class="SpellE">Julita</span>
Luis by title subsequent to </span><span style="">the
commencement of </span><span style="">the action
against <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="">Thus, the decision
against </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Julita</span></span><span style=""> Luis affects herein appellant Catalina <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span> even if she was not original­ly a party in the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being a transferee <span class="SpellE">p<u><span style="">endente</span></u></span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">lite</span></u></span><span style=""> of the property in litigation, the appellant stands </span><span style="">in the shoes of her predecessors in </span><span style="">interest, namely, the defendants Carmen Blue
and <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis, and Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Agraviador</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant may be a proper party in the
case, but she is not an indispensable party, and she is bound by the judgment
against </span><span style="">her </span><span style="">predecessors in in­terest.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
claim </span>of the appellant that she is being deprived of her property
without due process of law is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The purpose of <span class="SpellE">impleading</span> a party in a case,
so that he may be bound by a court proceeding, <span style="">is </span>merely to assure the party of a day in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at <span style="">bar the protective mantle of due process had
been accorded the ap­pellant because she was </span>furnished with a copy of
the <span style="">omnibus motion of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> in the court below, she </span><span style="">filed her
opposition to said omnibus motion, and she filed her motion for reconsideration
of </span><span style="">the order of the trial judge
granting what was prayed for </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the
omnibus motion, and so the appellant had her day in court, and she may be held

<p class="BODY">The appellant also contends that the lower court should not have entertained
any more the suit of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> against <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis because in the compromise agreement entered
into between the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> and Carmen Blue it was
agreed that Carmen Blue would not demand from the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
the payment of one-half of the amount of P5,076.60, or P2,538.30, and that the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> would accept that amount in full settlement of
whatever lia­bility Carmen Blue might have incurred for selling the land
covered by TCT No. 41711 to <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This con­tention is also untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let it be noted that in the <span style="">compromise agreement </span>the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> did not recognize the validity of the sale by
Carmen Blue to <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis of the lot covered by TCT
No. 41711.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had reserved his right to prosecute his case
against <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis and to obtain from her whatever
relief might be proper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had accepted the sum of P2<span class="GramE">,538.30</span>
in full settlement of whatever <span style="">lia­</span>bility Carmen Blue had incurred for
selling the land to <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis, it was simply in
consideration of his waiver of whatever claim he might have against Carmen
Blue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly Carmen Blue had
prejudiced the rights of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> when she
represented herself as the sole heir of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> Jose
-- knowing that the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was a sur­viving son of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> Jose -- and adjudicated to herself alone the two
lots belonging to the estate left by <span class="SpellE">Cip­riano</span>
Jose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Carmen Blue <span style="">compounded the
prejudice to the rights </span>of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> when she
sold the two lots to third parties, thereby necessitating the filing of an
action by the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> against Carmen Blue and the
purchasers of the two lots in order to protect his rights as an heir of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> Jose.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court declared that Carmen Blue was entitled to only
one-half of the lot which she sold to <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis,
because the other half was the share of herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Carmen Blue sold the whole lot to <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis without the knowledge and consent of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, the most that <span class="SpellE">Julita</span>
Luis had acquired in virtue of that sale was the undivided <span style="">one-half portion
which was the share of Carmen Blue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
lower court, therefore, had </span>correctly held that the sale of the whole
lot to <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis was null and void, and TCT No.
41711 that was issued in the name of <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis as a
result of the sale was also null and void.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the <span style="">lower </span>court, however, ordered the cancellation of TCT <span style="">No. 85491 </span>in
the name of appellant Catalina <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span> and the
issuance of another title in the names of Esteban Jose and <span class="SpellE">Julita</span>
Luis, share and share alike, it had thereby recognized that <span class="SpellE">Julita</span>
Luis had acquired a right over the undivided one-half share in the lot in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We sustain the ruling of the
lower court in this connection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so
when <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis sold the whole lot in question to
Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Agraviador</span>, the most that she could have
conveyed to the latter was the undivided one-half share in said lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It follows that the most that Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Agraviador</span> could have mortgaged was the one-half undivided
share in the lot, and all that appellant Catalina <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span>
had acquired in the public auction sale when the mortgage constituted by
Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Agraviador</span> on the whole lot was foreclosed
was only one-half undivided share in said lot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is Our considered view, therefore, that it would be in the interest
of justice and equity that the right <span style="">of
appellant Catalina <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span> over one-half of the lot
in question </span>should be recognized, and that a new certificate of title <span style="">should be issued in
the names of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Esteban Jose </span>and
appellant Catalina <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span>, share <span style="">and share
alike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It would not be fair that <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis be still considered <span style="">the owner </span>of one-half of this lot after she had sold whatever
interest she had in the lot to Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Agravia­dor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it would not be fair also that appellant
be left without any right and interest on the lot after she had paid for it <span style="">at the public </span>auction
sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This ruling is without prejudice <span style="">to <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> </span>pursuing the <span style="">execution of the judgment in his favor </span>for
attorney's fees and costs of this suit <span style="">in </span>the lower instance against <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Luis, <span style="">by levying on whatever property <span class="SpellE">Julita</span>
Luis has.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
