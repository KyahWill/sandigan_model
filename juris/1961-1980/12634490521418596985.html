				<BR><STRONG>ZALDIVAR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for <i style="">certiorari</i>
to review the decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations, Second Regional
District, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, in four cases involving
tenancy relationship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties in
these cases being the same and the issues involved therein being interrelated,
by agreement of the parties, these cases were consolidated and were decided in
a single decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, Luis Molina and <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Maderia</span>, hereinafter
referred to as <u>tenants</u>, are the te­nants of petitioner-appellant,
Alfredo Diaz, hereinafter referred to as <u>landholder</u>, on separate parcels
of <span class="SpellE">ricelands</span> situated in the Barrio of <span class="SpellE">Bucot</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aliaga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, with an area of two
and one-half hectares each, more or less.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent Judge Jose M. Santos of the Court of Agrarian Relations is
herein referred to as CAR.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that prior to the agricultural year 1961-1962,
the landholder contributed to the production of the lands by defraying the
expenses for transplanting, while the tenants contributed their labor, work
animals, farm implements and expenses for final harrowing; and they divided the
net produce under the sharing ratio of fifty-fifty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The tenancy contract between the parties was
not in writing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime before <st1:date year="1961" day="20" month="3">March
 20, 1961</st1:date>, the tenants notified the landholder of their desire to
change their tenancy relationship from one of crop sharing to that of
leasehold, effective the agricultural year 1961-1962 which admittedly started
in the last week of May, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
consonance with their desire to change their tenancy system beginning with the
agricultural year 1961-1962, the tenants undertook to contribute all the items
of expenses for production, with the landholder contributing only the
lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The landholder refused to accede
to the desire of the tenants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So in that
month of March, 1961, the tenants each filed a petition before the Court of
Agrarian Relations praying approval of the change of their tenancy relationship
from that of crop sharing system to that of leasehold system and to fix the
annual lease rental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These two petitions
were docketed as CAR Cases Nos. 2453-NE-61 and 2456-NE-61.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1961</st1:date>,
the landholder, being insistent in the continuation of the share tenancy
contract, depo­sited in court the sum of P100.00 representing the ex­penses for
transplanting for the agricultural year 1961-­1962, at P50.00 for each of the
two tenants, and prayed the court to order the tenants to withdraw that amount
as expenses for transplanting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The landholder
also offered to deposit the sum of P43.00 for the cost of the seedlings -
P28.00 for tenant Luis Molina, and P15.00 for tenant <span class="SpellE">Nar­ciso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maderia</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
petition was docketed as CAR Case No. 2764-NE-61.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 27, 1961, the landholder filed with the same court a
petition for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> against tenant Luis Molina,
alleging that on November 20, 1961 said tenant pre-threshed a portion of the <span class="SpellE">palay</span> planted on the land tenanted by him in violation of
Section 39 of Republic Act <span style="">1199, and
that said tenant had been grossly negligent in the performance of his duties
and had failed to fol­low proven farm practices thereby rendering unproduc</span>tive
the land tenanted by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This petition
was docketed as CAR Case No. 2834-NE-61.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent, or respondents, as the case may be, in each of
the four cases mentioned in the foregoing para­graphs, filed his/their
respective answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing the four cases jointly the CAR, on March 18, 1963,
rendered a decision (1) declaring the tenancy relationship between the landholder
and the tenants to be under the leasehold tenancy system effective as of the
agricultural year 1961-1962; (2) fixing the rentals for the landholdings, such
that for the agricultural years 1961-1963 tenant Molina should pay 18 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span> and 42 kilos of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> for
every agricultural year, and tenant <span class="SpellE">Maderia</span> should
pay 19 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span> and 36 kilos; and beginning with the
agricultural year 1963-1964 tenant Molina should pay 26 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span>
and 22 kilos annually while tenant <span class="SpellE">Maderia</span> should pay
37 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span> and 21 kilos; (3) ordering the landholder
to refund to tenant Molina 20 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span> and 39¼ kilos of
<span class="SpellE">palay</span> or the value thereof in the sum of P240.37, and
also to refund tenant <span class="SpellE">Maderia</span> 39 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span>
and 37¼ kilos of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">palay</span></span><span style=""> or the value thereof in the sum of P457.81;
(4) ordering the Provincial Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> to re­lease to the tenants the proceeds of the sale
of the dis­puted portions of the harvest for the agricultural </span>year <span style="">1962-1963; and (5) dismissing CAR Case No.
2764-NE-61 (for consignation) and CAR Case No. 2834-NE-61 (for </span><span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">His motion for reconsideration of the decision of the CAR, dated <st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="3">March 18, 1963</st1:date>, having been denied,
the landholder filed his notice of intention to appeal, and on <st1:date year="1963" day="13" month="7">July 13, 1963</st1:date>, he filed the petition
for <i style="">certiorari</i> in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his petition for <i style="">certiorari</i>
to review the decision of the CAR, the landholder simply raised the question of
the constitutionality of Section 14 of Republic Act 1199, which provision of
law the tenants had invoked in their petition before the CAR for a change of
their tenancy relationship from share tenancy to leasehold tenancy and upon
which the CAR had based its decision declaring the tenancy relationship between
the landholder and the tenants to be under the leasehold system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">landholder,
in this appeal, does not question the pro­priety of the rentals fixed by the
CAR and the action of the CAR in dismissing the petitions for consignation and <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <span class="SpellE">Primero</span> v. Court of
Agrarian Rela­tions, G. R. No. L-10594, <st1:date year="1957" day="29" month="5">May
 29, 1957</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court upheld the constitutionality and validity of Republic Act 1199 in
its entirety because it is "a remedial legisla­tion promulgated pursuant
to the social justice precepts of the Constitution and in the exercise of the
police power of the State to promote the common weal." Then in the <span style="">case </span>of De <span class="SpellE">Ramas</span>
v. The Court of Agrarian Relations, et al., G.R. No. L-19555, <st1:date year="1964" day="29" month="5">May 29, 1964</st1:date>, this Court spe­cifically
declared that Section 14 of Republic Act 1199 is constitutional.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court held that the enactment of that
particular provision of Republic Act 1199 is in virtue of the exercise of the
police power of the State, and neither does said provision impair the
obligation of contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, this
Court held that –</p>

<blockquote>"The right granted to the tenant to change the contract from
share tenancy to that of leasehold tenancy can not be considered unreasonable
or oppressive, because by the landlord's giving up of 5% of the harvest (the
change from share to leasehold tenancy reduces the landlord's share from 30% to
25%), the tenant becomes more responsible, more competent, and financially
prepared to comply with his obligations under the lease, to the ultimate
benefit of the landlord, with the consequent improvement of a lot of a big segment
of the population and thereby giving full meaning to the social justice directive
contained in the Constitution."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The ruling in the De <span class="SpellE">Ramas</span> case, <u>supra</u>,
has been reaffirmed by this Court in a number of subsequent decisions.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>
