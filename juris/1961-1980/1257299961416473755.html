				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><h3></h3><p>Appeal by certiorari from a decision of the Court of Industrial Relations, 
affirmed by the court <i>en banc</i>, dismissing this case upon the ground of 
lack of jurisdiction to hear the same. </p>
<p>Petitioner Alfredo V. Perez was a janitor of respondent Plastics Incorporated 
from March 14 to July 2, 1958. On the date last mentioned, Perez was dismissed 
by respondent upon the ground that one of its security guards had then 
apprehended him carrying a bundle of plastics allegedly stolen from said 
respondent. For reasons not stated in the record, the criminal case for theft 
subsequently filed against Perez was eventually dismissed, for which reason 
Perez sought reinstatement, which was denied. Accordingly, he filed with the 
Court of Industrial Relations a petition for reinstatement with backpay from the 
time of his dismissal. Respondent moved to dismiss the petition upon the ground 
of lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case. The motion was 
granted in an order dated September 30, 1960, which, on motion for 
reconsideration filed by Perez, was affirmed by the court sitting <i>en 
banc</i>. Hence, this appeal by certiorari.</p>
<p>Petitioner maintains that the decision appealed from is erroneous for, in 
PRISCO <i>vs. </i>CIR,. 108 Phil., 134 (May 23, 1960), we allegedly held "that 
the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over all labor disputes as 
long as the employer-employee relationship does exist or it is being sought to 
be re-established". There is no merit in this pretense. </p>
<p>We have repeatedly held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This Court has held in numerous cases that upon the enactment of Republic 
Act No. 875, which took effect on 17 June 1953, the jurisdiction of the Court of 
Industrial Relations was confined to the following: (1) when the labor dispute 
affects an industry which is indispensable to the national interest and is so 
certified by the President to the industrial court (section 10, Republic Act No. 
875); (2) when the controversy refers to minimum wage under the Minimum Wage Law 
(Republic Act No. 602); (3) when it involves hours of employment under the 
Eight-Hour Labor Law (Commonwealth Act No. 444); and (4) when it involves an 
unfair labor practice (section 5[a], Republic Act No. 875)." (Philippine Sugar 
Institute <i>vs. </i>CIR, 106 Phil., 401 [October 29, 1959], pp. 
2-3.)</p></blockquote>
<p>This ruling had, however, been misunderstood in some quarters as implying 
that cases involving the application of the Minimum Wage Law and the Eight-Hour 
Labor Law are always within the jurisdiction of the CIR. Hence, in the PRISCO 
case (<i>supra</i>), <i>which involved claims for overtime, </i>we said:</p>
<p>"* * * where the employer-employee relationship is still existing or is 
sought to be reestablished because of its wrongful severance (as where the 
employee seeks reinstatement), the Court of Industrial Relations has 
jurisdiction over all the claims arising out of, or in connection with 
employment, such as those related to the Minimum Wage Law and the Eight-Hour 
Labor Law. <i>After the termination of the relationship and no reinstatement is 
sought, such claims become mere money claims, and come within the jurisdiction 
of the regular courts."</i></p>
<p>In other words, there must be an employer-employee relationship between the 
parties in controversies arising under the Minimum Wage Law and the Eight-Hour 
Labor Law, or such relationship must be sought to be re-established, for said 
controversies to be within the jurisdiction of the CIR. </p>
<p>The case at bar has not been certified by the President and is not one for 
alleged unfair labor practice. Neither does it involve the Minimum Wage Law or 
the Eight-Hour Labor Law. Perez merely claims a right to reinstatement because 
of the dismissal of the criminal charge of theft against him, upon which his 
separation from the service had been' predicated. His alleged cause of action 
does not fall under the jurisdiction of the CIR.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision and the resolution appealed from are hereby affirmed, 
with costs against petitioner Alfredo V. Perez. It is so ordered.</p>
