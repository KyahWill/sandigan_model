				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal from a judgment <span style="">of the Court of First </span>Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental dated August 25, 1962, finding the
herein appellants guilty of contempt <span style="">of
</span>court for non-compliance with the court's decision rendered in civil
case 1865 for mandamus which directed and ordered them to appropriate the
necessa­ry amount available from the municipal treasury of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span>
for the payment of salary differentials due to the herein <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1956" day="20" month="2">February 20, 1956</st1:date>
the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> filed a petition for mandamus in the
court below against the municipal treasurer, the then incumbent municipal mayor
and members of the muni­cipal council of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span>, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental, for payment of salary differentials
allegedly due<span style=""> t</span>hem, as employees
of the mu­nicipal government, under the terms of their respective appoint­ments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main cause of com<span style="">p</span>laint of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in that case was
that, while the municipal council of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span>, on
December <span style="">29, 1955 passed two
resolutions, numbered 125 and 126, authoriz</span>ing the appropriation and
payment to them of salary differentials <span style="">on
account of the enactment of the Minimum Wage Law </span><span style="">(R. A. </span><span style="">602 </span>which
fixed the minimum w<span style="">a</span>ge of
industrial workers and govern­ment employees at 4.00 per day), the said
council, on January 14, 1956, <span class="GramE">revoke<span style="">d</span></span> the said resolutions, allegedly because the lat­ter were
passed merely to benefit a few officials and employees of the municipality,
there were not enough funds to pay the said salary differentials, and the
Minimum Wage Law is not obligato­ry upon the government and public
corporations.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners (the herein <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>)
and the respondents in the mandamus petition subsequently submitted to the
court an "Agreed Statement of Facts," on the basis of which the court
below rendered its decision dated January 30, 1957, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
<span style="">portion of which reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered the respondents Malcol<span style="">m</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Enerio</span>
[Mun<span style="">i</span>cipal Mayor] <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Anacleto</span></span><span style=""> </span>A. <span class="SpellE">Bandala</span>

Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Arado</span>, San­tiago <span class="SpellE">Hayo</span>,
Juan <span class="SpellE">Caliso</span>, as Members of the Muni­cipal Council of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span>, are hereby ordered to appropriate necessary
amounts to pay the salary dif­ferentials for the petitioners and also for the
payment of their entire salaries from month to month, subject naturally to the
availability of funds after all statutory and subsisting contractual
obligations shall have been properly covered by adequate appropriations."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above decision became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
but as the municipal council failed to implement it, the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
filed a motion for execution of judgment on <st1:date year="1957" day="2" month="3"><span style="">M</span>arch 2, 1957</st1:date>,
pursuant to which a writ of execution was issued on <st1:date year="1957" day="9" month="3">March 9, 1957</st1:date> and duly served on the
respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently, the council
still failed to comply with the lower court's decision and writ of execution,
as on <st1:date year="1957" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1957</st1:date> the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, through counsel, filed a motion for the
respondents <span style="">to show <span class="GramE">cause</span>
why they should not be dealt with in contempt of court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting on this motion, the court issued an
order requiring the res­pondents to appear before the said tribunal to show <span class="GramE">cause</span> why they should not be held for contempt for their
failure to comply with its decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nothing was done, however, on this motion as before the same could be
heard, the presiding judge of the court went on leave, and the temporary judge
on detail thought that the incident should be heard by the regular judge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Then, on <span style="">Ap</span>ril 1, 1959, the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> filed
with the court a "Motion to Implement Decision" of January 30, 1957
on the ground, among others, that the respondents in the mandamus case had not
yet complied with the writ of execution issued in connection with the court's
decision in the case and that the council had, in the intervening period, made
new appropriations in violation of the said decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on this motion, the court issued an order on <st1:date year="1959" day="4" month="4">April 4, 1959</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads as follows:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, finding the motion of the coun­sel for the
petitioners to be well founded, the Munici­pal Council of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental, composed of the Municipal Mayor,
Malcolm S. <span class="SpellE">Enerio</span>, Vice-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span>

the said Muni­cipal Council and <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> N. Tan as
Municipal Treasu­rer are hereby ordered to appropriate in the fiscal year of
1959 to 1960 the total amount of P</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">7,575.20
and to appropriate similar amount every succeeding fiscal year thereafter until
the total liability and obligations of the Municipal Government in favor of the
herein plaintiffs shall have been liquidated in about five (5) years more or
less "<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1959" day="13" month="5">May 13, 1959</st1:date>
the respondents in the mandamus case asked for a reconsideration of the court's
order mainly on the ground that the municipality had no funds to appropriate to
comply with the order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While this <span style="">m</span>otion was
pending consi­deration, however, the 1959 provincial and municipal elections
were held; in this election the herein appellants were elected, as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>former vice-mayor <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span>
A. <span class="SpellE">Bandala</span> was elected municipal mayor, <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Macoy</span> as vice-mayor,
and the foll<span style="">owing as councilors:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Francisco A</span><span style="">. </span><span style="">German, <span class="SpellE">Constancio</span> M.

<span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> Paler and Jose Tan.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the exception of mayor <span class="SpellE">Bandala</span> and councilors German and Ira, all the others were
new members of the council and could not, therefore, be named respondents in
the mandamus petition filed by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in the
court below.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before the in-coming municipal officials assumed office, however,
the outgoing members of the council approved on <st1:date year="1959" day="17" month="12">Decem­ber 17, 1959</st1:date>, a resolution (Resolution 204), in
which the council resolved<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><span style="">" .</span></span><span style=""> . . </span>to
appropriate the amount of TWENTY SIX THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT AND
33/100 PESOS ( 26, 453. 33) from any fund not other<span style="">wise appropriated and expended to cover the entire claim of the
petitioners in Civil Case No. 1865, en­titled 'TOMAS AGUADOR, ET AL.,
PETITIONERS VERSUS MALCOLM S. ENERIO, ET AL., RESPONDENTS' in accordance with
the decision of the Honorable Court dated January 30, 1957 in said case."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On January 2, 1960 the appellants who, by then, had assumed the
helm of government at <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span>, approved another
resolution (Resolution 9) requesting the counsel of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
to wait until July of the succeeding fiscal year for the council to appropriate
funds to pay the obligation in civil case 1865.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This re­solution also stated, in its declaratory portion, that the
council had previously revoked Resolution 204 of the former council by another
resolution (Resolution 8).</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant then to their promise, the members of the coun­cil
appropriated in the FY 1960-61 municipal budget the sum of P <span style="">7, 5</span>75. <span class="GramE">20 which is
equivalent to the annual installment payment ordered by the court in its order
of </span><st1:date year="1959" day="4" month="4"><span class="GramE">April 4,
 1959</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">amount </span>was thereafter paid to the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 20, 1962, however, the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
filed with the court a motion for contempt against the municipal treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span> and the herein<span style=""> </span>appellants on the ground, mainly, <span style="">that while </span>in the <span style="">FY </span>1961-62
municipal budget of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span> there <span style="">was </span>an appropriation item <span style="">of P 7, 575.20 </span>for the payment of the
sala­ry <span style="">differentials </span>of the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">appellees</span></span><span style="">, a notation had </span>been placed un­derneath
said item which had the effect of modifying the decision and order of the
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This notation reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"(The Municipal
Treasurer should hold </span>pay­ment <span style="">of
</span>this particular obligation pending the receipt of the <span style="">copies </span>of the amended appointments <span style="">of the </span>claimants of this case from the
Commissioner of Civil Service decreasing their salaries as per <span class="SpellE">plantilla</span> in 1954-1955)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1962</st1:date>
the court issued an order requiring the appellants to appear before it on <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1962</st1:date> and show cause why they
should not be dealt with for contempt of court for not comply­ing with its
decision and orders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the members of
the council, with the <span style="">exception </span>of
<span style="">mayor </span><span class="SpellE">Bandala</span>
and councilor <span class="SpellE">Roa</span>, appeared before the said tribunal
on the scheduled date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the hearing,
the appellants manifested in open court that they went there involunta­rily,
that <span style="">is, </span>only <span style="">in </span>obedience to the subpoena <span style="">issued </span>by the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also questioned the validity of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' motion for con­tempt, contending that the same
was a mere motion and not a con­tempt charge under the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court, however, these arguments
notwithstanding, ordered the arraignment of the appellants on the contempt
motion of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellants pleaded not guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 2, 1962 the appellants filed a motion for reconside­ration
of the court's assumption of jurisdiction on the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>'
motion for contempt, based on the following grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the appel­lants who were new members of
the council were not parties to the original petition for mandamus and hence
not bound by the de­cision and orders promulgated therein; (b) they were not
furnished any copy of the motion for contempt; (c) the said motion does not
constitute a contempt charge; (d) the appearance of the appellants on June 30,
1962 was involuntary; (e) the appellants had no partici­pation in the agreed
statement of facts entered into between the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
and the former members of the council which formed the basis of the lower
court's decision and orders in the mandamus case; and (f) since the previous
members of the municipal council who were the parties in the mandamus case
retired by the expira­tion of their terms of office on December 31, 1959, with
the excep­tion of <span class="SpellE">Bandala</span>, German and Ira, who were
re-elected, they could not be declared in contempt as they were not aware of
the antece­dents of the case upon which the alleged contempt charge was
founded.</p>

<p class="BODY">Aside from the above-mentioned motion, the appellants also filed
an answer to the motion for contempt of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ar­guments advanced in their answer were
as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) apart from the fact that
they were strangers to the mandamus case, they could not comply with the
court's decision in that case since the munici­pality of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span>
had not been made <span style="">a </span>party to the
said petition for mandamus (citing the cases of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>
City <i>vs.</i> Enriquez, L-9775, <span style="">May </span>29,
1957; <span class="SpellE">Angara</span> <i>vs.</i> <span class="SpellE">Gorospe</span>,
L-9230, April 22, 1957; <span class="SpellE">Caba­nes</span> <i>vs.</i>
Rodriguez, L-9799, May 31, 1957; <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> <i><span style="">vs.</span></i><span style=""> </span>Rodriguez, L­9052, September 28, 1957; <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>
City <i>vs.</i> Rodriguez, L-8801, September 30, 1957); (b) due to the
non-inclusion of the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span> in the
case, they were, therefore, in good faith in not complying with the court's
orders; (c) the decision of the lower court being based solely on a stipulation
of facts, it did not become <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>, but should be considered as a mere
administrative proceeding which could be set aside on grounds of fraud or
mistake; (d) certain written instruments were recently unearthed by the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> (the herein appellants) which showed that the
petitioners (the herein <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>) signed a pledge
dated April 14, 1954 wherein they promised to collect their salary
differentials only in case revenue collections for 1953-54 of the municipality
would exceed the revenue estimates based on the 1952-53 annual budget which
condition, as the appellants later attempted to show, was not met; and (e) the <span class="SpellE">ap­pellees</span> were extended new appointments with reduced
salaries, that is, at the old rates.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1982</st1:date>,
however, the lower court issued an order declaring the notation appearing in
the municipal budget of <span class="SpellE">Oro­quieta</span> as in violation of
its decision on the mandamus case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conse­quently,
it ordered the municipal treasurer to ignore the said an­notation and immediately
pay the salary differentials from the ap­propriation in the said budget to the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court
also held in abeyance any action on the contempt proceedings initiated by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 5, 1962 the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> filed
their opposition to the motion for reconsideration of the appellants of July 2,
1962, on the following grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the
appellants had already pleaded to the contempt charge and, therefore, should be
deemed to have waived all objections thereto; (b) the appellants are <span style="">the successors-in-­interest of the members of
the council who were cited as parties to the mandamus petition and, hence, are
bound by the decision ren­dered therein; </span>(c) <span style="">the appellants are <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from questioning
the court's jurisdiction since they already voluntarily submitted them</span>selves
to the court's jurisdiction by <span style="">partly
satisfying the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' claims; (d) copies </span>of
the motion for contempt were furnished the provincial fiscal who had been
appearing as counsel for the respon­dents in the mandamus case; (e) the
municipal council was likewise served a copy of their motion which was received
by the municipal secretary; (f) on June 30, 1962, at the hearing of the
contempt charge, the appellants, with the exception of mayor <span class="SpellE">Bandala</span> and councilor <span class="SpellE">Roa</span>, were
furnished each a copy of said motion; and (g) the motion for contempt
constitutes a contempt charge, and all that the Rules of Court require is a
charge in writing which may therefore, take any form.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 6, 1962 some of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
filed a "supplemental contempt charge" against vice-mayor <span class="SpellE">Macoy</span>, and councilors Ger­man, <span class="SpellE">Marimon</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Udal</span>, Delgado, Paler and Tan, averring that even as
the lower court in its order of July 2, 1962 declared the annotation in the FY
1961-62 municipal budget null and void, the accused officials, at their session
of July 2, 1962, approved a resolution (Resolution 233) reverting the amount of
P7,525.20 appropriated in the said budget to the general fund of the
municipality for use in de­fraying the cost of constructing a street and sewerage
system in­side the municipal market.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on the "supplemental contempt charge" of the <span class="SpellE">appel­lees</span>, the lower court on <st1:date year="1962" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1962</st1:date>, issued an order, directing the members of
the council of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span> to restore or re-appropriate
the sum of P 7, 525.20 in the same budget within 48 hours from re­ceipt of the
said order.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 7, 1962 the appellants filed an answer to the <span class="SpellE">appel­lees</span>' opposition to their motion for reconsideration,
in which they contended that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> promised to collect salary differentials only if
the estimated revenue receipts (of P102, 046.00) for FY 1953-54 were actually
collected per municipal council Resolution 83 dated August 31, 1953 (and
several other resolutions), which promise was expressly borne out by a pledge dated
April 14, 1954 signed by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>; (b) by virtue
of Resolution 84 dated August15, 1955, the claims of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
against the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span> had already
been totally discharged, for at the end of June 30, 1954 the sum of only P87,
480.23 was actually collected, and not the expected P102,046.00; the foregoing
documents, the ap­pellants alleged, were not made known by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in their petition for mandamus, thus misleading
the court which rendered decision based on the agreed statement of facts
between the parties; (c) some of the petitioners in the mandamus case were mere
tem­porary employees and hence their services were good for only three (3)
months under section 682 of the Revised Administrative Code, unless their
appointments were renewed for another three (3) months with the approval of the
Civil Service Commissioner, and consequently are not entitled to salary
differentials for a straight period of four (4) years as they claimed; (d)
according to section 691 of the Revised Administrative Code, persons employed <span style="">in </span>the government service contrary to
law or the civil service rules are not entitled to compensation; (e) the
appellants are not successors-in-office of the respondents in the mandamus
petition; and (f) the reason why they appropriated P 7,575.20 was their be­lief
that all the proceedings were valid and legal as they were not parties to the
mandamus case, but that since the discovery of the documents aforementioned,
they were of the view that the <span class="SpellE">appel­lees</span>' claims had
already been discharged.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On July </span>9, <span style="">1962 the appellants </span>moved for a
reconsideration of the court's order <span style="">of
</span>July 6, 1962, for the following <span style="">reasons:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>(a) they were not furnished with any
copy of the supplemental contempt charge nor served notice of its date of
submission, so they <span style="">could be heard by
the court; (b) the supplemental contempt charge, being criminal in nature and
an amendment of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' mo­tion for contempt,
cannot be heard <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> nor submitted
to the court for resolution without the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> (the
herein appellants) being given their day in court; (c) they were not parties to
the mandamus case which was the basis of the supplemental contempt charge; and
(d) the said charge, being an amendment to the motion for contempt, cannot be
filed without leave of court for that would put them (the appellants) in double
jeopardy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day, that is, <st1:date year="1962" day="9" month="7">July
 9, 1962</st1:date>, the lower court issued an order denying the motion for
reconsideration of the ap­pellants of its order of <st1:date year="1962" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The

the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> filed their answer to the above

the declarations made in open court during the consideration of the above
proposals for ad­mission, discloses the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
admitted proposals 1, 2, and 3, with the qualification, with respect to
proposal 3, that the council was furnished a copy of the motion for contempt
officially through the provincial fiscal and the municipal secretary, and, that
in fact, vice-mayor <span class="SpellE">Macoy</span> even argued in court during
the hearing on the motion for contempt; proposal 4 was admitted with the
qualifica­tion indicated as to proposal 3; proposal 5 was admitted with the qua­lification
that the appellants had complied with the January 30, 1957 decision as
implemented by the lower court's order dated April 4, 1959 when they approved,
on January 2, 1960, Resolution 9 requesting the plaintiffs (the herein <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>) in civil case 1865, through their counsel, to
wait until July of 1961 for the municipal council to appro­priate the amount
from any available funds of the municipality to co­ver up the differentials
owing to the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, followed by Resolution 42 on
January 29, 1960, appropriating the sum of P7,575. 20 in the FY 1960-61
municipal budget of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span> for payment to the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, which was actually paid to them; proposal 6 was
rejected on the ground that under the rulings of the Supreme Court in <span class="SpellE">Teves</span> <i>vs.</i> Court of Appeals, L-14776, May 30, 1960,
and other cases, a municipality may be considered bound by a court's decision
in a mandamus case although not explicitly made a party-respondent; pro­posals
7 and 8 were likewise rejected on the grounds <span style="">that to admit </span>them would amount to a re-opening of the mandamus
case, and that even if the alleged waiver were admitted in evidence during the
trial in the mandamus case, the same would have been denied admission for being
null and void as contrary <span style="">to section 20
of the M</span>inimum Wage Law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Due to the refusal of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> to
admit some of the pro­posals offered by the appellants, the latter, at the
hearing that fol­lowed on the contempt charges, attempted to introduce in
evidence, both documentary and oral testimony, that would prove the facts
denied by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, but this attempt was foiled
by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> whose objections were sustained by
the lower court basically on the ground that the said evidences would only
serve to revive the mandamus case the judgment in which has long become final
and <span class="SpellE">execu­tory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1962</st1:date>
the court rendered its decision on the contempt charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It found the appellants guilty of contempt of
court, and accordingly sentenced each of them to pay a fine of P25.00, with
subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were further ordered confined in jail until they shall have com­plied
with the court's decision and implemental order in the mandamus case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the effect of the judgment was
suspended as to the respondents therein who have filed or may file a written
manifestation declaring their willingness to comply with the court's decision
and orders in the said mandamus case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this appeal.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Several assignments of error are made by the appellants in this
appeal.</p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">I. </span>The first states
that "The lower court erred in declaring appellants guilty of contempt of
court in a case where they were not parties and for allegedly disobeying a
decision already complied <span style="">with."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There are, obviously, two assertions made by the appellants in this
particular assignment of error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
shall, however, discuss the second assertion first.</p>

<p class="BODY">As disclosed in their brief, the appellants' argument that the
lower court's decision of January 30, 1957 has already been complied with, is
based upon the fact that as shown by the <span class="SpellE">appel­lees</span>'
own evidence, the members of the municipal council of <span class="SpellE">Oro­quieta</span>
(the respondents in the mandamus case) approved, on De­cember 17, 1959,
Resolution 204, <u>supra</u>, which appropriated the sum of P 26, 548.33 from
any fund of the municipality not otherwise <span style="">appropriated to cover the entire claim of the petitioners in said
mandamus case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, according
to the appellants, the only remaining action to be taken was the implementation
of this resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not think that
this conclusion can be sustained on the basis of the evidence of record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted that on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="2" month="1"><span style="">January
 2, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, only two
days after the appellants assumed of­fice as members of the municipal council
of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span>, they ap­proved Resolution 9 requesting
the counsel of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> to wait until July for
the council to appropriate the amount neces­sary to satisfy the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' claim in the mandamus case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This resolution proves quite clearly that
Resolution 204 was revoked by Resolution 8, series of 1960, which was passed by
the appel­lants themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
pertinent portion of Resolution 9 reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, that the honest purpose and in­tention of the
framers of Resolution No. 8, series of 1950, particularly the present Municipal
Council, in revoking said Resolution No.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>204, series of 1959, is not to deny in complying with the order of the
Hon­orable Court dated January 30, 1957, but rather to request, the plaintiffs
of said civil case No. 1865, through its counsel Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Conol</span>, to defer said payment, and wait till July of
next fiscal year so the present municipal council will appropriate the <span style="">amount </span>from any funds available to
cover the said obligation in civil case No. 1865;".</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">We cannot, therefore, in view of this
fact, sustain the appellants' argument that the lower court's decision had
already been complied with.</p>

<p class="BODY">We now go to the first assertion of the appellants:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that they cannot <span style="">be </span>adjudged guilty of contempt for
disobeying the court's de­cision inasmuch as they were not parties in the
mandamus case and hence must be deemed unaware of its existence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support of this position, the appellants
cite the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) they became
members of the council only on January 1, 1960 whereas the lower court's
decision in the mandamus case was rendered way back on January 30, 1957, while
the writ of execution to enforce this deci­sion was issued on March 19, 1957
and the court's so-called imple­mental order, on April 4, 1959, all prior to
their assumption of office; and (b) this Court's statement in <span class="SpellE"><u>Ferrer</u></span><u> <i>vs.</i> Rodriguez, et al</u>.,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
to wit:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"As </span>a general
rule, persons who are not par­ties to an action or proceedings are not subject
to the jurisdiction of a court trying a case, are not sup­posed to be aware of
the court's order and cannot, <span style="">therefore,
be declared guilty of contempt for violat­ing its orders.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Nevertheless, persons who are not parties in a proceeding may
be declared guilty of contempt for <span class="SpellE">wilful</span> violation
of an order issued in the case if said persons are guilty of conspiracy with
any of the par­ties in violating the court's order."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We cannot sustain the appellants' argument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, it is impossible to
believe that the appellants could not have actual knowledge of the existence of
civil case 1865 and the deci­sion and orders of the lower court relative
thereto, since as one of the appellants himself testified before the court
below - and his testimony, incidentally, was adopted in its entirety by the
other appellants - the matter of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' claim
was an <span style="">issue </span>during their
political campaign in the 1959 elections, the appellants supporting the stand
that if the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' claims were true and valid,
they will have to pay the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same
witness, while denying any know­ledge of the lower court's decision in the
mandamus case, also tes­tified, when asked this question:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"What was the basis of the appro­priation
if it was not the decision of this Court?", that "That was the basis
of course but it was not on the strength of the decision that we appropriated
the amount." The fact that this witness admit­ted that they appropriated
an amount (which is equivalent to the first installment payment ordered by the
lower court) to pay the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' claim, based on
what the court required, shows that the appellants were fully aware of the
court's decision in the mandamus case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the second place, it must be observed that the appel­lants approved
Resolution 9 mentioned above only two days after they assumed office as the
elected officials of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, in the third place, section 49 of Rule
39 of our Rules of Court (for­merly section 44) provides that:</p>

<blockquote>"The effect of a judgment or final order ren­dered by a court
or judge of the Philippines, having jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment or
order, may be as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"(b) </span>In other cases the judgment
so ordered is, in respect to the matter directly adjudged or as to any other
matter that could have been raised in relation thereto, conclusive between the
parties and their successors in interest by title subsequent to the
commencement of the action or special proceed­ing, litigating for the same
thing and under the same title and in the same capacity."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Being the successors in office of the <span class="SpellE">outgone</span> members of the mu­nicipal council of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span> who were the respondents in civil case 1865, the
appellants also succeeded to the civil obligations im­posed by statute or
judicial decision upon the members of the mu­nicipal council in their official
capacity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An elective officer does not
succeed merely to the rights and privileges attached to an elective office; he
also assumes, in contemplation of law, the obligations appurtenant hereto as
ordained by statutory rule or judi­cial pronouncement.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot consider <span class="SpellE"><u>Ferrer</u></span><u> <i>vs.</i>
Rodriguez,</u> cited by the ap­pellants, as applicable to the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only were the facts in that case
different from those in the present case, but also, as we said there, the lack
of jurisdiction of a tribunal over persons not parties to an action or proceeding,
is only the general rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We, in fact,
cited in that case one exception -- conspiracy -- but, obviously, we never
suggested or implied that this is the only ex­ception.</p>

<p class="NUM">II. We now turn to the appellants' second assignment of
error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellants contend "That
assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> that appellants are bound by
the decision of the lower court, the said court erred in not admitting
evidences of appellants to prove circumstances of fraud under which said
decision was rendered and the non-availability or insufficiency of funds by
reason of which compliance cannot be made.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">" There</span> are likewise two parts to this
assignment of error.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the trial of the contempt charges, the appellants attempted to
adduce evidence which would show that the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
signed on April 14, 1954 a pledge in which the latter promised "to abide
volun­tarily with the spirit and purpose of Resolution No. 83, s. 1953 of the
Honorable Municipal Council of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span> to the
extent of col­lecting only any amount of salary increase or difference that may
be due us proportional to the actual revenue collections made up to June 30,
1954 in excess of the ordinary revenue estimates based from the 1952-53 Annual
Budget." The appellants also wanted to prove that the condition contained
in this pledge which would have entitled the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
to collect salary differentials did not happen as tax collections fell short of
the expected municipal income.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their
attempts to introduce these evidences were, however, foiled each time by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> who objected on the ground <span style="">m</span>ainly that
their admission would amount to a re-opening of the mandamus case in w<span style="">h</span>ich there was already a final
judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is our opinion that the lower court acted correctly on this
particular aspect of the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The proper step that the appellants could have taken was either to file
a separate action attacking the validity of the lower courts decision or a
petition for relief on the ground of fraud, assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>argu</u><u><span style="">endo</span></u></span> that the evidence in
their hands would be sufficient for the purpose of re-opening the court's
decision.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Nevertheless, it is also our opinion that it would not have availed the
appellants any, were the alleged pledge signed by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
and the other documents related thereto admitted in evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be observed that the alleged pledge
was signed on <st1:date year="1954" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1954</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>'
claim for salary dif­ferentials was, however, based upon two resolutions
subsequent­ly passed by the municipal council of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span>
on <st1:date year="1955" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1955</st1:date>,
namely, Resolutions 125 and 126, <u><span style="">supra.</span></u><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
the council itself, by its own action, rendered nugatory whatever binding ef­fect
the said pledge could have produced against the interest of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Admittedly, these two resolutions were subsequently revoked on <st1:date year="1956" day="14" month="1">January 14, 1956</st1:date> by another council
resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it was precisely the
validity of this latter resolution that was assail­ed by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in the mandamus case, and which the lower court
by virtue of its decision in this case, in effect, rendered null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the situation is that those two
resolutions still stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, one
of the principal reasons that brought about the passage of those two
resolutions was to enable the <st1:place><st1:placetype>mu­nicipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
to comply with the Minimum Wage Law whose provisions fixing the minimum wage of
employees <span style="">in </span>both
the private and government sectors are mandatory and cannot be waived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <span style="">section
</span>2(b) of R.<span style="">A. </span>602 provides:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Employer includes any person acting directly or indirectly in the
interest of an employer in relation to an employee and shall include the
government and government corporations." On the other hand, sec­tion 20 of
the same law provides: "No worker or organization of workers may
voluntarily or otherwise, individually or collective­ly, waive any rights
established under this Act, and no agreement or contract, oral or written, to
accept a lower wage or less than any other benefit required under this Act
shall be valid."</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants argue, however, <span style="">that </span>the lower court erred in refusing to admit proof of the
financial incapacity of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>muni­cipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
to pay the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We cannot sustain this argument on the basis of the recital of facts
contained in the re­cord of this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">More </span>than any other reason, what
impelled the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> to file the contempt charges
against the appellants was the fact that while the latter included an
appropriation item in the FY 1961-62 budget for the payment of the second
installment on the claim of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, the
appellants made a notation therein directing the municipal treasurer to
withhold payment of said amount until the respective appointments of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> were received.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From the evidence adduced in the court below, we ga­ther that the
municipal council makes appropriations on the ba­sis of the statements and
estimates of income and expenditures submitted <span style="">by </span>the municipal treasurer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, from the testi­mony of the
municipal treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span>, <span style="">we </span>gather
that in the <span style="">m</span>atter
of the above-mentioned appropriation in question, he certified to the council
the availability of funds, for the fiscal year involved, in the amount of P
7,575.20 as approved in the bud­get, but that the council later reverted said
appropriation to some other purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the face of this testimony of one of the appel­lants' own witnesses, it <span style="">is </span>difficult
to fend off the truth of the ver­dict that the municipality had funds to meet
the claims of the <span class="SpellE">ap­pellees</span> in FY 1961-62.</p>

<p class="BODY">We also consider as untenable two other points subsumed by the
appellants in their discussion of their second assignment of error, namely, (a)
that inasmuch as more than five years have elapsed since the decision in the
mandamus case became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, the
enforcement of said decision can no longer be had by a mere motion, but through
an independent action; and (b) that the lower court erred in refusing to
consider the appellants' proof that the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
were extended subsequent appointments which carried reduced salary rates.</p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with the appellants' first contention, it must be
borne in mind that the case at bar pertains to a contempt pro­ceeding which
arose from the fact that the appellants refused or failed to obey the command
of a judicial tribunal for the perform­ance of certain specific acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the objective of the
proceeding below is primarily that of holding the appellants punish­able for
disobeying the court's command, and, only secondarily, for the enforcement of
the rights and interests of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it is within the power of the lower court
to take cognizance of the contempt charges filed by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect, in turn, to the argument that the court below
should have admitted evidence that the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> were
extended subsequent appointments at reduced salary rates, it is our consi­dered
opinion that it is now late in the day to raise this point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This particular issue should have been raised
in the mandamus case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, from the
decision of the lower court in civil case 1865, it appears that except for two
of the petitioners<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
in that case, the salary due the rest of the petitioners therein was P120.00 a
month under their respective appointments.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This monthly salary, at the time the Minimum Wage Law took effect, was,
as practiced by the government, the minimum monthly salary that government em­ployees
were supposed to receive per month.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, even if the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> were really
extended subsequent appointments at re­duced salary rates, such a reduction
would have been void for being contrary to the provisions of the law.</p>

<p class="NUM">III. We now proceed to the appellants' third assignment of
error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellants maintain that
"The lower court erred in declaring the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
liable under the decision" in civil case 1865.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Teves</u></span><u> <i>vs.</i> Court of
Appeals,</u><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court was presented an issue similar to the one now raised by the
appellants, and we there held as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"It is an elementary rule of procedure that cases must be
prosecuted for and against the real parties in interest, and in an action for
recovery of accrued salaries, the appropriation for which had already been
expended, the City that would have to provide the needed amount is certainly a
necessary party therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Angara</span> <i>vs.</i> <span class="SpellE">Gorospe</span>, 101 <u>Phil.</u>

despite the fact that the city or <span class="GramE">municipality concerned were</span>
not made parties to the action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <i>vs.</i> Rodriguez, 95 <u>Phil</u>.

citations are not controlling in the case at bar, for in those instances, the
question of juris­diction of the court to make the awards was not raised and
passed upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor can we apply our ruling
in the cases of <span class="SpellE">Mangubat</span> <i>vs.</i> <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> (G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-12837, </span></span><st1:date year="1959" day="30" month="4"><span class="GramE"><span style="">April 30, 1959</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="">) and </span></span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Baguio</span></span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE"><span style=""> <i>vs.</i> Rodriguez, (G.

1959) that petition for </span><span style="">mandamus </span><span style="">and quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span>
may be entertained and back salaries awarded notwithstanding the non-inclusion
of the city as a party, for the reason that in those cases, the action was
directed against the </span><span style="">mayor, </span><span style="">the treasurer, the auditor and the city
council -- all represented by the city attorney.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inclusion in the petition of these
officials, specifi­cally the city council that would pass the necessary
legislation covering the necessary appropriation, the city treasurer and the
city auditor who would release the funds, was considered substantial com­pliance
with the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Differently, in the
instant case, the action was directed only against the City Mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no question that the said respon­dent
Mayor may, by a writ of mandamus, be com­pelled to reinstate petitioner <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>, but, certainly, back salaries cannot be awarded
without affording either the City itself or the City Council opportunity to be
heard and prepare its defense."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The doctrine which we adhere to, therefore, as rounded out in the
above case, is that the express inclusion of a city or municipality in cases
involving a demand for payment of unpaid salaries is not mandatory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The thrust of this doctrine applies in full measure
to the instant case. Indeed, what really matters in cases of this nature is
whether the local government concerned could be justly said to have been given
and adequately afforded the opportunity to defend itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, under our legal <span style="">sys­tem, </span>the right to act for and <span style="">in </span>behalf of
a city or municipality, unless the statute specifies otherwise, is vested in
its elected offi­cials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at
bar, the municipal mayor, the members of the municipal council and the
municipal treasurer were expressly made parties in the mandamus case and in the
contempt proceedings, and they were represented by the provincial fiscal in
both cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We would be unjustly
misshaping the doctrine above enun­ciated and would render nugatory our
attempts lately to free rules of procedure from the fetters of inordinate
technicality, if, in the face of what transpired in this case, we would hold
that the muni­cipality of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span> was not
adequately represented in the mandamus<span style="">
case instituted by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in the court below.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">IV. We now turn to the fourth and last assignment of error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellants contend that "The lower
court erred in declaring appel­lants guilty of contempt of court without due
process of law."</p>

<p class="BODY">As may be inferred from the brief submitted to this Court, the
appellants' reference to lack of due process is anchored, apart from the
alleged objectionable features of the proceedings in the court below which were
mentioned in their first three assignments of error, upon the following
premises:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) that copies of the mo­tion
for contempt filed by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> were served only
upon the provincial fiscal and the municipal secretary of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span>;
(b) that no copy of the supplemental charge for contempt was served upon the
fiscal or on any of the appellants prior to their arraignment; (c) that on June
23, 1960 the lower court issued without hearing or notice an order requiring
the appellants to appear before the said court on June 30, 1962 and show cause
why they should not be dealt with in contempt of court for failure to obey the
decision of January 30, 1957; and (d) that on June 30, 1962 the lower court
immediately arraigned the appellants before they could even be furnished a copy
of the motion for contempt, or apprised of the nature of the charges, or could
consult with a lawyer of their choice.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are of the view that the appellants' claim of denial of due
process is untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the appellants' first premise, while it may be
true that they were not furnished individually a copy of the mo­tion for
contempt by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> prior to or at the time of
its filing with the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, it must be borne in mind that
the said motion actually and substantially constituted a charge for contempt
for the reason that there is no particular form prescribed by the Rules of
Court in which a contempt charge shall be framed or des<span style="">cribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is also no
requirement in the Rules of Court that a copy of the contempt charge shall be
served on the respondents named therein when it is filed in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that section 3, Rule 71 (formerly Rule
64) requires on this matter is that a charge in writing be filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent in a contempt proceeding is,
of course, entitled to know the nature and cause of the accusation against him,
but this right is properly satisfied when the court, </span>af­ter <span style="">the respondent appears before it, reads to
the respondent the complaint or furnishes him a copy thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the munici­pal secretary, and the
provincial fiscal who under the law is the legal counsel of municipal officials
when the latter are sued in their official capacity, were both served with
copies of the motion for contempt prior to its hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record also shows that one of the
appellants was present during the hearing of the contempt </span>motion on <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Based on what he said below, it may be clearly
inferred that the members of the municipal council of <span class="SpellE">Oro­quieta</span>
had been informed about the said motion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, he said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"This
representation have, upon previous agreement with the coun­cil, to be one among
those to consult with the Fiscal regarding this case, because it is the Fiscal,
according to law, who should represent the Municipal Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Until the Fiscal is disquali­fied to do so, I
cannot make any say in this case." Since there had been a previous
agreement among the members of the council to consult with the fiscal first
concerning the case, it is, therefore, difficult to accept that the municipal
secretary who received the copy of the said motion had not done his duty of
forwarding the said copy to the members of the council.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under section 5 of Rule 131 of our Rules of
Court, there is a presumption that official duty has been regularly
performed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe that this has not
been suffi­ciently rebutted by the appellants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Lastly, the <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span> evi­dence on record
shows that the appellants, after their arraign­ment in the court below, were
individually given a copy of the motion for contempt, against which the
appellants even filed an answer refuting the material allegations made by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The appellants cannot thus be said to have been deprived of their right,
under section 3, Rule 71 of the Rules of Court, to be heard.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing discussion obviously answers the second argument
raised by the appellants to support their fourth assign­ment of error.</p>

<p class="BODY">We shall then go to the appellants' third assertion that the
lower court denied them due process by issuing without hearing or notice its
order of June 23, 1962 requiring then to appear before the said court on June
30, 1962 and show cause why they should not be dealt with for contempt for not
complying with the court's January 30, 1957 decision on the mandamus case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants would apparently be correct were it demand­ed by
the fundamental rules established by existing conventions that the procedural
branch of justice be applied in the purest and most absolute sense ever
conceived by man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We all look forward to
the inevitable coming into being of such a state in our quest for true justice
and we have cause to envy those who will have the good luck in the future to
boast of such a state of achievement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But by our standards of today which the public expects shall be
fulfilled; <span style="">we
do not </span>think that the court <span style="">below is required to </span>consult with the
appellants first before it issues a formal order for them to appear and show
cause why they should not be dealt with for contempt for failing to obey the
court's decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the proceedings
below, the court <u>a</u> <u><span style="">quo</span></u>
had before it a complaint for contempt of court filed by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> against the appellants, and since the Rules of
Court, <span style="">as </span>a matter of due
process of law, expressly require that the accused in a contempt case be
afforded the opportunity to be heard by himself or counsel, it stands to reason
that the very least that it could have done was to hale the appellants before
it so that the court could hear their side in person or by counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not like­ly that the court below had
the intention of depriving the appellants this opportunity when it ordered them
to come to court and show cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
the case went subsequently to the trial stage after the appellants had filed
their answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot, therefore, sus­tain
the appellants' position.</p>

<p class="BODY">We now turn to the fourth and last point raised by the appel­lants
to support their stand that they were denied due process of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellants claim that on <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1962</st1:date>, the lower court
immediately arraigned them before they could be (a) furnished a copy of the
motion for contempt, or (b) apprised of the nature of the charges, or (c) could
consult with a lawyer of their choice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We have already passed upon the first point of the appellants, and con­sequently,
we shall hereafter be concerned solely with the latter two.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants' use of the term "arraign" in their assign­ment
of error convinces us that the appellants have in mind the provision of section
1, Rule 116 of the Rules of Court on criminal procedure which states that
"The arraignment must be made by the judge or clerk, and shall consist <span style="">in </span>reading the complaint or
information to the defendant and delivering to him a copy thereof, including a
list of witnesses, and asking him whether he pleads guilty or not guilty as
charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"They had, in fact, argued
before the lower court, when the latter ordered their "arraignment"
on the supplemental charge for contempt, that the admission of said
supplemental charge would put them in double jeopardy inasmuch as the same,
according to them, constitutes an amendment of the motion for contempt of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> which can no longer be made since they had
already entered their plea of not guilty to the con­tempt motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The term "arraignment" as understood in the aforemen­tioned
section of our Rules of Criminal Procedure cannot, however, be applied in its
fullest sense to the case at bar since the appel­lants were not charged with
the commission of a crime, but sim­ply with not complying with what the court
had ordered them to do, which was to pay and satisfy the claim of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 3
of Rule 71, of course, requires that a person charged with con­tempt be given
an opportunity to be heard, and, as we said earlier, it is part of the court's
duty, as required by this provision of the rules, that the person charged be
informed of the charges against him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While nothing would prevent a court in a contempt case such as the one
at bar to follow strictly the provisions of <span style="">section </span>1, Rule 116 of the Rules of Court, nevertheless, for
purposes of Rule 71 <span style="">the court </span>adequately
fulfills its duty either by reading the complaint to the respondent or
furnishing him with a copy of the contempt charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have examined the records of this case at
length and are satisfied that the requirement of section 3 of Rule 71 was
properly accomplished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellants,
moreover, admit that they were arraigned, and it strikes us as an
incomprehensible case of self-contradiction that while they admit they were
arraigned, they charge the lower court with not apprising them of the nature of
the charges for contempt filed by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to their argument that they were not given the chance to
consult with a lawyer of their choice, it must be observed that their
appearance on June 30, 1962 was ordered by the court below way back on June 23,
1962 by an order which specifically required theca "to show cause why they
should not be dealt with in contempt of court for not complying with the
decision of this Court dated January 30, 1957." The appellants had,
therefore, sufficient time to procure a lawyer of their choice if they had so
desired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More­over, the law makes it the
duty of the provincial fiscal to represent the officials of a municipality in
cases in which they are charged in their official <span class="GramE">capacity,</span>
and, consequently, it cannot be said that they were deprived the services of
counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, all the appellants
pleaded not guilty to the contempt charges.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It cannot, therefore, be rationally argued that there was any actual or
legal harm that was inflicted on them as a result of the arraignment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lastly, in the hearings that subsequently followed,
the appellants never showed up with any lawyer of their own choice, but were
all represented by the provincial fiscal who was assisted by two of the
appellants who are attorneys-at-law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing opinion notwithstanding, this Court is aware that
provincial and municipal elections in this country are held every four years,
and that on account of the passage of time since the instant appeal was brought
to us, it is quite possible that as we now render this decision, a new and
different set of elective officials administers the affairs of the municipal
government of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, we affirm the judgment of conviction of <st1:date year="1962" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1962</st1:date> <u>en</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are
constrained nevertheless to re­mand this case to the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
in order that it may order the reception of evidence as to the present legal
capability of the ap­pellants to fulfill what the said court ordered to be
done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court is likewise
directed to order the inclusion of the in­cumbent new members of the municipal
council of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span>, plus the municipal mayor and
the municipal treasurer, with due notice to the provincial fiscal, as
party-respondents, in order that the said officials may be adequately afforded
a reasonable opportunity to effectuate with deliberate speed the lower court's
decision of January 30, 1957 in the mandamus case (civil case no. 1865).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to costs.</p>
