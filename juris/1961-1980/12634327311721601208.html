dated December 30, 1975 of the Workmen's Compensation Commission in WCC Case
No. 18094, entitled "Alberto Flores vs. Development Bank of the
Philippines", which reversed the award by the Hearing Officer in favor of
the petitioner on the ground that the latter's diseases — <u>diabetes</u> <u>mellitus</u>,
asthmatic bronchitis, <span class="SpellE">pneumonitis</span> and hypertension —
were not service-connected and therefore not compensable under the Workmen's
Compensation Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="19" month="5">May 19, 1976</st1:date>,

<p class="BODY">The records show that petitioner as of 1973 had been employed by
private respondent DBP continuously for 33 years since 1940.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1962, petitioner was first hospitalized at
the Saint Luke's Hospital, <span class="SpellE">España</span> Ext., <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
for abdominal pain and diabetes, but after treat­ment he was able to return to
work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1969, he was detailed in the
Collection and Acquired Assets Department of the bank to handle distressed and
bad accounts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, he was again
hospitalized at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Medical</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and Saint Luke's Hospital for various illnesses, such as asthmatic bronchitis, <span class="SpellE">pneumonitis</span>, diabetes mellitus and hypertension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due to poor health he was forced to retire
from the service on <st1:date year="1973" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1973</st1:date>,
before he could reach the compulsory retirement age.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="10" month="3">March 10, 1975</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a "Notice of Injury or Sickness and Claim for

Unit, <st1:place><st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
stating among others, that he contracted asthmatic bronchitis, <span class="SpellE">pneumonitis</span>, <u>diabetes</u> <u>mellitus</u> and
hypertension during the course of his employment, and/or which was aggravated
by his employment with the private respondent.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
This case, therefore, filed before <st1:date year="1975" day="31" month="3">March

Chief, Workmen's Compensation Unit, Regional Office No. VII, <st1:place><st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, issued an award in favor of
petitioner for failure of private respondent to controvert the claim.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1975</st1:date>,
private respondent filed a petition to reinstate its right to controvert the
claim and a motion to reconsider the Award dated <st1:date year="1975" day="3" month="7">July 3, 1975</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Finding the grounds therein to be meritorious, Mr. Correa granted the same and
accordingly set aside the Award, and required the parties to submit their
respective affidavits and/or documentary evidence to sustain their respective
allegations.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1975</st1:date>,
Mr. Correa rendered a decision awarding compensation benefits to the petitioner
on his findings that –</p>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>There are now divergence of medical opinion in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that the physician's opinion are
made depending to what parties they are for.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent's two physicians, Drs. <span class="SpellE">Abubakar</span> and
<span class="SpellE">Cañizares</span> both concluded that the nature of the claim­ant's
work could not cause or aggra­vate the various ailments he is suffering and on
the contrary, Dr. Castro, stated that the sickness could be aggravated by the
nature of his work, if not caused by said nature of his job.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But what we observed in this case, is the fact that the claimant
had spent the best of his life in the service of the Bank - for 34 long
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the nature of his job
does not require of him to exert physical efforts, it seems that the mental
stress brought about by the pressure of his job was indeed heavy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The place of his work in an air conditioned
office and then to outside his room is conducive to sudden change of
temperature (sic).</blockquote>

<blockquote>As a matter of fact, his Medical Report which show his various
consultations, treatments and follow-up treatments for various sickness
suffered indicates that he had been sick from February 13, 1963 and even after
he had retired, on August 31, 1973 so that before he could reach the retirement
age, he was constrained to retire, notwith­standing better benefits that would
be due him had he stayed a little longer, but his sickness prevented him from
working further.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Considering the length of his employment, the nature of his work
and the condition of the place of his job, convinces us that his sickness, if
not caused by the nature of such job, was aggravated by the nature of
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This condition according to the
Court, fulfills the criteria for the com­pensability of his sickness in
accordance with Section 2 of the Act.</blockquote>

the respondent is ordered:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1. To pay the claimant thru this Office, the sum of SIX THOUSAND
PESOS (P6,000) as compensation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. To this Office the sum of SIXTY ONE PESOS (P61.00) as
administrative fees, pursuant to Section 55 of the Act, as amended.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="24" month="10">October 24, 1975</st1:date>,
respondent DBP moved to have the award reconsidered,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">On December 30, 1975, respondent Commission — per Associate
Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> I. <span class="SpellE">Sagmit</span>,
Jr., concurred in by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Herminia</span> <span class="SpellE">Castelo</span>
Sotto, M.D., Associate (Medical) Commissioner — reversed the decision of the
Hearing Attorney and absolved private respondent from any liabi­lity under the
Workmen's Compensation Act, holding thus —</p>

<blockquote>Generally speaking, diabetes mellitus is not compensable <u>per</u>
<u>se</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a disease of the
pancreas, which by reason of the diminution or failure of the secretion of that
gland, results in the over supply of sugar in the blood which condition can be
remedied by the administration of insulin, which supplies the lack of the
necessary pancreatic secretions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, diabetes mellitus can be compensable in cases when it is
complicated with hypertension and asthmatic bronchitis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hypertension is not a disease, of itself as
it is but a mere symptom of a disease, therefore, not disabling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bronchitis is an inflammation of the
bronchial tubes or its secondary outlets.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It may be caused or aggravated by stress, heavy work, dust, if allergic,
pollen, and hairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Claimant being a
Special Assistant of the bank while suffering from asthmatic bronchitis can not
be subject to stress, heavy work, dust or pollen.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is ironic that air-conditioning one of the modern appliances
that facilitate and enhance office efficiency, should be tagged by the claimant
as the culprit that brought about his alleged illnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not that naive to believe this.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner now contends (1) that his illnesses were caused and/or
aggravated by the nature of his employment; (2) that his illnesses supervened
during the course of his employment with respondent DBP and therefore are presumed
to be compensable; and (3) that respondent DBP failed to overcome the legal
presumption of compensability of his illnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, respondent DBP maintains that hypertension
and the other respiratory ailments of petitioner are mere complications of the
primary disease of diabetes mellitus; that diabetes mellitus is an idiopathic
disease which is dependent in part on conditions inherent in the individual;
and that petitioner's illnesses could not have been directly caused nor
aggravated by the nature of his employment with respondent DBP.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing contentions, the determinative issue in this
petition for review which We consider as a Special Civil Action for <i>Certiorari</i>,
in order to expedite its resolution, is whether petitioner's illnesses, i.e., <u>diabetes</u>
<u>mellitus</u>, with asthmatic bronchitis, <span class="SpellE">pneumonitis</span>
and hypertension are compensable under the Workmen's Compensation Law which
issue, in turn, may be resolved through a determination of whether or not said
illnesses have been the direct cause of or were aggravated by his employment
with respondent Development Bank of the Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case is not now one of first impression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the very recent case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Sevilla</u></span><u> vs. Workmen's Compensation Commission</u>,
<u>et al</u>.,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
the First Division of this Court speaking thru Justice Cecilia <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> Palma, ruled in favor of compensability of <u>diabetes</u>
<u>mellitus</u> quoting the oft-cited case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Abana</u></span><u>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Quisumbing</span></u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
This Court held:</p>

<blockquote>While there is that possibility that factors other than the
employment of the claimant may also have contributed to the aggravation of his
illness, this is not a drawback to its compensability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, under the law, it is not required that
the employment be the sole factor in the growth, development or acceleration of
claimant's illness to entitle him to the benefits provided for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>It is enough that his employment had
contributed, even in a small degree, to the development of the disease</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been repeatedly held that under the
Workmen's Compensation Law, it is not necessary for a claimant to carry the
burden of proof to establish his case to the point of demonstration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>It is sufficient to show that the
hypothesis on which he bases his claim is probable</u>." (Emphasis
supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court further emphasized that the exact medical cause of the
illness of an employee is not significant, for, granted for argument's sake,
that the evidence of the claimant is insufficient to show a causal link between
the nature of his employment and his ailment, under the provisions of Section
44 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended, it is to be presumed that the
claimant's illnesses which supervened at the time of this employment, either
arose out of, or was at least aggravated by, said employment, and that with
this legal presumption, the burden of proof shifts to the employer, and the
employee is relieved of the burden to show causation.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that petitioner had several times been
hospitalized for the various illnesses complained of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was even forced to retire before he could
reach the compulsory age for retirement due to his disability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts of hospital confinement and early
retirement from the service give rise to legal presumption that petitioner's
illnesses arose out of or were at least aggravated by the employment and the
burden of proof (of non-work connection) shifts to the employer.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, respondent DBP relied mainly on the medical
opinion of Dr. Felipe H. <span class="SpellE">Abubakar</span>, physician in its
medical department, that petitioner's illness of <u>diabetes</u> <u>mellitus</u>
is one inherent in the individual and cannot be caused or aggravated by the
nature of his employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a posture
utterly fails in the face of the ruling that mere opinion of doctors cannot
prevail over the presumption established by law.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, denying benefits to petitioner who had spent the best
years of his life in the public service (for 33 years) and who was forced to
retire <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> at an early age due to illnesses
which supervened during the course of his employment, violates the social
justice mandate of the Constitution.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, the Workmen's Compensation Act — as a social legislation intended to
give relief to the workman in the event that he should die or sustain an injury
or sickness in the pursuit of his employment — should be liberally construed to
attain its laudable objective.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, this petition is GRANTED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the Workmen's Compensation
Commission is SET ASIDE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent
Development Bank of the Philippines is hereby ordered to pay petitioner the sum
of P6,000.00 as disability compensation, the further sum of P600.00 as
