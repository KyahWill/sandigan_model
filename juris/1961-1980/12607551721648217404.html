				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Leyte, Hon. 
Gaudencio Cloribel, presiding, finding Zacarias G. Tan, a Chinese citizen, 
qualified for admission as citizen of the Philippines.
<p>The facts necessary for the resolution of the appeal are briefly as follows: 
On May 31, 1956, Zacarias G. Tan filed a petition for naturalization, alleging, 
among other things, that he is an employee, in a business concern at Maasin, 
Leyte, since May 15, 1956, with a monthly salary of P120.00; that he was born on 
November 5, 1933 in Maasin and is a citizen of Nationalist China; that he is not 
suffering from any incurable contagious disease; that it is his intention in 
good faith to become a citizen of the Philippines and to renounce absolutely and 
forever all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or 
sovereignty, and particularly to the Republic of China; that he has all the 
qualifications and none of the disqualifications which bar him from becoming a 
citizen of the Philippines; that Miguel Orito, Sr. and Pedro M. Flores, both of 
Maasin, Leyte and Filipino citizens, are his witnesses. He prays that he be 
admitted a citizen of the Philippines. No declaration of intention was submitted 
by the petitioner with his application.</p>
<p>The Republic filed a motion to dismiss the petition for failure to allege 
therein such of petitioner's educational qualifications as would exempt him from 
filing a declaration of intention. Acting upon the motion the lower court on May 
8, 1957, ordered the amendment of the petition to include the necessary 
allegations. In compliance with the order, petitioner on May 20, 1957 filed his 
amended petition, incorporating in paragraph 4 thereof the phrase "and I have 
completed my elementary and secondary education in schools recognized by the 
Philippine Government". This amended petition was admitted by the lower court. A 
motion for reconsideration of the order, on the ground that a republication of 
the amended petition is necessary before the Court proceed with the trial, was 
denied, and so the hearing on the case was continued.</p>
<p>On November 18, 1957, the lower court, rendered the decision appealed from. 
In said decision, the court found that petitioner has completed his elementary 
education in the public schools duly recognized by the Government; that he is 
not afflicted with any contagious and incurable disease; that he will renounce 
allegiance and loyalty to the Republic of Nationalist China of which he is a 
citizen; that he is employed by Tan Yu Chin at the rate of P120.00 a month; that 
he possesses all the qualifications to become a citizen of the Philippines and 
none of the disqualifications. The court granted the petition and directed the 
Clerk of Court to forward "as soon as possible" copies of the decision and all 
pertinent papers in connection with the case to the Solicitor General, the 
National Bureau of Investigation, Philippine Constabulary, the Commissioner of 
Immigration and the Local Civil Registrar of Maasin, Leyte.</p>
<p>Against the above decision, the Solicitor General has prosecuted this appeal 
before this Court.</p>
<p>The first ground for assailing the correctness and validity of the decision 
is that the lower court had no jurisdiction to try the naturalization case 
because the amended petition was not republished. An examination of the record 
discloses that although the original petition for naturalization was published 
in the Official Gazette and in a newspaper of general circulation, the amended 
petition was not. The amendment, i. e., that applicant completed his elementary 
and secondary education in schools recognized by the Government, is a material 
fact which entitles petitioner to exemption from filing a declaration of 
intention. The fact alleged in the amendment should be made known to the public 
to enable the latter to furnish the material evidence and information to the 
Government regarding such qualification of the petitioner. Inasmuch as the 
amended petition was not published in accordance with law and Section 1 of 
Republic Act No. 530 provides that no petition for naturalization should be 
heard until after six months from the date of the last publication, the court 
below did not have jurisdiction to hear the amended petition and grant the same. 
(Kiat Chun Tan <i>vs</i>. Republic, 92 Phil., 987)</p>
<p>As to the merits of the petition, upon consideration of the evidence at the 
trial, we find no credible proof to sustain the lower court's finding that the 
petitioner has a lucrative profession or occupation. Except for the unsworn 
certification of Tan Yu Chin, petitioner's father, and petitioner's own 
testimony, no other evidence was presented to prove petitioner's alleged income 
of P120.00 a month. This Court is not bound by a mere statement of the 
petitioner. The certification issued by petitioner's own father is incompetent, 
not only because it is hearsay but also because it is not sworn to. Moreover, 
the fact that his own father is his employer and that he is still living with 
him makes doubtful the truth of petitioner's employment and gives rise to the 
suspicion that he was employed by his father, if it were true that he was, only 
for the purpose of this petition.</p>
<p>But even if we concede that petitioner has an occupation because of his 
supposed monthly income of P120.00, still his occupation cannot be considered as 
sufficiently lucrative because of the high cost of living now prevailing (Swee 
Din Tan <i>vs</i>. Republic 109 Phil., 287; Republic <i>vs</i>. Lim, L-3030, 
January 31, 1951; Pang Kok Hua <i>vs</i>. Republic, 91 Phil., 254). The second 
ground of the Republic in assailing the decision of the lower court is therefore 
meritorious.</p>
<p>The third ground of the Solicitor General's appeal is that the decision is 
contrary to the provisions of Republic Act No. 530, in that it allows the 
petitioner to be naturalized 30 days after the promulgation of the decision. 
This argument is also well founded. The dispositive part of the decision gives 
the impression that the petitioner can take his oath without waiting for the 
two-year period provided for by law because it directs the clerk of court to 
forward the papers to the different government offices as soon as possible. The 
decision is apparently objectionable on this ground.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing considerations, we find that the court below 
exceeded its jurisdiction in hearing the petition as amended; and that 
petitioner is not qualified for admission for naturalization because of lack of 
a lucrative occupation. The decision is hereby reversed and the petition 
dismissed, with costs against the petitioner.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla,
