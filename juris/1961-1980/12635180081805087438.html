<blockquote>"Against the decision of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> dismissing

<p class="BODY">After appropriate proceedings, the Court of Appeals found that
the last assignment of error is untenable - <span class="SpellE">Hermila</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> having admitted, during the trial, that the
properties in question had been acquired by Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span>
before their alleged marriage in 1935, and, hence, were his "exclusive
properties" but upheld the first, second, third and fourth assignments of
error, in view of which, without passing upon the fifth assignment of error
which was evidently unnecessary - it rendered the appealed decision in favor of
<span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Miraluna</span> and <span class="SpellE">Hermilina</span> <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span>, and their

was legally pre­sumed" to be married to Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span>,
and in granting her the corresponding <span class="SpellE">usufructuary</span>
right; 4) in declaring that <span class="SpellE">Sal­vacion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Miraluna</span> and <span class="SpellE">Hermilina</span> <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span> are "legitimate child­ren and legal heirs

adjudicating the properties in question to them"; 5) "in declaring
the deceased Antonio Serrano and his widow, herein petitioner, as purchasers in
bad faith"; and 6) "in not affirming the judgment of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>" dismissing the present
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues thus raised by Mrs. Serrano may be summed up as
follows: 1) whether the deceased Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span>
was legally married to <span class="SpellE">Hermila</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span>;
and 2) whether she and her aforementioned children may recover the properties
in dispute, des­pite the final orders issued in Special Cases Nos. 265, 730 and
947.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the first question, the Court of Appeals said:</p>

<blockquote>"On the question of whether or not <span class="SpellE">Hermila</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> was legally married to Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span>, the prepon­derance of evidence leans in favor
of the claim of said plain­tiff that she and the decedent (Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span>) were married on <st1:date year="1935" day="7" month="1">January 7, 1935</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Hermila</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena's</span> claim was
corroborated by Francisco <span class="SpellE">Sanga</span>, an assigner of Fran­cisco
<span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span> since the year 1925, who testified to the
effect that he was present during their wedding ceremony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such claim also finds strong support from the
documentary evidence Exhibits B, C and F. Exhibit B is a public instrument
executed by Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span> on <st1:date year="1941" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1941</st1:date>, in which he
represented himself as "<span class="SpellE">casado</span>" (married).
Al­though the name of the spouse is not mentioned in said instru­ment, it is
reasonable to conclude that he was referring to herein plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Hermila</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> since he was
then living with her and there is no claim that Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span>
was married to someone else other than <span class="SpellE">Hermila</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Exhibit C is an instrument executed by plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Hermila</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> sometime in
1947 designating defendant <span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span> Lim Serrano, to
whom Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span> left an indebtedness in
the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,734.64</span>, as <span class="SpellE">adminis­tratrix</span>
of the properties in litigation until full payment of said obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said instrument, which was executed be­fore
the institution of the present action, refers to plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Hermila</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> as '<span class="SpellE">Hermila</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Maguinsa­wan</span>.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Exhibit F is a public record, being a report dated <st1:date year="1951" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1951</st1:date>, submitted by <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> Papa, Chief of Cadastral Survey Party No. 20-D,
to the Director of Lands in connection with Homestead Application No. 175018 of
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said report states, among others, that '<u>the
applicant is married and the name of his wife is <span class="SpellE">Carmila</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span></u>' and that he has three children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the witness stand, <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span>
Papa confirmed the veracity of the contents of his report Exhibit F, declaring
that this was prepared on the basis of information given to him per­sonally by
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span>, then a homestead ap­plicant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Moreover, there is hardly any dispute that Fran­cisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span> and plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Hermila</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> had deported themselves as husband and wife
from 1935 until the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> death in 1942.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This circumstance gives rise to the
presumption that they had entered into a lawful contract of marriage (Rule 131,
Sec. 5 (bb), <span class="GramE">Rules</span> of Court).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We do not believe that the allegations in Exhibit 2 to the
effect that 'the deceased Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span> had
been living as husband and wife with <span class="SpellE">Hermila</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> with whom he had three children who are minors'
and that 'the said children are at present living with their natural mother <span class="SpellE">Hermila</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span>' are sufficient
either to rebut the above presumption of lawful marriage or to outweigh the
plaintiffs' evidence establishing the marriage to plain­tiff <span class="SpellE">Hermila</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> and the late
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span>. Exhibit 2 is an opposition
filed in Special Case No. 265 by <span class="SpellE">Anatolio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span> and Alberto Maxey, both uncles of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span>, to the petition of <span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span>
Lim Serrano for the issuance of letter of administration in her favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Hermila</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> was made to sign Exhibit 2 only to indicate her
conformity to the appointment of <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> <span class="SpellE">Anatolio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span> as
administrator of her husband's estate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is not shown that she signed Exhibit 2 with full knowledge or
understanding of the import of the allegations referred to above.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In view of the foregoing consideration, we hold that plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Hermila</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> was legally
married to the late Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span>. And it not
being disputed that plaintiffs <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Miraluna</span> <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Hermilina</span> <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span> are the children of <span class="SpellE">Hermila</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> with the deceased Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span>, we hereby declare them as legitimate children
of the said spouses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, they are
entitled to inherit the entire hereditary estate of their deceased estate,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a>
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span>, subject however to the <span class="SpellE">usufructuary</span> right of plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Hermila</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> as surviving spouse of said decedent
pursuant to Article 834 of the old Civil Code."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the Court of Appeals found that Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsa­wan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Hermila</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> were legally married and that <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Miraluna</span> and <span class="SpellE">Hermilina</span> <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span> are their legitimate children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These findings of fact, which, in the
language of the law, are "final,"<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a> cannot be disturbed by Us,
particularly because its premises - name­ly, the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Hermila</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span>, corroborated
by that of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Sanga</span>, and bolstered up by
Exhibits B, C and F, and by the established fact that Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Hermila</span> <span class="SpellE">Car­tagena</span> had deported themselves as husband and wife from
1935 to the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> death in 1942 - are borne out by
the record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the
aforementioned findings of the Court of Appeals are based upon substantial
evidence. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>What is more, such findings
are correct.</p>

<p class="BODY">In passing upon the second question, the Court of Appeals
expressed itself as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In our opinion, Special Cases Nos. 265, 730 and 947 do not
constitute a bar to the present action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We note that Special Case No. 265 was instituted by defendant <span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span> Lim Serrano in 1948 after she had been designated
by plain­tiff <span class="SpellE">Hermila</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span>
to administer the properties in liti­gation by virtue of the instrument Exhibit
C. As already stated above, Exhibit C refers to plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Hermila</span>
<span class="SpellE">Carta­gena</span> as the widow of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span> yet in the peti­tion filed by defendant <span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span> Lim Serrano in Special Case No. 265, no mention
is made about her and the other plaintiffs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petition only names defendant <span class="SpellE">Anuncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Dela­man</span> and Alberto Maxey as the relatives of the late
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, defendant <span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span>
Lim Serrano intentionally omitted to name the herein plaintiffs in her petition
in order to prevent them from intervening in said proceeding. And this leads
credence to the claim of plaintiffs that the intestate proceedings were had
through the fraudulent machinations of the defendants, resulting in the
adjudication of the properties of the late Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span>
in favor of defendants <span class="SpellE">Anuncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Delaman</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Gorgonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Delaman</span>, who
are not his legitimate heirs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is true that 'a final order of distribution of the estate
of a deceased person vests title in the <span class="SpellE">distributees</span>'
(Santos vs. Roman Catholic Bishop of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Caceres</span>, 46 Phil. 875). Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has
ruled that a party interested in probate proceedings may have a final
liquidation set aside when, as in this case, he is left out by reason of
circumstances beyond his control or through mistake or inadvertence not
imputable to his neg­ligence (Ramos vs. <span class="SpellE">Ortuzar</span>, 89
Phil. 720).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Special Cases Nos. 730
and 947 were instituted, plaintiffs <span class="SpellE">Salva­cion</span> <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Miraluna</span> <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Hermilina</span> <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span> were still minors, which fact, apart from the
fraudulent machinations employed by the defendants prevented them from
intervening in said proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to
them, therefore, the final orders of distribution issued therein are not
binding and conclusive and do not constitute a bar to the present action.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The pretension of the defendant spouses that they are
purchasers in good faith is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They know or ought to have known that plaintiffs are the legitimate
heirs of the late Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span> and,
therefore, are the lawful owners of the properties in litigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, they derived their possession of
said properties from plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Hermila</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> who, as <u>widow of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span></u><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> </span></span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a>
designated them as administrators thereof in 1947.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having thus purchased the properties from per­sons
who are not the lawful owners thereof, with know­ledge of this fact, they did
not acquire any valid title thereto."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We are fully in agreement with the foregoing views.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Al­though it is true that final orders in
probate cases partake of the nature of a judgment <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>rem</u></span>,
binding upon the whole world, it does not follow <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
that said final orders - like any other judgment or final order - cannot -
within the statutory period of prescrip­tion - be annulled upon the ground of
extrinsic fraud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is espe­cially
true when the subsequent action contests the title to the pro­perty adjudicated
in the probate proceedings and the adjudication has taken place - as it did in
Case No. 265 - without the participa­tion of the plaintiffs in the second case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, <span class="SpellE">Llanera</span> vs. <span class="GramE">Logos,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a> is squarely in point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That case referred to one <span class="SpellE">Gorgonio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Llanera</span> who had, on <st1:date year="1942" day="13" month="10">October 13, 1942</st1:date>, died single and intestate, leaving an
estate consisting of the proceeds of an insurance policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On petition of one <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ayque</span> <span class="SpellE">Altavano</span>, the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> found that the only
relatives of the deceased were his surviving brothers and sisters, and some
nephews and nieces, among whom said estate was ordered distributed, after which
the court ordered, on May 28, 1949, that the proceedings for the settlement of
the estate be deemed closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
appeared, however, that the deceased had had a brother who died on <st1:date year="1935" day="19" month="6">June 19, 1935</st1:date>, leaving a son, <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span>, born in Sta. Rosa, Laguna, on <st1:date year="1925" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1925</st1:date>, not included among those mentioned
above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eligio</span>
came to know, in 1953, of the death of his uncle, <span class="SpellE">Gorgonio</span>,
and the distribution of the proceeds of his insurance policy in the intestate
proceedings in <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So, on <st1:date year="1955" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1955</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Eligio</span> commenced, in the Court of First Instance of
Laguna, an action, to recover said proceeds of the insurance policy, against
those to whom the same had been adjudicated, but, the latter court dismissed
the case, upon the ground of im­proper venue and prescription of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal taken by <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span>,
We reversed the decision of the trial court, stating:</p>

<blockquote>"The flaw we find in this reasoning is that it presupposes
that the instant action is for the settle­ment of the estate of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Gorgonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Llanera</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such is not the case for his estate has
already been settled by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>
so much so that the proceedings were declared closed and ter­minated on <st1:date year="1949" day="28" month="5">May 28, 1949</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The present action is to recover the property
illegally adjudicated to the de­fendants on the ground of fraud and being an
action <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>personam</u></span> the same can be
filed either at the resi­dence of any of the defendants or at the residence of
the plaintiff, at the election of the latter (sec. 1, Rule 5). Plaintiff chose
to institute the action in the Court of First Instance of Laguna, where he is a
resi­dent, and so it is incorrect to say that the venue of the present case has
been improperly laid.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In holding that the present action has already pre­scribed,
the trial court also said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'<span class="GramE">The</span> claim of the plain­tiff, in the opinion of the, Court,
was filed out of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In summary
settlement of the estate of a deceased person, any heir deprived of his lawful
participation therein should file the corresponding petition in the court
having jurisdiction of the estate within two years after the settlement and
distribution thereof (sec. 4, Rule 74, Rules of Court). While the Rules of
Court do not prescribe any time limit during which an heir deprived of his
lawful parti­cipation in the estate of a person which was settled in a regular
testate or intestate proceeding, Article 1100 of the Civil Code, however,
provides that action for rescis­sion on account of 'lesion' shall prescribe
after four years from the time the partition was made. Considering that
judicial partition of the estate of <span class="SpellE">Gorgonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Llanera</span> was made on <st1:date year="1949" day="17" month="5">May
 17, 1949</st1:date>, hence plaintiff's action was com­menced beyond the
prescriptive period provided by law.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Again, we find this reasoning incorrect, for it overlooks the
fact that the present action is not for rescis­sion of a contract based on 'lesion'
but an action to recover property based on fraud which under our law may be
filed within a period of four years from the discovery of the fraud. (sec. 43
par. 3, Act 190). Since, as alleged in the complaint, fraud was discovered only
in 1953 and the action was brought in 1955, it is clear that plaintiff's ac­tion
has not yet prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is therefore
an error to dismiss the complaint based on prescription."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, from the moment of the death of Fran­cisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span> on February 22, 1942, ownership of his estate
became vested, by operation of law, in his children, <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Miraluna</span> and <span class="SpellE">Hermilina</span> <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span>, subject to the right of usu­fruct of his
widow, <span class="SpellE">Hermila</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span>,
with no other limitation than the obligation to pay the debt of the deceased in
favor of Mrs. Serrano, amounting to P1<span class="GramE">,734.64</span>. As such
creditor, the latter instituted, on <st1:date year="1948" day="5" month="8">August
 5, 1948</st1:date>, Special Case No. 265 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> and prayed that letters of administra­tion be issued
to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Although she had documentary
evidence in her possession indicating that the deceased had been survived by a
widow, <span class="SpellE">Hermila</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span>,
and their aforementioned minor children</u>, Mrs. Serrano did <u>not</u>
mention this fact to the probate court and instead alleged that the <u>only</u>
known relatives left by the deceased are <span class="SpellE">Anuncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Delaman</span>, Alberto Maxey and <span class="SpellE">Anatolio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ma­guinsawan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said omission and this allegation become more significant when we
consider the fact that the status of Mrs. Serrano as cre­ditor of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span> was one inherited by her from her father,
Silvestre E. Lim, to whom Antonio <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span>, father
of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span>, was originally indebted in
the sum of P1,052.42; that Antonio <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span> died
on June 17, 1941, in view of which, on August 11, 1941, his son, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsa­wan</span>, executed the deed Exhibit B, above referred
to, acknowledg­ing the debt of his deceased father, in favor of Silvestre E.
Lim, and promising to pay said debt; that Silvestre E. Lim expressed his
agreement thereto and, likewise, signed <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B.,
which states that Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span> is <span class="SpellE"><u>casado</u></span>; that, sometime after the latter's death, <span class="SpellE">Hermila</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> executed <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">C as "<span class="SpellE">Hermila</span>

Serrano as <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> of the properties in
question and delivered the same to her; and that, "<span class="SpellE">como</span>

Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span></u>," said <span class="SpellE">Hermila</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> declared that
the aforesaid sum had been received personally by "<u>mi <span class="SpellE">difunto</span> <span class="SpellE">esposo</span> Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span></u>."</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the very <span class="SpellE">muniments</span> of title of
Mrs. Serrano as cre­ditor of Francisco <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Maguinsawan</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> showed that he was married; that his wife was <span class="SpellE">Hermila</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span>; and that she
is his widow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, Mrs. Serrano must
have believed the same to be true, be­cause, otherwise, she would not have
secured an acknowledgment of her rights, as such creditor of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span>, and her designation as <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
of his properties, from "<span class="SpellE">Hermila</span> C. <span class="SpellE"><u>Vda</u></span><u>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span></u> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><u>como</u></span></st1:place></st1:city><u>

The failure of the petition, in Special Case No. 265, to name <span class="SpellE">Hermila</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> or to refer to
her, even if only as one who claims to be the wife or widow of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsa­wan</span>, and, hence, to have an interest in his
estate, must have been, therefore, deliberate on the part of Mrs. Serrano, for
the purpose of withholding said facts from the Court and of forestalling
service of notice of the proceedings to <span class="SpellE">Hermila</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> and her partici­pation or intervention
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="GramE">indicia
of such purpose is</span> fur­ther bolstered up by the allegation in the
petition to the effect that <span class="SpellE">Anuncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Delaman</span>, Alberto Maxey and <span class="SpellE">Anatolio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span> "are the relatives of the
deceased."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is interesting to
note that Mrs. Serrano did not dare testify in the case at bar, to attest that
such was her "best knowledge, information and belief" as alleged in
said petition - as if she had no information about <span class="SpellE">Hermila</span>
<span class="SpellE">Carta­gena</span> and her children.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 4, 1950, <span class="SpellE">Bruna</span> <span class="SpellE">Dilag</span> and Joaquin <span class="SpellE">Dilag</span> inter­vened

deceased; that she is his only heir; and that she had died intestate in
1943.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On November 6, 1954, counsel for <span class="SpellE">Bruna</span> <span class="SpellE">Dilag</span> filed with the Court
of First In­stance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, Special Case No. 730,
for the settlement of the Intestate Estate of <span class="SpellE">Ceferina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dilag</span> and the <u>appointment of Antonio Serrano as
administrator thereof</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two (2) days
later, or on Nov­ember 8, 1954, he was appointed as such.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Based upon a stipulation of facts submitted
in Case No. 265, <u>in which <span class="SpellE">Hermila</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> and her minor children were neither mentioned nor
represented</u>, said court issued, on the same date, an order declaring <span class="SpellE">Ceferina</span> <span class="SpellE">Dilag</span> the sole heir of
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maguinsawan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon thereafter, or on January 21, 1958, <span class="SpellE">Bruna</span> <span class="SpellE">Dilag</span> was declared, in
Special Case No. 730, the sole heir of <span class="SpellE">Ceferina</span> <span class="SpellE">Dilag</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">A little over two (2) weeks prior thereto, or on January 5, 1958,
<span class="SpellE">Bruna</span> <span class="SpellE">Dilag</span> had, however,
died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On January 27, 1958, a petition

to be the only heirs of <span class="SpellE">Bruna</span> <span class="SpellE">Dilag</span>,
for the settlement of her intestate estate. In said case, <span class="SpellE">Anuncio</span>

submitted a deed of extrajudicial partition among themselves, which was
approved by the court on October 1, 1958.<span style="">&nbsp;

<span class="SpellE">Dilag</span> and the <span class="SpellE">Delaman's</span>
were repre­sented in Cases Nos. 730 and 947 by the same lawyers for Mrs.
Serrano in Case No. 265, and that the service of said lawyers in Case No. 947
was engaged by Mrs. Serrano.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing facts, We are satisfied that the
