<p class="BODY">The following facts are not in dispute:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In a complaint filed on

sale, in favor of defendants <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Broce</span> and Esmeralda <span class="SpellE">Broce</span>, and
the return by the latter, of a parcel of land described as Lot No. 228-D of the

Carlos, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental, with an area of 354,250

<blockquote>8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the questions before
this Court are as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">(a) Which should prevail, the Extra-judicial Settlement of 1930 or
that of 1951?</p>

<p class="2Q">(b) If the 1930 Extra-Judicial Settlement is upheld, then the buyer
Esmeralda <span class="SpellE">Broce</span> bought on <st1:date year="1962" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1962</st1:date>, Lot No. 228-D, as described
in the 1930 document.</p>

<p class="2Q">(c) If the 1951 Extra-judicial Settlement is upheld, then <span class="SpellE">Fortunata</span> <span class="SpellE">Oyod</span> owned an undivided
share in Lot No. 288; and what Esmeralda <span class="SpellE">Broce</span>
acquired in 1962 is not Lot No. 228-D specifically, but an undivided share of
1/4 in <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 228.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due hearing, the court rendered judgment on July 11, 1964,
upholding the due execution and validity of the 1930 extrajudicial partition by
the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Severo</span> <span class="SpellE">Oyod</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacia</span> <span class="SpellE">Mahinay</span> of
Lot No. 228, and of the sale in 1962 to Esmeralda <span class="SpellE">Broce</span>
of Lot No. 22 8-D by the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Fortunata</span> <span class="SpellE">Oyod</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, finding
that the <span style="">heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Severo</span> <span class="SpellE">Oyod</span> contracted an
obligation with the Philippine National Bank prior to the sale of lot No.
228-D, to pay the outstanding taxes on the entire </span><st1:place><span style="">Lot</span></st1:place><span style=""> 228, the court ruled that lien was thus
created and attached to the land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Esmeralda <span class="SpellE">Broce</span> was then ordered to pay to
plaintiffs the sum of P780.00 or 1/5 of the said obligation, as share of Lot
228-D.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Both parties appealed; plaintiffs excepting from the ruling that
sustains the validity of the extrajudicial partition of 1930 and the order to
Esmeralda <span class="SpellE">Broce</span> to pay only the sum of P780.00
instead of P2<span class="GramE">,392.00</span>; whereas, defendant Esmeralda <span class="SpellE">Broce</span> prays for her total exculpation from any liability.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is evident from the issues formulated and litigated in the
court below, which are again being raised in this appeal by the
plaintiffs-appellants, that the controversy lies on the effect of the execution
of the extrajudicial partition of 1951, which was duly recorded in the Registry
of Deeds, upon the 1930 agreement which, although embodied in a public
instrument, was admittedly not registered.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
For, if there was a valid partition of Lot No. 228 (one of the properties
included in the 1930 agreement) and ownership of the portions respectively
assigned to the heirs <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> had indeed passed to
the latter, then the sale of Lot No. 228-D to Esmeralda <span class="SpellE">Broce</span>
in 1962 would also be valid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the
other hand, if there was proper cancellation and substitution of that 1930
settlement, by the extrajudicial partition of 1951, wherein the heirs agreed
to, form a co-ownership of the whole Lot 228, then what could be <span style="">acquired by defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Esmeralda <span class="SpellE">Broce</span> would only be an undetermined 1/4
share of the same lot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The issue - of the effect
of an unregistered <span class="SpellE">extrajusdicial</span> <span class="SpellE">settiernent</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> among the heirs of the estate of a deceased
person - is not new.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was previously
resolved by this Court in favor of the validity of that partition in the case
of <u>Hernandez vs. <span class="SpellE">Andal</span></u>, 78 Phil. 196, </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">this wise:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Is section 1 of Rule 74 <u>constitutive</u> and not merely <u>evidential</u>
of partition?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, is writing
the act that confers legal validity upon the agreement?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are no indications in the phraseology
of this rule which justify an affirmative answer to these ques­tions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted that where the law intends <span class="GramE">a writing</span> or other formality to be the essential requisite <span style="">to the validity of the transaction, it says
so in clear and unequivocal terms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
the statute of frauds as originally enacted in England and as enacted in some
of the states, uses the words 'utterly void' with refer­ence to certain
transactions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the terms of such
statute transactions required to be in writing are absolutely void and not
merely <span class="SpellE">voidable</span> if not made in the manner
indicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again article 633 of the
Civil Code </span><span style="">says </span><span style="">that donation may be <u>valid</u> only when
made in a public document.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 146
of the Mortgage Law makes </span><span style="">known
its </span><span style="">intention to have the
execution of a public instrument and its registration </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the registry indispensable to the validity of the contract by using this
phrase:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'in order that voluntary
mortgages may be legally created in a valid manner.' Article 1765 of the Civil
Code also employs for the same purpose similar expression with reference to the
execution of a public document:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'in
order that mortgage may be validly constituted,' And with </span>respect <span style="">to the formalities of last wills and
testaments, section 618 of Act No. 190 makes this emphatic statement:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'No will shall be valid to pass upon any
estate real or personal nor charge or affect the same, unless it be written
etc.' Other examples might be mentioned.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Section I of Rule 74 contains no such express or <span class="GramE">clear</span> declaration that the required public instrument is to
be constitutive of a contract of partition or an inherent element of its
effectiveness as between the <span style="">parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this Court had </span>no apparent <span style="">reason, in adopting this rule, to make the
efficacy of a partition as between the parties dependent on the execution of a
public instrument and its registration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span>
(78 Phil. 204-205).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Touching
on the purpose of the registration-requirement in the said, provision, this
Court ruled in the same case:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The requirement that a partition be put in a public document
and registered has, in our opinion, for its purpose the protection of creditors
and at the same time the protection of the heirs themselves against tardy
claims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Note that the last sentence of
the sec­tion speaks of debts and creditors.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The object of registration is to serve as constructive notice, and this
means notice to others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must follow
that the <span style="">int</span>rinsic validity of a
partition not executed with the prescribed formalities does not come into play
when, as in this case, there are no creditors or the rights of <span style="">the creditors are not affected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No rights of creditors being involved, it is
competent for the heirs of an estate to enter into an agreement for
distribution in a manner and upon a plan different from those provided by
law." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><u>Cas</u></span>. <u>cit</u>.,
pp. 208-209).</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is nothing here on record to indicate that when the first partition
agreement was entered into, there existed any claim against the estate of the
deceased or that prejudice was thereby caused to any third party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that a voluntary division of the
estate of the deceased, by the heirs among themselves, is conclusive<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and confers upon said heirs exclusive ownership of the respective portions
assigned to them,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
the extrajudicial partition made by the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Severo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Oyod</span> in 1930 could not have been<span style=""> </span>cancelled or substituted by the
execution, by some of these heirs, of another extrajudicial settlement of the
same estate in 1951 even if the latter document be registered, particularly
since one of the co-signers of the 1930 agreement, Eugenia <span class="SpellE">Oyod</span>,
had died on January 8, 1950 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D) <span class="GramE"><span style="">before</span></span><span style=""> the second extrajudicial settlement was </span>made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court, therefore, committed no
error in holding that the sale to defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Esmeralda <span class="SpellE">Broce</span> of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 228-D
in 1962 did not suffer from any infirmity.</p>

<p class="BODY">A second reason is that it is not shown that the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Broce</span> had notice or
knowledge of the second partition of 1951.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As <span style="">the </span><span style="">1930 </span><span style="">partition was operative to vest title in <span class="SpellE">Fortunata</span> <span class="SpellE">Oyod</span> to the lot
allotted to her even if the agreement was unrecorded, Brace had reason to rely
thereon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, there is no basis to the lower court's order to
defendant-appellant, Esmeralda <span class="SpellE">Broce</span>, to assume a
proportionate share of the indebtedness contracted by the surviving heirs of
the deceased <span class="SpellE">Severo</span> <span class="SpellE">Oyod</span>
with the Philippine National Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
fact alone that the property in dispute originally formed part of <span style="">the estate of said deceased person and that
the obligation was contracted prior to its purchase by herein
defendant-appellant, to pay the taxes due on the estate of the deceased, does
not render the vendee answerable <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As pronounced by this Court in the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Habaña</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Imbo</span></u>, <u>supra</u>
if there is really need to sell properties belonging to an heir to pay the
debts of the estate, there should first be exhaustion of other properties still
owned by the said heir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present
case, there is no proof that the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Fortunata</span> <span class="SpellE">Oyod</span> received from the estate of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Severo</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Oyod</span> no property other than </span><st1:place><span style="">Lot</span></st1:place><span style=""> 228-D.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, it does not even appear that this obligation to the
Philippine National Bank was duly constituted as an encumbrance on the whole </span><st1:place><span style="">Lot</span></st1:place><span style=""> 228.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As mere vendee of </span><st1:place><span style="">Lot</span></st1:place><span style=""> 228-D,
defendant-appellant cannot be required to share in the pay­ment of an
obligation contracted by the heirs of the estate, of which she is not one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
