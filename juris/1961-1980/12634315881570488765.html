				<BR><STRONG>AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Ruby Socorro P. <span class="SpellE">Firman</span> of <span class="SpellE">Malita</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> in her verified complaint dated <st1:date year="1974" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1974</st1:date> charged respondent lawyer with
immorality for allegedly having carnal relations with her, when she was below
eighteen years of age, although he was a married man.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, in a handwritten letter dated December 2, 1974,
addressed and airmailed to the Chief Justice, Ruby revealed that she signed the
complaint due to the pressure exerted by her father with the assistance of
lawyer <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> <span class="SpellE">Parcasio</span>
and Judge <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> Fuentes and that the contents of her
complaint were false, being "the product of the imaginations" of her
parents and lawyer <span class="SpellE">Parcasio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She asked that the case be dropped.</p>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding that letter, Ruby and her parents filed a
verified petition dated <st1:date year="1975" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1975</st1:date>
for respondent's disbarment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
alleged therein that the respondent, a relative and family lawyer of the
complainants, seduced Ruby and cohabited with her in <span class="SpellE">Digos</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Davao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent in his answer denied the charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was referred to the Solicitor
General who asked the provincial fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> to receive the evidence and submit the corresponding
report.</p>

<p class="BODY">Alberto <span class="SpellE">Firman</span>, Ruby's father (he is a
high school graduate), in his affidavit of March 24, 1976, declared that his
daughter is already married to another man and that due to the persistent
entreaties of the respondent, he (<span class="SpellE">Firman</span>) decided to
withdraw and drop the complaint for disbarment and that he was expressing his
appreciation for the attention given by this Court to his complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing on the same date (in respondent's absence), the
fiscal took <span class="SpellE">Firman's</span> sworn testimony in the presence
of his wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He reaffirmed the contents
of his affidavit of desistance and further alleged that his wife and daughter
were in conformity with the withdrawal of the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had mulled over the matter for sometime
and they had decided to adopt a "forgive and forget" attitude.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the subsequent hearing before the investigating fiscal on <st1:date year="1976" day="28" month="4">April 28, 1976</st1:date>, the respondent (in
the absence of the complainants) took exception to certain allegations in
Alberto <span class="SpellE">Firman's</span> affidavit of desistance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent insisted that the case be
dismissed on the basis of Ruby's handwritten letter of <st1:date year="1974" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1974</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General recommends that the case be dismissed
because the desistance of the complainants had rendered it difficult to
investigate the charge and because there is no evidence to substantiate it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finding that recommendation to be well-taken, this case is
dismissed and considered closed.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
