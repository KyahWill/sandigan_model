				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In 1946, "Limaco &amp; De Guzman Commercial Co., Inc., hereinafter referred 
to as defendant-principal, was engaged in the importation of cigarettes. To 
guarantee payment of the revenue taxes due to the government plaintiff, the 
defendant-principal and the Visayan Surety &amp; Insurance Corporation, as 
surety, hereinafter referred to as defendant-surety, executed two importers 
Bonds (Exhs. B &amp; CW), dated June 12, 1946 and June 29, 1946, in the amounts 
of P1,000.00 and P2,000.00, respectively, holding themselves jointly and 
severally liable to pay the said sums in favor of plaintiff, under the terms and 
conditions specified therein. On June 27, 1946, defendant-principal filed with 
the Bureau of Customs, entry papers covering shipment of 2 million "Spud" 
cigarettes it had imported from New York, U. S. on board the "SS Steel Ranger." 
The specific tax due thereon amounted tc P6,000.00, at the rate of P3.00 / 
thousand (Sec. 13 [b] 2 of the Tax Code).
<p>On July 15, 1946, defendant-principal thru its broker J. O. Hiponia, paid to 
the Bureau of Customs, the sum of P1,000.00 in cash, and P5,000.00 in PNB Check 
No. 601580-K, on account of said tax. The cigarettes were released to 
defendant-principal. The said check, however, was subsequently dishonored by the 
bank, for lacic of funds, and returned to the maker.</p>
<p>On June 17, 1948, the Collector of Internal Revenue, demanded from 
defendant-principal, the payment of the aforesaid sum of P5,000.00 as deficiency 
specific tax due on the imported cigarettes (Exh. D). The said amount remained 
unpaid, notwithstanding repeated demands upon the defendant-principal and the 
defendant-surety (Exh. E, G, H, I and J). The Solicitor General on July 19, 
1950, wrote to defendant-surety (Exh. 1), demanding payment within 10 days from 
receipt of the letter. In its reply, dated July 27, 1950, the defendant-surety 
requested for a copy of the statement showing the exact amount as well as the 
nature of the alleged specific taxes and that the complaiint the Solicitor 
General "intended to institute against us (defendants) be temporarily suspended" 
(Exh. 2). On April 15, 1951, defendant-principal requested that action on the 
case be deferred as it was "willing to make representations with vthe Collector 
of Internal Revenue with a view to settling the matter amicably" (Exh. K). On 
April 25, 1951, the defendant-principal made a similar request to the Solicitor 
General (Exh. L), on the same ground.</p>
<p>On February 18, 1953, plaintiff filed a complaint with the CFI of Manila 
(Civil Case No. 18859), praying for the forfeiture of the bonds and payment of 
the sum of P5,000.00, plus interest. On March 7, 1953, the defendant-surety 
filed its answer, disclaiming its liability under the bonds, contesting the 
validity of the assessment and invoking the defense of estoppel and 
prescription. On February 5, 1954, the defendant-principal likewise filed its 
answer, contesting the validity of the tax assessment, on the ground of 
prescription.</p>
<p>On January 18, 1955, Hiponia paid P2,000.00 on account of the deficiency tax 
of P5,000.00.</p>
<p>On February 10, 1955, the defendant-surety, was granted by the CFI leave to 
file an amended answer by adding the defense of lack of cause of action. 
However, the order granting leave to amend was vacated, in view of the 
allegation that the case involved a disputed assessment of internal revenue 
taxes and the case was remanded on March 22, 1955, to the Court of Tax Appeals 
(Sec. 22, R. A. No. 1125). On March 17, 1955, the defendant-surety paid the 
outstanding balance of P3,000.00, in order that it might be removed from the 
black list of surety companies banned by the Collector of Internal Revenue.</p>
<p>The defendant-surety was erased from the black-list and again allowed to file 
bonds in the B.I.R.</p>
<p>On November 10, 1955, the defendant-surety after reviving the "motion for 
leave to amend answer" in the Tax Court, filed a second amended answer with 
counterclaim, seeking the return or refund of the F3,000.00 it had previously 
paid. On November 15, 1955, plaintiff-appellant filed a motion to dismiss the 
case, on the ground that "The specific tax in question in the above entitled 
case has been paid to the satisfaction of the plaintiff." The Tax Court, 
however, denied the motion and instead ordered the plaintiff to answer the 
counterclaim.</p>
<p>After due hearing, the Tax Court rendered a decision, the dispositive portion 
of which reads—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"WHEREFORE, the action of plaintiff for the forfeiture of importer's bond is 
hereby dismissed and the counterclaim of defendant being legally justified, the 
Collector of Internal Revenue should be, as he is hereby ordered to refund to 
the Visayan Surety and Insurance Corporation the sum of P3,000.00 <i>with 
interest</i> from date of payment. Without pronouncement as to 
costs."</p></blockquote>
<p>In its appeal to this Court, plaintiff-appellant submits (1) that the 
counterclaim set up by defendant-surety, being for the recovery of taxes 
previously paid, should comply with the requisites of section 306 of the Tax 
Code; (2) That plaintiff-appellant's action has not been barred by the statute 
of limitations; (3) That the payment effected by defendant-surety was voluntary 
and, therefore,, constituted a waiver of prescription or of the statute of 
limitations and (4) That the amount of P3,000.00 was legally or correctly 
collected by the government.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the provisions of section 306 of the Tax Code, a taxpayer must 
first file "a claim for refund or tax credit with the Collector of Internal 
Revenue", before maintaining a suit or proceeding in any court for the recovery 
of any internal revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally 
assessed or collected. This provision is mandatory and a condition precedent to 
the prosecution of a suit for the recovery of taxes said to have been 
erroneously or illegally collected, the non-compliance of which bars the action, 
nay, it subjects the claim to dismissal, for lack of cause of action (Johnston 
Lumber Co. Inc. vs. CTA &amp; Coll. Int. Rev. 101 Phil., 151.) No evidence 
whatsoever was presented to show that the defendant-surety filed a claim for 
refund or tax credit of the amount of P3,000.00 paid by it on March 17, 1955, 
before it filed on November 10, 1955, its second amended answer wherein the 
counterclaim in question was pleaded. There is not even an allegation in the 
counterclaim to that effect. The letter dated March 14, 1955 (Exh. 6 and 6A) can 
not be considered as claim for refund, because it merely informed the Collector 
of Internal Revenue that it was tendering payment of the sum of P3,000.00 so 
that defendant-surety might be removed from the black list. The law governing an 
action -for the recovery of taxes is section 306 of the Tax Code, whether or not 
the recovery is by a counterclaim or a separate action. The counterclaim should 
have been dismissed, for lack of cause of action.</p>
<p>Plaintiff-appellant's action has not prescribed. Under Sec. 332 (c) of the 
Tax Code, the collection of the tax by summary methods or by judicial action 
shall be effected within five (5) years after the assessment of the tax. In the 
case at bar, the Tax Court observed that "the taxes in question must have been 
assessed at the earliest on June 27, 1946," when a return (Importer's 
declaration) was filed or at the latest on July 15, 1946, when payment was made 
on the basis of the said importer's declaration, and concluded that "the instant 
action having been instituted in the Court of First Instance only on February 8, 
1953, it becomes apparent that the right to collect the tax in question has been 
barred by the statute of limitations". While the findings of the Tax Court has 
the character of finality, it appears, however, that the Tax Court in this 
particular case was merely dwelling in the realms of surmises and speculations 
when it pronounced that "the taxes in question <i>must have been assessed</i> at 
the earliest on June 27, 1946 when a return (importer's declaration) was filed 
or at the latest on July 15, 1946, when payment was made on the basis of the 
said importer's declaration". Factually, the assessment in question was not 
issued on July 14, 1946, but on June 17, 1948. When the Collector of Internal 
Revenue received information from the Bureau of Customs that the said sum of 
P5,000.00 was not paid (for lack of funds), he immediately issued a letter dated 
June 17, 1948 (Exh. D), addressed to the defendant-principal assessing and 
demanding from the latter the payment of the said P5,000.00. It was then that 
the unpaid specific tax of P5,000.00 was deemed to have been assessed. Assess 
means to impose a tax; to charge with a tax; to declare a tax to be payable; to 
apportion a tax to be paid or contributed, to fix a rate; to fix or settle a sum 
to be paid by way of tax; to set; fix or charge a certain sum to each tax-payer; 
to settle determine or fix the amount of tax to be paid (84 C. J. S. pp. 
749-750). In the case at bar, when the tax was paid in cash and in check on July 
15, 1946, the plaintiff-appellant had a right to rely, as it, in fact, relied 
that said payment fully settled the specific taxes due on the imported 
cigarettes. The cigarettes would not have been released, had plaintiff-appellant 
been aware that the payment did not fully settle the said specific taxes. It can 
not be said that July 15, 1946 (the date of payment), was the date of assessment 
from which the period of collection should start. July 15, 1946 was simply the 
date of tender of payment. The right to collect the amount of P5,000.00 began 
only after the P5,000.00—rubber-check was dishonored. The action to assess and 
collect the unpaid tax commenced anew on <i>June 14, 1948</i>, when a letter of 
demand for the amount of said rubber-check had been sent to the 
defendant-principal (Exh. D). This letter should be deemed to be an assessment 
because it declared and fixed a tax to be payable against, the party liable 
thereto, and demanded the settlement thereof. Judicial action having been 
instituted on February 18, 1953, the five year period for collection had not 
then elapsed.</p>
<p>Even assuming that July 15, 1946 is the date of assessment, still the action 
to collect is not barred by the statute of limitations, because the statute was 
suspended. When the rubber-check was dishonored and demand letters were sent by 
the plaintiff-appellant and the Solicitor General to defendant-principal (Exhs. 
D, E, G, H, I and "1", the last being an extrajudicial demand for payment of 
P3,000.00 on July 19, 1950), the defendant-principal wrote two letters to the 
Solicitor General on April 15 and 25, 1951, respectively, requesting for the 
deferment of the judicial action to be taken by the latter towards the 
collection of the obligation, so that the former could make representations with 
the Collector to settle the matter amicably (Exhs. K and L). This being the 
case, the prescriptive period to effect the collection of the tax which 
allegedly commenced on July 15, 1946, was interrupted, "The prescription of 
actions is interrupted when they are filed before the court, when there is a 
written extrajudicial demand by the creditors and when there is any written 
acknowledgment of the debt by the debtor" (Art. 1155, New Civil Code). The 
defendants-appellees, under the circumstances, should be the last to claim 
prescription. As held in the case of Lattimore vs. U. S. 12 F. Supp. 895, 16 
AFTR 1240, "Taxpayers seeking to recover overpayment in income tax could not 
claim that collection by Commissioner was barred by limitations where procedure 
carried out which resulted in postponement of collection was that requested by 
taxpayers". Having acknowledged the debt in writing in April 1951, and the 
complaint was filed in 1953, prescription had not set in. The full time for the 
prescription must be reckoned from the cessation of the interruption (Segucio 
vs. Bulos, G. R. Nos. L-17608-09, July 31, 1962, and cases cited therein). Had 
it not been for the filing of the complaint in 1953, the interruption would have 
ceased in April 1956.</p>
<p>Moreover, it should be recalled that the present action is essentially one to 
collect on the bonds which is an action separate and distinct from an action to 
collect taxes. Article 1144 of the Civil Code which provides that actions upon a 
written contract, must be brought within ten (10) years from the time the right 
of action accrues, finds a fitting application (Rep. of the Phil. vs. Xavier Gun 
Trading, et al. G. R. No. L-17325; Rep. of the Phil. vs. Dorego, et al., G. R. 
No. L-16594, both promulgated April 26, 1962). It appearing that said bonds were 
executed on June 12 and 29, 1946, the right of the government to collect the 
amounts covered thereby, prescribed on June 12 and 29, 1956. The complaint was 
filed on February 18, 1953.</p>
<p>The last argument advanced by defendant-surety is that the sum of P3,000.00 
was illegally or erroneously collected and payment thereof was involuntary, 
having been allegedly made under duress. The sum of P3,000.00 sought to be 
refunded in the counter-claim was covered by the surety bond in the total sum of 
P3,000.00. The total sum of P6,000.00 for specific taxes were just and 
demandable, for it represented the tax for 2 million "Spud" cigarettes, at the 
rate of P3.00/thousand (Sec. 13 [b] 2, of the Tax Code) and the subsequent 
payment in cash in the same sum of P3,000.00, in order to remove the name of the 
defendant-surety from the black list, can not be considered involuntary. A 
threat to enforce one's claim through competent authority, if the claim is just 
or legal, does not vitiate consent (Art. 1335, Civil Code). Having been made by 
the defendant-surety to preserve its credit and enable it to carry on its 
business with the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the said payment can not be 
considered involuntary (Harvey vs. Gerard Nat. Bank, 119 Pa. 212, 13 A. 202; 48 
C. J. 751).</p>
<p>In view hereof, the decision appealed from is reversed and the 
plaintiff-appellant is absolved from refunding the amount of P3,000.00 to 
appellee defendant-surety, with costs against the latter.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, Dizon, 
Regala,</i> and <i>Makalintal, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
