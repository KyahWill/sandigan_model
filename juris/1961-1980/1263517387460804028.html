				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by <i style="">certiorari</i>
from the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 35429-R, Geronimo <span class="SpellE">Caguiat</span> et al., Petitioners, vs. Hon. Guillermo E. Torres
and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Caguiat</span>, Respondents, which
"denied and dismissed" the petition for <i style="">certiorari</i> filed by herein petitioners-appellants for the purpose
of annulling and setting aside the order of above-mentioned judge of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Rizal</span></span><span style=""> in </span>Civil Case No. 8050 of said court
between said appellants and private <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> - respondent
herein, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Caguiat</span> granting the latter's
motion to enjoin the taking of said <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
deposition, by way of discovery, after issues had already been joined by the
filing of said <span class="SpellE">appel­lee's</span> answer as defendant in
said civil case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The controlling facts as found by the Court of Appeals are as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Petitioners are plaintiffs <span style="">in </span>Civil Case No. <span style="">8050 of </span>the Court of First Instance of
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Branch VIII, presided over by <span style="">res­</span>pondent
Judge, while respondent Francisco <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Caguiat</span></span><span style=""> is the
defendant therein.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>On August 18, 1964, after defendant had filed his answer with
counterclaim, and the plaintiffs, their reply to defendant's answer (See
Annexes A, B, C, D), the herein petitio­ners served on respondent <span class="SpellE">Caguiat</span> a notice to take his deposition (Annex E).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="26" month="8">August
 26, 1964</st1:date> respondent <span class="SpellE">Caguiat</span> filed with
the lower court an urgent motion to prevent the taking of the deposition or to
restrict <span class="GramE">its scope (Annex F), which urgent motion</span> the
pe­titioners opposed (Annex G).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
29th of the same month the respondent Judge issued an order (Annex F) to hold
in abeyance the re­solution of his co-respondent's urgent motion until after
the pre-trial set for September 3, 1963 which was, however, reset for October
2, 1964 to give the parties time to consider an amicable settlement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties however failed to arrive at an
amicable settlement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On October 3, 1964 herein petitioners again served on respondent <span class="SpellE">Caguiat</span> a second notice for the taking of his deposition
upon oral examination (Annexes K and L), to prevent which, the latter filed an
urgent motion on the 14th of the same month (Annex M).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Peti­tioners opposed respondent <span class="SpellE">Caguiat's</span> urgent motion (Annex N).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Resolving the urgent motion and the
opposition thereto, the respondent Judge, on the 17th, granted his co-respondent's
urgent motion and ordered the petitioners to refrain from taking the
contemplated deposition (Annex O).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner's motion for reconsidera­tion (Annex P) was denied after its
hearing on <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1964</st1:date>
(Annex S).</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">x<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The petitioners’ avowed purpose in secur­ing the deposition of
respondent <span class="SpellE">Caguiat</span> is to get the latter to lay his
cards on the table and/or to simplify or abbreviate the proceed­ings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Caguiat</span>,
on the other hand, affirms that he has already revealed practically his entire
defense, even to the extent of naming his witnesses, during the pre-trial, so
that the necessity of a deposition has been obviated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, according to respondent <span class="SpellE">Caguiat</span>, <span style="">he had </span>expressed
willingness to enter into a stipulation of facts, but apparently the
petitioners did not want to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We note
that the petitioners <span style="">have not denied
respondent <span class="SpellE">Caguiat's</span> assertion that he had already
disclosed all his evidence during the pre-trial, neither have they belied that
personal animosities bet­ween them and the same respondent which went
unfettered during the pre-trial, might endanger the peaceful and objective
conduct of the deposition upon oral examination.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is significant that
the respondent Judge deferred the resolution of his co-respondent's first
motion to prevent the taking of his deposition or to restrict its scope, until
after the pre-trial (See Annex H).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Likewise, the second urgent motion of the same tenor (Annex M) and the
petitioners' opposition thereto (Annex N) were resolved only after the
completion of the pre-trial and in fact after the parties' </span><u><span style="">joint</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">petition for hearing on
the merits had been granted (Annex </span><span style="">J).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">The fact that the <span class="SpellE">con­troverted</span>
orders were issued only after the pre-trial supports respondent <span class="SpellE">Caguiat's</span> affirmation that he had revealed his defense
during the trial, and that the respondent judge had satisfied himself that
after such revelation there was no more need to take the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
deposition upon oral examination.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indubitably this view must have been shared by the <span class="GramE">petitioners,</span>
otherwise they would not have filed a joint motion for hearing on the merits
even before the orders in question were issued." (Decision of Court of
Appeals, pp. 1-2 &amp; 4-5)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellants assign the
following alleged errors of the Court of Appeals:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">"I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN MAKING ITS DECISION DEPEND ON
THE UNSUPPORTED CON­CLUSION THAT 'SINCE THE RESPONDENT FRANCISCO CAGUIAT HAD
PRACTICALLY DISCLOSED ALL HIS <span style="">EVIDENCE
DURING THE PRE-TRIAL CONFERENCE' THE NECESSITY OF A DEPOSITION THROUGH ORAL
EXAMINATION BY THE PETITIONERS WAS OBVIATED.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">"II<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"ASSUMING ARGUENDO THAT THERE WAS A DISCLOSURE OF EVIDENCE BY
THE RESPONDENT CAGUIAT DURING THE PRE-TRIAL CONFERENCE AND THAT THE PERSONAL
ANIMOSITIES BETWEEN THE PARTIES MIGHT BE HEIGHTENED, THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED
IN MAKING SAID 'FINDINGS' AS GROUNDS TO COMPLETELY PREVENT AND BAR DISCOVERY
THROUGH DEPOSITION ON EXAMINATION.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">"III<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN LIMITING PETITIONERS’ MODE OF
DISCOVERY TO OTHER MEANS THAN ORAL EXAMINATION IGNORING THEREBY THE SPIRIT
BEHIND THE RULES OF DISCOVERY.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Appellants' brief)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Anent the first alleged
error, it is readily to be noted that the conclusions of fact of the Court of
Appeals being assailed are binding upon the parties and this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the finding of that appellate court
to the effect that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> has already disclosed all
his evidence during the pre-trial and <span class="GramE">that personal
animosities</span> between the par­ties "might endanger the peaceful and
objective conduct of the deposition upon oral examination" proposed
appears well substantiated in the records before Us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As aptly stated in the appealed decision:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It is significant that the respondent Judge deferred the
resolution of <span style="">his
</span>co-respondent's first motion to prevent the taking of his deposition or
to restrict its scope, until after the pre-trial (see Annex H).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, the second urgent motion of the
same tenor (Annex M) and the petitioners' op­position thereto (Annex N) were
resolved only after the completion of the pre-trial and in fact after the
parties' <u>joint</u> petition for hearing on the merits had been granted (An­nex
J).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> orders were issued only after the pre-trial
supports respondent <span class="SpellE">Caguiat's</span> affirmation that he had
revealed his defense during the trial, and that the respondent Judge had
satisfied him­self that after such revelation there was no more need to take
the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> deposition upon oral examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indubitably this view must have been shared
by the <span class="GramE">petitioners,</span> otherwise they would not have
filed a joint motion for hearing on the merits even before the orders in
question were issued.” (P. 5, CA's decision)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In their second assignment of error, appellants con­tend that the
disclosure by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> of practically all his
evidence at the pre-trial and the danger of heightening the animosities between
the parties during the proposed taking of the deposition of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
are not enough to warrant the trial court's order preventing completely the
taking of said deposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
contention is untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">There can be no question that the trial court has jurisdiction to
direct, in its discretion, that a deposition shall not be taken, if there are
valid reasons for so ruling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Cojuangco</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Caluag</span>, L-7952, July
30, 1955, unreported) That the right of a party to take depositions as means of
discovery is not exactly absolute is implicit in the provi­sions of the Rules
of Court cited by appellants themselves, sections 16 and 18 of Rule 24, which
are precisely designed to protect parties and their witnesses, whenever in the
opinion of the trial court, the move to take their depositions under the guise
of discovery is actually intended to only annoy, embarrass or oppress
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such instances, these
provisions expressly authorize the court to either prevent the taking of <span style="">a </span>deposition
or stop one that is already being taken.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, aside from having practically disclosed all
his evidence at the pre-trial, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> expressed
willingness to enter into a stipulation of facts, which offer, appellants
rejected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, according to Court
of Appeals, the parties herein filed a joint motion for hearing on the merits
even before the orders in question were issued.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under these circumstances, it is inevitable to conclude that there was
indeed no further need for the deposition desired by appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could have served no useful purpose, for
there was nothing anymore to discover.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellants have not shown any real concrete reason for such deposition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' inference in their third assignment of error that the
Court of Appeals has limited their modes of discovery only to other means than
a deposition is en­tirely baseless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
that has been done here is to hold, and rightly, that appellants have failed to
show that the trial court gravely abused its discretion in holding that, under
the circumstances <span style="">proven in </span>the records, there existed good reasons to prevent them
from taking the deposition of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is <span class="GramE">Our</span> conclusion that this appeal is
absolutely without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of
availing themselves of the modes of discovery provided in the Rules in the
manner that would accomplish one of the basic purposes for which they have been
designed, namely, to cut down trivial discussion about issues of fact which are
better agreed upon rather than formally tried, appellants have chosen to unduly
delay this case by taking the simple incident herein involved to the Court of
Appeals and later to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Treble costs against appellants <span style="">in </span>this
instance.</p>
