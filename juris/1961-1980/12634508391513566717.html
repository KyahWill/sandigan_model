				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">With Andres P. Baring as <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, and
Cesar M. <span class="SpellE">Caba­hug</span> as lessee, both entered on June 26,
1960 into a contract of lease over a parcel of land in <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Opon</span> /now <span class="SpellE">Lapulapu</span> City/, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, Lot No. 202 of the <span class="SpellE">Opon</span>
Cadastre, for a period of five <span style="">(5) </span>years
starting from July 1, <span style="">1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The rental agreed upon was P<span style="">75 </span>per month, payable as fol­<span style="">lows:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>P375 </span>upon signing of the agreement, as advanced ren­tals for five
<span style="">(5) </span>months or from July 1, 1960
to November <span style="">30, 1960; </span>thereafter,
P225 advance rentals for the next succeeding three months, payable on the first
five days of every three months.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant thereto, <span class="SpellE">Cabahug</span> paid <span style="">P375 </span>on the date of execution of the
lease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1960" day="3" month="12">December <span style="">3, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>he paid <span style="">P75 as </span>part payment of the advance rentals for the three-month
period from December 1960 to February 1961.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1961</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Baring's</span> counsel sent <span class="SpellE">Cabahug</span> a
demand letter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="22" month="5">May 22, 1961</st1:date>, a second demand letter was writ­ten.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Altho</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabahug</span> admittedly received said letters, no further
payment of rentals was made.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="2">February <span style="">8, </span>1962</st1:date>, Baring sued <span class="SpellE">Cabahug</span> in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> for specific performance <span style="">of </span>the lease contract, i.e., payment of rentals due, plus dama­ges
and attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1962</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Cabahug</span> answered with a counter­claim for rescission
of the contract, with damages, allegi<span style="">ng
that he signed the lease on the strength of <span class="SpellE">Baring's</span>
misrepresentation that the parcel of land is the same one formerly owned by
Philippine Refining Co., Inc., and that, furthermore, the subject lot has not
been delivered to him until now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After Baring replied to the counterclaim on <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1962</st1:date>, trial started, on <st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="11">November 13, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was set to be continued on November 20 and
21, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plain­tiff continued
testifying on cross-examination on <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="11">Novem­ber
 20, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties then
agreed to continue the next trial on <st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="1">January
 <span class="GramE">25, 1963</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attorney for the defen­dant, however, on <st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1963</st1:date>, submitted a written
motion for postponement, with the opposing counsel's con­formity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So the case was reset for <st1:date year="1963" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1963</st1:date>, no­tice of which was
personally received by defendant's coun­sel.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1963</st1:date>,
neither defendant nor his counsel appeared in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff offered his evidence and the case
was submitted for decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, on <st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="6">June 28, 1963</st1:date>,
the Court of First Instance rendered its decision, ordering defendant to pay
plaintiff P2<span class="GramE">,250.00</span> as rentals for 1961, 1962 and
January to June of 1963, plus P300.00 attorney's fees and the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1963</st1:date>
defendant's counsel filed a mo­tion for new trial stating that his
non-appearance was due to the negligence of his office clerk who forgot to note
in his trial calendar the date stated in the notice and who thereafter
misplaced or lost said notice; further, defendant allegedly has a good and
valid defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Submitted therewith were
an affidavit of the clerk and <span style="">an affidavit
of merits, signed by defendant's lawyer, as­serting that the parcel of land
covered by the lease was never delivered to defendant and that what defendant
has occupied lies outside of said lot, "as will be shown by competent
evidence later on."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Said motion was denied on <st1:date year="1963" day="13" month="9">September
 13, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, also, a motion
to reconsider the <span class="GramE">denial,</span> was itself de­nied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the denial orders, defendant has
appealed di­rectly to <span class="GramE">Us</span>, alleging that said denial
does not serve the ends of justice, is attended with abuse of discretion and
overlooks defendant's good and valid defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is that motions for new trial rest on the sound
discretion of the trial court (<span class="SpellE">Porciuncula</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Adamos</span>, L-11519-20, <span style="">April
</span>30, 1958, 55 O.G. 32).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Among the grounds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
is excusable negligence (Sec. 1, Rule </span>37, <span style="">Rules of Court), and defendant's motion invoked such ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear from the record however that
defen­dant's counsel was </span><u><span style="">inexcusably</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">negligent
in failing to take note of the date for the trial in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As sta­ted, he personally received the notice
from the court; it was on his motion that said trial was postponed; hav</span>ing
received the notice of the court, he should have forth­with entered the date
for the next trial in his calendar, but for no excusable reason he neglected to
do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that he delegated to his
clerk the task of noting it down in his trial calendar and that the latter
forgot to do so, and even lost the notice itself, does not consti­tute
excusable negligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it is the duty
of counsel to adopt and strictly maintain a system that efficiently takes into
account all court notices sent to <span class="GramE">him.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>And for want of diligent supervision, the
inexcusable negli­gence of the clerk is thus imputable to the aforesaid coun­sel.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the defense stated in the affidavit of merits, the same
does not deserve a re-opening of the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If <span class="GramE">Indeed</span> the parcel of land was never
delivered to the les­see, it is strange why he made a total payment of P450.00
for rentals and why he never complained for non-delivery of the lot until he
filed his answer to the complaint on <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="4">April
 24, <span style="">1962</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>or about a year and <span style="">9 </span>months after the con­tract went into
effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant's silence during this
period, notwithstanding plaintiff's two demand letters re­ceived by him, belies
his pretenses to non-delivery of the land.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed order denying the motion for new
trial is affirmed, with costs against appellant.</p>
