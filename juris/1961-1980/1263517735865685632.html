<p class="BODY">Upon these facts, the court below dismissed the com­plaint filed
by the Government on the ground that the action had prescribed, reasoning as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The obligations under the pro­missory notes were due and
payable one year after the execution thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Altho</span> the period of maturity is not stated in
all the notes, this is sufficiently shown by the nature of the standing crops -
<span class="SpellE">maiz</span>, sugarcane and <span class="SpellE">palay</span> -
mortgaged, which are yearly crops.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
first promissory note is dated <st1:date year="1943" day="7" month="4">April 7,
 1943</st1:date>, and the last, October 27, 1943; but the complaint was filed
only on <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even taking into consideration that 'the
moratorium law suspended the running of the period of prescription and the
enforcement of the payment of all debts and other monetary obligations payable
within the Philippines from March 10, 1945, to July 26, 1948, or a period of
three years, four months and sixteen days' as repeatedly stated by the Supreme
Court in so many decisions and cited in the case of <span class="SpellE">Bachrach</span>
Motor Co., Inc. vs. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Lejano</span>, 56 O.G. 3278,
still the action has already prescribed because from the last promissory note
dated October 27, 1943, which became due on Octo­ber 27, 1944 to March 30,
1962, the date when the complaint was filed, a period of 17 years 5 months and
3 days had elapsed, and deducting from this the period of moratorium of 3
years, 4 months and 16 years, there remains a period of 14 years and 17 days.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Wherefore, judgment is hereby rendered dismissing the
complaint, without special pronouncement as to costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Government's motion for the reconsideration of this decision
proved unavailing; hence, this appeal from the said decision directly taken to
this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sole issue presented for resolution under the lone assignment
of error is whether or not the action of the Republic had really
prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the position of the
Solicitor General that it has not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has had occasions to
turn down such plea of prescription in situations similar to the one now pre­sented
before Us, and We find the rulings laid then squarely applicable here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, this Court explained in the case of
Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. Jose <span class="SpellE">Grijaldo</span>:<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> [T]he
appellant maintains that the action of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
had prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant points out
that the loans became due on <st1:date year="1944" day="1" month="6">June 1,
 1944</st1:date>; and when the complaint was filed on <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1961</st1:date> a period of more than 16 years
had already elapsed - far beyond the period of ten years when an action based
on a written contract should be brought to court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This contention of the appellant has no merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Firstly, it should be considered that the
complaint in the present case was brought by the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
not as a nominal party but in the exercise of its sovereign functions, to
protect the interests of the State over a public property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under paragraph 4 of Article 1108 of the
Civil Code prescription, both acquisitive and extinctive, does not run against
the State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has held that the
statute of limitations does not run against the right of action of the
Government of the '<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(Government of the Philippine Islands vs. Monte de <span class="SpellE">Piedad</span>,
etc. 35 Phil. 738-751).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the
running of the period of prescription of the action to collect the loan from
the appellant was interrupted by the moratorium laws (Executive Orders Nos. 25,
dated November 18, 1944; Executive Order No. 32, dated March 10, 1945; and
Republic Act No. 342, approved on July 26, 1948).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The loan in question, as evidenced by the
five promissory notes, were incurred in the year 1943, or during the period of
Japanese occupation of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This case is squarely covered by Executive Order
No. 25, which became effective on <st1:date year="1944" day="18" month="11">November
 18, 1944</st1:date>, providing for the suspension of payments of debts incurred
after <st1:date year="1941" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1941</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The period of prescription was, therefore,
suspended beginning <st1:date year="1944" day="18" month="11">November 18, 1944</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, in the case of <span class="SpellE">Rutter</span> vs. Esteban (L-3708, May 18, 1953; 93 Phil. 68),
declared on <st1:date year="1953" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1953</st1:date>
that the Moratorium Laws, R.A. No. 342 and Exe­cutive Orders Nos. 25 and 32,
are unconstitutional; but in that case this Court ruled that the moratorium
laws had sus­pended the prescriptive period until <st1:date year="1953" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1953</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
ruling was catego­rically reiterated in the decision in the case of Manila
Motors vs. <st1:place>Flores</st1:place>, L-9396, <st1:date year="1956" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1956</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
follows, therefore, that the prescriptive period in the case now before Us was
suspended from November 18, 1944, when Executive Order No. 25 took effect,
until May 18, 1953 when R.A. 342 along with Executive Orders Nos. 25 and 32
were declared unconstitutional by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Computed accordingly, the prescriptive period was suspended for 8 years
and 6 months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the appellant's own
admission, the cause of action on the five promissory notes in question arose
on <st1:date year="1944" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1944</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint in the present case was filed
on <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1961</st1:date>, or
after a period of 16 years 6 months and 16 days when the cause of action
arose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the prescriptive period was
not interrupted by the mora­torium laws, the action would have prescribed
already; but, as We have stated, the prescriptive period was suspended by the
moratorium laws for a period of 8 years and 6 months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If we deduct the period of suspension (8
years and 6 months) from the period that elapsed from the time the cause of
action arose to the time when the complaint was filed (16 years, 6 months and
16 days) there remains a period of 8 years and 16 days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the prescriptive period ran
for only 8 years and 16 days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
still re­mained a period of one year, 11 months and 14 days of the prescriptive
period when the complaint was filed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above ruling was later reiterated in the case of Republic vs.
Rodriguez,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
the facts of which, except that the loans there involved were contracted by
therein defendant himself, are on all fours with those of the one here
present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, defendant Gregorio
Rodriguez obtain­ed loans, evidenced by two promissory notes and secured by a
chattel mortgage, from the Bank of Taiwan, Ltd. in the year 1943.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The loans remained unpaid until <st1:date year="1946" day="21" month="1">January 21, 1946</st1:date>, when they became
vested in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States of America</st1:place></st1:country-region>
thru its Alien Property Custodian, pursuant to the United States Trading with
the Enemy Act, as amended, and under its Vesting Order No. P-4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, on <st1:date year="1954" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1954</st1:date>, said unpaid accounts together with other
assets of the Bank of Taiwan were transferred, conveyed and assigned to the
Government of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
by virtue of the Transfer Agreement executed on that date between the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> and the Philippine governments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In June, 1960, the Republic sued on the
notes; but the action was dismissed on the ground of prescription, first, by
the justice of the peace of La Carlota, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental
and, later, by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal to this Court,
however, the order of dismissal was reversed and the record remanded for
further proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Speaking thru Mr.
Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>, this Court ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"At first glance, the period of prescription has lapsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the Government argues that from the
period of 1943-1954, must be deducted the time when the Moratorium Law was in
force, because it tolled or suspended the running of the statute of limitations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other side replies that as the Moratorium
did not bind the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
or the Government of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the running of the prescriptive period was never interrupted, and therefore,
more than ten years having elapsed, the notes prescribed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It will be recalled that the Mora­torium Law was established
by Executive Orders Nos. 25 and 32, dated <st1:date year="1944" day="18" month="11">November 18, 1944</st1:date>, and <st1:date year="1945" day="10" month="3">March 10, 1945</st1:date>, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time, these credits be­longed to the
Bank of Taiwan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Mo­ratorium Law
bound it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, as to it, the
prescriptive period was toiled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it
was only on January 21, 1946, that it lost ownership to the United States
Government, <u>more than one year</u> must be deducted from the period from
November, 1943 to July, 1954; with the result that, for purposes of prescription,
less than ten years had elapsed when (in July, 1954) the Republic became the
owner of the promissory notes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must
be remembered that from that time (July, 1954), the prescriptive period stopped
to run against the Re­public of the Philippine Islands.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Prescription does not run against the State (Art. 1108, New
Civil Code).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It may be added in this connection that after Independence in
July, 1946, the United States Government became a foreign country, lost its
sovereignty over these Islands, and therefore, could not sue, by reason of the
Mora­torium Law, which lost its force only on May 18, 1953 (<span class="SpellE">Rutter</span>
vs. Esteban, 93 Phil. 68).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So the period
between July, 1946 to May, 1953 (about 7 years) should be deducted in computing
the period of prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Applying the precedents above-quoted to the problem on hand, it
is clear that the right of action of the Republic had not prescribed when it
filed its complaint in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
first of the promissory notes here involved matured on <st1:date year="1944" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1944</st1:date>, whereupon, a right of action to
enforce the obligation <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> accrued in favor of
the Bank of Taiwan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time, the
said bank was free to sue herein <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> to recover
the debt; but since it did not choose to do so, the period of prescription
commenced to run against it, and seven (7) months and eleven (11) days elapsed
before the running of the statute of limitations against it was suspended on
November 18, 1944, when it was tolled, first, by Executive Order No. 25 which
provided for the suspension of payments of debts incurred after December 31,
1941 and, later, by Executive Order No. 32, dated March 10, 1945, which suspended
the enforcement of payments not only of all debts and monetary obligations
incurred before December 8, 1941, but also of all debts contracted during the
Japanese occupation.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
On <st1:date year="1946" day="21" month="1">January 21, 1946</st1:date>, the
assets of the Bank of Taiwan in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
including the promissory notes referred to, became vested in the Government of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States of America</st1:place></st1:country-region>
by virtue of its Vesting Order No. P-4, issued under authority of its Trading
with the Enemy Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Granting, <span class="SpellE"><u>argumenti</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>gratia</u></span>,
herein <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' claim that the period of
prescription then commenced to run against the U.S. Government because the
moratorium provided for in the executive orders above-mentioned did not bind
it, still, the running of the statute of limitations was suspended for a second
time on July 4, 1946, when the Philippines obtained independence and the United
States became a foreign country in this jurisdiction and could not sue, by
reason of the moratorium laws,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
with the resultant effect that four (4) months and thirteen (13) days of the
prescriptive period again elapsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
moratorium laws were declared unconstitutional and lost their binding effect on
May 18, 1953 (<span class="SpellE">Rutter</span> vs. Esteban, <u>supra</u>),
after which the period of prescription started to run anew against the United
States Government; but on July 20, 1954, after the lapse of one (1) year, one
(1) month and two (2) days, the running thereof was suspended for the third
time when the obligation under consideration was transferred and assigned to
the Govern­ment of the Philippines by the Attorney General of the United States
by virtue of the corresponding transfer agreements entered into between the two
governments pursuant to the Philippine Property Act of 1946.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And there is no gainsaying that from that
date (<st1:date year="1954" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1954</st1:date>), the
statute of limitations ceased to run against the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
since prescription does not run against the State which, in this case, seeks to
enforce the said obligation in the exercise of its sovereign role.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
In fine, a total of only two (2) years and twenty-six (26) days, i.e., 7 months
and 11 days during the period from April 7, 1944 to November 18, 1944, added to
4 months and 13 days during the period from January 21, 1946 to July 4, 1946,
plus 1 year, 1 month and 2 days during the period from May 18, 1953 to July 20,
1954, had elapsed when the ownership of the first note fell into the hands of
the Republic of the Philippines, and as against whom no prescription had run
thereafter up to the time the present case was filed on March 30, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This conclusion applies with greater force in
respect of the other promissory notes here involved which matured much
later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, We hold that the
lower court erred in holding that the action of the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in this case had pres­cribed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> Pedro C. <span class="SpellE">Hernaez</span>,
however, interposes his own assignment of errors in his brief, claiming that:</p>

<blockquote>"I. THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER COURT</st1:address></st1:street>
ERRED IN DECLARING THAT THERE EXISTED A NEGOTIORUM GESTIO RELATION BETWEEN
DEFENDANT PEDRO C. HERNAEZ AND DEFENDANT RAMON DE LA RAMA;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"II. THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER COURT</st1:address></st1:street>
LIKEWISE ERRED IN DECLARING THAT DEFENDANT PEDRO C. HERNAEZ RATIFIED THE ACTS
OF MANAGEMENT OF THE GES­TOR;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"III. THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER COURT</st1:address></st1:street>
ERRED IN NOT DECLA­RING THAT ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT DEFENDANT DE LA RAMA WAS
THE NEGOTIORUM GESTOR OF DEF­ENDANT HERNAEZ, THE SUMS OF MONEY SUPPOSEDLY
LOANED BY THE TAIWAN BANK, LTD., TO RAMON DE LA RAMA REPRESENTED THE MONEY
PROCEEDS OF SUGAR BELONGING TO DEFENDANT HERNAEZ." (Pp. 79-80, R.A.)<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Of course, it is permissible for an <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
who has not himself appealed to assign what he believes to be errors committed
by the trial court in its decision, if his purpose in doing so is not to have
the appealed judgment modified or reversed in any way but only to be sure that
it is affirmed on other grounds, just in case it cannot be sustained on the
ground upheld by the trial judge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, to that end, it is not even necessary for him to make any
assignment of error, all he has to do is to point out in the discussion in his
brief the errors allegedly committed by the trial court against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(2 Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, pp.
427-428, 1963 ed.)</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot, however apply these observations to the above
assignment of errors of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Hernaez</span>
in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True, said assignment is
intended for no other purpose than to sustain the judgment of dismissal of the court
<u>a</u> <u>quo</u> in his favor, but it will be noted that said assignment
raises issues of fact which require a review of the evidence, and as plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> has appealed directly to this Court on a question
of law, namely, whether or not the trial court erred in dismissing its
complaint on the ground of prescription, upon the factual premises found by His
Honor from the evidence submitted by the parties after due trial, the record on
appeal here does not incorporate such evidence, hence the same cannot be reviewed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, even if <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Hernaez</span> had himself
perfected his own appeal, which understandably he could not have done since the
judgment of the trial court was in his favor, this Court would still be unable
to pass on issues of fact he raised, for they properly belong to the
jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals, even under the former law in force at the
time the present case was appealed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under these circumstances, We hold that the appropriate procedure is for
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to take up the above assignment of errors in
the appeal he may make, if necessary, from the judgment that the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> will render after this case is remanded to it.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, the judgment of dismissal
rendered by the trial court is hereby reversed, the motion of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> for the dismissal of the complaint on the ground
of prescription is denied, and this case is ordered remanded to the trial court
in order that said court may render judg­ment on the merits and pass on all
issues between the parties other than that of prescription resolved herein,
with costs against <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.</p>
