petition was submitted in behalf of the same respondents on July 31,

</blockquote>

<p>The questions to determine are whether the appellee's removal as
public school teacher from the Euhang Elementary School, Hamtic,
Antique, is illegal; whether she has a cause of action against the
appellants and by mandamus proceedings may secure reinstatement to her
former position; and whether she has exhausted all administrative
remedies.</p>
<p>A cause of action exists if upon the facts alleged in a complaint
admitted by the adverse party or proved by admissible and credible
evidence a valid judgment may be rendered by a competent court. In her
petition for mandamus the appellee alleges that she was illegally
removed from her teaching position. If that allegation be established
or proved, a valid judgment may be rendered reinstating her to her
position. Hence, a cause of action exists against those responsible for
her removal from her position and the remedy of mandamus is available
to secure her reinstatement thereto.</p>
<p>There is, however, no doubt that her removal as a public school
teacher because of loss of Filipino citizenship is legal. Not being
included in section 671 of the Revised Administrative Code which
enumerates the officers and employees constituting the unclassified
service, teaching in a public school is in the classified service—a
public function which may be performed, by Filipino citizens only. An
applicant for admission to examination for entrance into the civil
service must be a citizen of the Philippines (section 675 of the
Revised Administrative Code). And after he had qualified himself to be
eligible for appointment to a civil service position and had been
appointed to such position, he must continue to be such citizen. A
voluntary change of citizenship or a change thereof by operation of law
disqualifies him to continue holding tho civil service, position to
which he had qualified and had been appointed. Such being the case,
upon the appellee's marriage on 10 August 1957 to Ng Foo <em>alias</em>
Pio Chet Yee, a Chinese citizen, the appellee ceased to be a citizen of
the Philippines, and for that reason she is no longer qualified to
continue holding the civil service position to which she had qualified
and had been appointed.</p>
<p>Section 681 of the Revised Administrative Code provides that— </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In making selection from lists of certified
eligibles furnished by the Commissioner, appointing officer shall, when
other qualifications are equal, prefer:.</p>
  <p>First.  Citizen of the Philippines.       </p>
  <p> Second. Honorably discharged soldiers, sailors, and mariners of the United States,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is no argument against the limitation of holding public offices to
citizens of the Philippines. The preference provided for in the section
quoted above was operative during the period before 4 July 1946 or
before the Philippines became an independent' nation.</p>
<p>In view of the conclusion arrived at, the point of exhaustion of administrative remedy need not be passed upon.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is reversed and petition denied, without pronouncement as to  costs in both instances.</p>
<p><i>Bengzon, C. J., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala, </i>and <i>Makalintal, JJ,,</i> concur. </p>
