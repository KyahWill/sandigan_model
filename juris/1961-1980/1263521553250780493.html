of the Court of First Instance of Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs-appellants as parents of their sixteen-year old son, <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Palisoc</span>, and a student
in automotive mech­anics at the Manila Technical Institute, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
Boulevard, Manila, had filed on May 19, 1966, the action below for dam­ages
arising from the death on March 10, 1966 of their son at the hands of a fellow
student, defendant <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Daffon</span>,
at the laboratory room of the said Institute.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants, per the trial court's decision, are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"(T)he defendant Antonio C. <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span>, at the time when the incident which gave rise
to this action occurred was a member of the Board of Directors of the
institute:<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
the defendant <span class="SpellE">Teodosio</span> <span class="SpellE">Valenton</span>,
the president thereof; the defendant Santiago M. <span class="SpellE">Quibulue</span>,
instructor of the class to which the deceased belonged; and the defendant <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Daffon</span>, a fellow
student of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
beginning the Manila <span class="SpellE">Techanical</span> Ins­titute was a
single proprietorship, but lately on <st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="8">August
 2, 1962</st1:date>, it was duly incorporated."</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts that led to the tragic death of plaintiffs' son were
thus narrated by the trial court:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"(T)he deceased <span class="SpellE">Domina­dor</span> <span class="SpellE">Palisoc</span> and the defendant <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span>
L. <span class="SpellE">Daffon</span> were classmates, and on the afternoon of
March 10, 1966, between two and three o'clock, they, together with another
classmate <span class="SpellE">Desiderio</span> Cruz were in the laboratory room
located on the ground floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that
time the classes were in recess.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Desiderio</span> Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Vir­gilio</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Daffon</span> were working on a machine while <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>
<span class="SpellE">Palisoc</span> was merely looking on at them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Daffon</span> made a
remark to the effect that <span class="SpellE">Palisoc</span> was acting like a
foreman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of this remark <span class="SpellE">Palisoc</span> slapped slightly <span class="SpellE">Daffon</span>
on the face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Daffon</span>,
in retaliation, gave <span class="SpellE">Palisoc</span> a strong flat blow on
the face, which was followed by other fist blows on the stomach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Palisoc</span> re­treated
apparently to avoid the fist blows, but <span class="SpellE">Daffon</span>
followed him and both exchanged blows until <span class="SpellE">Palisoc</span>
stumbled on an engine block which caused him to fall face downward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Palisoc</span> became pale
and fainted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First aid was administered
to him but he was not revived, so he was immediately taken to a hospi­tal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He never regained consciousness; finally he
died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fore­going is the substance of
the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Desiderio</span> Cruz, the lone witness to
the incident."</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court expressly gave credence to this version of the
incident, as testified to by the lone eyewitness, <span class="SpellE">Desiderio</span>
Cruz, a classmate of the protagonists, as that of a disinterested witness who
"has no motive or reason to testify one way or ano­ther in favor of any
party" and rejected the self-exculpatory version of defendant <span class="SpellE">Daffon</span> denying that he had inflicted any fist blows an the
deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the postmortem findings of Dr. Angelo <span class="SpellE">Singian</span>
of the Manila Police Department who performed the autopsy re "Cause of
death: shock due to traumatic fracture of the ribs (6th and 7th, left),<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
contusion of the pancreas and stomach with intra-gastric hemorrhage and slight <span class="SpellE">subarachnoid</span> hemorrhage on the brain", and his
testimony that these internal injuries of the deceased were caused 'probably by
strong fist blows", the trial court found defendant <span class="SpellE">Daffon</span>
liable for the <span class="SpellE">quasi­delict</span> under Article 2176 of the
Civil Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
It held that "(T)he act, therefore, of the accused <span class="SpellE">Daffon</span>
in giving the dec­eased strong fist blows in the stomach which ruptured his
inter­nal organs and caused his death falls within the purview of this article
of the Code."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, however, absolved from liability the three other
defendants-officials of the Manila <span class="SpellE">Techanical</span>
Institute, in this wise:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Their liabilities are based on the provisions of Article 2180 of the New Civil
Code which reads:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Art. 2180.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></p>

<p class="2Q">'Lastly, teachers or heads of establishments of arts and trades
shall be liable for damages caused by their pupils and students and
apprentices, so long as they remain in their custody.’</p>

<blockquote>“In the opinion of the Court, this article of the Code is not
applicable to the case at bar, since this contemplates the situation where the control
or influence of the teachers and heads of school establishments over the
conduct and actions of the pupil supersedes those of the parents.</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'CIVIL LAW:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>DAMAGES. ART.
2180. NEW CIVIL CODE CONSTRUED:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The
clause 'so long as they remain in their custody' contained in Article 2180 of
the new civil code contemplated a situation where the pupil lives and boards
with the teacher, such that the control or influence on the pupil supersedes
those of the parents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In those
circumstances the control or influence over the conduct and actions of the
pupil as well as the responsibilities for their sort would pass from the father

school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These defendants can­not
therefore be made responsible for the tort of the defendant <span class="SpellE">Daffon</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Judgment was therefore rendered by the trial court as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dismissing the defendants' counter­claim for

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs' appeal raises the principal legal question that under
the factual findings of the trial court, which are now beyond review, the trial
court erred in absolving the defendants-school officials instead of holding
them jointly and severally liable as <span class="SpellE">tortfeasors</span>,
with defendant <span class="SpellE">Daffon</span>, for the damages awarded them
as a result of their son's death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court finds the appeal, in the main, to be meritorious.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court absolved
defendants-school officials on the ground that the provisions of Article 2180,
Civil Code, which expressly hold "teachers or heads of establishments of
arts and trades ... liable for damages caused by their pupils and students and
apprentices, so long as they remain in their custody", are not applicable
to the case at bar, since "there is no evidence that the accused <span class="SpellE">Daffon</span> [who inflicted the fatal fist blows<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
lived and boarded with his teacher or the other defendants-officials of the
school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These defendants cannot
therefore be made respon­sible for the tort of the defendant <span class="SpellE">Daffon</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court based its legal conclusion expressly on the
Court's dictum in <u>Mercado vs. Court of Appeals</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
that "(I)t would seem that the clause 'so long as they remain in their cus­tody,'
contemplates a situation where the pupil lives and boards with the teacher,
such that the control, direction and influence on the pupil supersedes those of
the parents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In these circums­tances the
control or influence over the conduct and actions of the pupil would pass from
the father and mother to the teacher; and so would the responsibility for the
torts of the pupil.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a sit­uation
does not appear in the case at bar: the pupils appear to go to school during
school hours and go back to their homes with their parents after school is
over." This dictum had been made in rejecting therein petitioner-father's
contention that his minor son's school, Lourdes Catholic School at <span class="SpellE">Kanlaon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City <i>[</i>which
was not a party to the case<i>]</i> should be held responsible, rather than him
as father, for the moral damages of P2,000.00 adjudged against him for the
physical injury inflicted by his son on a classmate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>[</i>A cut on the right cheek with a piece
of razor which cost only P50.00 by way of medical expenses to treat and cure,
since the wound left no scar.<i>]</i> The moral damages award was after all set
aside by the Court on the ground that none of the specific cases provided in
Article 2279, Civil Code, for awarding moral damages had been established,
petitioner's son being only nine years old and not having been shown to have
"acted with discernment" in inflicting the injuries on his classmate.</p>

<p class="BODY">The dictum in <u>Mercado</u> was based in turn on another dictum
in the earlier case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Exconde</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Capuno</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
where the only issue involved as expressly stated in the decision, was whether
the therein defendant father could be held civilly liable for damages resulting
from a death caused in a motor vehicle accident driven <span class="SpellE">unauthorizedly</span>
and negligently by his minor son, (which issue was resolved adversely against
the father).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Nevertheless, the dictum
in such earlier case that "(I)t is true that under the law above-quoted,
'teachers or directors of arts and trades are liable for any damage caused by
their pupils or apprentices while they are under their custody', but this
provision only applies to an insti­tution of arts and trades and not to any
academic educational institution. " was expressly cited and quoted in <u>Mercado</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case at bar was
instituted directly against the school officials and squarely raises the issue
of liability of teachers and heads of schools under Article 2180, Civil Code,
for damages caused by their pupils and students against fellow students on the
school premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, the parents of
the stu­dent at fault, defendant <span class="SpellE">Daffon</span>, are not
involved, since <span class="SpellE">Daffon</span> was already of age at the time
of the tragic incident. There is no question, either, that the school involved
is a non-academic school,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
the Manila Technical Institute being admittedly a technical vocational and
industrial school.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court holds that under the cited <span class="SpellE">codal</span>
article, defendants head and teacher of the Manila Technical Institute
(defendants <span class="SpellE">Valenton</span> and <span class="SpellE">Quibulue</span>,
respectively) are liable jointly and sever­ally for damages to
plaintiffs-parents for the death of the latter's minor son at the hands of
defendant <span class="SpellE">Daffon</span> at the school's labor­atory
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No liability attaches to defendant
<span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span> as a mere member of the school's board of
directors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The school itself can­not be
held similarly liable, since it has not been properly <span class="SpellE">im­pleaded</span>
as party defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While plaintiffs
sought to so <span class="SpellE">implead</span> it, by <span class="SpellE">impleading</span>
improperly defendant <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span>, its former single
proprietor, the lower court found that it had been incorpor­ated since August
2, 1962, and therefore the school itself, as thus incorporated, should have
been brought in as party defendant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiffs failed to do so, notwithstanding that <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span>
and his co-defendants in their reply to plaintiffs' request for admission had
expressly manifested and made of record that "defendant Antonio C. <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span> is not the registered owner/head of the 'Manila
Technical Institute' which is now a corporation and is not owned by any
individual person."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rationale of such liability
of school heads and teachers for the <span class="SpellE">tortious</span> acts of
their pupils and students, so long as they remain in their custody, is that
they stand, to a certain extent, as to their pupils and students, <u>in loco <span class="SpellE">parentis</span></u> and are called upon to "exercise reasonable
supervision over the conduct of the child."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
This is expressly provided for in Articles 349, 350 and 352 of the Civil Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
In the law of torts, the governing principle is that the protective custody of
the school heads and teachers is <span class="SpellE">mandatorily</span>
substituted for that of the parents, and hence, it becomes their obligation as
well as that of the school itself to provide proper supervision of the
students' activities during the whole time that they are at attend­ance in the
school, including recess time, as well as to take the necessary precautions to
protect the students in their custody from dangers and hazards that would
reasonably be anticipated, including injuries that some student themselves may
inflict will­fully or through negligence on their fellow students.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As tersely summarized by
Mr. Justice J. B. L. Reyes in his dissenting opinion in <span class="SpellE"><u>Exconde</u></span>,
"the basis of the presump­tion of negligence of Art. 1903 <i>[</i>now 2180<i>]</i>
is some <u>culpa in <span class="SpellE">vigilando</span></u><i> </i>that the
parents, teachers, etc. are supposed to have incurred in the exercise of their
authority"<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
and 'where the parent places the child under the effective authority of the
teacher, the latter, and not the parent, should be the one answerable for the
torts committed while under his custody, for the very reason that the parent is
not supposed to interfere with the discipline of the school nor with the
authority and supervision of the teacher while the child is under
instruction." The school itself, likewise, has to respond for the fault or
negligence of its school head and teachers under the same cited article.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court therefore
erred in law in absolving defendants-school officials on the ground that they
could be held liable under Article 2180, Civil Code, only if the student who
inflicted the fatal fist blows on his classmate and victim "lived and
boarded with his teacher or the other defendants officials of the school."
As stated above, the phrase used in the cited art­icle -- "so long as (the
students) remain in their custody" means the protective and supervisory
custody that the school and its heads and teachers exercise over the pupils and
students for as long as they are at attendance in the school, including recess
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the law that
requires that for such liability to attach, the pupil or student who commits
the <span class="SpellE">tortious</span> act must live and board <u>in the school</u>,
as erroneously held by the lower court, and the dicta in <u>Mercado</u> (as
well as in <span class="SpellE"><u>Exconde</u></span>) on which it relied, must
now be deemed to have been set aside by the pre­sent decision.</p>

<p class="NUM">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants <span class="SpellE">Valenton</span> and <span class="SpellE">Quibulue</span> as
president and teacher-in-charge of the school must therefore be held jointly
and severally liable for the quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span> of their
co-defendant <span class="SpellE">Daffon</span> in the latter's having caused the
death of his classmate, the deceased <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Palisoc</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
unfortunate death result­ing from the fight between the protagonists-students
could have been avoided, had said defendants but complied with their duty of
providing adequate supervision over the activities of the stu­dents in the
school premises to protect their students from harm, whether at the hands of
fellow students or other parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any
rate, the law holds them liable unless they relieve themselves of such
liability, in compliance with the last paragraph of Art­icle 2180, Civil Code,
by "(<u>proving) that they observed all the diligence of a good father of
a family to prevent damage</u>." In the light of the factual findings of
the lower court's decision, said defendants failed to prove such exemption from
liability.</p>

<p class="NUM">7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' contention that the award of P6,000.00 as
indemnity for the death of their son should be increased to P12,000.00 as set
by the Court in <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pantoja</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
and observed in all death indemnity cases there­after is well taken. The Court,
in <span class="SpellE"><u>Pantoja</u></span>, after noting the de­cline in the
purchasing power of the Philippine peso, had expressed its "considered
opinion that the amount of award of compensatory damages for death caused by a
crime or quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span> should now be P12,000.00."
The Court thereby adjusted the <u>minimum</u> amount of "compensatory
damages for death caused by a crime or quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>"
as per Article 2206, Civil Code, from the old stated minimum of P3,000.00 to
P12,000.00, which amount is to be awarded "even though there may have been
mitigating cir­cumstances" pursuant to the express provisions of said <span class="SpellE">codal</span> article.</p>

<p class="NUM">8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' other claims on appeal that the lower court
should have awarded exemplary damages and imposed legal interest on the total
damages awarded, besides increasing the award of attorney's fees all concern
matters that are left by law to the discretion of the trial court and the Court
has not been shown any error or abuse in the exercise of such discre­tion on
the part of the trial court.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Decisive here is the touchstone provision of Article 2231, Civil Code, that 'In
quasi­-<span class="SpellE">delicts</span>, exemplary damages may be granted if
the defendant acted with <u>gross negligence</u>." No gross negligence on
the part of defendants was found by the trial court to warrant the imposi­tion
of exemplary damages, as well as of interest and increased attorney's fees, and
the Court has not been shown in this appeal any compelling reason to disturb
such finding.</p>

The writer concurs with the views expressed in the dissenting opinion of Mr.
Justice J. B. L. Reyes in <span class="SpellE"><u>Exconde</u></span> [concurred
in by Justices Padilla and A. Reyes] that "(I) can see no sound reason for
limit­ing Art. 1903 of the old Civil Code to teachers of arts and trades and
not to academic ones.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What substan­tial
difference is there between them in so far as con­cerns the proper supervision
and vigilance over their pupils?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
cannot be seriously contended that an aca­demic teacher is exempt from the duty
of watching that his pupils do not commit a tort to the detriment of third
persons, so long as they are in a position to exercise authority and
supervision over the pupil." However, since the school involved at bar is
a non­academic school, the question as to the applicability of the cited <span class="SpellE">codal</span> provision to academic institu­tions will have to
await another case wherein it may properly be raised.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">MAKALINTAL, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I vote to affirm the decision appealed from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I see no reason to depart from the doctrine
laid down by this Court in Mercado v. Court of Appeals, 108 Phil. 414, where
the clause "so long as they remain in their custody" used in Article
2180 of the Civil Code was construed as referring to a "situation where
the pupil lives and boards with the teacher, such that the (latter's) control,
direct­ion and influence on the pupil supersedes those of the parents." I
think it is highly unrealistic and conducive to unjust results, considering the
size of the enrollment in many of our educational institutions, academic and
non­academic, as well as the temper, attitudes and often <span class="SpellE">dis­tructive</span>
activism of the students, to hold their teachers and/or the administrative
heads of the schools directly liable for torts committed by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When even the school authorities find
themselves besieged, beleaguered and attacked, and unable to impose the
traditional disciplinary measures formerly recognized as available to them,
such as suspension or outright expulsion of the offending students, it flies in
the face of logic and reality to consider such students, merely from the fact
of enrollment and class attendance, as "in the custody" of the
teachers or school heads within the meaning of the statute, and to hold the
latter liable unless they can prove that they have exercised "all the
diligence of a good father of the family to pre­vent damage." Article
2180, if applied as appellants cons­true it, would be bad law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would demand responsibility without
commensurate authority, rendering teachers and school heads open to damage
suits for causes beyond their power to control.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Present conditions being what they are, I believe the restrictive
interpretation of the aforesaid provision enunciated in <u>Mercado</u> should
be maintained.</p>

<p class="BODY">With particular reference to the case at bar, one other factor
constrains me to dissent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The opinion of
the majority states:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Here, the
parents of the student at fault, defendant <span class="SpellE">Daffon</span>,
are not involved, since <span class="SpellE">Daffon</span> was already of age at
the time of the tragic incident." This statement is of course in
accordance with Article 2180, which says that "the father and, in case of
his death or incapacity, the mother, are responsible for the damages caused by
the <u>minor</u> children who live in their company." <span class="GramE">Note
that for parental responsibility to arise the children must be minors who live
in their company.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, as stated
also in the opinion of the majority, "the rationale of (the) liability of
school heads and teachers for the <span class="SpellE">tortious</span> acts of
their pupils and students, so long as they remain in their custody, is that
they stand, to a certain extent, as to their pupils and students, in <u>loco</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>parentis</u></span> and are called upon to exercise
reasonable supervision over the conduct of the child," then it stands to
reason that (1) the clause "so long as they remain in their custody"
as used in reference to teachers and school heads should be equated with the
phrase "who live in their company" as used in reference to parents;
and (2) that just as parents are not responsible for damages caused by their
children who are no longer minors, so should teachers and school heads be
exempt from liability for the <span class="SpellE">tortious</span> acts of their
students in the same age category.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
find no justification, either in the law itself or in justice and equity, to
make a substitute parent liable where the real parent would be free from
liability.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">REYES, J.B.L., <i>J.</i>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">I concur with the opinion of Justice Mr. Teehankee but would like
to clarify that the argument of the dissenting opinion to the effect that the responsibility
of teachers and school officers under Article 2180 should be limited to pupils
who are <u>minors</u> (below the age of majority) is not in accord with the
plain text of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 2180 of
the Civil Code of the Philippines is to the following effect:</p>

<blockquote>"The obligation imposed by article 2176 is demandable not only
for one's own acts or omissions, but also for those of persons for whom one is
responsible.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The father and, in case of his death or incapacity, the
mother, are responsible for the damages caused by the minor children who live
in their company.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Guardians are liable for damages caused by the minors or
incapacitated persons who are under their authority and live in their company.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The owners and managers of an establishment or enterprise are
likewise respon­sible for damages caused by their employees in the service of
the branches in which the latter are employed or on the occasion of their
functions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Employers shall be liable for the damages caused by their
employees and household helpers acting within the scope of their assigned
tasks, even though the former are not engaged in any business or industry.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The State is responsible in like manner when it acts through
a special agent; but not when the damage has been caused by the official to
whom the task done properly pertains, in which case what is provided in article
2176 shall be applicable.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Lastly, teachers or heads of establishments of arts and
trades shall be liable for damages caused by their pupils and students or
apprentices, so long as they remain in their custody.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The responsibility treated of in this article shall cease
when the persons herein mentioned prove that they observe all the diligence of
a good father of a family to prevent damage."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Examination of the article shows that where the responsibility
prescribed therein is limited to illegal acts during minority, the article
expressly so provides, as in the case of the parents and of the guardians.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is natural to expect that if the law had
intended to similarly restrict the civil responsibility of the other categories
of persons enumerated in the article, it would have expressly so stated. The
fact that it has not done so indicates an intent that the liability be not
restricted to the case of persons under age.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Further, it is not without significance that the teachers and heads of
scholarly establishments are not grouped with parents and guardians but ranged
with owners and managers of enterprises, employers and the state, as to whom no
reason is discernible to imply that they should answer only for minors.</p>

<p class="BODY">Giorgi, in his well-known "Teoria de las Obligaciones en el
Derecho Moderno", Volume 5, page 404, No. 272 (Sp. Ed.), after noting the
split among commentators on the point at issue, observes with considerable
cogency that -</p>

<blockquote>"272. Ante esta variedad de opiniones, ninguna de las cuales
se funda en argumentos merecedores de seria ponderacion, no es facil tomar un
partido.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Esto no obstante, debiendo
manifestar nuestra opinion, nos acer­camos a la de los que no estiman necesaria
la menor edad del discipulo o del aprendiz; porque si el aforismo <u>ubi voluit
dixit, ubi noluit tacuit</u>, no es siempre argumento seguro para interpretar
la ley, es infalible cuanto se refiere a una misma disposicion relativa a
varios casos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Y tal es el art. 1.153. Lo
que haya establecido importa poco si, elevandones a los principios de razon,
puede dudarse de la oportunidad de semejante diferencia; porque la voluntad
cierta del legislador prevalece <u>in iure condito</u> a cualquier otra
consideracion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Por otra parte, si bien
se considera, no puede parecer extraño 6 absurdo el suponer que un discipulo y
un aprendiz, aunque mayores de edad, acepten voluntariamente la entera vigi­lancia
de su preceptor mientras dura la educacion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ni parece dudoso desde el momento que los artesanos y los preceptores
deben, al par de los padres, responder civilmente de los daños cometidos por
sus discipulos, aun cuando estos esten faltos de discernimiento."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, Planiol-Ripert, in their “Droit Civil Pratique,"
Volume VI, No. 635 (Spanish version), say that -</p>

<blockquote>"635. <u>Personas de quien responde.</u> -? Si bien la
responsibilidad del maestro es ori­ginalmente una extension de la de los padres
(1), el art. 1384 no especifica que los alumnos y aprendices han de ser menores
de edad, por lo que la presuncion de culpa funcionara aun cuando sean mayores
(2); pero, la vigilancia no tendra que ser ejercida en iguales terminos. Aun
respecto a los menores variara segun la edad, extremo que tendra que tenerse en
cuenta a los fines de apreciar si el maestro ha podido impedir el acto nocivo o
no.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">I submit, finally, that while in the case of parents and
guardians, their authority and supervision over the children and wards end by
law upon the latter reaching majority age, the authority and custodial super­vision
over pupils exist regardless of the age of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A student over twenty-one, by enrolling and
attending a school, places himself under the custodial supervision and
disciplinary authority of the school authorities, which is the basis of the
latter's correlative responsibility for his torts, committed while under such
authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, the teachers'
control is not as plenary as when the student is a minor; but that circumstance
can only affect the degree of the responsibility but cannot negate the
existence thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only a factor
to be appreciated in determining whether or not the defendant has exer­cised
due diligence in endeavoring to prevent the injury, as prescribed in the last
paragraph of Article 2180.</p>
