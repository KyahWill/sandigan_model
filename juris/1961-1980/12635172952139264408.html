				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., Acting C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Direct appeal from two orders, dated 19 May and 5 June 1965,
issued by the Court of First Instance of Manila (Judge Francisco <span class="SpellE">Arca</span> presiding), in its Civil Case No. 54913, entitled
Luzon Steel Corporation, plaintiff, vs. Metal Manufacturing of the Philippines,
Inc., and Jose O. <span class="SpellE">Sia</span>, defendants, whereby the court
aforesaid quashed a writ of execu­tion issued against the Times Surety &amp;
Insurance Co., Inc., and cancelled the undertaking of said surety company.</p>

<p class="BODY">The essential and <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span> facts
of the case may be summarized as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Luzon Steel Corporation has sued Metal Manufacturing of the
Philippines and Jose O. <span class="SpellE">Sia</span>, the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
<span class="GramE">manager</span>, for breach of contract and damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It obtained a writ of preliminary attachment
of the properties of the defendants, but the attachment was lifted upon a P25<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> counter-bond executed by the defendant <span class="SpellE">Sia</span>, as principal, and the Times Surety 6 Insurance Co.,
Inc. (hereinafter designated as the surety), as <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>
guarantor, in the following terms:</p>

<blockquote>"’WHEREFORE, we JOSE O. SIA, as principal, and the TIMES
SURETY &amp; INSURANCE CO., INC., as Surety, in consideration of the
dissolution of attachment, hereby jointly and severally bind ourselves in the
sum of Twenty Five Thousand Pesos (P25<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>),
Philippine Currency, to answer for the payment to the plaintiff of any judgment
it may recover in the action in accordance with Section 12, Rule 59, of the
Rules of Court.' <span class="GramE">(pp. 32, 45, Rec. on Appeal.)"</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Issues having been joined, plaintiff and defendant (without
interven­tion of the surety) entered into a compromise whereby defendant <span class="SpellE">Sia</span> agreed to settle the plaintiff's claim in the following
manner:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the Defendant shall settle with the
Plaintiff the amount of TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND (P25<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>)
PESOS, in the following manner:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>FIVE
HUNDRED (P500.00) PESOS, monthly for the first six (6) months to be paid at the
end of every month and to commence in January, 1965, and within one month after
paying the last installment of P500.00, the balance of P22,000.00 shall be paid
in lump sum, without interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
understood that failure of the Defendant to pay one or any installment will
make the whole obligation immediately due and de­mandable and that a writ of
execution will be issued immediately against Defendants bond."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The compromise was submitted to the court and the latter approved
it, rendered judgment in conformity therewith, and directed the parties to
comply with the same (Record on Appeal, page 22).</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant having failed to comply, plaintiff moved for and
obtained a writ of execution against defendant and the joint and several <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">counterbond</span></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The surety, however, moved to quash the writ
of execution against it, averring that it was not a party to the compromise,
and that the writ was issued without giving the surety notice and hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court, overruling the plaintiff's
opposition, set aside the writ of execution, and later cancelled the
counter-bond, and denied the motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence this appeal.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Main issues posed are (1) whether the judgment upon the
compromise discharged the surety from its obligation under its attachment <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span> and (2) whether the writ of execution could be
issued against the surety without previous exhaustion of the debtor's
properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both questions can be solved by bearing in mind that we are
dealing with a <span class="SpellE"><u>counterbond</u></span> filed <u>to
discharge</u> a levy on attachment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rule
57, section 12, specifies that an attachment may be discharged upon the making
of a cash deposit or filing a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span> "in an
amount equal to the value of the property attached as determined by the
judge"; that upon the filing of the <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>
"the property attached ----- shall be delivered to the party making the
deposit or giving the counter-bond, or the person appearing on his behalf, <u>the
deposit or <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span> aforesaid standing in place of
the property so released</u>".</p>

<p class="BODY">The underlined expressions constitute the key to the entire
problem.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether the judgment <span class="GramE">be</span> rendered after trial on the merits or upon compromise,
such judgment undoubtedly may be made effective upon the property released; and
since the <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span> merely stands in the place of
such property, there is no reason why the judgment should not be made effective
against the <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span> regardless of the manner how
the judgment was obtained.</p>

<p class="BODY">Squarely on the point, and rebutting the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
apprehension that the compromise could be the result of a collusion between the
parties to injure the surety, is our decision in <span class="SpellE">Anzures</span>
vs. Alto Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc., et al., 92 Phil. 742, where this
Court, through former Chief Justice Pares, ruled as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Under section 12, Rule 59, of the Rules of Court, the bond
filed, as in this case, for the discharge of an attachment is 'to secure the
payment to the plaintiff of any judgment he may recover in the action,' and
stands 'in place of the property so released'.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It follows that the order of cancellation issued by the respondent judge
is erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, judgment had
already been rendered by the Court of First Instance of Manila in civil case
No. 11748, sentencing Ben­jamin Aguilar to pay the sum of P3<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>
to the petitioner; and it is not pretended that said judgment is a
nullity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no point in the con­tention
of the respondent Surety Company that the compromise was entered into without
its knowledge and consent, thus becoming as to it essentially fraudulent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Surety is not a party to civil case No.
11748 and, therefore, need not be served with notice of the petition for
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As against the conjecture of
said res­pondent that the parties may easily connive by means of a compromise
to prejudice it, there is also the likelihood that the same end may be at­tained
by parties acting in bad faith through a simulated trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, it is within the power of the
Surety Company to protect itself against a risk of the kind.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Wherefore, the order of the respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span>
the bond in question is set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">So ordered with costs against the respondent Alto Surety &amp;
Insurance Co., Inc."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The lower court and the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> herein
appear to have relied on doctrines of this Court concerning the liability of
sureties in bonds filed by a plaintiff for the <u>issuance</u> of writs of
attachment, without discrimina­ting between such bonds and those filed by a
defendant for the <u>lifting</u> of writs of attachment already issued and
levied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This confusion is hardly
excusable considering that this Court has already called attention to the
difference between these kinds of bonds.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, in <span class="SpellE">Cajefe</span> vs. Judge Fernandez, et al.,
L-15709, 19 October 1960, this Court pointed out that -</p>

<blockquote>"The diverse rule in section 17 of Rule 59 for <span class="SpellE">counterbonds</span> posted to obtain the lifting of a writ of
attachment is due to these bonds being security for the payment of any judgment
that the attaching party may obtain; they are thus mere replacements of the
property formerly attached, and just as the latter may be levied upon after
final judgment in the case in order to realize the amount adjudged, so is the
liability of the <span class="SpellE">countersureties</span> ascertainable after
the judgment has become final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
situation does not obtain in the case of injunction <span class="SpellE">counterbonds</span>,
since the sureties in the latter case merely undertake to pay all damages that
the plaintiff may suffer by reason of the continuance ----- of the acts
complained of ' (Rule 60, section 6) and not to secure payment of the judgment
recovered.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It was, therefore, error on the part of the court below to have
ordered the surety bond cancelled, on the theory that the parties' compromise
discharged the obligation of the surety.</p>

<p class="BODY">As declared by us in Mercado vs. <span class="SpellE">Macapayag</span>,
69 Phil. 403, 405-406, in passing upon the liability of counter sureties in <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> who bound them­selves to answer <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> for the obligations of the defendants to the
plaintiffs in a fixed amount of P912.04, to secure payment of the amount that
said plaintiff be adjudged to recover from the defendants.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">the</span>
liability of the sureties was fixed and conditioned on the finality of the
judgment rendered regardless of whether the decision was based on the consent
of the parties or on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
judgment entered on a stipula­tion is nonetheless a judgment of the court
because <span class="GramE">consented</span> to by the parties."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But the surety in the present case insists (and the court below
so ruled) that the execution issued against it was invalid because the writ
issued against its principal, Jose O. <span class="SpellE">Sia</span>, et al.,
defendants below, had not been returned unsatisfied; and the surety invoked in
its favor Section 17 of Rule 57 of the Revised Rules of Court (old Rule 59),
couched in the following terms:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 17.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>When execution returned unsatisfied,
recovery had upon bond</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- If<i> </i>the
execution be returned unsatisfied in whole or in part, the surety or sureties
on any <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span> given pursuant to the provisions
of this rule to secure the payment of the judgment shall become charged on such
counter-bond, and bound to pay to the judgment creditor upon demand, the amount
due under the judgment, which amount may be recovered from such surety or
sureties after notice and summary hearing in the same action."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The surety's contention is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>
contemplated in the rule is evidently an ordinary guaranty where the sureties
assume a subsidiary liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
not the case here, because the surety in the present case bound itself
"jointly and severally" (<u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>solidum</u></span>)
with the defendant; and it is prescribed in Article 2059, paragraph 2, of the
Civil Code of the Philippines that <span class="SpellE"><u>excusion</u></span>
(previous exhaustion of the property of the debtor) shall not take place
"if he (the guarantor) has bound himself <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span>
with the debtor".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule heretofore
quoted can not be construed as requiring that an execution against the debtor
be first returned unsatis­fied <u>even if</u> the bond were a <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> one; for a procedural rule may not amend the
substantive law expressed in the Civil Code, and further would nullify the
express stipulation of the parties that the surety's obligation should be <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> with that of the defendant.</p>

<p class="BODY">A second reason against the stand of the surety and of the court
below is that even if the surety's undertaking were not <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>
with that of the principal debtor, still he may not demand exhaustion of the
property of the latter, unless he can point out sufficient <span class="SpellE">leviable</span>
property of the debtor within Philippine territory. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>There is no record that the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> surety has done so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Says Article 2060 of the Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 2060<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In</span> order that the guarantor may make use of the benefit of <span class="SpellE">excussion</span>, he must set it up against the creditor upon the
latter's demand for payment from him, and point out to the creditor available
property of the debtor within Philippine territory, sufficient to cover the
amount of the debt."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A third reason against the thesis of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
is that, under the rule and its own terms, the counter-bond is only conditioned
upon the rendition of the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Payment under the bond is not made to depend upon the re­delivery or
availability of the property previously attached, as it was under Section 440
of the old Code of Civil Procedure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where
under the rule and the bond the undertaking is to pay the judgment, the
liability of the surety or sureties attaches upon the rendition of the
judgment, and the issue of an execution and its return <span class="SpellE"><u>nulla</u></span>
<u>bona</u> is not, and should not be, a condition to the right to resort to
the bond.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that under Section 17 recovery from the surety or
sureties should be "after notice and summary hearing in the same
action".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this requirement has
been substantially complied with from the time the surety was allowed to move
for the <span class="SpellE">quashal</span> of the writ of execution and for the
cancellation of their obligation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the orders appealed from are reversed, and the
court of origin is ordered to proceed with the execution against the surety <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, Times Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against said <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.</span></p>
