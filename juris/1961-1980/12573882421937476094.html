				<H3>PANGASINAN TRANSPORTATION CO., INC., PETITIONER, VS. RICARDO FELICIANO, RESPONDENT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition filed by the Pangasinan Transportation Co., Inc. to review 
and revoke a decision rendered on 25 August 1958 by the Public Service 
Commission granting to Ricardo Feliciano, the applicant therein and respondent 
herein, a certificate of public convenience to operate for twenty-five years 
four auto-trucks of any make, with fixed route and regular termini, for 
transportation of passengers and freight on the line Moncada to Tarlac 
<i>via</i> Gerona and vice versa in the province of Tarlac and subject to the 
terms and conditions enumerated therein (Case No. 113880).
<p>It appears that on 10 March 1958 the respondent Ricardo Feliciano applied to 
the Public Service Commission for a certificate of public convenience to operate 
seven units on the above-mentioned line. On 18, 25 and 26 March 1958 Jose M. 
Villarama, the Pangasinan Transportation Co., Inc. and the Estate of Florencio 
Buan, respectively, filed their objection to the application. The Pangasinan 
Transportation Co., Inc. petitioner herein, alleged that its service as 
operator, together with that rendered by other operators, on the line applied 
for is more than satisfactory, as shown by its overwhelming evidence; that the 
granting of the application would result in ruinous competition; and that being 
a pre-war and present operator with its units having been fully rehabilitated it 
is entitled to protection; and prayed for a stay of the decision sought to be 
reviewed and revoked. At the hearing, only the petitioner introduced evidence to 
support its objection. The Estate of Florencio Buan made its own the evidence 
presented by the petitioner. Jose M. Villarama did not appear at the hearing. 
After hearing, the Public Service Commission rendered a decision granting to the 
applicant a certificate of public convenience but only for four units.</p>
<p>The errors claimed by the petitioner to have been committed by the Public 
Service Commission are the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Public Service Commission erred in not holding that as the present case 
is merely an application for the increase of respondent's trips on the line 
Moncada (Tarlac)—Tarlac (Tarlac) where he is presently operating, his percentage 
tax payment (Exh. "74", Pantranco) does not warrant the proposed increase.</p>
<p>The Public Service Commission erred in granting the respondent a certificate 
of public convenience notwithstanding the insufficiency of the evidence to 
reasonably support the grant of the certificate.</p>
<p>The Public Service Commission erred in not holding that the approval of the 
application would cause ruinous competition among the petitioner, the respondent 
and other present operators on the line covered by the application, and which 
would undoubtedly be detrimental to public necessity and 
convenience.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the decision under review the Public Service Commission states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>* * * that he (the applicant, respondent herein) is a textile merchant who 
sells and travels to Tarlac on Sundays, Gerona on Tuesdays, Moncada on Thursdays 
and Saturdays, and Paniqui on Mondays, Fridays and sometimes on Wednesdays; that 
he has been travelling since 1952 and that during his travels he occasionally 
uses the Pangasinan Transportation Co. buses, sometimes the pick-ups of 
Policarpio Gutierrez; that there are only two (2) units being operated by the 
Pantranco; that Mr. Policarpio Gutierrez operates four (4) units; that all in 
all, the interval of trips of the operations of the Pantranco and Policarpio 
Gutierrez, if combined, would be about one hour; that there are many passengers 
like vendors, farmers, employees, merchants, students and teachers, who travel 
along the proposed line; that the Pantranco, the Philippine Rabbit, Binalonan 
Liner and other TPU auto-truck operators seldom pick up passengers along the way 
especially if they are carrying cargoes or baggages with them and traveling on 
short distances. Mr. Hipolito Macaspac of Paniqui, Tarlac, testified that he is 
a textile vendor; that he sells his goods in Moncada and sometimes in Gerona; 
that he goes to Tarlac on Sundays; Gerona on Tuesdays; Moncada on Thursdays and 
then sells his goods in Paniqui on Fridays; that he uses the pick-ups of 
Policarpio Gutierrez and the Vendor's Liner, whose interval of trips is one hour 
and two hours, respectively; that he had no occasion to ride on the Pantranco 
buses because they are always invariably full of passengers and mostly express 
trips; that he likewise had no occasion to ride on the buses of the Philippine 
Rabbit and the Binalonan Liner because they come from the north and most of them 
are operating express trips; that before a passenger could get a ride in 
Paniqui, he has to wait for two (2) hours; that the pick-ups operating are 
usually full of passengers; that this condition is also true in getting 
transportation in Moncada.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the oppositor, Pangasinan Transportation Company presented 
its evidence tending to show that there are many pick-ups such as the Tarlac 
Especial, Lucky Carrier, San Sebastian, Vendor Liner, and others, which operate 
along the proposed line; that the Dangwa Transportation Co., Philippine Babbit, 
B. de Castro, Villa-Rey, Angat-Manila, operate buses on the line; that the load 
of these buses are usually 1/2 and at most 2/3 of their capacity; that it takes 
at most about 15 minutes only to wait for the passenger bus or pick-up; that the 
Pangasinan Transportation Company operate trips from Tarlac to Cuyapo via 
Moncada; from Tarlac to Rosales via Moncada; from Tarlac to Baguio via Moncada 
and also from points north like Lingayen, Dagupan, San Fernando, etc, passing 
Moncada to Manila; that it makes a total of 50 round trips passing Moncada and 
Tarlac aside from the trips made by pick-ups on the line in question; that the 
interval of trips on the line passing Tarlac and Moncada is sometimes 20 or 25 
minutes; that the interval of trips of the different buses between Moncada and 
Tarlac via Gerona is every 5 minutes; that the buses are usually half full only 
of passengers and it is only during fiestas and special occasions that these 
buses become full; that applicant paid only a total of P454.09 from January, 
1957 to March, 1958, as evidenced by the certification of the Municipal 
Treasurer of Paniqui, Tarlac, which shows that his buses are not full everyday 
as alleged by the applicant on the lines presently operated by him which touches 
the Municipalities of Tarlac and Moncada.</p></blockquote>
<p>and, after taking into consideration the evidence, found— </p>
<blockquote>
<p>* * * that public convenience will be promoted in a proper and suitable 
manner by granting to applicant a certificate of public convenience for the 
operation of four (4) units on the line Moncada (Tarlac)—Tarlac (Tarlac) via 
Gerona and vice versa.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing considerations, and it appearing on the evidence of 
record that applicant is a Filipino citizen and actually an operator of TPU 
auto-trucks service on three (3) different lines and therefore financially 
capable to operate the said service, the present application may be, as it is 
hereby approved on the line above specified. The oppositions filed herein are 
hereby overruled and in pursuance to (of) the provisions of Section 15 of 
Commonwealth Act 146, as amended, the certificate of public convenience herein 
applied for as (is) granted to the applicant, * * *</p></blockquote>
<p>It is a settled rule that the findings and conclusions of fact by the Public 
Service Commission after weighing the conflicting evidence adduced by the 
parties in public service cases are binding on the Supreme Court and will not be 
disturbed unlless they appear not to be reasonably supported by evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p>In the case of Raymundo Transportation Co., Inc. vs. Cervo, (91 Phil., 313), 
this Court held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether public necessity and convenience warrant the putting up of additional 
service on the part of the appellee, is a question of fact which the Public 
Service Commission has found in the affirmative. This finding, being supported 
by sufficient evidence, should not be disturbed. * * *</p></blockquote>
<p>The decision appealed from is affirmed with costs against the petitioner.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, Paredes,
