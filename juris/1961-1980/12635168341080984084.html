				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This Court is prayed by appellant, <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span>
Surety &amp; Insurance Company, to reverse the decision of the Court of First
Instance of Manila condemning it to pay to the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
National Marketing Corporation, the principal sum of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>,
plus P9,990.91 in accrued interest up to 1 November 1964, and interest
thereafter at 7% per annum on the principal and 6% on the accrued interest,
together with 10% on the total amount due by way of attorney’s fees and costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal being made directly to this Supreme Court, the facts
found by the court below must be held binding upon this appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such facts are stated in the appealed
decision to be as follows (Record on Appeal, pages 18-21):</p>

<p class="2Q">"'From the evidence thus presented, it appears that under the
provisions of Executive Order No. 350, Series of 1950, all the properties,
rights, obligations, and contracts of the Philippine Relief and Trade Rehabi­litation
Administration (PRATRA) had been transferred to the Price Stabilization
Corporation (PRISCO). Also, by virtue of Republic Act No. 1345, as amended, all
rights and contracts of the PRISCO involving real estate, fixed assets and
stock in trade had been assumed by herein plaintiff, the NAMARCO.</p>

<p class="2Q">It also appears that on June 24, 1950, defendant Marquez secured
from the PRATRA one (1) tractor and one (1) rice thresher, with a total value
of P20,000.00, for which the said defendant paid thereon the sum of P8,000.00
as down payment, thereby leaving a balance of P12,000.00, as evidenced by an
invoice marked as Exhibit A.</p>

<p class="2Q">On the same date, defendant Marquez executed a promissory note in
the amount of P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> payable in installments
commencing from <st1:date year="1951" day="24" month="6">June 24, 1951</st1:date>
to <st1:date year="1952" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1952</st1:date>, with
interest thereon at the rate of 7% per annum from <st1:date year="1950" day="24" month="6">June 24, 1950</st1:date> until finally paid, which promissory note is
marked in this case as Exhibit B.</p>

<p class="2Q">It is further stipulated in the aforesaid promissory note that in
the event of failure of the said defendant to pay the principal obligation or
interest thereon when due and payable, an additional sum equivalent to 10% of
the total amount due shall be paid as attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="2Q">To guarantee full compliance with the afore­mentioned obligation,
defendant Marquez, as Principal, and defendant <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span>
Surety &amp; Insurance Company, as surety, executed Guaranty Bond P. S. &amp;.
I. No, 4220 in favor of the PRATRA, wherein they bound themselves, jointly and
severally, to pay the said amount of P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
(Exhibit C).</p>

<p class="2Q">In this guaranty bond, the surety expressly waives its right to
demand payment and notice of non-payment and agrees that the liabilities of
this guaranty shall be direct and immediate and not contingent upon the
exhaustion by the PRATRA of whatever remedies it may have against the
principal, and that the same shall be valid and continuous until the obligation
so guaranteed is paid in full (Exhibit C-1).</p>

<p class="2Q">After making partial payments in the sums of P2<span class="GramE">,870.19</span>
and P326.77 on July 7, 1951 and February 23, 1952, respectively, defendant
Marques defaulted in the payment of the other installments, so that the total
amount due NAMARCO as of October 31, 1964 is P19, 990.91, re­presenting
principal and accrued interest, as shown in a statement of account marked as
Exhibit D.</p>

<p class="2Q">On <st1:date year="1956" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1956</st1:date>,
<st1:date year="1963" day="16" month="2">February 16, 1963</st1:date>, <st1:date year="1964" day="10" month="6">June 10, 1964</st1:date>, <st1:date year="1964" day="18" month="9">September 18, 1964</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1964" day="13" month="10">October 13, 1964</st1:date>, plaintiff demanded from
defendants Marquez and <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> Surety &amp;
Insurance Company payment of their outstanding obligation, as shown in Exhibits
E, E-2, E-3, E-4, E-6, E-8, E-10, and E-12. The claim, therefore, of defendant <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> Surety &amp; Insurance Company that they never
received a demand for payment from plaintiff must necessarily fail, considering
that it is clearly shown in registry return receipts marked as Exhibits E-5,
E-9, E-11, and E-13 that the same had been received by the addressee.</p>

<p class="2Q">As the said amount was not paid despite the afore­mentioned demands
<span class="SpellE">therefor</span> upon the said defendants, the present action
was instituted on <st1:date year="1964" day="16" month="12">December 16, 1964</st1:date>,
to enforce collection.'"</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The appellant surety company poses three
questions for our resolution:</p>

<p class="NUM">(1) Whether the Court of First Instance had original jurisdiction
to take cognizance of the suit;</p>

<p class="NUM">(2) Whether the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
action is barred by prescription;</p>

<p class="NUM">(3) Whether the surety's liability can exceed the sum of P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the first question tendered, appellant surety company argues
that since the balance due on the principal of the promissory note guaranteed
by it is only P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, in view of the debtor's
payment of P2,000.00 on account of the principal of the loan, jurisdiction lay
with the Municipal Court, and not on the Court of First Instance, pursuant to
section 44 (c) of the Judiciary Act, as amended by Republic Act No. 3828.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is without merit, for it ignores the fact that
upon the terms of the promissory note, Exhibit "B", copy of which was
attached to the guaranty bond, as its annex "A", default upon the
principal or interest entitled the credi­tor to an additional ten per centum of
the total amount due for attorneys' fees and costs of collection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even disregarding interest overdue and
payable, when the complaint was filed the creditor-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
was entitled to collect no less than P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> on the
loan plus P1,000.00 attorneys' fees, or a total of P11,000.00. The initial
limit of the original jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance under
Republic Act No. 3828 being -</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">all</span> cases in
which the demand, <u>exclusive of interest</u>, or the value of the property in
controversy, amounts to more than ten thousand pesos".</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">the</span> court below
did not incur in this error.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention that plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
cause of action against the surety was barred by the statute of limitations in
1964, because the face value of the promissory note fell due on <st1:date year="1962" day="25" month="6">25 June 1962</st1:date>, is likewise
untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The course of extinctive
prescription was interrupted by the written demands for payment made upon the
principal debtor on <st1:date year="1956" day="22" month="3">22 March 1956</st1:date>,
<st1:date year="1963" day="16" month="2">16 February 1963</st1:date>, and June,
September and October of 1964, copies of which were furnished the surety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 1115 of the Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
prescribes that "the prescription of actions is interrupted – when there
is a written extrajudicial demand by the creditor". </p>

<p class="BODY">The surety avers that a demand upon the debtor is no demand upon
the surety, and that the copies of the letters of demand upon the former do not
constitute a demand upon the guarantor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This thesis is worthless because (a) the liability of the appellant was
expressly made <u>joint and several</u> by the terms of the guaranty bond, and
(b) for the reason that, in the latter document, "the surety also waives
its right to demand payment and notice of non-payment" (<st1:city><st1:place>Bend</st1:place></st1:city>,
paragraph 3).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The words "demand
payment" <span class="SpellE"><u>vis-a-vis</u></span> the creditor can only
refer to "demand for payment".</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Laches</span> not having been invoked as a
defense in the court below, the same can not be gone into at this stage of the
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the
established jurisprudence is that mere delay of the creditor in proceeding
against the principal debtor does not release the guarantor (<span class="SpellE">Lavides</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Eleazar</span>, 106 Phil.
576, 579, and cases therein cited), and much less will it relieve a surety, who
is <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable with the main debtor.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the third and last issue, it is enough to remark that while
the guarantee was for the original amount of the debt of <span class="SpellE">Gabino</span>
Marquez, the amount of the judgment by the trial court in no way violates the
rights of the surety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment on
the principal was only for P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, while the
remaining P9,990.91 represent the <span class="SpellE"><u>moratory</u></span>
interest due on account of the failure to pay the principal obligation from and
after the same had fallen due, and default had taken place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant surety was fully aware that the
obligation earned interest, since the note was annexed to its contract, Exhibit
"C".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contract of guaranty
executed by the appellant Company nowhere excludes this interest, and Article
2055, para­graph 2, of the Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is clearly applicable. </p>

<blockquote>"If it (the guaranty) be simple or
indefinite, it shall comprise not only the principal obligation <u>but also all
its accessories</u>, including judicial costs, provided with respect to the
latter, that the guarantor shall only be liable for those costs incurred after
he has been judicially required to pay. "<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

1889, couched in terms similar to the one quoted, <span class="SpellE">Manresa</span>,
