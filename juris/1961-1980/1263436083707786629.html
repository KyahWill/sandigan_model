				<H3>ESTRELLA B. ONDOY, PETITIONER, VS. VIRGILIO IGNACIO, PROPRIETOR M/B LADY ESTRELLITA AND/OR IMPERIAL FISHING ENTERPRISES AND/OR THE SECRETARY OF LABOR AND/OR THE COMPENSATION APPEALS AND REVIEW STAFF, DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, RESPONDENTS.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The undisputed facts argue strongly for the granting of the claim for compensation filed by petitioner, the mother of one Jose Ondoy, who was drowned while in the employ of private respondent, Virgilio Ignacio.&nbsp; Whatever be the cause for the failure to do so, it is admitted that there was no controversion.&nbsp; Such omission, fatal in character, was sought to be minimized by the filing of a motion to dismiss based on the alleged absence of an employment relationship.&nbsp; What cannot be ignored, however, is that subsequently, in the hearing of such claim, private respondent submitted affidavits executed by the chief engineer and oiler of the fishing vessel that the deceased, a fisherman, was in that ship, undeniably a member of the working force, but after being invited by friends to a drinking spree, left the vessel, and thereafter was found dead.&nbsp; The referee summarily ignored the affidavit of the chief-mate of respondent employer to the effect "that sometime in October, 1968, while Jose Ondoy, my co-worker, was in the actual performance of his work with said fishing enterprises, he was drowned and died on October 22, 1968.&nbsp; That the deceased died in line of duty."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The hearing officer or referee dismissed the claim for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> A motion for reconsideration was duly filed, but in an order dated August 29, 1977, the then Secretary of Labor, now Minister Blas F. Ople, denied such motion for reconsideration for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Hence this petition for review.<br><ol><li>In <i>La Mallorca v. Workmen's Compensation Commission</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> this Court explicitly held that the failure to controvert "is fatal to any defense that petitioner could interpose.&nbsp; So we have held in a host of decisions in compliance with the clear and express language of the Workmen's Compensation Act.&nbsp; Any assertion to the contrary is doomed to futility."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The opinion noted thirty decisions starting from Bachrach <i>Motor Co. v. Workmen's Compensation Com­mission</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> to <i>Northwest Orient Airlines, Inc. v. Workmen's Compensation Commission</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Thereafter, in <i>Regal Auto Works, Inc. v. Workmen's Compensation Commission</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> such a doctrine was reaffirmed.&nbsp; It was further noted that nine more decisions had been rendered by this Court starting from <i>Republic v. Workmen's Compensation Commission</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> to <i>Abong v. Workmen's Compensation Commission</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> By the time respondent Secretary of Labor denied the motion for reconsideration, a host of decisions that speaks to the same effect had been promul­gated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> It clearly appears, therefore, that the failure of the referee to grant the award ought to have been remedied and the motion for reconsideration granted.<br><br></li><li>The deceased in this case met his death because of drowning.&nbsp; In <i>Camotes Shipping Corpo­ration v. Otadoy</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> there was not even any direct testimony that the deceased was drowned while in the performance of his duty.&nbsp; All that could be alleged was that he "was lost at sea while in the employ of petitioner."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Nonethe­less, the award for compensation was sustained.&nbsp; Likewise, the ruling in <i>Caltex (Phil.) Inc. v. Villanueva</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> was cited with approval.&nbsp; Thus:&nbsp; "The fact that the employee was found missing while on board the petitioner's vessel MV 'Caltex Mindanao' became known to the captain of the vessel on 10 October 1956 but it was only on 6 November 1956 when the petitioner transmitted to the respondent Commission WCC Form No. 3 stating that the employee was 'lost at sea and presumed dead as of October 10, 1956,' and that it was controverting the respondent's claim."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> In the present case, there is evidence of the fact of death due to drowning.&nbsp; That was not controverted.&nbsp; Under the circumstances, the failure to grant the claim finds no justification in law.<br><br></li><li>It bears repeating that there is evidence, direct and categorical, to the effect that the deceased was drowned while "in the actual perform­ance of his work" with the shipping enterprise of private respondent.&nbsp; Even without such evidence, the petitioner could have relied on the presumption of compensability under the Act once it is shown that the death or disability arose in the course of employment, with the burden of overthrowing it being cast on the person or entity resisting the claim.&nbsp; Time and time again this Court has stressed such statutory provision.&nbsp; It suffices to mention cases decided from January to April of this year.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> An appraisal of the counter-affidavits submitted by two employees of private respondent and there­after beholden to him to the effect that the deceased left the vessel for a drinking spree certainly cannot meet the standard required to negate the force of the presumption of compensa­bility.<br><br></li><li>Nor is an affirmance of the finding of the referee adverse to the claim warranted because of the doctrine that the findings of facts of an administrative agency must be accorded due weight and consideration.&nbsp; An excerpt from the recent case of <i>Uy v. Workmen's Compensation Commission</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> finds pertinence:&nbsp; "The claim merits scant conside­ration for this Court is authorized to inquire into the facts when the conclusions are not supported by substantial or credible evidence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]<br><br></sup></li><li>This Court, in recognizing the right of petitioner to the award, merely adheres to the interpretation uninterruptedly followed by this Court resolving all doubts in favor of the claimant.&nbsp; So it has been since the first leading case of <i>Francisco v. Conching</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> decided a year after the 1935 Constitution took effect.&nbsp; What was said in <i>Victorias Milling Co., Inc. v. Workmen's Compensation Commission</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> is not amiss:&nbsp; "There is need, it seems, even at this late date, for [private respondent] and other employers to be reminded of the high estate accorded the Workmen's Compensation Act in the constitutional scheme of social justice and protection to labor."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Further:&nbsp; "No other judicial attitude may be expected in the face of a clearly expressed legislative determination which antedated the constitutionally avowed concern for social justice and protection to labor.&nbsp; It is easily understandable why the judiciary frowns on resort to doctrines, which even if deceptively plausible, would result in frustrating such a national policy."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Lastly, to quote from the opinion therein rendered:&nbsp; "To be more specific, the principle of social justice is in this sphere strengthened and vitalized.&nbsp; A realistic view is that expressed in <i>Agustin v. Workmen's Compensation Commission</i>:&nbsp; 'As between a laborer, usually poor and unlettered, and the employer, who has resources to secure able legal advice, the law has reason to demand from the latter stricter compliance.&nbsp; Social justice in these cases is not equality but protection.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></li></ol><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for review is granted and petitioner Estrella B. Ondoy is awarded the sum of P6,000.00 as compensation for the death of her son, Jose Ondoy; P300.00 for burial expenses; and P600.00 as attorney's fees.&nbsp; This decision is immediately executory.&nbsp; Costs against private respondent Virgilio Ignacio. <br><br><i>Antonio, Aquino, Concepcion, Jr., Abad Santos</i>, and <i>De Castro, JJ.</i>, concur. <br><i>Barredo, J.</i>, is on leave.<br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Annex C-1.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Petition, par. 8.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>Ibid.,</i> par. 11.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> L-29315, November 28, 1969, 30 SCRA 613.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <i>Ibid.,</i> 619-620.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 99 Phil. 238 (1956).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> L-25274, July 29, 1969, 28 SCRA 877.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> L-29455, September 30, 1975, 67 SCRA 207.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> L-26763, December 26, 1969, 30 SCRA 811.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> L-32347, December 26, 1973, 54 SCRA 379.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Cf. <i>Security Services v.
