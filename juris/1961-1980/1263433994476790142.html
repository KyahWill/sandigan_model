After the "special piece" given in the honor of David <span class="SpellE">Abejuela</span>, <span class="SpellE">Petronilo</span> Lozano, and

destroyed by it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man, later

did not answer, and just mumbled:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Linte</span>, <span class="SpellE">linte</span>, why did you tie
your <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> on this <span class="SpellE">dinog</span>

grappling near the gate of the cockpit because if it were so, <span style="">he would have also sustained some gunshot

<blockquote>"A careful scrutiny and evaluation of the evidence presented
by the state leads the court to the conclusion that both of the accused are
responsible criminally for the killing of the victim <span class="SpellE">Blas</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pacete</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
cir­cumstances surrounding the crime show that they cooperated with each other
in the aggres­sion which was unprovoked.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>David <span class="SpellE">Abejuela</span> cooperated in the execution of
the crime not only by provoking the deceased whom he tried to drag outside the
cockpit, but also by shoot­ing him with his own gun after said victim was
felled by the shot of Ramon and missed only because the deceased rolled on the
ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The shooting of the victim from
behind by the ac­cused Ramon <span class="SpellE">Abejuela</span> as he was
resisting the effort of the other accused David <span class="SpellE">Abejuela</span>
to drag him outside the cockpit was clearly characterized by treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The position of his wound which entered
behind his left knee-­cap and went out in front leaves no room for doubt that
the deceased was shot from the rear.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This circumstance demolishes completely David <span class="SpellE">Abejuela's</span>
claim of shooting him in self-defense as they confronted each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ramon <span class="SpellE">Abejuela's</span>
mere denial cannot prevail over the positive testimonies of the witnesses for
the prosecution who saw him deliver the fatal shot <span style="">at the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimonies
of Angel <span class="SpellE">Agbayani</span> and <span class="SpellE">Melanio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Laindag</span> in support of the theory of the defense
cannot be given credence because both of them appeared clearly biased especially
<span class="SpellE">Laindag</span> who gave an entirely different version of the
incident in his sworn statement to the municipal judge of Valencia when he was
investigated on Dec. 19, 1968.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Ramon <span class="SpellE">Abejuela</span> insists that David <span class="SpellE">Abejuela</span> alone is accountable for the death of <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacete</span> and assails the trial
court for believing the witnesses for the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ap­pellant more particularly impugns the
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Mensalbas</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Nabaja</span> as unworthy
of credence, the former because of his relationship with the deceased and his
inconsistent statement, and the latter for the contradictions in his testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has continually ruled that the matter of assign­ing
values to the testimony of witnesses is best performed by trial judges because
they, unlike appellate judges, can weigh such testimony in the light of the
demeanor, conduct, and attitude of the witnesses at the trial, and their
findings of fact may not be overturned unless there is a showing that in making
the factual findings, the trial court had overlooked or failed to consider
certain facts of weight and importance that could have<span style=""> materially affected the conclusion reached in the case.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>The fact that <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mensalbas</span> is related to the deceased does not
disqualify him from testifying; nor does it render his tes­timony utterly
devoid of belief, in the absence of an improper motive actuating him to testify
falsely against the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
contradictions and inconsistencies in the testimony of the witnesses, pointed
out by the appellant, refer to minor details and are not of such magnitude and
character as to lead one to believe that these witnesses were coached or
tutored.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the claim that David <span class="SpellE">Abejuela</span>
alone is responsible for the death of <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacete</span> and that Ramon <span class="SpellE">Abejuela</span>
did not participate in the commission of the crime is not consistent with the
truth and the physical facts of the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Naba­ja</span>, <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Mensalbas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Esequio</span> <span class="SpellE">Taghap</span> categorically
declared that Ramon <span class="SpellE">Abejuela</span> shot <span class="SpellE">Blas</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pacete</span> from behind while David <span class="SpellE">Abejuela</span>
was holding <span class="SpellE">Pacete</span> by the arm and <span class="SpellE">Pacete</span>
was holding on to a post with his other hand.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the nature of the gunshot wound sustained by the deceased,
which had its point of entry at the back of the knee cap and its point of exit
at the front of the leg, fracturing the leg bones, with maceration of the skin,
muscles, and protrusion of the tibia, belies the claim of David <span class="SpellE">Abejuela</span> that he shot <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacete</span>, in self-defense, while they were facing each other.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant also claims that the trial court erred in
appreciating treachery as an aggravating circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Treachery was considered in this case as the
qualifying circumstance and is evident from the fact that <span class="SpellE">Blas</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pacete</span> was shot from behind by Ramon <span class="SpellE">Abejuela</span> while David <span class="SpellE">Abejuela</span> was
holding <span class="SpellE">Pacete's</span> arm, pulling <span class="SpellE">Pacete</span>
towards him, and <span class="SpellE">Pacete</span> was holding on to a post with
his other hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Blas</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pacete</span> was unarmed and the attack was sudden and
unexpected and there was no risk at all to the assailant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant claims that there is no conspiracy and evident
premeditation in the commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The unity of purpose and community of design is apparent from the fact
that Ramon <span class="SpellE">Abejuela</span> shot <span class="SpellE">Blas</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pacete</span> while David <span class="SpellE">Abejuela</span>
was holding <span class="SpellE">Pacete's</span> arm; that David <span class="SpellE">Abejuela</span> also shot <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacete</span> when the latter fell after being shot by Ramon <span class="SpellE">Abejuela</span>; and that they fled from the scene of the crime
and hid in the mill of one Mr. <span class="SpellE">Caluya</span> and went together
to Valencia the following morning to file a complaint against <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacete</span> and others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, We agree with the appellant that there
was no <span style="">evident premedi­</span>tation
because their meeting with <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pacete</span></span><span style=""> was not sought </span>after and no sufficient period of time intervened <span style="">between the </span>time the killing was
conceived, up to the <span style="">time of its
perpetration </span>for the accused to have made a cool and circumspect <span style="">delibera­</span>tion of the consequences of
their intended act.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant further contends that the lower court erred in not
appreciating the negligence of the doctor of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype><span style="">Hospital</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> which helped in the e<span style="">arly death of th</span>e<span style=""> </span>victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The </span></span>contention
is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The general rule is
that "he who inflicts the injury is not relieved <span style="">of responsibility if the wound </span>inflicted is dangerous, that is,
calculated to destroy or endanger life, even though the immediate cause of
death was erroneous or unskillful medical or surgical treatment."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
The gravity of the wound inflicted is apparent from the fact that <span style="">the leg </span>bones were fractured and the
skin and <span style="">muscles macerated, and </span>necessitated
amputation of the leg.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the appellant claims that the lower court did not take
cognizance of the caliber of the guns used by Ramon and David <span class="SpellE">Abejuela</span> in the shooting <span class="GramE">incident</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues, thusly:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"On pages 69, 89, 90 of the notes, during the direct and
cross-examination of <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Mensalbas</span>,
witness for the prosecution, the latter testified the gun used in the shooting
was a 'de <span class="SpellE">viente</span>' - caliber-gun using the bullet of a
shotgun which is of the pellet type.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
Ramon shot <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacete</span>
while the latter was grappling with David <span class="SpellE">Abejuela</span>,
the distance being only 'about one meter, p. 69', David could have suffered
gunshot wounds too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, if the shot
that inflicted the wounds was made by David, 'David <span class="SpellE">Abejuela</span>
used that pistol of his in shooting <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacete</span> but <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacete</span> was able to avoid that, p. 69', it is natural that
the pellet would not spread due to the closeness of the actor and the
victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This latter assumption would
tally with the confession of David <span class="SpellE">Abejuela</span> that he
shot the victim, p. 177 of the notes."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The caliber of the guns used in the shooting and wounding of the
victim <span class="GramE">which</span> resulted in his ultimate death is
immaterial in view of the positive testimony of the prosecution witnesses that
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Abejuela</span> shot <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacete</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the
appellant did not present a ballistics expert to sustain his claim that with
the type of ammunition he used in shooting <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacete</span>, which incidentally shattered the leg bones, thus
precluding a finding that the type of shotgun shell used contained only tiny
pellets, David <span class="SpellE">Abejuela</span>, standing about a meter away
from the victim, would have also sustained gunshot wounds.</p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel for the appellant "advances the theory that had
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Abejuela</span> really shot <span class="SpellE">Blas</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pacete</span>, considering the weapon used, the part of the
body injured, the injury inflicted and the manner it was inflicted negated the
crime of 'Murder', for Ramon<span style=""> showed no
intent to kill <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacete</span>."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the circumstances of the case show that Ramon <span class="SpellE">Abejuela</span> did not intend to kill <span class="SpellE">Blas</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pacete</span> since the shot was directed towards the calf
of the leg and not towards a vital part of the body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, he is responsible for the
consequences of his act, which is, the death of <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacete</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he had
not assaulted <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacete</span>
in a treacherous manner, he would have been found guilty of homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, since the act was committed with
treachery, the defendant, although he did not intend to kill the deceased, is
guilty of murder because of the qualifying circumstance of treachery.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
The lack of intention to commit so grave a wrong as that committed may only be
considered as<span style=""> a mitigating
circumstance.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, therefore, correctly found the accused Ramon <span class="SpellE">Abejuela</span> guilty of the crime of Murder, qualified by
treachery, and attended by the aggravating circumstance of recidivism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, the court erred in imposing the death
penalty upon the said accused in view of the presence of the mitigating
circumstance of lack of intention to commit so grave a wrong as that committed
which would offset the aggravating circums­tance of recidivism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> is the proper penalty to be imposed upon
the accused Ramon <span class="SpellE">Abejuela</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of the trial court is hereby
affirmed, with the modification that the accused Ramon <span class="SpellE">Abejuela</span>
should suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With costs against the
