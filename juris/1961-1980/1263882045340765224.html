<p class="BODY">The legal issues to be resolved in this case are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) Whether or not the alleged amendatory de­cision
and resolution of the Respondent Court of Appeals were issued without or in
excess of its ju­risdiction or with grave abuse of discretion and (2) whether
or not a final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment of the
Respondent Court of Appeals can still be the subject of a review by <i>certiorari</i>
by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records of this case show that the filing of the motion to
amend the decision of the Court of Appeals was brought about by the error of
omission committed by the Clerk of Court of the Respondent Court of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In making the Entry of Judgment
in CA-G. R. No. 23988-R, <span style="">on </span>June
26, 1964, the Clerk of Court, instead of reproducing the entire <span class="SpellE">dispo­sitive</span> portion of the decision rendered therein,
merely quoted the last sentence thereof - "The ap­pealed judgment is
reversed, with costs against defendants." - leaving the preceding portion
which resolved the issues pertaining to the rights and obligations brought on
appeal by the contending parties therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The omitted <span class="SpellE">decretal</span> portion states that
"Accordingly, defendant <span style="">Jose </span><span class="SpellE">Ilacad</span> either exceeded his authority in executing said
promissory note, or was not so authorized, so much so that he should be, as he
is hereby held personally liable for the payment of P15,000.00 with 8%
interests annually from October 20, 1956, till fully paid, in favor of
plaintiff bank." It was this particular o<span style="">mission </span>that snarled the proceedings incident to the execution
of said judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Clerk of Court of the
court of origin refused to embody in the writ of execution to be issued the
said omitted portion of the <span class="SpellE">decretal</span> part of the
decision, contending that the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part
consisted merely of what is stated in the Entry of Judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent bank, to avoid further delay in
the execution of the judgment, filed with the Respondent Court of Appeals the
Motion for Clarification that resulted in the issuance of an amendatory
decision varying the original <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of
the original decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amendatory
resolution dated <st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1964</st1:date>
last issued by the Respondent Court of Appeals, merely corrected the error of
making the defendants liable instead of Jose <span class="SpellE">Ilacad</span>
only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Respondent Court of Appeals,
in correcting the position of the comma to make the amount appear as P15,000.00
and rectifying the mistake in the formulation of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the first amendatory de­cision may not be said to have committed a
grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction or in excess of its
jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As </span>held by this
Court in the case of <u><span style="">Filipino Legion
Corporation vs. Court of Appeals</span></u><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
a judgment, even after it had become final, where there is an ambiguity caused
by an omission or mistake in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion,
the court may clarify such ambiguity, mistake or omission by an amendment and
in so doing it may resort to the pleadings filed by the parties, the court's
findings of facts and conclusions of law as expressed in the body of the
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent portion of the
decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>"This Court in various instances stated the rule that the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of a decision contains the judg­ment of
the court which is to be the subject of execution, irrespective of all
seemingly contrary statements in the body of the decision itself, and in case
of any omission, or discrepancy between the opinion set forth in the decision
proper and the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part, the latter prevails.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Equally true, however, are the following principles also enunciated
by the Court, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of a decision must find support from the decision's <u><span style="">ratio <span class="SpellE">decidendi</span></span></u><span style=""> </span>(<span class="SpellE">Morelos</span>

<p class="2Q">'While the opinion of the court is not part of the judgment, it
may, in case of uncertainty or ambiguity, be referred to for the purpose of
construing the Judgment particularly where the law require the judge to state
the reason for the judgment as in case of an opinion by an appellate court or
where the judgment itself refers to the opinion in such a way as to make it
part of the record.'</p>

<blockquote>that where there is ambiguity caused by an
omission or <span style="">mistake in </span>the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of a decision the court may clarify
such ambiguity by an amendment even after the judgment had become final, and
for this purpose it may resort to the pleadings filed by the parties, the
court's findings <span style="">of </span>facts and
conclusions of law as expressed in the body of the decision."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

where this Court, through Associate Justice now Chief Justice Fred Ruiz Castro,
said:</p>

<blockquote>"The sufficiency and efficacy of a judgment must be tested by
its substance rather than its form.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
construing a judgment, its legal effects including such effects that
necessarily follow because of legal implications, rather than the language
used, govern.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, its meaning,
operation, and consequences must be ascertained like any other written
instrument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, a judgment rests on
the intention of the court as gathered from every part thereof, including the
situation to which it applies and the attend­ant circumstances.</blockquote>

<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>There is indeed much to be desired in the formulation by Judge <span class="SpellE">Amores</span> of that part of the <span class="SpellE">decretal</span>
portion of the judgment in Criminal Case 1158-0 referring to the civil
liability of <span class="SpellE">Punzalan</span> resulting from his criminal
conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judge could have been
forthright <span style="">and </span>direct instead of
circuitous and ambiguous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, as we
have above explained, the statement on the civil liability of <span class="SpellE">Punzalan</span> must surely have a meaning, and even if the
statement were reasonably susceptible of two or more interpretations, that
which achieves moral justice should be adopted, eschewing the other
interpretations which in effect <span style="">would </span>negate
moral justice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is not amiss at this juncture to emphasize to all magistrates in
all levels of the Judicial hierarchy that extreme degree of care should be
exercised in the formulation of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion
of a decision, because it is this portion that is to be executed once the
decision becomes final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The adjudication
of the rights and obligations of the parties, and the dispositions made as well
as the directions and instructions given by the court in the premises in
conformity with the body of the decision, must all be spelled out clearly,

after which judgment was entered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
second is by direct action to annul and enjoin the enforcement of the

the judgment, <span style="">if </span>not already
carried into effect; or if the property has already been disposed of, he may
institute suit to recover it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The third
is either a direct action, <span style="">as <i>certiorari</i>,
or </span>by a collateral attack against the challenged judgment (which) is
void upon its face, or that the nullity of the judgment is apparent by virtue
of its <span style="">own recitals."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Since the judgment rendered by the Respondent Court of Appeals in
CA-G. R. No. 23988-R, which had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
is not void upon its face and as a matter of fact its original <span class="SpellE">decretal</span> portion has only been clarified without any legal
right or obligation originally adjudicated to the contending parties taken out
or added therein, the same can only be annulled or set aside by direct action
on the ground of <u>extrinsic</u> fraud.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And speaking of <u>extrinsic</u> fraud, it is that fraudulent scheme of
the prevailing litigant which prevents a party from having his day in court or
from presenting his case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fraud has been
regarded as extrinsic or collateral, within the meaning of the rule,
"where it is one the effect of which prevents a party from having a trial,
or real contest, or from presenting all of his case to the court, <span style="">or </span>where it operates upon matters
pertaining not to the judgment itself, but to the manner by which it was
procured so that there is not a fair submission of the controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, extrinsic fraud refers to any
fraudulent act of the pre­vailing party in the litigation which is committed
outside of the trial of the case, where the defeated party has been prevented
from presenting <span style="">fully </span>his side
of the case, by fraud or deception practiced on him by his opponent."<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners herein can not complain that their
predecessor-in-interest was prevented from presenting fully his case because of
any fraudulent scheme employed by the Respondent Bank outside of the trial.</p>
