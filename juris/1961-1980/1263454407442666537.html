				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In the present appeal, we are asked by the State's counsel to
strike down the order of Judge Emigdio V. Nietes dated October 15, 1965 <span style="">in a </span>naturalization case,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>reconsidering the order of
denaturalization and confirming an order of naturalization previous thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">The dossier of this case yields the following facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 14, 1956, petitioner <span style="">was </span>declared a naturalized citizen of the Philippines in an
order issued by Judge Rafael Amparo, then of the Court of First Instance of
Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On July 19, 1958, following the
lapse of the two-year statutory period, three things happened:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>first, hearing on petitioner's oath-taking
was had; second, after hearing, petitioner subscribed to an oath of allegiance
before Judge Amparo; and third, Certificate of Naturalization No. 2414 was
issued to petitioner <span style="">by the </span>Clerk
of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 2, 1962, the Republic of the Philippines filed a petition
to declare null and void Judge Amparo's decision for lack of jurisdiction
because the petition was published only once in the Official Gazette; and,
likewise, to strip petitioner of Philippine citizenship because, amongst
others, his naturalization was obtained through fraud and falsification in that
he suppressed the fact that he had a common-law wife Mary Go <u>alias</u> Go
Ting Ty, with whom he had several children.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On July 26, 1965, upon this petition, the opposition and supplemental
opposi­tion thereto, the reply to both, and after a hearing at which <u><span style="">evidence </span>was adduced</u>, the court,
this time presided by Judge Jesus Y. Perez <a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
(now Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals) issued an order cancelling the
naturalization certificate issued to petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">On petitioner's motion for reconsideration, the opposition
thereto, reply to opposition, and memoranda filed by petitioner, another judge
on temporary assignment, Judge Emigdio V. Nietes, issued the order of October
15, 1965 - now the subject of review - reversing the order of Judge Perez of
July 26, 1965, and confirming Judge Amparo's order of naturalization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this appeal by the State.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The authority of Judge
Emigdio V. Nietes to resolve the motion for reconsideration, challenged herein,
stems from facts following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge Nietes
was the district judge of Iloilo and Iloilo City, Branch I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to Administrative Order No. 243 of
the Secretary of justice dated July 28, 1965, Judge Nietes was detailed to the
Court of First Instance of Manila "to take cognizance of all cases
pertaining to the Third Branch thereof, effective immediately and until further
orders" from the Department of Justice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This administrative order was approved by the Supreme Court in a
resolution dated August 10, 1965.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On October 11, 1965, the
President of the Philippines appointed, <u>ad</u> <u>interim</u>, Honorable
Placido C. Ramos, District Judge of the Sixth Judicial District, "to
preside over the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch III."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On October 12, 1965, Judge Placido C. Ramos
took his oath of office before Acting Secretary of Justice Ruperto G. Martin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He assumed his office on that same day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The questioned order
(dated October 15, 1965) of Judge Emigdio V. Nietes, temporarily assigned to
Branch III, was therefore issued three (3) days after Judge Placido C. Ramos
had entered into the performance of his duties as Judge of the same Branch III.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The question then is
this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did the appointment of and
assumption of office by Judge Ramos </span><u><span style="">ipso</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">facto</span></u><span style=""> terminate the authority of Judge Nietes to act in the present case?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The controlling legal
provision is Section 51 of the Judiciary Act of 1948, as amended, which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 51.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Detail</u>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is pertinent to state
here that on July 27, 1965, i.e., one day prior to July 28, 1965 (date of
Administrative Order 243), Judge Jesus Y. Perez was elevated to the Court of
Appeals.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Judge Perez could not thus act on
petitioner's motion for the reconsideration of his order of July 26, 1965,
which was filed on September 1, 1965.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And, the posi­tion of Judge of Branch III became vacant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">1. First to be assessed
is the reach of Administrative Order No. 243 aforesaid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the terms thereof, authority therefor
emanated from Section 51 of the Judiciary Act of 1948, as amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the power of Judge Nietes to
take cognizance of all cases pertaining to Branch III of the Manila court must
be circumscribed within the bounda­ries set forth in that statutory
provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no question in our
mind that for as long as Branch III remained vacant, so long did Judge Nietes
have authority to act on any and all cases assigned thereto within the
three-month limit fixed in Section 51.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">2. Could Judge Nietes
still act in a case like the present at a time when there is already a regular
judge?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The assignment of Judge Nietes is
specific, namely, to take cognizance of all cases pertaining to the Third
Branch of the Court of First Instance of Manila, which was then vacant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since a judge for that branch had been
appointed and qualified, the reason for the assignment no longer existed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the author­ity of Judge Nietes to
continue acting as judge of Branch III terminated as of October 12, 1965 when
Judge Ramos took his oath of office and started his duties as Judge thereof;
and, the authority of Judge Ramos to act on this case began.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">3. The view we take of
this case </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">not without reason. Firstly, except under
special circumstances by law specified, two judges cannot sit in the same
branch of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, one
temporarily assigned to a branch of a court of first instance because of an
existing vacancy thereof should not intrude into the functions of the regularly
appointed judge who has qualified to fill that vacancy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, confusion may arise as to the
assignment of cases amongst the two judges of equal rank; delineation of work
between them may result in lack of harmony; disputes between the two may crop
up; the machinery of justice may not run smoothly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>As early as 1906, this Court, in a decision
penned by Chief Justice Arellano, declared that "[t]he certification and
signing of a bill of ex­ceptions [now record on appeal] are jurisdictional acts
which can not be executed by one who has no jurisdiction over the matter on
account of his having ceased to be the judge of the court in which the case was
tried by him as such judge."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Chief
Justice Arellano added:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"He has no
right to exercise any jurisdiction in a court of</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">which he has ceased to
be the judge.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> As valid then is the precept that the act of
reversing a decision penned by one judge of a given court, is jurisdictional,
and cannot be done by another temporarily assigned thereto who has ceased to be
a judge thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appropriately had it
been said that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"A judge in one
district may preside in another district in place of the judge of the latter
district.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this does not authorize
two judges to hold separate courts in the same district at the same time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore an order made by a judge presiding
out of his district, at a time when the judge of the district where the order
is made is also holding court therein, <u>is</u> <u>void;</u> and no one can be
punished for contempt of court in disobeying such order."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">4. The case of the
disputed order does not come within the exception written in Section 9 of Rule
135 of the Rules of Court and the second paragraph of Section 51 of the
Judiciary Act of 1948, as amended. This is because the case was <u>not</u>
heard <u>totally,</u> or for that matter, partially, by Judge Nietes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, no evidence was taken before
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidence on the State's petition to
cancel naturalization was taken before the then Judge Perez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not, therefore, lawful for Judge
Nietes to </span>issue the controverted order of October 15, 1965 reversing
Judge Perez’ order of cancellation of July 26, 1965.</p>

<p class="BODY">5. But on top of all these is the fact that at the time Judge
Emigdio V. Nietes handed down the order of October 15, 1965, he was neither a
judge <u>de</u> <u>jure</u> nor a judge <u>de</u> <u>facto</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not a <u>de</u> <u>jure</u> judge, because
there was an incumbent <u>de</u> <u>jure</u> judge actually discharging the
duties of office; not a <u>de</u> <u>facto</u>, because there was a <u>de</u> <u>jure</u>
judge.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, to rise to the level of a de facto judge, one must be acting under some
color of right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No color of right here
existed as the vacancy in the office which Judge Nietes was temporarily
occupying had been filled up.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>The result is the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order of Judge Nietes is null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">6. The nullity of Judge Nietes’ order of October 15, 1965 poses
the problem of whether we are to remand the case to the lower court to resolve petitioner’s
motion to reconsider Judge Perez’ order of July 26, 1965, or, to pass upon the
merits of the said motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We opt for
the second.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There <span style="">is </span>no necessity for the lower court
to take evidence. For, both the order of Judge Perez and that of Judge Nietes
were based on the evidence already presented.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The soundness of Judge Nietes’ resolution on the issues of <span style="">fact </span>and of law is thoroughly
discussed in the briefs of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nothing more <span style="">is </span>to be
done except to grant or to deny the motion for reconsideration on the basis of
the evidence of record and the law applicable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Were the case to be remanded just for the lower court to resolve said
motion for reconsideration, nothing substantial will be accomplished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the motion be granted, surely enough, the
State will appeal, as it did in the present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If denied, the probability is that petitioner
will also appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, we have here a
case which may be bouncing back and forth from the lower court to the upper
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Multiple appeals are not favored.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sound practice seeks to accommodate the
theory which avoids waste of time, effort and expense, both to the parties and
the government, not to speak of delay in the disposal of the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
A marked characteristic of our judicial set-up is that where the dictates of
justice so demand - as in the present case - the final court, the Supreme
Court, should act, and act with finality.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And this we read from the following culled from <u>Samal</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Court</u>
<u>of</u> <u>Appeals,</u> 99 Phil. 230, 233 [underscoring supplied], which is
illuminating:</p>

<blockquote>"Now, as regards the question of procedure, as already said,
the trial court in a decision dismissed the complaint without prejudice to
filing a new suit against the administrator of the estate of Pascual
Libudan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reversing said decision, the
Court of Appeals held that there was no need of filing an action against said
adminis­trator because at the commencement of the present action in 1950, the
estate of Pascual Libudan no longer had any right or interest in the
property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ordinarily, when an order of
dismissal issued by the trial court <span style="">is </span>reversed on appeal, the case is remanded
to said trial court for further proceedings, particularly for the reception of
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present case, however, <u>the</u>
<u>trial</u> <u>court</u> <u>had</u> <u>already</u> <u>received</u> <u>all</u> <u>the</u>
<u>evidence </u><u><span style="">presented</span></u><span style=""> <u>by</u></span> <u>both</u> <u>parties,</u>
<u>consequently</u>, <u>the</u> <u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u><span style="">Appeals</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>was</u> <u>in</u> <u>a</u> <u>position</u> <u>to</u> <u>p</u><u><span style="">ass</span></u><span style=""> <u>upon</u></span> <u>as</u> <u>it</u> <u>did</u> <u>said</u> <u><span style="">evidence</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>and</u> <u>decide</u> <u>the case</u> <u>on</u> <u>its</u> <u>merits,</u>
and <u>there</u> <u>was no</u> <u>necessity</u> <u>for</u> <u>remanding</u> <u>the</u>
<u>case.</u>"<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">7. The procedural question out of the way, we turn first to the
merits of the State's charge that petitioner obtained his citizenship thru
fraud and falsification because "he suppressed and did not disclose the
truth which is that at the time he filed the petition and during the hearing
and his oath-taking he had a common-law wife, Mary Go, with whom he has several
children and he further alleged and testified during the trial that these
children were also the children of his real wife Go Koa when the truth is that
they are the children of his paramour, Mary Go."</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, in his petition for naturalization, alleges that
"he is of good moral character."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The State offered evidence in support of denaturalization motion that
petitioner had been living with and begot least four illegitimate children with
his common-law wife, Mary Go, alias Go Ting Ty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fact of illegitimate relationship between Go Ty and <span style="">petitioner herein
is confirmed by the execution by both</span> <u>petitioner</u> and Go Ting Ty
on August 6, 1959 of an affidavit labeled "Affidavit to be Accomplished in
case of an Illegitimate Child" (Exhibit F-1-Denaturalization),
acknowledging the illegitimate status of Ernesto Go, who was born on June 10,
1959 and whose certificate of live birth (Exhibit F-Denaturalization) is the
basis of the affidavit, Exhibit F-1.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The extramarital
relationship between petitioner and Mary Go, alias Go Ting Ty, finds support
elsewhere in the record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A recital of
the evidence as to Mariano Li - without taking into account the other children
allegedly begotten by petitioner with Mary Go, alias Go Ting Ty - suffices for
the purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner testified at the
original hearing of his petition <span style="">for </span>naturalization that in addition to the
two children, namely, Aida.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Li and
Ricardo Li mentioned in his said application, another child, Mariano Li, born
on February 23, 1954, was begotten by him with his wife, Go Koa.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He presented Mariano Li's birth certificate,
Exhibit P-2, and the latter's Alien Certificate of Registration, Exhibit O-2.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, according to Drs. Mercedes Villalobos and Servando
Arellano,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>who attended to the birth of Mariano

the person whose picture is Exhibits B-1 and B-2-Denaturalization, who is Go

The following from the findings of Judge Jesus Y. Perez, to which we fully
subscribe, constitute circumstantial evidence of the fact just mentioned:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x There could not have been any
mistake on the part of Drs. Servando Arellano and Mercedes Villalobos as to the
identity of the woman known as Mary Go whose alien certi­ficate of registration
is exhibit 'M-denaturalization' because the said doctors had assisted to the
four deliveries of said Mary Go whose pictures are marked as Exhibits ‘M-2-
denaturalization’, ‘<span style="">N</span>-1-denaturalization'
and:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'O-1-denaturali­zation'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, her unusual bulk of about 275 pounds

but leave a lasting impression as to her identity to Drs. AreIlano and
Villalobos whereas, Go Koa, the peti­tioner's wife, whose picture <span style="">is </span>Exhibit

<blockquote>According to Dr. Servando Arellano, the birth certi­ficate exhibit
'A-<span style="">denaturalization'</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>does not reflect the truth that the
child referred to in said certificate of birth, is the third child of Mary Go

<p class="BODY"><span style="">If Mariano Li was the
first child of Mary Go, alias Go Ting </span>Ty <span style="">said Mariano Li could not have been the third child of petitioner's
legitimate wife, Go Koa.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To further bolster
the foregoing findings, Judge Perez added:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Another circumstance showing that Go Koa, the petitioner's
wife, is not the mother of the child Mariano Li is that in the birth
certificate of said child exhibit 'A-denaturalization', the mother is recorded
as only being 23 years old when the child Mariano Li was born on February 23,
1954.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, since according to the alien
certificate of registration exhibit 'B-denaturalization' of Go Koa, she was
born on April 5, 1914 she was there<span style="">fore
already 40 years old and not 23 years when Mariano Li was born.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, Mary Go or Go Ting Ty must
be 23 years old when Mariano Li was born because according to her alien
certificate of registration exhibit 'M-2-denaturalization', she was born on May
10, 1931.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The age of 23 years of the
mother of Mariano Li appearing in the latter's birth certificate corresponds to
the age of Mary Go alias Go Ting Ty and not Go Koa who was already 40 years of
age at the time of Mariano's birth."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find, as did judge
Perez, that petitioner was guilty of fraud in presenting proof during the
course of the hearing of his petition for naturalization that Mariano Li is his
child with his lawful wife, Go Koa. He is not entitled to citizenship because
he did not conduct himself “in a proper and irreproachable manner during the
period of his residence in the Philippines" required in Section 2 of the
Naturalization Law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

states only 300 Sto. Cristo, Manila, and 428 Sto. Cristo, Manila, </span>as <span style="">his former places of residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support of his said application, how­ever,
petitioner testified:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Section 7 of the
Naturalization Law exacts that a petition for naturalization state petitioner's
"present and former places of </span>residence.” <span style="">The residence contemplated in Section 7 encompasses all places where
petitioner actually and physically resided.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Certainly, the particular place or places in the Province of Rizal where
he was residing for three or four years come within the purview of the term
"residence." The reason for this is that “information regarding
petitioner and objection to his application are apt to be provided by people in
his actual, physical surrounding.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">Failure to allege a former place of residence
