				<BR><STRONG>MAKALINTAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Plaintiffs, now appellants, filed this action in the Court of First Instance 
of Manila to recover the sum of P5,000.00, corresponding to the face value of an 
insurance policy issued by defendant on the life of Estefania A. Saturnino, and 
the sum of P1,500.00 as attorney's fees. Defendant, now appellee, set up special 
defenses in its answer, with a counterclaim for damages allegedly sustained as a 
result of the unwarranted presentation of this case. Both the complaint and the 
counterclaim were dismissed by the trial court; but appellants were declared 
entitled to the return of the premium already paid, plus interest at 62 up to 
January 8, 1959, when a check for the corresponding amount—P359.65—was sent to 
them by appellee. 
<p>The policy sued upon is one for 20-year endowment non-medical insurance. This 
kind of policy dispenses with the medical examination of the applicant usually 
required in ordinary life policies. However, detailed information is called for 
in the application concerning the applicant's health and medical history. The 
written application in this ease was submitted by Saturnino to appellee on 
November 16, 1957, witnessed by appellee's agent Edward A. Santos. The policy 
was issued on the same day, upon payment of the first year's premium of P339.25. 
On September 19, 1958, Saturnino died of pneumonia, secondly to influenza. 
Appellants here, who are her surviving husband and minor child, respectively, 
demanded payment of the face value of the policy. The claim was rejected and 
this suit was subsequently instituted. </p>
<p>It appears that the months prior to the issuance of the policy, or on 
September 9, 1957, Saturnino was operated on for cancer, involving complete 
removal of the right breast, including the pectoral muscles and the glands found 
in the right armpit. She stayed in the hospital for a period of eight days, 
after which she was discharged, although according to the surgeon who operated 
on her she could not be considered definitely cured, her ailment being of the 
malignant type.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the fact of her operation Estefania A Saturnino did not make 
a disclosure thereof in her application for insurance. On the contrary, she 
stated therein that she did not have, nor had she ever had, among other ailments 
listed in the application, cancer or other tumors; that she had not consulted 
any physician, undergone any operation or suffered any injury within the 
preceding five years; and that she had never been treated for, nor did she ever 
have any illness or disease peculiar to her sex, particularly of the breast, 
ovaries, uterus and menstrual disorders. The application also recites that the 
foregoing declarations constituted "a further basis for the issuance of the 
policy." </p>
<p>The question at issue is whether or not the insured made such false 
representations of material facts as to avoid the policy. There can be no 
dispute that the information given by her in her application for insurance was 
false, namely, that she had never had cancer or tumors, or consulted any 
physician or undergone any operation within the preceding period of five years. 
Are the facts thus falsely represented material? The Insurance Law, (Section 30) 
provides that "materiality is to be determined not by the event, but solely by 
the probable and reasonable influence of the in forming his estimate of the 
proposed contract, or in facts upon the party to whom the communication is due, 
making his inquiries." It seems to be the contention of appellants that the 
facts subject of the representations were not material in view of the 
"non-medical" nature of the insurance applied for, which does away with the 
usual requirement of medical examination before the policy is issued. The 
contention is without merit. If anything, the waiver of medical examination 
renders even more material the information required of the applicant concerning 
previous condition of health and diseases suffered, for such information 
necessarily constitutes an important factor which the insurer takes into 
consideration in deciding whether to issue the policy or not. It is logical to 
assume that if appellee had been properly apprised of the insured's medical 
history she would at least have been made to undergo medical examination in 
order to determine her insurability. </p>
<p>Appellants argue that due information concerning the insured's previous 
illness and operation had been given to appellee's agent Edward A. Santos, who 
filed the application term after it was signed in blank by Estefania A. 
Saturnino. This was denied by Santos in his testimony, and the trial court found 
such testimony to be true. This is a finding of fact which is binding upon us, 
this appeal having been taken upon questions of law alone. We do not deem it 
necessary therefore, to consider appellee's additional argument, which was 
upheld by the trial court, that in signing the application form in blank and 
leaving it to Edward A. Santos to fill (assuming that to be the truth) the 
insured in effect made Santos her agent for that purpose and consequently was 
responsible for the errors in the entries made by him in that capacity.</p>
<p>In the application for insurance signed by the insured in this case, she 
agreed to submit to a medical examination by a duly appointed examiner of 
appellee if in the latter's opinion such examination was necessary as further 
evidence of insurability. In not asking her to submit to a medical examination, 
appellants maintain, appellee was guilty of negligence, which, precluded it from 
finding about, her actual state of health. No such negligence can be imputed to 
appellee. It was precisely because the insured had given herself a clean bill of 
health that appellee no longer considered an actual medical checkup necessary. 
</p>
<p>Appellants also contend there was no fraudulent concealment of the truth as 
much as the insured herself did not know, since her doctor never told her, that 
the disease for which she had been operated on was cancer. In the first place 
the concealment of the fact of the operation itself was fraudulent, as there 
could not have been any mistake about it, no matter what the ailment. Secondly, 
in order to avoid a policy it is not necessary to show actual fraud on the part 
of the insured. In the case of Kasprzyk <i>vs.</i> Metropolitan Insurance Go., 
140 N.Y.S. 211, 314, it was held: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Moreover, if it were the law that an insurance company could not defend a 
policy on the ground of misrepresentation, unless it could show actual knowledge 
on the part of the applicant that the statements were false, then it is plain 
that it would be impossible for it to protect itself and its honest 
policyholders against fraudulent and improper claims. It would he wholly at the 
mercy of any one who wished to apply for insurance, as it would be impossible to 
show actual fraud except in the extremest cases. It could not rely on an 
application as containing information on which it could act. There would be no 
incentive to an applicant to tell the truth." </p></blockquote>
<p>In this jurisdiction, a concealment, whether intentional or unintentional, 
entitles the insurer to rescind the contract of insurance, concealment being 
defined as "negligence to communicate that which a party knows and ought to 
communicate" (Sections 25 &amp; 26, Act No. 2427). In the case of Argente 
<i>vs.</i> West Coast Life Insurance Co., 51 Phil. 725, 732, this Court said, 
quoting from Joyce, The Law of Insurance, 2nd ed. Vol. 3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The basis of the rule vitiating the contract in cases of concealmentt is 
that it misleads or deceives the insurer into accepting the risk, or accepting 
it at the rate of premium agreed upon. The insurer, relying upon the belief that 
the assured will disclose every material fact within his actual or presumed 
knowledge, is misled into a belief that the circumstance withheld does not 
exist, and he is thereby induced to estimate the risk upon a false basis that it 
does not exist.'" </p></blockquote>
<p>The judgment appealed from, dismissing the complaint and awarding the return 
to appellants of the premium already paid, with interest at 6% up to January 29, 
1959, is affirmed, with costs against appellants. </p>
