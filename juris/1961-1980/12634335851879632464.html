				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for <i>certiorari</i> to reverse and set aside the Order
dated July 17, 1978 of the Deputy Minister of Labor in NLRC Cases Nos.
RB-IV-3168-75 and RB-IV-7560-76, entitled "Lourdes E. Bengzon v. Sta.
Ines-Melale Veneer &amp; Plywood Corporation and Robert V. Hyde." The following
are the pertinent facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 24, 1975, petitioner filed a com­plaint for illegal
dismissal with Regional Office No. IV of the Department of Labor (now Ministry
of Labor) against respondent Sta. Ines-Melale Veneer &amp; Plywood Corporation
(hereinafter referred to as Sta. Ines) and personally against its
Vice-President, Robert V. Hyde (NLRC Case No. RB-IV-3168-75).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of the stipulation of facts, the
document­ary evidence and memoranda of the parties the Labor Arbiter rendered a
decision on March 31, 1976, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the following are the orders in this case:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Sta. Ines-Melale Veneer &amp; Ply­wood,
Inc., should be, as it is hereby ordered to pay complainant Lourdes E. Bengzon
the sum of TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED (P2,500.00) PESOS as sepa­ration pay; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Robert V. Hyde is hereby or­dered
to pay the complainant the sum of THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND (P300,000.00) PESOS as
moral and exemplary damages."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the above decision petitioner appealed to the National Labor
Relations Commission alleging that respondent Sta. Ines should be held
solidarily liable with Robert V. Hyde for moral and exemplary damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Hyde likewise appealed from the
foregoing decision, assailing the jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter over his
person as he was alleged­ly improperly summoned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Sta. Ines did not appeal but
filed, on June 2, 1976, a consolidated reply memorandum arguing that it never
authorized or ratified the act of Robert V. Hyde in dismissing petitioner and
that the National Labor Relations Commission was without power to adjudicate
the issue of moral and exemplary damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 1, 1976, the National Labor Relations Commission rendered
a resolution remanding the case to the Labor Arbiter for further proceedings on
the ground that no jurisdiction was acquired by it over Robert V. Hyde as
respondent because of the failure at the start of the proceedings to properly
serve him with summons and a copy of the complaint. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Res­pondent Sta. Ines moved for
reconsideration of the NLRC resolution but the same was denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 3, 1976, respondent Sta. Ines filed an appeal to the
Secretary of Labor from the aforesaid resolution but the Secretary of Labor
affirmed the resolution in an Order dated September 15, 1976.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On November 19, 1976, on appeal by Sta. Ines,
the Office of the President likewise affirmed the reso­lution of the National
Labor Relations Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the pendency of the resolution of the NLRC, or on July 6,
1976, petitioner filed an amen­ded complaint with Regional Office No. IV of the
Department of Labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said complaint was
transmitted and certified to the NLRC for arbitration on the following
issues:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) reinstatement with
backwages; and (2) moral and exemplary damages of P400,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This case was docketed as NLRC Case No.
RB-IV-7560- 76 and was subsequently consolidated with NLRC Case No.
RB-IV-3168-75 after the latter case was remanded to the Labor Arbiter.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due hearing the Labor Arbiter rendered a decision on
November 18, 1977, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Responsive to the foregoing, respondent Sta. Ines-Melale
Veneer &amp; Plywood, Inc., and Ro­bert V. Hyde should be, as they are hereby
ordered to pay jointly and severally complainant Lourdes E. Bengzon separation
pay in the amount of P2,500.00 and the sum of P300,000.00 as moral and
exemplary damages."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">All the parties in the afore-mentioned consoli­dated cases
appealed the decision of the Labor Arbi­ter to the National Labor Relations
Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 21, 1978, the NLRC rendered a deci­sion <i>en banc</i>,
the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Commission has resolved to modify, as it
hereby MODIFIED the decision appealed from as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Sta. Ines-Melale Veneer &amp; Ply­wood,
Inc. is ordered to pay the complainant P54,394.62 as backwages from September
16, 1975 to February 21, 1978, P2,000.00 as separation pay and P300,000.00 as
moral and exemplary damages or the total sum of P354,394.62;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim for reinstatement of the com­plainant
to the same position held by her prior to her dismissal is denied;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Robert V. Hyde is absolved from any
liability."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On May 1, 1978, Presidential Decree No. 1367 was promulgated,
amending paragraph (3) of Article 217 of the Labor Code, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"(a) The Labor
Arbiters shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide the following
cases involving all workers, whether agricultural or non-agricultural:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfair labor practice
cases;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unresolved issues in
collective bargain­ing, including those which involve wages, hours of work, and
other terms and conditions of employ­ment; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All other cases arising from
employer-employee relations duly indorsed by the Regional Directors in
accordance with the provisions of this Code; <i>Provided</i>, that the Regional
Directors shall not indorse and Labor Arbiters shall not entertain claims for
moral or other forms of damages."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On May 24, 1978, respondent Sta. Ines filed with the Secretary of
Labor (now Minister of Labor) a notice and memorandum of appeal from the
decision <i>en banc</i> of the NLRC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
appeal was opposed by peti­tioner on June 26, 1978.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 17, 1978, respondent Deputy Minister of Labor issued an
Order affirming the decision of the NLRC but modifying the same by setting
aside the award of damages on the ground of lack of jurisdic­tion in accordance
with Presidential Decree No. 1367.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
dispositive portion of the said Order reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"ALL THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATION let the Decision <i>en banc</i>
of the Commission, dated February 21, 1978, be as it is hereby, affirmed with
modi­fication, in that the award of damages is set aside for lack of
jurisdiction."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that respondent Deputy Minister gravely
abused his discretion in disclaim­ing jurisdiction on the issue of damages, as
under Article 217 of the Labor Code prior to its amendment by Presidential
Decree No. 1367, Labor Arbiters had jurisdiction to hear and decide claims for
moral damages arising out of employer-employee relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner points out that Presidential
Decree No. 1367 was promulgated on May 1, 1978, long after NLRC consolidated
cases Nos. RB-IV-3168-75 and RB-IV-­7560-76 were decided by the Labor Arbiter
on Novem­ber 18, 1978, which decision was in turn affirmed, with modification,
on appeal to the NLRC on February 21, 1978.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Sta. Ines, however, invoking <i>Quisaba v. Sta.
Ines-Melale Veneer &amp; Plywood, Inc.</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
argues that petitioner's claim for moral and exemplary damages is properly
cognizable by the regular courts and not by the National Labor Relations
Commission and that Presidential Decree No. 1367 was promulga­ted on May 1,
1978 "to correct the erroneous assump­tion of jurisdiction by Labor
Arbiters and the National Labor Relations Commission on issues of moral and
other forms of damages."</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 6, 1979, respondent Sta. Ines mani­fested before this
Court that it has fully satis­fied the claim of petitioner with respect to
backwages and separation pay, in the total amount of P56,394.62, as evidenced
by a cash voucher dated February 2, 1979, duly signed by petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the crux of the controversy is the jurisdic­tional authority
of Labor Arbiters and the NLRC prior to the enactment of Presidential Decree
No. 1367, over damages grounded on the dismissal <i>per se</i> of petitioner,
since in fact, she asks for reinstate­ment with backwages.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the time when the Labor Arbiter rendered a decision in
consolidated cases Nos. RB-IV-3168-75 and RB-IV-7560-76 on November 18, 1977,
the appli­cable law was Article 217 of the Labor Code, which provides as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 217.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Jurisdiction
of Labor Arbiters and the Commission</i>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- (a) The Labor Arbiters shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and
decide the following cases involving all workers, whether agricultural or
non-agricultural:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfair labor practice
cases;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unresolved issues in collective bar­gaining
including those which involve wages, hours of work, and other terms and
conditions of employ­ment duly indorsed by the Bureau in accordance with the
provisions of this Code;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All money claims of workers involving
non-payment or underpayment of wages, overtime or premium compensation,
maternity or service incen­tive leave, separation pay and other money claims
arising from employer-employee relation, except claims for employee's
compensation, social secu­rity and medicare benefits and as otherwise pro­vided
in Article 128 of this Code;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cases involving
household services; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(5)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All other cases arising
from employer-employee relation unless expressly excluded by this Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b) The Commission
shall have exclusive ap­pellate jurisdiction over all cases decided by Labor
Arbiters, compulsory arbitrators, and volun­tary arbitrators in appropriate
cases provided in Article 263 of this Code."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is here a manifest intent of the Labor Code to expand the
jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unlike the Court of Industrial Relations whose jurisdiction was limited
to unfair labor prac­tice cases, representation cases, and national interest
cases, the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Commission was expanded
to accommodate all cases involving employer--employee relations.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Applying Article 217 of the Labor Code, this Court, in <i>Garcia v. Martinez,
et al.</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
ruled that:</p>

<blockquote>"The provisions of paragraphs 3 and 5 of Article 317 are broad
and comprehensive enough to cover the claim of an employee for damages al­legedly
arising from his unjustified dismissal * * *.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His claim was a consequence of the termi­nation of their
employer-employee relation."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The Court in <i>Garcia</i> declared that
the Court of First Instance of Davao erred in denying the motion to dismiss the
claim for actual and moral damages as a result of the arbitrary dismissal of
employee, on the ground that the case falls "within the exclusive
jurisdiction" of the National Labor Relations Com­mission (NLRC) pursuant
to Article 217 of the Labor Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although this decision was later reconsidered, the reconsideration was
based on the fact that the case could not be refiled with the Labor Court,
since the latter had already been deprived of any jurisdiction to hear claims
for moral damages by Presidential Decree No. 1367.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, petitioner's complaint was filed directly
with the Regional Office of the Min­istry of Labor where the case was heard and
decided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time the case was heard
and decided, the Labor Court had jurisdiction over the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither can private respondent rely upon <i>Quisaba
v. Sta. Ines-Melale Veneer Plywood, Inc., supra</i>, to justify the action
taken by respondent Deputy Minister of Labor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Quisaba</i>, the complaint for damages was based on tort, the
violation of a private legal right independent of contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, Quisaba did not ask for reinstatement
or backwages, but predi­cated his claim of damages on the <i>manner</i> of his
dismissal and the <i>consequent</i> effects of such dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, petitioner's action is based on her
contract, and her desire to reinstate their emplo­yer-employee relations,
hence, she prays for her reinstatement with backwages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unlike section 2 of Presidential Decree No.
21, which was the law in­volved in <i>Quisaba</i>, Article 217 of the Labor
Code confers broader powers on Labor Arbiters and the Commission by vesting
upon them exclusive jurisdic­tion to hear "all other cases arising from
employer-employee relation unless expressly excluded by this Code."</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is that where a court has already ob­tained and is
exercising jurisdiction over a contro­versy, its jurisdiction to proceed to the
final determination of the cause is not affected by new legislation placing
jurisdiction over such proceed­ings in another tribunal.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The exception to the rule is where the statute expressly provides, or is
construed to the effect that it is intended to ope­rate as to actions pending
before its enactment.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Where a statute changing the jurisdiction of a court has no retroactive effect,
it cannot be applied to a case that was pending prior to the enactment of the
statute.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
We find the principles applicable to the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To require petitioner to file a separate suit
for damages in the regular courts would be to "sanction split
jurisdiction, which is prejudicial to the orderly administration of jus­tice.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view hereof, <i>certiorari</i> is grant­ed
and the respondent Deputy Minister of Labor is hereby directed to decide the
appeal on the question of moral and exemplary damages, inviting attention to
the fact that in their "Notice and Memorandum of Appeal", private
respondent raised only questions of law and did not impugn the findings of fact
of the NLRC as to the amount of damages.<span style="">&nbsp;
