he was a coalman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, from <st1:date year="1952" day="1" month="7"><span style="">July </span>1,

job <span style="">was </span>to grease train cars

 2, 1949</st1:date>, on the occasion of the company's annual physical check-up,
the company physician gave <span class="SpellE">Gando</span> a clean bill of
health, declared him fit for work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1952" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1952</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1953" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1953</st1:date>, Dr. Fernando C. <span class="SpellE">Jusay</span> of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span></st1:placename>

suffering from “P.T.B., minimal right.” Petitioner allowed him to continue with
his work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Jusay's</span>
examinations, on two subsequent occasions, October 25 and November 23, 1958,
show that <span class="SpellE">Gando</span> was afflicted with “moderately
advanced pulmonary tuberculosis, right; infiltration 1st <span class="SpellE">interspace</span>
to 3rd rib, left." He was again allowed to work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such was his condition upon examination by
the same physician on August 15, 1957.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One year thereafter, petitioner's own physician found him with only his
right lung weak.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, he remained in his
job.</p>

<p class="BODY">But then, on September 11, 1959, <span class="SpellE">Gando</span>
was struck on the chest by an iron bar which he was at the time using to remove
the axle cover of a drum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He failed to
report for work since then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He suffered
continuous <span class="SpellE">hemoptysis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First taken home, he <span style="">was, </span>on September 28, 1959, removed to the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
Institute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On October 7, 1959, he died
of "bilateral, far advanced pulmonary tuberculosis."</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 11, 1960, his wife, Belen <span class="SpellE">Glendo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Gando</span>, formally
registered with the Department of Labor a claim for death compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On October 22, 1960, petitioner filed its
employer's report.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hearing on the merits <span style="">was
</span>had before Roman <span class="SpellE">Caringal</span>, hearing officer,
who awarded compensation to <span class="SpellE">Gando's</span> dependents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the Chairman of the Workmen's
Compensation Commission affirmed with but slight modifications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> approved
the Chairman's decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this appeal.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. First of the questions to claim attention is the dependents’
right to death benefits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Controlling
here is Section 2 of<span style=""> </span>the Work­men's
Compensation Law which provides that "[w]hen an employee suffers personal
injury from any accident arising out of and in the course of his employment, or
contracts tuberculosis or other illness directly caused by such employment, or
either aggravated by or in result of the nature of such employment, his
employer shall pay compensation in the sums and to the persons hereinafter
specified.</p>

<p class="BODY">That Section 8 of the law,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>which
defines the death benefit, does not mention aggravation, <span style="">as </span>petitioner contends, is
inconsequent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because Section 8 itself
speaks of death caused by a "disease contracted or injury received” as
provided in Section 2 hereinbefore quoted, which in turn makes compensable,
injury or illness aggravated by the nature of the employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not matter that the word
"aggravated" <span style="">was </span>only inserted in Section 2 by a later amendment thru
Republic Act 772, which took effect on June 20, 1952.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It bears repetition that death here took
place on October 7, 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And a rule,
elementary in legal hermeneutics, <span style="">is </span>that an amended statute should be
construed as if it had been originally passed in its amended form.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the merits, the finding below, on which we place our stamp of
approval, emphatically negates petitioner's claim of non-compensability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Says </span>the Commission decision:</p>

<blockquote>"The fact that the deceased was in the best of health at the
time he was taken in by respondent <span style="">[MRR]
</span>and was allowed to continue with his job even after he was discovered to
be afflicted with tuberculosis remains undisputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, is the fact that the deceased died of
pulmonary tuberculosis, far advanced, bilateral, 26 days after he quit working
on September 12, 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the
respondent seems to dispute, however, is the fact that the deceased's
employment had something to do with the acceleration of his death due to
pulmonary tuberculosis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it is of the
opinion that the demise of the deceased was due to <span style="">the </span>natural progress of his ailment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We could not agree with the respondent on the above opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the deceased were separated from the
service immediately upon being discovered to be afflicted with tuberculosis in
its early stage and since then his illness had gradually progressed to
moderately advanced stage we might say that respondent's view is tenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, such was not the situation in this
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of persuading the deceased
to <span style="">go </span>on vacation to enable him
to recuperate from his illness, respondent had explicitly assured the former
that there was nothing wrong with his continuing with his job because he was
merely suffer­ing from weak lungs (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. '1', '2',
'3' and '4' for respondent).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only to
find later that he was already afflicted with the disease in its moderately
advanced stage, and bilateral at that.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That the deceased's illness was worsened and his death hastened by a
harm associated with his employment, which consisted primarily of greasing
train cars and wagons under any weather con­dition to avoid delay in the
schedule of their trips, <span style="">is </span>best
evidenced by the fact that he had recurrent <span class="SpellE">hemoptysis</span>
during the period of his employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
this holds true, even if we ignore entirely the alleged inci­dent met by the
deceased while in the performance of his job and even if we assume that other
factors foreign to the employment had likewise contributed to the aggra­vation
of his illness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, the <span style="">law </span>does
not weigh the relative weight of the contribution made by the em­ployment to
the illness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is enough that it did
contribute to its aggravation even in a small degree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See The Law of Workmen's Compensation by
Arthur Larson, Vol. I, p. 50)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <u><span style="">ITEMCOP</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Florzo</u></span><u>,</u>
G.R. No. L-21969, <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1966</st1:date>,
we said:</p>

<blockquote>"At any rate, the law presumes, in the absence of substantial
evidence to the contrary, that the claim is compensable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The burden to disconnect, by substan­tial
evidence, the injury or sickness from employment, <span style="">is </span>laid at the employer's door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner failed to dis­charge this
burden.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So rigid is the rule that even
where the cause of the employee's death is unknown - as peti­tioner claims -
the right to compensation subsists.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Reason for this is that the Workmen's Compensation Act <span style="">is a </span>social
legislation; it is designed to <span style="">give </span>relief to the workman; therefore, to
effectuate its purpose, it must be liberally construed." [<u>Citing</u>

<p class="BODY">Upon the law and the facts, the claim here involved is
compensable.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Gando</span> suffered the accident heretofore adverted to on
September 11, 1959, we do not doubt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Evidence then is that immediately after the accident, two of his
co-laborers took him home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From thence,
he was, on September 23, 1959, taken to the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
Institute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not report for duty
from September<span style=""> </span>1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man died on October 7, 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner did not say <span style="">that </span>it did not have any knowledge of
such death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet, petitioner was
remiss in its duty, set forth in Section 37 of the Workmen's Com­pensation Act,
to report the injury "[a]s soon as possible after the occurrence"
which resulted "in absence from work for a day or more", and to
report the death of the employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Laches</span>, therefore, on the part of the individual
respondents in filing their claim would not bar recovery.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did petitioner
comply with Section 45 of the Act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because, it did not controvert the right to compensation (death benefit
"on or before the fourteenth day of disability or within ten days after he
has knowledge" thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, petitioner
only bestirred itself after respondent Belen <span class="SpellE">Glendo</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Gando</span> had already filed
the claim for compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Guilty
itself of delay in filing the report, petitioner cannot now invoke a similar
delay on the part of the claimant to avoid the latter's claim for
compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More than this, peti­tioner's
failure to explain lack of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> for an
unreasonable length of time constitutes "a renunciation of his right to
challenge the claim."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's averment
that the compensation award should not have been given to the minor children of
the <span class="SpellE">Gandos</span> deserves but passing mention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that it was only Belen <span class="SpellE">Glendo</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Gando</span> who signed the claim; that she did not expressly hold
herself out therein as representing their children; and that she was not
appointed guardian ad <span class="SpellE">litem</span> in the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it is equally true that, as stated in the
Commission decision, Item 7 of the claim lists the names of the minors as
surviving dependents of the deceased, together with their respective dates of
birth, addresses, and relationship (children) with the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These dependents, by Section 9 of the law,
are entitled to compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, there
is no necessity for Belen <span class="SpellE">Glendo</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
de <span class="SpellE">Gando</span> to be appointed guardian ad <span class="SpellE">litem</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, she is,
by Article 320, Civil Code, the legal administrator of the property of her
children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the very least, we say that
