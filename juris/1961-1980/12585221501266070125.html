				<H3>DELFIN MERCADER, PETITIONER, VS. HON. FRANCISCO VALILA OF THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE COURT OF BOBON, SAMAR AND AMANCIO BALITE, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On April 20, 1959, Amancio Balite filed with the justice of the peace
court at Bobon, Samar, a criminal complaint for libel against Delfin
Mercader. After making the preliminary examination, the judge issued
the corresponding warrant of arrest. The accused moved to dismiss for
lack of jurisdiction and cause of action. Upon denial thereof, the
accused filed in September 1959, this petition for certiorari, based
mainly on the alleged want of jurisdiction of the aforesaid inferior
court.
  <p>In ordinary circumstances, the petition would have,
been dismissed, without prejudice to its presentation before the local
court of first instance. But at that time there were pending before
this Tribunal some cases involving the jurisdiction, or lack of
jurisdiction, of justices of the peace over criminal libel, in the
light of Republic Act 1289, approved June 15, 1955.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
So, we gave due course to this petition. In his answer, the respondent
judge explained that he had taken cognizance of the case for purposes
of preliminary investigation. In fact, he stated, as the accused had
failed to attend the hearing, and there was <i>prima facie</i> evidence, he forwarded the <i>expediente</i> to the court of first instance for trial on the merits. </p>
  <p>The
controversy is thus reduced to the question whether the inferior courts
may, after the passage of Republic Act 1289, entertain criminal
complaints for written defamation, not for trial on the merits, but for
purposes of preliminary investigation. It is contended by those who
would deny such authority, that Republic Act 1289 had the effect of
depriving justice of the peace courts of their power even to conduct
preliminary investigations in the matter of libel or written
defamation. The question has been decided in the affirmative in People <i>vs</i>. Olarte, 108 Phil., 756; 58 Off. Gaz., (8) 1517. Through Mr. Justice Concepcion, this Court said:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Can
we justly hold that by fixing for said offense a penalty falling under
the original jurisdiction of courts of first instance, the framers of
section 2 of Act No. 277 had evinced the intent, either to establish an
exception to the provisions of Act No. 194, authorizing every justice
of the peace "to make preliminary investigation of any crime alleged to
have been committed within his municipality, jurisdiction to hear and
determine which is by law * * * vested in the judges of Courts of First
Instance,' or to divest justice of the peace of such authority, as
regards the crime of libel?"</p>
    <p>"It is obvious to us that such
inference is unwarranted. To begin with, there is absolutely nothing in
Act No. 277 to indicate the aforementioned intent. Secondly, repeals or
amendments by implication arc neither presumed nor favored. On the
contrary every statute should be harmonized with them. Thirdly, the
jurisdiction of courts of first instance to hear and determine criminal
actions within the original jurisdiction thereof is far from
inconsistent with the authority of justices of the peace to make
preliminary investigations in such actions. What is more, this
authority has been vested to relieve courts of first instance of the
duty to hear cases which are devoid of probable cause, thereby paving
the way for the effective exercise of the original jurisdiction of said
courts and the expeditious disposal by the same of criminal cases which
are <i>prima facie</i> mertitorious. *  * *."</p>
    <p>"It is
apparent, from a perusal of the three (3) provisions aforementioned,
that the framers of Article 360 of the Revised Penal Code intended to
introduce no substantial change in the existing law, except as regards
venue, and that, in all other respects, they meant to preserve and
continue the <i>status quo</i> under sections 2 and 11 of Act No. 277.
Such was also the purpose of Congress in passing House Bill No. 2695,
which eventually became Republic Act No. 1280."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    The Bobon justice of the peace has thus acted within his powers, and this petition will have to be dismissed.</p>
  <p>
Petitioner here maintains that even if the justice of the peace courts
have jurisdiction to conduct preliminary investigations, the venue was
improperly laid in Bobon, because neither the complainant nor the
defendant resided there. The statute<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
provides that where the libel is published or circulated in a province
or city wherein neither the offended party nor the offender resides,
the action may be brought therein; and the complaint herein questioned,
alleges that the libel had <i>been published and circulated in Bobon and other municipalities of Samar</i>. Bobon  and  Samar,  therefore,  constituted  proper  venue. </p>
  <p>Petitioner's
last contention that the complaint stated no cause of action, may not
be considered now. It is unimportant in a certiorari proceeding,
specially because petitioner has the remedy of discussing the issue
before the court of first instance, and then if after hearing he is
convicted, to appeal in due time.</p>

  <p align="center"><strong>DISSENTING OPINION </strong></p>
 
  <p><strong>PARAS, C. J.:</strong></p>
  <p>I dissent for the same reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in the case of People <i>vs</i>. Olarte, 108 Phil., 756; 58 Off. Gaz., (8) 1517, which read as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"It
will observed that as a general rule, the law, in defining crimes, does
not mention or make reference to the court where the ease should be
filed.</p>
    <p>"In the case of libel, however, aside from the
definition, the law expressly indicates the court wherein the criminal
and civil actions are to be filed. Article 360, Par. 3, of the Revised
Penal Code provides:</p>
    <p>"The criminal action and the civil action for damages in cases of written defamations, as provided in this chapter, <i>may be filed</i> simultaneously or separately <i>with the Court of First Instance</i>
of the province wherein the libel was published, displayed or
exhibited, regardless of the place where the same was written, printed
or composed.' (Italics added.)</p>
    <p>"After the amendment of the said article by Republic Act No. 1289, the third  paragraph  reads:</p>
    <p>"The criminal and civil action for damages in cases of written defamations as provided for in this chapter, <i>shall be filed</i> simultaneously or separately <i>with the court of first instance</i>
of the province or city where any of the accused or any of the offended
parties resides at the time of the commission of the offense: <i>Provided, however</i>,
That where the libel, is published, circulated, displayed or exhibited
in a province or city wherein neither the offender nor the offended
party resides the civil and criminal actions may be brought in the
court of first Instance thereof: <i>Provided, further</i>, That the civil action shall be filed in the same court where the criminal action is filed and vice versa. <i>Provided, further</i>,
That the court where the criminal action or civil action for damages is
first filed, shall acquire jurisdiction to the exclusion of other
courts; <i>And provided, finally</i>, That this amendment shall not
apply to cases of written defamations, the civil and/or criminal
actions to which, have been filed in court at the time of the
effectivity of this law.'</p>
    <p>"The crime of libel is transitory
and in accordance with the old laws, the criminal action could be field
in any place where there had been publication. If the Justice of the
Peace Courts had jurisdiction, at least for the purpose of preliminary
investigation and issuance of warrant of arrest, the action could be
filed in <em>ANY</em> of the several Justice of the Peace Courts of
any province. This could no doubt lead to undue harassment of the
defendant and it is likewise considered that under the old laws many of
the justices of the Peace were not lawyers, the conclusion is
inevitable that the frames of the Revised Penal Code did not want the
intervention of said Justices of the Peace. Thus the Revised Penal Code
expressly provides, in the case of libel, (and contrary to its other
provisions) that the complaint must be filed not in any Justice of the
Peace Court, BUT in the Court of First Instance.</p>
    <p>"The
majority believes that the reference to the Court of First Instance in
Article 360 of the Revised Penal Code is unnecessary. If that were so,
I see no reason for them to express the conviction and admit that a
civil suit for the recovery of damages involving a small sum of money,
like for instance P50.00, is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Court of First Instance.</p>
    <p align="center">  *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
    <p>"It
is interesting to note that in the whole Revised Penal Code and other
statutes prescribing penal provisions, there is no mention of the court
wherein a case should be filed, inasmuch as there is a general law on
the matter, with the notable exceptions of those relating to the
violation of the provisions of (1) the Election Code, (2) the Copyright
Law, (3) the Land Registration Act and (4) the crime of libel.</p>
    <p>"The
crime of libel being transitory as stated above, amendments have been
made regarding venue. The reason for the amendment is as stated by the
authors thereof, to avoid harassment specially to newspapermen and to
foster the freedom of the press. These objectives must have prompted
the exception in the law confining to the Court of First Instance
original exclusive jurisdiction over said cases for the legislature
must have believed that there, was no sufficient guaranty in the
fairness of proceedings when the preliminary investigation was not to
be conducted by the Judge of the Court of First Instance. It is true
that in the debates, the sponsors of the bill numbered later as
Republic Act No. 1289 declared that the amendment on Article 360
referred to venue. But It should be observed that the matter of
jurisdiction provided for in the original provisions of article S60 has
been reiterated in. the aforesaid Republic Act with the only difference
that more emphasis has been given to it by the substitution of the word
'may' with 'shall'."<br>
