				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1959" day="7" month="9">September <span style="">7, </span>1959</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Fulgencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Baquiran</span> was
charged with murder before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>
committed according to the information filed by the Provincial Fiscal, in the
following manner:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 29th day of April, <span style="">1959, </span>in the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Tumauini</span>, province of <span class="SpellE">Isabe­la</span>,
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said
accused, together with John Doe, whose real identity is still unknown, con­spiring
and confederating together and helping one another, with evident premeditation
and treachery, did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully
and feloniously shoot with a carbine one Alberto Castillo, thereby inflicting
upon the latter gunshot wound passing thru and thru the outer surface of the
mid­dle third of the right arm and passing thru its in­ner surface to enter the
4th <span class="SpellE">intercostal</span> space of the right anterior <span class="SpellE">axillary</span> line, which directly caused his death due to
gunshot wounds to the liver, right and left lung and smashing of the heart sub­stance
and muscle to pieces, with extensive hemor­rhage."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">The
court, after due trial, found the defendant guilty of the crime charged and
sentenced him to suffer "the penalty of life imprisonment (<span class="SpellE"><u>cadena</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>),
with the accessory penalty of the law to indemnify the heirs of Alberto
Castillo in the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and to pay the
costs."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The defendant appealed to
this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The crux of this appeal lies in the identity of the as­sailant of
Alberto Castillo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Juanita <span class="SpellE">Marilao</span>, the wife of the deceased, and <span class="SpellE">Celedonia</span>
Castillo, her daughter, pointed the accusing finger at the appellant <span class="SpellE">Fulgencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Baquiran</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The widow testified that on <st1:date year="1959" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1959</st1:date>, between the hours of
six and seven in the evening, the appellant appeared from nowhere and shot the
victim with a carbine while the latter and his <span class="GramE">family were</span>
eating their supper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bullet tore
through the body of Castillo causing instantaneous death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon seeing the bloodied figure of her
husband topple to the floor, Juani­ta fled and hid herself in the bushes about
two hundred meters away from her house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her three children, Franco (who is blind and the oldest at 16 years), <span class="SpellE">Celedonia</span> (12 yrs.) and <span class="SpellE">Rostum</span> (6
yrs.), likewise scampered away for safety.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>, she took
courage and emerged from her hiding place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Forthwith, with her barrio mates, Mateo <span class="SpellE">Forto</span>
and Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, Juanita rushed to <span class="SpellE">Tumauini</span> to report her husband's violent death to the
authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the PC detachment headquarters in <span class="SpellE">Tumauini</span>,
she met Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> <span class="SpellE">Venturina</span>,
the officer-in-charge, to whom she narrated the events of the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Informed of the killing, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Venturina</span> immediately called for Dr. Guillermo <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Laman</span></span><span style="">, </span>the municipal health officer, and,
together with Juanita and three Constabulary soldiers, proceeded to the scene
of the crime in barrio <span class="SpellE">Sisim</span> Alto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about the same time, Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Gumatay</span>, the chief of police of <span class="SpellE">Tumauini</span>,
was preparing to con<span style="">duct his own
investigation of the shooting at <span class="SpellE">Sisim</span> </span><span style="">Alto after having </span><span style="">been apprised of the incident by <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Forto</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. <span class="SpellE">Laman</span> autopsied the body of the
deceased and found two gunshot wounds, one of which plowed through the liver,
traversed the right and left lung and smashed the heart muscle, causing
extensive hemorrhage which resulted in the death of Alberto Castillo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About a meter and a half from where the
gunman was supposed to have stood, two empty carbine shells were found.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The dining room where the
victim was shot is rectangular in shape, with a floor of bamboo rising half a
meter or so from the ground and separated from the kitchen by a gap about a
meter wide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is walled on three sides
only, the southern part being completely open.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the night of the murder, the deceased was seated on the western side
of the room, facing his wife and daughter, with his two sons somewhere to his
left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The assailant approached from the
southern side of the yard </span>and was only two meters away from the victim
when he fired his <span style="">gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>According to the testimony of Juanita
and <span class="SpellE">Celedonia</span>, it was possible to see the appellant
because the place was lighted by two kerosene lamps -- one placed in the middle
of the floor where the family was eating and the other on the left side of
Juanita.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Allegedly, appellant had a
companion but his identity has never been ascertained.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Fulgencio</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Baquiran</span> was
convicted by the lower court on the basis of the declarations of Juanita <span class="SpellE">Marilao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Celedonia</span>
Castillo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>His <span style="">defense of alibi was </span>disbelieved <span style="">by the court </span><u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> <u>quo</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Considering the magnitude of the charge and
the con­sequences of conviction, this Court is bound to assay the evidence
presented closely and carefully that it may arrive at a moral certainty as to
the guilt or innocence of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is a legal truism that evidence to be believed, must not only proceed
from the mouth of a credible witness, but it must be credible in itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Human perception can be warped by the impact
of events and testimony colored by the unconscious work­ings of the mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No better test has yet been found to measure
the value of a witness' testimony than its conformity to the knowledge and
common experience of mankind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is on
this cru­cible that we now proceed to assess the declarations of Juanita <span class="SpellE">Marilao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Celedonia</span> Castillo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Juanita <span class="SpellE">Marilao's</span> testimony suffers from a plethora of
contradictions and on certain vital points runs counter to the testimonies of
both prosecution and defense witnesses and the other evidence on hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Several <span style="">of these inconsistencies place under a cloud of </span>grave <span style="">doubt her identification of the appellant as
the murderer of her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, she
testified that on the evening of </span><st1:date year="1959" day="29" month="4"><span style="">April </span><span style="">29, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><span style="">the family ate by the light of two
"improvised" </span><u><span style="">kerosene</span></u><span style=""> <u>lamps</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">On
cross-examination, however, it was brought out by the defense counsel </span>that
in the affidavit subscribed and sworn to by Juanita on <span style="">April 30, 1959 </span>before Mariano T. <span class="SpellE">Barcelo</span>,
Justice of the Peace of <span class="SpellE">Tumauini</span>, she asserted that
she was able to recognize the accused because they were then using two <u>candles</u>
in the dining room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Celedonia's</span>
testimony in this regard is similar to her mother's, and in her "Abstract
of Testimonies" given before Judge <span class="SpellE">Barcelo</span> and
certified by the latter, she likewise stated that they were using two <u><span style="">candles</span></u><span style=""> </span>that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Testifying
eleven months later, mother and daughter had made a significant alte­ration in
their previous statements -- statements given just a day after the murder! Was
the change made to lend more credence to their testimony as to the identity of
the assailant?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None­theless, even
assuming that they were indeed using kerosene lamps, it is still doubtful
whether it would have been possible for the witnesses to have identified the
appellant as the murderer considering that eyes accustomed to light take some
time to adjust to darkness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The span of
time that elapsed from the moment the witnesses became aware of the menacing
pre­sence of the killer to the time the fatal shots were fired appears from the
evidence to have been very short.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
after the deceased was shot, the witnesses fled in confusion without a glance
at the killer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Second, when examined by the provincial fiscal as to the number
of times the accused fired at her husband, Juanita stressed that he did
"only once".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
contradicted by two prosecution witnesses, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Laman</span>
and Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Venturina</span> who both arrived at the same
conclusion that two shots were fired, the former basing his opinion on the fact
that there were two bullet wounds on the body of the deceased and the latter on
the recovery of two empty carbine shells at the scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Adding further to the haze of her testimony
was Jua­nita's statement on cross-examination that although she saw the appellant
even before her husband did, she did not give him any warning at <span class="GramE">all.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Juanita's
reaction to the presence of the assailant armed with a rifle and ready to fire
at her husband goes against the grain of common experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could not have been because there was no
more time to give any warn­ing, for the deceased was even able to say,
"Who are you?",<span style="">&nbsp; </span>be­fore he was
gunned down.</p>

<p class="BODY">The widow's behavior after the incident was even more puzzling
and leads us to the conclusion that she did not at all recognize her husband's
assassin and that her subsequent identification of the appellant was an
afterthought <span style="">born
of a </span>prejudiced mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She related
that when she reported the murder to the PC detachment at <span class="SpellE">Tumauini</span>
around <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">one o'clock</st1:time> in the morning of <st1:date year="1959" day="30" month="4">April 30, <span style="">1959</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>she told Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Venturina</span>
that it was <span class="SpellE">Fulgencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Baquiran</span>
who shot her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Venturina</span> denied this and testified that she refused and
would not talk about the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mateo <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Forto</span></span> who, she admitted, was
present when she made the report to Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Venturina</span>,
confirmed the sergeant's testimony and added that she said that she was not
able to recognize any of the killers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Forto</span> also disclosed that on the way to <span class="SpellE">Tumauini</span>
he questioned Juanita as to the identity of her husband's assailants and that
the widow replied that she was not able to recognize them be­cause they had the
brim of their caps tilted downwards.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Gumatay</span>, chief of police of <span class="SpellE">Tumauini</span>, testified similarly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he investigated the widow at the scene
of the crime, the latter revealed that she could not recognize the malefactors
because it was dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon his return to <span class="SpellE">Tumauini</span>, <span class="SpellE">Gumatay</span> en­tered the
result of the evening's investigation in the police blotter under date of <st1:date year="1959" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1959</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>.
3).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Laman</span>,
who overheard the conversation between <span class="SpellE">Gumatay</span> and
the widow, corroborates the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These witnesses have not been shown by the
prosecution to have any inordinate interest in the acquittal of the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one is a relative or bar­rio-mate
of the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are disinterested
persons and the record does not indicate any reason for us to disbelieve their
testimonies or to suspect their motives.</p>

<p class="BODY">The natural reaction of one who witnesses a crime and recognizes
the offender is to reveal it to the authorities at the earliest
opportunity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Juanita <span class="SpellE">Marilao</span>
did report the crime to the Constabulary but she did not reveal the identity of
the assailant although it was inquired into three times or more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It taxes credulity that Juanita made no
effort to expose the appellant then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
silence casts serious doubt on her subsequent identification of the ap­pellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had she really recognized the appellant, as
the prosecution contended, she would have immediately and spontaneously
revealed his identity upon reporting the crime as would be expected according
to the natural course of things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
argument that she was still in a state of shock after the incident and that she
was afraid of reprisal from the assailants who were still at large is not
supported by the evidence on record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
fact that she <span style="">was </span>able to seek
out <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Forto</span> to
help her go to <span class="SpellE">Tumauini</span> on the night of the murder
does not show a confused and disorganized mind.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If she were afraid of reprisal, wouldn't it be more in con­sonance with
common experience for her to have revealed the identity of the accused that he
might safely be put behind bars?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it
were, the accused was not ordered arrested until <st1:date year="1959" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1959</st1:date> after Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Venturina</span>
filed a complaint the day before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
is in itself significant for it lends support to the declarations of <span class="SpellE">Celedonia</span> and <span class="SpellE">Fulgencio</span> that the
identification of the latter as the alleged assailant took place on <st1:date year="1959" day="1" month="5">May 1, 1959</st1:date> and not on April 30 as
asserted by both Juanita and <span class="SpellE">Venturina</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As previously mentioned, Juanita testified
that <span style="">she </span>identified the accused
as the mur­derer of her husband during the first hours of the morning of <st1:date year="1959" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1959</st1:date> when she reported her
husband's death to the PC detachment at <span class="SpellE">Tumauini</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was denied and contradicted by Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Venturina</span> who asserted that the identification was made
during the confrontation between the widow and the ap­pellant in the morning of
April 30 around nine or ten o'clock in the morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Celedonia</span>, who was
investigated together with her mother as <span class="SpellE">Venturina</span>
himself admitted, testified that the investigation took place on <st1:date year="1959" day="1" month="5">May 1, 1959</st1:date> and that the accused was
not present at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This corroborates <span class="SpellE">Baquiran's</span> statements to the same effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For more than twenty-four hours then no word
was received from the widow as to the identity of her husband's killers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">This despite the fact that
after her husband's burial on April 30, she decided to spend the rest of the
day and night in <span class="SpellE">Tumauini</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>If Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Venturina</span>
filed the complaint only on <st1:date year="1959" day="2" month="5">May <span style="">2, </span>1959</st1:date> it could have been
due to the fact that the widow made her identification only the day before, <st1:date year="1959" day="1" month="5">May 1, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By then, she had had more than ample time for
reflection and what <span style="">was </span>merely a
suspicion deepened into a conviction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She admitted on cross-examina­tion that she was not able to identify her
husband's killer although she suspected somebody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span class="GramE">.-</span><span style=""> </span>You want to make this Honorable Court under­stand
that the Chief of Police, together with his two policemen, Domingo and <span class="SpellE">Taguba</span>, went to <span style="">that
place where your husband was shot and killed without interrogating or making
inves­tigation regarding the assailant?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"A<span class="GramE">.-</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked me, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Q<span class="GramE">.-</span><span style=""> </span>And there you told him that you were not able
to identify the person who shot and killed your husband, although you suspected
somebody?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"A<span class="GramE">.-</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. 71).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">She
repeated her suspicions later to Chief of Police <span class="SpellE">Gumatay</span>
after the burial of her husband, mentioning the name of <span class="SpellE">Baqui­ran</span>
as the suspect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to say,
suspicion is not identi­fication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
the fact that she merely had </span>suspicions is an <span style="">indication that at the time her husband </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">shot, she was not
able to make a positive identification of the assailant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The prosecution attempted
to develop the theory that the deceased was killed on account of a dispute with
the appellant involving a piece of tobacco land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, several facts in the record
testified to by both the accused and the widow weak­en the prosecution's
theory, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that the land allegedly in dispute </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">bartered by the
deceased to his brother, step­father of the accused, for a <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>
in 1953; that the appel­lant is not the owner of the land but merely worked on
it for his stepfather; that the dispute, if any, happened three years before or
in 1956 over a question of boundaries but had been settled amicably the same
year; that prior to the murder, the appellant had kept within his stepfather's
land and had not encroached upon the deceased's; and that the widow herself
admitted that there was no question between the deceased and the appellant
concerning the land before the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We quote:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Q<span class="GramE">.-</span><span style=""> </span>In other words, before the death of your hus­band
there was no question between your hus­band and the defendant about that land?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A<span class="GramE">.-</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>None, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q<span class="GramE">.-</span><span style=""> </span>You are very sure of that?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A<span class="GramE">.-</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.” <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. 22).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">No other motive for the killing has been shown by the <span style="">p</span><span style="">rosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The widow only mentioned the alleged dispute
over the tobacco land and even then contradicted herself on cross-examination
by admitting that anterior to the incident no question over the land existed
between her husband and the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is true Juanita testified that the accused tried to claim part of her land
after the death of her hus­band but the same is uncorroborated and was denied by
the appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The other leg on which stands the prosecution's case is provided
by the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Celedonia</span> Castillo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With regard to the identity of her father's
assailants, her tes­timony squares with her mother's statements pinning the
blame on <span class="SpellE">Fulgencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Baquiran</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, we find it difficult to give it
credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like her mother, she took an
unnaturally long time to disclose the murderer's identity despite the opportu­nities
she had to make such revelation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
admitted that she revealed the identity of the assailant for the first time
only on <st1:date year="1959" day="1" month="5">May 1, 1959</st1:date> <span style="">when </span>she was investigated by <span class="SpellE">Venturina</span> at the PC detachment in <span class="SpellE">Tumauini</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If she really knew her father's killer or
killers, she would have told either Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Venturina</span> or
Chief of Police <span class="SpellE">Gumatay</span> when the two made inquiries
on the night of the murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
she confessed on cross-examination that she was present and within hearing
distance when her mother was investigated by Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Venturina</span>
at <span class="SpellE">Tumauini</span> on May 1, 1959 and that what she heard her
mother declare, she repeated later before Judge <span class="SpellE">Barcelo</span>
who made an abstract of her testimony.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Like a dutiful daughter, she followed her mother's lead when the latter
singled out the appellant as the malefactor.</p>

<p class="BODY">We now turn to the alibi of <span class="SpellE">Fulgencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Baquiran</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
time of the incident, he was one of the barrio lieutenants of <span class="SpellE">Arcon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tumauini</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Isabela</span></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Around four o'clock in the afternoon of April
29, 1959, <span class="SpellE">Eusebia</span> Gonzales, the owner of a sari-sari
store in <span class="SpellE">Arcon</span>, reported the theft of a bottle of wine
from her store to <span class="SpellE">Baquiran</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, he was not at home then as he had
gone plowing in <span class="SpellE">Minanga</span>, another barrio of <span class="SpellE">Tumauini</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At five
o'clock in the <span style="">afternoon, </span>he
went home and was informed by his wife of the theft and Gonzales' desire to see
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After resting for a while and
cooking for his wife who had just given birth, he went to see Gonzales,
arriving in her store around six o'clock in the evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After thirty minutes, he left to send for the
suspected thief, <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> <span class="SpellE">Macoco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went to the house of <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>
Manuel, a barrio policeman, to ask the latter to see <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>
<span class="SpellE">Belisar</span>, another policeman within whose territory <span class="SpellE">Macoco</span> lives, that he may fetch the suspect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He arrived at Manuel's house around seven
o'clock in the eve­ning and waited for about an hour for <span class="SpellE">Belisar's</span>
report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At eight o'clock, his emissary
reported that the suspect could not come because of a headache.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At around eight-thirty, <span class="SpellE">Ba­<span style="">quiran</span></span><span style=""> </span>came back to the store of Gonzales and told her that the
investigation had to be conducted another time as the alleged thief was not in
a <span style="">proper </span>condition for any
inquiry.</p>

<p class="BODY">The time and the sequence of events constituting the alibi of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Baquiran</span></span><span style=""> </span>are corroborated by four witnesses
none of whom is his relative or <span class="GramE">is</span> possessed with an
observable reason, cause or motive to falsify his or her testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>
Manuel's reckoning of the time is thirty minutes earlier than that made by the
appellant, nonetheless the crucial period from six o'clock to seven o'clock in
the evening has been well covered by his testimony and that of Gonzales.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's alibi is <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span>
by the prose­cution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its veracity has
not been seriously challenged and, except for the minor inconsistency as to the
name of the stolen bottle of wine, no other contradiction fatal to the alibi of
appellant has been exposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did
the prosecution show that from six-thirty, when <span class="SpellE">Baquiran</span>
left the store of Gonzales, to seven o'clock, when he arrived at the house of <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> Manuel, the accused had the time and opportunity
to go to <span class="SpellE">Sisim</span> Alto, shoot the deceased and return to
<span class="SpellE">Arcon</span> to establish his alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the defense proved that
barrio <span class="SpellE">Sisim</span> Alto is more than six kilometers from
bar­rio <span class="SpellE">Arcon</span> and that to go from one place to the
other one has to pass through two other barrios, <span class="SpellE">Sisim</span>
<span class="SpellE">Abajo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Minanga</span>, as well
as cross a river.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although alibi is the
weakest de­fense that an accused can avail of, it acquires commensurate
strength where, as in this case, no positive and proper identification has been
satisfactorily made by witnesses of the offender's identity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution <span style="">has </span>the <u>onus</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">probandi</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>in establishing the guilt of the
accused, and the weakness of the defense does not relieve it of this
responsibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this Court recently
stated:</p>

<blockquote>"The rule that alibi must be satisfactorily proven was never
intended to change the burden of proof <span style="">in
</span>criminal cases; otherwise, we will see the absurdity of an accused being
put in a more difficult position where the prosecution's evi­<span style="">dence is </span>vague and weak than where it
is strong." <span class="GramE">(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Fraga</span>,
et al., G.R. No.</span> L-12005, August 31, 1960).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> is reversed,
and the ap­pellant is hereby acquitted, with costs <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>
