				<H3>ANTONIO M. PATERNO, ET AL., PETITIONERS VS. JOSE V. SALUD, RESPONDENT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Antonio Paterno and his sister Margarita Paterno Vda. de Javier brought on November &nbsp;8, 1952 before the Court of First Instance &nbsp;of Batangas an action to recover &nbsp;from Jose V. Salud a parcel of land &nbsp;containing an area of 5 hectares situated in San Juan de &nbsp;Bolbok, Batangas, as well as the value of the crops harvested therefrom since 1950 and damages. <p>Defendant claims to be the owner of the land which plaintiffs seek to recover having been in adverse possession thereof since &nbsp;1890 and having registered &nbsp;it in his name in Registration Case No. 23 of the same court on April 16, 1940 for which he obtained a torrens title. &nbsp;By way of counterclaim, &nbsp;defendant &nbsp;seeks in turn &nbsp;to recover &nbsp;from plaintiffs a strip &nbsp; of land with an area of 1 ½ hectares also situated &nbsp;in the same municipality.</p> <p>On May 31, 1954, after the reception of the evidence, the court <i>a quo</i> rendered judgment ordering defendant to reconvey to plaintiffs the land mentioned in their complaint free from any lien or incumbrance, to &nbsp;pay them P2,000.00 as moral damages, &nbsp;P224.00 as actual damages, and P2,000.00 as attorney's fees, plus costs of suit. &nbsp;The &nbsp;court dismissed defendant's &nbsp; counterclaim.</p> <p>When the case was &nbsp;taken to the Court of Appeals, the decision &nbsp;was &nbsp;reversed. &nbsp;&nbsp;The &nbsp;court &nbsp;not &nbsp;only &nbsp;dismissed plaintiff's complaint but ordered them to reconvey to defendant &nbsp;the &nbsp;land subject-matter &nbsp;of his &nbsp;counterclaim consisting of &nbsp;1 ½&nbsp;hectares, &nbsp;with costs. &nbsp;&nbsp;Plaintiff &nbsp;interposed the present petition for &nbsp;review.</p> <p>It appears from plaintiffs' evidence that on March 30, 1912, Jose T. Paterno, as administrator of the &nbsp;estate of Maximino Molo Agustin &nbsp;Paterno, acquired at &nbsp;an auction sale certain parcels of land that were levied in execution belonging to Esteban &nbsp;de Villa, &nbsp;among others, one &nbsp;of the following description: &nbsp;"No. 5, Terreno en dicho 'barrio de Libato, de 1200 metros cuadrados de superficie, lindante al Norte rio Lawaye; al &nbsp;Este Francisco Marasigan; al Sur estero Lapa; y al Oeste &nbsp;Benedicto &nbsp;de Villa." &nbsp;From &nbsp;1915 to 1927 Paterno &nbsp; leased this parcel of land &nbsp;together &nbsp;with the other parcels acquired at the auction sale to Esteban de Villa and Pia de Villa. &nbsp;&nbsp;In 1924, Paterno, desiring to &nbsp;have all the lands so acquired registered under the Land Registration Act, ordered their survey as described in their tax declarations and in the notice of sale, and it was then discovered that the area &nbsp;of parcel No. 5 was not only 1,200 sq. m. as described therein but 30.5285 hectares.</p> <p>In March, 1926, Paterno sought the registration of the lands acquired in the auction &nbsp;sale &nbsp;in the name &nbsp;of the estate of Maximino Molo Agustin Paterno, but parcel No. 5 was not included because its plan had not yet been approved when the petition for &nbsp;registration &nbsp;was filed. In 1927, all these lands were &nbsp;adjudicated to Concepcion Paterno &nbsp;Vda. de Padilla, &nbsp;daughter of the late Maximino Molo Agustin Paterno, &nbsp;as &nbsp;her share &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;estate. &nbsp;&nbsp;In that year, the lease of &nbsp;the &nbsp;lands to the De Villas was not renewed and so their &nbsp;possession was &nbsp;returned to the Paternos who appointed Felix Lontok &nbsp;as their overseer. &nbsp;Sometime thereafter, &nbsp;apparently acceding to the plea of &nbsp;the &nbsp;De Villas, Concepcion Paterno agreed to retain only the eastern portion of the land, &nbsp;with an area of &nbsp;5 hectares, leaving the rest with an area of 25 &nbsp;hectares to be subdivided between the De Villas.</p> <p>In &nbsp;1943, &nbsp;Concepcion Paterno died leaving all the &nbsp;lands she owned in Batangas, including the one &nbsp;in question, to plaintiffs as her heirs. &nbsp;Hence, from 1927, when the lease to the De Villas was terminated, to 1949, plaintiffs had been &nbsp;in possession of the lot with an area of &nbsp;5 hectares first thru their overseer Felix Lontok, who later &nbsp;became himself its lessee. &nbsp;In 1950, however, defendant wrested the possession of the land in question from plaintiffs in the manner they explained during the trial of the &nbsp;case. </p> <p>Thus, according to plaintiffs, defendant secured in 1931 a plan for the land &nbsp;in question which was approved by the Bureau of Lands. &nbsp;In 1946, he declared this property for taxation &nbsp;under Tax Declaration No. 2209. &nbsp;This was later cancelled by Tax Declaration No. 4410 with the excuse that it &nbsp;was a &nbsp;correction of &nbsp;Tax &nbsp;Declaration &nbsp;No. &nbsp;&nbsp;1956. In 1947, defendant filed a petition for &nbsp;registration of the land omitting to mention &nbsp;therein the &nbsp;claims &nbsp;of &nbsp;Jose T. Paterno &nbsp;and Concepcion Paterno &nbsp;although &nbsp;in the plan on which his petition for registration was &nbsp;based it &nbsp;was stated that the land described therein was identical to that surveyed for Concepcion Paterno and was part &nbsp;of &nbsp;a much larger tract of land surveyed for Jose T. Paterno. &nbsp;Defendant was ordered &nbsp;to amend his petition by including these two as claimants. &nbsp;&nbsp;This he did but he gave their addresses as San Juan, Batangas, although he knew they never lived there. &nbsp;&nbsp;No copy of the petition was served on their overseer &nbsp;Felix &nbsp;Lontok. &nbsp;&nbsp;The &nbsp;petition was &nbsp;heard &nbsp;without opposition, and on April 16, 1948 the court issued &nbsp;a decree in favor of defendant over the land in &nbsp;question. &nbsp;&nbsp;In &nbsp;1950, armed with this decree, defendant wrested the possession of the land from plaintiffs and reaped the harvest &nbsp;therefrom of some 20 to 25 cavanes of palay since that &nbsp;year. In &nbsp;the &nbsp;meantime, &nbsp;defendant &nbsp;mortgaged the land to the Philippine National Bank. &nbsp;&nbsp;Attempts were made &nbsp;to &nbsp;settle the controversy amicably, and when this &nbsp;proved &nbsp;in &nbsp;vain, the present action &nbsp;was taken by the plaintiffs.</p> <p>Plaintiffs' theory, therefore, may be stated &nbsp;as &nbsp;follows: The Land in question was originally a portion of &nbsp;a bigger parcel of land whose area was found to &nbsp;be 30.5285 &nbsp;hectares which was purchased by Jose T. Paterno, as administrator of the estate of &nbsp; Maximino &nbsp;Molo &nbsp;Agustin &nbsp;Paterno, &nbsp;at an auction sale involving the properties of Esteban de Villa. This land &nbsp;was later adjudicated &nbsp;to Concepcion &nbsp;Paterno Vda. &nbsp;de Padilla, who, &nbsp;upon &nbsp;her &nbsp;death, &nbsp;bequeathed &nbsp;it together with &nbsp;other hands, to plaintiffs.</p> <p>Defendant's evidence, on &nbsp;the other hand, &nbsp;discloses &nbsp;that on June 25, 1881 JBaltazar de Villa owned, among others, a parcel of land &nbsp;of the following description: "La tercera partida de cantidad de unos &nbsp;veinte cavanes &nbsp;aproximados de semilla de &nbsp;palay, cuyos confines, al Este &nbsp;las tierras de Da. Antonio de Villa, al Oeste las de Don. Vicente de Villa, y al Norte el Rio denominado Lawaye, y al Sur las tierras de Diia. Paula de Mercado con riachuelo denominado Lapa en Medio." &nbsp;&nbsp;(Possessory information &nbsp;Exhibit 6-a.) &nbsp;&nbsp;Baltazar de Villa is the father of Esteban de Villa and Pia de Villa, while Pia de Villa is the mother of Jose V. Salud, defendant herein.</p> <p>In 1912, Jose T. Paterno, as administrator of the estate of Maximino Molo Agustin Paterno, bought at &nbsp;an auction sale certain lands belonging to Esteban &nbsp;de Villa pursuant to a levy in execution issued &nbsp;to enforce &nbsp;a &nbsp;judgment obtained against Esteban de Villa. &nbsp;Among the lands &nbsp;so purchased was one described as follows: "No. 5. &nbsp;Terreno en dicho barrio &nbsp;de Libato, de 1200 metros cuadrados &nbsp;de euperficie, lindante al Norte rio Lawaye; al Este Francisco Marasigan; al Sur estero Lapa; y al Oeste &nbsp;Benedicto &nbsp;de Villa."</p> <p>After Pia &nbsp;de Villa acquired the parcel &nbsp;of land &nbsp;covered by the possessory information Exhibit 6-a from her father Baltazar, &nbsp;she &nbsp;immediately entered into its &nbsp; possession, &nbsp;with the exception of some portions thereof which she later sold, and continued in said possession &nbsp;until her &nbsp;death. &nbsp;Of said land, Pia donated a portion containing &nbsp;12 hectares to Vicente de &nbsp;Villa; sold another containing &nbsp;8 hectares &nbsp;to Antonio Adapon; and a &nbsp;portion &nbsp;thereof &nbsp;situated on the eastern part containing an area of 5 hectares &nbsp;was transmitted by succession to her &nbsp;son Jose V. Salud. &nbsp;On April 16, &nbsp; 1948, &nbsp;defendant Salud sought the registration of this parcel of land, together with others that belonged to &nbsp;him, for which he secured a torrens title in the manner already outlined elsewhere in this decision.</p> <p>We may, therefore, say &nbsp;that defendant's theory is as follows: Neither the land in question, nor the larger tract of land containing 30.5285 hectares of which it was originally &nbsp;a part, was included in the &nbsp;auction in 1912 of the properties of Esteban de Villa, and &nbsp;so none was transmitted by plaintiffs' predecessor-in-interest to Concepcion &nbsp;Paterno Vda. de Padilla, nor devised or transmitted by the latter to plaintiffs. &nbsp;Plaintiffs failed to identify the parcel of land which &nbsp;they claim to be their own. &nbsp;The land in question belonged to defendant's mother &nbsp;Pia de Villa, from whom he derived his title. &nbsp;And the &nbsp;land which properly belong to plaintiffs is the strip of 1,200 sq. m. on the eastern edge of another property belonging to defendant which was used by the &nbsp;Paternos as a road to the &nbsp;provincial &nbsp;highway, which land was the one bought at the auction sale &nbsp;in 1912.</p> <p>Predicated upon the evidence presented by both parties in relation to issues raised by &nbsp;them, the Court of &nbsp;Appeals reached the following &nbsp;conclusion:</p> <blockquote> <p>"After a careful perusal of the &nbsp;proofs of record, we are of the firm &nbsp;belief that the land in question &nbsp;and the bigger &nbsp;parcel of 30.5235 &nbsp;hectares of which &nbsp; it was &nbsp;originally &nbsp;a part, were not included in the auction in 1912 &nbsp;of the properties of Esteban &nbsp;de Villa; that &nbsp;these lands were transmitted &nbsp;by Maximino Molo &nbsp;Agustin Paterno &nbsp;to &nbsp;Concepcion P. de Padilla; &nbsp;that &nbsp;the land in question was not devised &nbsp;or transmitted by Concepcion de Padilla &nbsp;to plaintiffs; &nbsp;and that plaintiffs failed to identify &nbsp;conclusively the land in question over which &nbsp;they claim &nbsp;ownership; &nbsp;that &nbsp;the &nbsp;land in question &nbsp;belonged to &nbsp;defendant's mother, Pia de Villa, from whom he derived his title; &nbsp;and that plaintiffs land is the strip of 1,200 square meters used by them as a road from other property belonging to them, to &nbsp;the provincial highway."</p> </blockquote> <p>The evidence of record fully justifies the &nbsp;above &nbsp;finding. It appears that among the lands 'bought by the administrator of the &nbsp;estate of Maximino Molo Agustin Paterno at the auction sale of the properties of Esteban de Villa which was &nbsp;of particular interest in this case is the one described in the notice of sale as follows: "No. 5. &nbsp;&nbsp;Terreno en dicho barrio de &nbsp;Libato, de &nbsp;1200 metros cudrados de supeficie, lindante al Norte rio Lawaya; &nbsp;al Este Francisco Marasigan; al Sur estero Lapa; y al Oeste Benedkto de Villa." This land only carries an area of 1,200 sq. m. &nbsp;There is nothing to &nbsp; show that this1 forms &nbsp;part of an original parcel of land containing an area of 30.5285 &nbsp; hectares which in 1912 &nbsp;also belonged to Esteban de Villa. &nbsp;The only thing that plaintiffs claim to bolster up their contention ie that when this &nbsp;parcel of land was surveyed in 1924, together with &nbsp;other parcels of land bought in the auction sale, as a preparatory &nbsp;step for their registration under the Land Registration Act, it &nbsp;was &nbsp;discovered that &nbsp;parcel &nbsp;No. 5, which was sold to them by the sheriff in 1912, had &nbsp;an area of not only 1,200 sq. m. &nbsp;but 30.5285 hectares, which claim certainly is untenable because a piece of land having an area of 1,200 sq. m. cannot &nbsp;be said to be &nbsp;identical to one having an area of 30.5285 hectares, which is more than 250 times &nbsp;bigger. &nbsp;Contrary to &nbsp;plaintiffs' contention, the boundaries of &nbsp;the &nbsp;two &nbsp;properties are not also the same. The identical and natural boundaries are only on the north and south—Lawaye river on the north and Lapa creek on the south; there toeing no &nbsp;natural boundaries &nbsp;on the east and west, &nbsp;as there are on these sides' &nbsp;merely names of adjoining owners. &nbsp;There is no evidence that these adjoining owners &nbsp;do not own other lands which adjoin other properties of Esteban de &nbsp;Villa &nbsp; along these rivers. &nbsp;This great difference in &nbsp;area was &nbsp;not satisfactorily explained. </p> <p>While there are &nbsp;authorities that uphold the proposition that in identifying a particular piece of land its boundaries and not the area are the main &nbsp;factors to be &nbsp;considered,<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[1]</sup></font> however, this &nbsp;only holds true when the boundaries given are sufficventlu certain and the identity of the &nbsp;land proved &nbsp;by the boundaries clearly indicates that an erroneous statement concerning the area can &nbsp;be disregarded or ignored. Otherwise, the area stated in the document should be followed.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[2]</sup> </font>&nbsp;Thus, &nbsp;in &nbsp;a case where a &nbsp;petitioner claimed &nbsp;in his application to be entitled to the registration of a parcel of land whose area after the survey turned out &nbsp;to be 626 hectares while the grant given to &nbsp;him only &nbsp;mentions 92 hectares, &nbsp;the court rejected the &nbsp;claim after &nbsp;laying down the &nbsp;following &nbsp;principle: &nbsp;"While the &nbsp;proposition of law laid &nbsp;down by the court below may be true to the effect that natural boundaries will prevail over area, yet when the land sought to be registered is almost seven times as much as that described &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;deed,<i> the evidence as to &nbsp;natural boundaries must be very clear &nbsp;and convincing before that rule can be applied."</i><font color="#ff0000"><sup>[3]</sup></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Italics supplied) &nbsp;&nbsp;Plaintiffs' contention was, therefore, properly &nbsp;rejected &nbsp;by the Court of Appeals it appearing that it is only on the north &nbsp; and south sides of the property in question &nbsp;where the natural boundaries are &nbsp;identical &nbsp;because on the east and west &nbsp;there are no &nbsp;natural &nbsp;boundaries but only the names of &nbsp;adjoining owners who were not shown not to own &nbsp;other properties adjoining those of &nbsp;Esteban de &nbsp;Villa. &nbsp;The discrepancy in the measurement of the two pieces of land is so great that there could hardly be any room to suppose that a 30-hectare land area might have &nbsp;been &nbsp;wrongly &nbsp;or &nbsp;&nbsp;inaccurately &nbsp;estimated to be only 1,200 sq. m.</p> <p>Another factor that argues &nbsp;against plaintiffs' claim is the &nbsp;fact that the inventory and partition &nbsp;of the estate of Maximino Molo Agustin Paterno does not show that the land in question was ever transmitted to Concepcion Paterno Vda. de &nbsp;Padilla, &nbsp;plaintiffs' predecessor-in- interest. &nbsp;Nor does the &nbsp;inventory of the estate of the &nbsp;late Concepcion Paterno de Padilla, which includes all her real properties in Batangas, makes any mention of the property &nbsp;in question. For this &nbsp;reason, the &nbsp;Court of Appeals could not bring its mind to conform to the claim of plaintiffs that the land in question &nbsp;is the one included in the auction sale held in 1912 of the properties of Esteban de Villa and which was later handed down to them by their predecessor-in-interest Concepcion Paterno Vda. de Padilla, as may be seen from the following comment: </p> <blockquote> <p>"* * * Moreover, &nbsp;the &nbsp;inventory &nbsp;and &nbsp;partition &nbsp;of the estate of Maximino &nbsp;Molo Agustin Paterno, shows that the &nbsp;property in question was never transmitted to &nbsp;said Concepcion de Padilla (Exhibits HH-1 &amp; HH-39). &nbsp;The &nbsp; inventory of Concepcion de &nbsp;Padilla's estate, which included all her real &nbsp;properties in Batangas, failed to mention the property in question. &nbsp;(Exhibit 3). &nbsp;The &nbsp;inventory mentioned properties &nbsp;of various areas, &nbsp;registered under the Torrens system in &nbsp;the name of &nbsp;Concepcion Paterno; &nbsp;and the property in question was not then registered under the Torrens &nbsp;system. &nbsp;&nbsp;It was shown &nbsp;that &nbsp;this &nbsp;inventory &nbsp;was presented by her administratrix before the probate court and the same was approved by said court, without the objection of &nbsp;the &nbsp;plaintiffs, notwithstanding their &nbsp;awareness of the pendency of the administration proceedings. Again, in the &nbsp;project of partition of Concepcion de &nbsp;Padilla's &nbsp;(Exhibit &nbsp;4), wherein various &nbsp;properties &nbsp;in &nbsp;Batangas were adjudicated &nbsp;to &nbsp;the plaintiffs, the property in question was not included. &nbsp;It is worthy to note that plaintiffs, the administratrix and other &nbsp;instituted heirs, signed the said project &nbsp;of partition, which &nbsp;was &nbsp;presented to and approved by the court (Exhibit 5). &nbsp;Again, it is &nbsp;conceded that the project was &nbsp;denominated &nbsp;'partial' &nbsp;project &nbsp;of partition. &nbsp;But &nbsp;this does not refer to &nbsp;any undiscovered 'residuary estate' &nbsp;in Batangas, not adjudicated to the plaintiffs, but to &nbsp;the interest and participation &nbsp;of the deceased &nbsp;testatrix on the properties &nbsp;under administration in cases &nbsp;Nos. 46058 to 46063, CFI of Manila—to the &nbsp;testate estate of Concepcion's husband, &nbsp;Narciso Padilla (Exh. &nbsp;4 clause &nbsp;11). They do not &nbsp;refer to the properties of &nbsp;Concepcion de Padilla &nbsp;in Batangas, &nbsp;for as &nbsp;far as &nbsp;her &nbsp;Batangas properties &nbsp;are concerned, the &nbsp;project &nbsp;of &nbsp;partition &nbsp;was &nbsp;complete. &nbsp;In &nbsp;&nbsp;fact, &nbsp;answering &nbsp;the question 'Are you sure &nbsp; that all properties within the jurisdiction of the province of Batangas, left by your aunt Concepcion Paterno Vda. &nbsp;de Padilla &nbsp;were &nbsp;enumerated in &nbsp;that &nbsp;inventory?', &nbsp; plaintiff Antonio Paterno said: 'Yes' &nbsp;(t.s.n., p. 117 &nbsp;March &nbsp;19, 1953), &nbsp;which inventory as heretofore stated, does not include the property in question (Exhibit 3). &nbsp;If, &nbsp;as alleged by plaintiff Antonio Paterno, as early as 1929 or 1930, he already knew of his aunt Concepcion's desire to have all her Batangas properties registered, it was not satisfactorily explained why he or his aunt &nbsp;had not commenced registration proceedings of the &nbsp;land under &nbsp;consideration, notwithstanding the fact that he received the plan, &nbsp;surveyor's certificate and technical &nbsp;description of the land &nbsp;(Exhibits B, B-l and B-2), after &nbsp;the death of &nbsp;his aunt in 1943 and that the &nbsp;property &nbsp;was allegedly adjudicated to him in 1946. &nbsp;This, coupled with the other facts and factors heretofore discussed, can only mean that plaintiffs did not &nbsp;acquire the &nbsp;land in question from their aunt Concepcion de Padilla." </p> </blockquote> <p>Plaintiffs tried to trace the &nbsp;history of the land in question thru an elaborate exposition of the chain of tax declarations covering it since 1923, but this &nbsp;cannot help them any as long &nbsp;as the fundamental question &nbsp;relative &nbsp;to &nbsp;the identity of the land is not resolved. &nbsp;And here, as we have said, &nbsp;this is not the case. &nbsp;The lower court emphasized the circumstance that the &nbsp;Tax Declaration &nbsp;No. 8100 &nbsp;in &nbsp; the name of &nbsp;Pia de Villa &nbsp;(Exhibit KK-8) &nbsp;which superseded Exhibit &nbsp;KK-7 was cancelled in 1922 by Tax Declaration No. 8388 in &nbsp;the name of Jose T. Paterno. &nbsp;&nbsp;But it &nbsp;should be noted &nbsp;that said Tax Declaration No. &nbsp;8388 was &nbsp;in &nbsp;the following year 1923 cancelled partially by Tax Declaration No. 8624 in the name &nbsp;of Pia de Villa, which declares an area &nbsp;of 25.6876 hectares and by Tax Declaration No. 8623 in the name of Jose T. Paterno which declare an area of 1,200 sq &nbsp;m., assessed &nbsp;at P30.00, &nbsp;and for &nbsp;which the &nbsp;tax paid was only P0.26. &nbsp;The position of plaintiffs is rendered more doubtful by the fact that Pia de Villa and not Esteban de &nbsp;Villa &nbsp;was the declared owner in 1918 of &nbsp;the large tract of land of which the 5 hectares in question forms part &nbsp;as shown by the very diagram made by plaintiffs. This &nbsp;can only mean that &nbsp;after the auction sale in 1912, Pia de Villa was the owner of the entire property in 1918, and that what was sold to Jose T. Paterno &nbsp;was in fact another land of 1,200 sq. m. owned by Esteban de Villa.</p> <p>On the other hand, defendant has proven that the property in question belonged to his mother Pia de Villa from whom he derive his title. &nbsp;The &nbsp;original &nbsp;parcel of land described in the possessory information title Exhibit (5-a was inherited by Pia de Villa upon the death of her father Baltazar de Villa. &nbsp;Pia's ownership was even admitted by plaintiffs. &nbsp;Pia commenced possession of said land and continued therein until her death except with regard to certain portions &nbsp;which she disposed of to wit: &nbsp;by donation to Vicente de Villa (lVz hectares), by sale to Bonifacio Hernandez &nbsp;(5 hectares), and by mortgage to one Adapon &nbsp;(8 hectares) , thereby leaving her five hectares on the easternmost portion to her &nbsp;son Jose V. Salud &nbsp;which &nbsp; is &nbsp;the land in question. &nbsp;She declared said piece of land in her name for taxation &nbsp; purposes and as early as 1914 she paid the taxes thereon. &nbsp;&nbsp;Even when she was still alive Pia already adjudicated said property to her son, &nbsp;defendant herein, although she continued possessing and administering it. &nbsp;Plaintiffs' claim &nbsp;that the &nbsp;land in &nbsp;question was &nbsp; mortgaged &nbsp;to &nbsp;the Paternos by the De Villa family who owed some money to Maximino &nbsp;Molo &nbsp;Agustin Paterno &nbsp;which &nbsp;mortgage was foreclosed and the property sold at public auction cannot be entertained, for the evidence reveals that it was Esteban de Villa &nbsp;alone, &nbsp;and not Pia de Villa, &nbsp;against whom the execution was levied upon and that the only property sold were those of Esteban de Villa which, as already stated, do not include the property in &nbsp;question.</p> <p>We &nbsp;believe, however, that the &nbsp;Court of &nbsp;Appeals erred in declaring defendant owner of the parcel of land claimed in his counterclaim. &nbsp;The evidence shows that plaintiffs' predecessor-in-interest Concepcion Paterno Vda. de Padilla secured in 1928 &nbsp;Original Certificate &nbsp;of Title No. 4918 over a parcel &nbsp;of land of which the land involved herein was a part. &nbsp;This &nbsp;parcel of land was &nbsp;originally acquired by the Paternos in 1912. &nbsp;This was leased to Esteban de Villa and &nbsp;Pia de Villa from 1917 to 1925; surveyed for &nbsp;Jose T. Paterno on September 25, 1924; &nbsp;was the subject of petition for registration &nbsp;by the Paternos in 1926, due notice &nbsp;of which was given to the De Villas, and upon the death &nbsp;of Concepcion Paterno Vda. de Padilla, it was transmitted &nbsp;to plaintiffs by succession. &nbsp;&nbsp;Since &nbsp; the &nbsp;land in question &nbsp;was registered in the name of &nbsp;the Paternos in 1928 and it was only on &nbsp;November 19, 1952, date of defendant's &nbsp;answer, that he sought its &nbsp; reconveyance to him, that title &nbsp;became indefeasible under Section 38, Act No. 496, as amended by Act No. 3630. &nbsp;Here &nbsp;there is no proof &nbsp;of irregularity &nbsp;in the issuance of the title, &nbsp;nor in the proceeding incident thereto, nor is there any claim that fraud has intervened in the issuance of said title. &nbsp;&nbsp;Even then, the period of one year within which intrinsic fraud can be claimed has long expired. &nbsp;This land &nbsp;should, therefore, &nbsp;be adjudicated &nbsp;to plaintiffs.</p> <p>Wherefore, the decision &nbsp;appealed from is modified in the sense that the land &nbsp;claimed &nbsp;in &nbsp;the complaint belongs &nbsp;to defendant and therefore the complaint should be dismissed. With regard to defendant's counterclaim, the land &nbsp;therein claimed should be adjudicated to plaintiffs. &nbsp;&nbsp;No costs.</p> <p> <i>Bengzon, C. J.
