right to damages and to the owner­ship and possession of a house in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
the subject of the suit:</p>

<p class="BODY">In Civil Case 3412 of the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, judgment was, on <st1:date year="1958" day="6" month="5">May 6, 1958</st1:date>, rendered ordering defendant therein, <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span>, to pay
plaintiff Jesus <span class="SpellE">Gigante</span> P1<span class="GramE">,570</span>
with interest and attorneys' fees.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Pursuant to the writ of execution there issued, the Sheriff levied - on <st1:date year="1961" day="29" month="5">May 29, 1961</st1:date> - the house in question
situate at <st1:street><st1:address>551 <span class="SpellE">Nadurata</span>
  Street</st1:address></st1:street>, Grace Park, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
valued at P3<span class="GramE">,040</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1961</st1:date>,
said house was sold at public auction to plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Gigante</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, on <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1962</st1:date>, the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> granted <span class="SpellE">Gigante's</span> motion
for a writ of possession of that house.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>But the writ of possession was successfully blocked in the Municipal
Court of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> by Republic Savings Bank
(hereinafter referred to merely as the Bank) which asserted ownership of the
house upon facts hereinafter to be related.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is undisputed that the house in question was originally
entered in the assessment rolls of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:place></st1:city>
as Tax Declaration 34783 in the name of <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span>, judgment debtor of Jesus <span class="SpellE">Gigante</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Across the face of this tax declaration,
however, <span style="">the following </span>entry
appears: "Cancelled (by) Tax No. 52622 Rolando D. <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span>".
Tax Declaration 52622, on its face and <span style="">according
to a certi­</span>fication of the Office of the Assessor of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
was taken by Rolando <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span> on <st1:date year="1958" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1958</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1959" day="29" month="3">March 29, 1959</st1:date>,
said Rolando <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span> applied for a loan of P25<span class="GramE">,000</span> with the Bank.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>He offered as collateral <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> that house
then already declared for taxation pur­poses in his name under Tax Declaration
52622 as well as the land on which it stands covered by Transfer Certificate of
Title 59922 issued in his favor.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this
application, the Bank granted Rolando <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span> a loan
of P18<span class="GramE">,000</span> secured by a real estate mortgage dated <st1:date year="1959" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1959</st1:date> on the land covered by
the <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> title just <span style="">mentioned "<u>together</u></span> with all the buildings and
improvements now existing or which may hereafter be constructed on the
mortgaged property." This mortgage was recorded on <st1:date year="1959" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Rolando <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Mallari</span></span><span style=""> failed to pay the loan.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Bank foreclosed.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1960" day="28" month="6">June
 28, 1960</st1:date>, the Bank bought the land "together with all the
buildings and improvements thereon" for P23<span class="GramE">,631.19</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, title to the land and all the
improvements thereon was consolidated <span style="">in </span>the name of the Bank.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And, on <st1:date year="1961" day="5" month="7">July 5, 1961</st1:date>, Transfer Certificate of Title 88233 was
issued to the Bank by the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
in lieu of Rolando <span class="SpellE">Mallari's</span> Torrens Title No. 59922.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">And </span>now
to the present suit.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Plaintiff Jesus <span class="SpellE">Gigante</span> charges that any transfer
from <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> to his son Rolando is fictitious,
fraudulent and null <span style="">and void.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He prays that defendants Rolando <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span> and the Bank turn </span><span style="">over to </span>him the possession and
ownership of the house, and jointly and severally pay him P5<span class="GramE">,000</span>
by way of actual losses and damages, P2,000 for exemplary damages, and P2,000
as attorneys' fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants' answer traversed the allegations of the complaint,
averred that defendant Bank purchased said house <span style="">and the lot at a sale on foreclosure of the mortgage executed by
Rolando <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span> in its favor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the issues, judgment was rendered below dismissing the
complaint with costs against plaintiff; <span style="">declaring
the </span>house and lot in question as the Bank's property; <span style="">and ordering </span>plaintiff to pay
defendants P300 each by way of attorneys' <span style="">fees.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff </span>appealed.</p>

<blockquote>1. Plaintiff's claim to the house rests on the judgment in his
favor and against <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span>
of <st1:date year="1958" day="6" month="5">May 6, 1958</st1:date>, and the
Sheriff's levy of <st1:date year="1961" day="29" month="5">May 29, 1961</st1:date>
and sale of the house on <st1:date year="1961" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1961</st1:date>,
both in Civil Case 3412 of the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Caloocan</span></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>But neither judgment
nor levy nor sale was recorded on the <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place>
title.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">Upon the other </span>hand, the Bank's right is based on a real estate
mortgage duly <span style="">recorded on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="24" month="4"><span style="">April
 24, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Bank's registered mortgage is thus
superior to both said judgment and levy and sale.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And, by virtue of the foreclosure sale of
the land and the improvements thereon, the house on said land is beyond the
reach of plaintiff's action to nullify the transfer from <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>
to Rolando <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Because, the house - the subject matter thereof - has
lawfully passed into the ownership and possession of the Bank which has <span style="">not acted </span>in bad faith.</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>2. Neither would the action for rescission of the transfer of the
house - alleged to be fraudulent - from <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span> to his son Rolando <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span>
prosper.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor the action for damages
against herein defendants Rolando <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span> and the
Bank.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">reason is </span>plain.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span>, the <span style="">vendor, is not a party to the </span>present
suit.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He is an indispensable
party.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The action for rescission and
the claim for damages cannot be finally determined without the presence in
court of <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For, any decision on either would affect
him.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He is entitled to be heard, to
defend the validity of the transfer to his son Rolando.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Judgment in the present suit would not be binding upon <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mallari</span>, cannot be executed against him.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="FOOTNOTES">In Alberto <i>vs.</i> <span class="SpellE">Mananghala</span>,
89 Phil. 188, 191-192, this Court said:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES"><span style="">"In an action
for rescission of sale because of </span>non­payment <span style="">of price, the vendee is an indispensable party. </span>(<span class="SpellE">Ocejo</span>, Perez 8 <st1:place>Co.</st1:place> <i>vs.</i>
International Banking Corporation, 37 Phil. 631.) In an action for recovery of
property against a person who purchased it from another who in turn acquired it
from others by the same means or by donation or otherwise, the <span style="">predecessors of </span>defendants, are
indispensable parties if the transfers if not voided, may bind <span style="">plaintiff. (Garcia <i>vs.</i> Reyes, 17 Phil.
127.) In the </span>latter case, this Court held:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES">'In order to bring this suit duly to a close, it is
imperative to determine the only question raised in connection with the pending
appeal, to wit, whether al/ the persons who intervened in the matter of the
transfers and donation herein referred to, are or are not necessary parties to
this suit, since it is asked in the complaint that the said transfers and
donation be declared null and' void - an indispensable declaration for the
purpose, in a proper case, of concluding the plaintiff to be the sole owner of
the house in dispute.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES">If such a declaration of annulment can directly affect the
persons who made and who were concerned in the said transfers, nothing could be
more proper and just than to hear them in the litigation, as parties interested
in main­taining the validity of those transactions, and therefore, whatever be
the nature of the judgment rendered, Francisco Reyes, Dolores <span class="SpellE">Carvajal</span>, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Chicote</span>,
Vicente Mir<span style="">a</span>nda, and Rafael
Sierra, besides the said minors, must be included in the case as defendants.'
(Garcia <i>vs.</i> Reyes, <span class="GramE">17 Phil. 130-131.</span>)."</p>
