				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Ten persons were charged with the offense of robbery with homicide
committed in the early morning of <st1:date year="1962" day="3" month="11">November
 3, 1962</st1:date> in the <u>barrio</u> of <span class="SpellE">Goso</span>-on, <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Carmen</st1:placename></st1:place>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Agusan</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Six of them, described in the indictment by
the appellations John, Peter, Joseph, Walter, <span class="SpellE">Caezar</span>
and Roberto, all surnamed Doe, were, up to the promulgation of the judgment <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u>, at large.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of the remaining
four accused, two, <span class="SpellE">Inecito</span> <span class="SpellE">Hevero</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Nonilon</span> <span class="SpellE">Butao</span>, were,
after due trial, acquitted for insufficiency of evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last two, Angeles Cruz and Arturo <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>, were found guilty, and each was sentenced to
life imprisonment; both were also adjudged, jointly and severally, to indemnify
the heirs of the two deceased victims, in the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,000</span>
each.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this decision of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, these two appealed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> later withdrew his appeal;
under Resolution of <st1:date year="1966" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1966</st1:date>,
we granted the withdrawal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Only the appeal of Angeles Cruz is the object of this review.</p>

<p class="BODY">The heart of this appeal is the correctness of the identification
of Angeles Cruz by the two principal witnesses for the pr<span style="">o</span>secution, the sisters <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> and Emma <span class="SpellE">Cabillo</span>, 15 and
12 years of age, respectively, in June 1963 when they testified in Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We address the question:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Was the identification of Angeles Cruz <span class="GramE">so</span>
positive and certain as to meet the inflexible require­ment of proof beyond
reasonable doubt of his criminal participa­tion?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our answer is in the negative.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution's version may be summarized briefly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A band of robbers, numbering from five to
ten, at about one o'clock in the morning of November 3, 1962, broke into the
house of <span class="SpellE">Tarciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabillo</span>
in <span class="SpellE">Goso</span>-on, Carmen, <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They scaled the front wall by the use of an
improvised ladder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching its <u>veranda</u>,
they drilled holes in the wall to loosen the boards, after the removal of some
of which they gained entrance into the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mixed eerie sounds of screaming and simultaneous discharge of firearms
forthwith followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon thereafter the
robbers hurriedly fled, away to a waiting speedboat and out to the sea and
darkness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Behind them lay a
terror-stricken household, its master <span class="SpellE">Tarciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabillo</span> dead from a spray of bullets, and a housemaid,
Margarita <span class="SpellE">Cabilogan</span>, profusely bleeding from a gun­shot
wound which inexorably caused her death.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was the integrated testimony of <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>
and Emma <span class="SpellE">Cabillo</span> upon which the trial court
principally based its conviction of Angeles Cruz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were roused from slumber, so they tes­tified,
by the instantaneous presence of at least five men, all masked, in the living
room where they were sleeping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they
had sprung to their feet, they were grabbed by two of the rob­bers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> was held
fast by Arturo <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>, with his arms slung around
her waist, while Emma was held in a similar fashion by Angeles Cruz; both girls
were utilized as shields when the robbers commenced firing into the master's
bedroom where <span class="SpellE">Tarciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabillo</span>
apparently held out for sometime with his own gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After resistance had altogether ceased, the
robbers ransacked every known drawer and container.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> and Emma
were then forced down to the store below where, with the aid of electric
lights, they marked the identities of Arturo <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
and Angeles Cruz whose masks had fallen off during the confu­sion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The drawers in the store were chiseled open
and their con­tents seized by the robbers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Angeles Cruz then returned upstairs, Emma with him, unlocked the door to
the master's bedroom, and ransacked the two drawers therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>, meanwhile,
succeeded in slipping out to safe refuge in the house of a neighbor, Ben <span class="SpellE">Maol</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Emma had
remained upstairs, after the robbers beat a hasty escape, stunned by the sight
of her father lying inert in a pool of blood.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's challenge against the identification made of him
by <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> and Emma is two-pronged:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>first, the condi­tions that hapless morning
were not conducive to, but on the contrary were suppressive of, definitive
identification; and second, the subsequent actuations and declarations of Emma
and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> are irreconcilable with their avowed certainty
as to the identity of the appellant Cruz.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have committed the records of this case to an exacting
study.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unhappily, our minds cannot rest
easy on the evidence of guilt adduced against the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the wee hours after <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>
when the robbery took place, what was the lighting situation in the house?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let us examine the record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In her statements given to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Butuan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
police just a few hours after the perpetration of the crime, and to the police
authorities of Carmen the day after, <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> was
explicit that the living room of the house was sufficiently lighted to enable
her to identify at least two of the armed malefactors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the witness stand, however, she admitted,
contrary to her statements to the police, that the living room was unlighted
and "so dark that I could not see clearly their faces that night." It
was only later when they were down in the store that she came face to face with
two of the robbers, one of these being the appel­lant Cruz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the latter part of her testimony in court,
however, she reneged on her previous declaration and stated that while they
were still upstairs, the light in the living room was switched on by one of the
malefactors who commenced to ransack the drawers in that room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This narration hardly squares with the testimony
of the other girl, Emma, who testified that the light in the living room was
already on and was put out only when the firing started.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Completely negating the testimony of these
two girls, their mother, <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabillo</span>,
declared positively that the entire house was enveloped in darkness at the time
of the perpetra­tion of the crime, except for a small lamp in the master's bedroom
- and this, because the family was economizing on electrical consumption.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lighting situation in the house was therefore wholly
uncertain, and renders highly suspect and questionable, <span style="">if </span>not altogether infirm, the ability
of the two girls to shape out a positive identification of the appellant Cruz.</p>

<p class="BODY">But let us probe further into their other declarations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under oath they testified that all the
robbers were masked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was downstairs
in the store that these two sisters allegedly identified the faces of <span class="SpellE">Eonifacio</span> and Cruz, when the latter's masks sudden­ly fell
off their faces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rendered dramatic by
the production in court of two handkerchiefs alleged to have been recovered
from the scene of the crime that morning, this twist is remarkable for its <span class="SpellE">inverisimilitude</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the first place, these handkerchiefs were not properly or satisfactorily
identified because <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>, who had supposedly found
them, could not say whether those produced in court were the self-same
handkerchiefs that she had found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
second place, these handkerchiefs were alleged to have been turned over by <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> to municipal judge <span class="SpellE">Quirico</span>
<span class="SpellE">Battad</span> of Car­men, yet when called to the witness
stand the latter failed to affirm the discovery of such handkerchiefs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, no mention - not even the slightest
hint - was ever made of these handkerchiefs in the various statements given by
the two girls to the police investigators.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A facet <span class="GramE">so</span> significant and vital as the falling
off of the masks, the two girls would not have escaped mentioning when shortly
after the incident they were closely interrogated by the police.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the afternoon of <st1:date year="1962" day="3" month="11">November
 3, 1962</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> and Emma were brought to
the police department in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Butuan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> and, while there, made to
examine photographs of several "tough guys" in that city.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> singled out
Arturo <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> from the pictures, pointing to him
as one of the robbers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just then, one
Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Baril</span> of the Philippine Constabulary remarked to
her that <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> belonged to a gang, a member of
which was Angeles Cruz.</p>

<p class="BODY">That very same afternoon, Angeles Cruz was picked up in front of
a <span class="SpellE">moviehouse</span> and brought to the police station for
questioning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was made to walk and
turn around in the presence of <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> and Emma.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cruz was not placed in a police lineup, contrary
to standard stationhouse verification procedure, to test the accuracy of the
witnesses' memory, and to afford a mere suspect a fair chance of early relief
from the inconvenience inflicted on one who is mistakenly identified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>
and Emma testified that the several accused, including Cruz, were pointed out
to them as the persons suspected by the police as the perpetrators of the
robbery committed in <span class="SpellE">Goso</span>-on, and as notorious
"tough guys" in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Butuan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The identification at the police station was
attended, as the two girls themselves admitted, by a great deal of whispered
conversations as well as by at least one unexplained conference elsewhere in
the municipal building, at which they were present, immediately prior to their
being con­fronted with the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">The manner by which Emma and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>
were made to identify the accused at the police station was pointedly
suggestive, generated confidence where there was none, activated visual ima­gination,
and, all told, subverted their reliability as eyewitnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This unusual, coarse and highly singular
method of identification, which revolts against the accepted principles of
scientific crime detection, alienates the esteem of every just man, and
commands neither our respect nor acceptance.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, chief of police <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacon</span> of Carmen, <span class="SpellE">Agu­san</span>, whom
the lower court praised and commended in no uncertain terms as</p>

<blockquote>"... an impartial witness ... incumbent Chief of Police ... no
relation to any one of the accused ... no motive to distort the truth ... his
testimony ringing with truth and sincerity,"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">testified</span>
candidly on the witnesses' efforts at identification of the appellant
Cruz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pacon's</span> <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span> testimony is hereunder reproduced:</p>

<blockquote>"Q
-<span style=""> </span>What transpired when Angeles Cruz
arrived in the police station?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A - He
was brought to a table which was fenced around and he was interrogated, while
the children were outside.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then what transpired?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A - They asked the children who were beside
me.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q
-<span style=""> </span>What did they ask?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A - They were asked if they know the person
who was sitting near the table of the office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then I asked Emma first whether or not she know the person (referring to
Angeles Cruz) and Emma answered:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'He is
not the one.' Then Captain <span class="SpellE">Villa­remo</span> went outside
and inside the railing and related something to them and asked the children if
said person was the one who, one of the members of the <span class="SpellE"><u>barcada</u></span>
of Arturo <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>, robbed their father in <span class="SpellE">Goso</span>-on; that upon being asked, she said that he is not the
one. 'Keep on watching and examine whether or not he is one who robbed your
father in <span class="SpellE">Goso</span>-on,' Captain <span class="SpellE">Villaremo</span>
said.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So the children kept on watching
Angeles Cruz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly thereafter,
Captain <span class="SpellE">Villaremo</span> asked again if he is the one and
told them, saying:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'He is the one, Day,
no?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is the one, Day, no?' And then <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Z</span>enaida</span>
said, 'Maybe he is the one.' After that the children were brought to the P.C. Headquarters."
(<span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacon</span>, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 300-301, February 5, 1964)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We must hasten, at this juncture, without need of elaboration, to
stress that the record is sufficiently interspersed with reliable proof of the
identification of Arturo <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> as one of the <span class="SpellE"><u>particeps</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>criminis</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In sharp contrast, there is a paucity of
evidence of identification with respect to the appellant Cruz.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although indications there are in the record that the alibi
offered by the appellant Cruz may stand searching scrutiny, we will merely
repeat, as we come to the end of our travail, what we said in one case:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Although alibi is the weakest defense
that an accused can avail of, it acquires commensurate strength where, as in
this case, no positive and proper identification has been made by the witnesses
of the offender.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution has the
<u>onus</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>probandi</u></span> in establishing the guilt
of the accused, and the weakness of the defense does not relieve it of this
responsibility." (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Baquiran</span>, L-20153,
June 29, 1967, 20 SCRA 451, 460-461)</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> is reversed,
and the appellant Angeles Cruz is hereby acquitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.</span></p>
