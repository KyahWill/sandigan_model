				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A constitutional question with an element of novelty is raised in
this <span class="GramE">appeal</span> from a lower court order dismissing an
action for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition against the then respondent Fiscal
of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Benjamin H. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>,
to prevent him from conducting a preliminary investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is whether there is an encroachment on the
constitutional prerogatives of the Auditor General if, after the final approval
of certain vouchers by him without an appeal being made, an inquiry by a
provincial fiscal to determine whether criminal liability for <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> through falsification of public, official and
commercial documents based thereon could lawfully be conducted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court answered that it could
validly be undertaken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree that a
prosecutor could, without offending the constitutional grant of authority to
the Auditor General, do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We therefore
affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition proceeding filed with
the lower court on June <span style="">6, </span>1967,
petitioners,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
now appellants, assailed the jurisdiction of respondent Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, then Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
to conduct the preliminary investigation of the alleged commission of <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> through falsification of public, official and
commercial documents imputed to them by the other respondent, then the
Commanding General, Philippine Army, Fort <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Romeo <span class="SpellE">Espino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The basis for such a petition was that under
the Constitution, the Auditor General is not only vested with the duty to
examine or audit all expenditures of funds of the Government, but also to audit
or investigate and "bring to the attention of the proper administrative
officer expenditures of funds or property which in his opinion are irregular,
unnecessary, excessive, or extravagant." It is their contention that under
the above, it is incumbent on the Auditor General to determine whether criminal
responsibility for the anomaly discovered in the course of his audit or
examination of the accounts lies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
further contended that the decisions of the Auditor General on the correctness
of the vouchers on which the alleged offenses were based having become final and
irrevocable, not even the courts could substitute its findings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise the provision of <span style="">law </span>that vouchers, claims or accounts "once finally settled
<span style="">shall </span>in no case be opened or
reviewed except <span style="">as </span>herein
provided" would be meaningless if the army authorities and respondent
Fiscal were permitted to proceed with the preliminary investigation to
determine whether criminal cases could be filed.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The above legal objections were brought to the attention of the
then respondent Provincial Fiscal by petitioners in a motion to quash which <span style="">was </span>denied by him in a resolution of
May 23, 1967 on this ground:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The
exclusive jurisdiction of the Auditor General on matters now raised by
respondents refer to <span class="SpellE">auditorial</span> requirements and
approval but not to the criminal liability, if any, of the persons involved in
an alleged irregular or anomalous disbursement of public funds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The authority of the Fiscal to investigate
whether <span style="">a </span>criminal act has been
committed or not in the disbursement of public funds, and finally of the Courts
to try any person involved in the alleged <span class="SpellE">malversation</span>
of public funds is not curtailed or in any way divested by the administrative
findings of the Auditor General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To hold
otherwise would be to arrogate unto the Office of the Auditor General the power
which pertains to the judicial branch of the government."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Then came this petition before the lower court, petitioners
praying for a judgment annulling the aforesaid resolution of respondent
Provincial Fiscal denying their motion to quash, rendering judgment that he <span style="">was </span>without jurisdiction to conduct
such preliminary investigation and prohibiting him from further proceeding on
the matter.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
On November 2, 1967, there <span style="">was </span>a
motion to dismiss by respondent Provincial Fiscal based on the argument that
the amounts subject to the criminal cases were not closed and settled accounts
and that even if they were such, respondent Fiscal could still institute the
appropriate criminal action, there being no need for a certification by the
Auditor General as to any irregularity in the settlement of accounts <span style="">as </span>an essential element for a
criminal prosecution in <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">After an opposition was filed by petitioner to the aforesaid
motion to dismiss on <st1:date year="1967" day="21" month="11">November 21,
 1967</st1:date>, the lower court, in an order of <st1:date year="1967" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1967</st1:date>, dismissed the petition. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>In support of such an order, it was set forth
in such order of dismissal:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The
Provincial Fiscal is only studying whether or not, as complained of, from these
accounts or vouchers which have already been passed in audit by the Auditor
General or his representatives more than three years ago, there is a crime to
be prosecuted in which the petitioners are answerable."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
It was further emphasized:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Were
the theory of the petitioners to prevail, then the Auditor General will be
arrogating unto himself duties which pertain to the judicial branch of the
government."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The last ground on which the plea that the petition be dismissed was sustained
is the principle that one "cannot restrain the Fiscal, by means of
injunction, from prosecuting [this] case * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The matter was duly elevated on appeal to this Court on <st1:date year="1968" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The brief for petitioners as appellants was
filed on March 6 of that year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the
submission of the brief for respondents as <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
on <st1:date year="1968" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1968</st1:date>, the appeal
was deemed submitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As set forth at
the outset, there is no legal ground for reversing the <span style="">lower </span>court.</p>

<p class="BODY">1. Appellants, in their brief, reiterate their principal argument
that the order of the lower court dismissing their petition and thus allowing
their investigation by respondent Fiscal to proceed, did amount to an
encroachment on the constitutional prerogatives of the Auditor General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a contention lacks merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It betrays on its face a lack of understanding
of the constitutional provision relied upon.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Auditor General, as noted, is vested with the power to examine,
audit and settle all accounts pertaining to the revenues and receipts from
whatever source, and to audit, in accordance with law and administrative
regulations, all expenditures of funds or property pertaining to or held in
trust by the government as well as the provinces or municipalities thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
That is one thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ascertainment of
whether <span style="">a </span>crime
is committed and by whom is definitely another.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is thus a manifest failure on the part of appellants <span style="">to </span>appreciate correctly the
constitutional objective in the conferment of authority on the Auditor
General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is based on the fundamental
postulate that <span style="">in </span>the division
of powers, the control over the purse remains with the legislative branch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is the explicit requirement then that
there be no expenditure of public funds except in pursuance of an appropriation
made by law.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>There is need, therefore, for an
enactment to <span style="">permit disbursements from
the public treasury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Nor
does fidelity to this constitutional mandate end there.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>There must be compliance with the terms of
the statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it were not so, to the
extent that there is a deviation, there is a frustration of the legislative
will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is </span>obvious that Congress
itself is not in a position to oversee and supervise the actual release of each
and every appropriation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is where
the Auditor General comes in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the
responsibility of his office to exact obedience to any law that allows the
expenditure of public funds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He serves as
the necessary check to make certain that no department of the government,
especially its main spending arm, the Executive, exceeds the statutory limits
of the appropriations to which it is entitled.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That is the purpose and end calling for the creation of such an office,
certainly not the enforcement of criminal statutes.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">So it has been made clear
by the then Delegate, later President, <span class="GramE">Manuel</span> <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> in the Constitutional Convention </span>of 1934.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the question as to the method or means to
determine whether public funds are spent in accordance with the congressional
will, this <span style="">was </span>his answer:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The only means provided in our
Constitution, as in the constitutions in other countries, is the office of the
auditor; therefore, if the auditor is a check on the Executive, it is not wise
to make the auditor depend on the Executive.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For another ways, the Executive, if he is able to influence the auditor,
may prevent the proper checking of the <span style="">expenditures
</span>of the public money."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
For such a dignitary to live up to such grave responsibility, he must,
according to Delegate <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Roxas</span></span><span style="">, </span>be
independent, not only of the President but even of Congress, even if he were in
a true and vital sense fulfilling a task appertaining to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"In the United States, while the auditor is appointed by the
President with the advice and consent of the United States Senate, the office
is kept as an independent office — independent [of] the Executive and
independent [of] the Legislature, because he has not only to check the accounts
of the Executive, but also the accounts of the Legislature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It could be that appellants were not completely oblivious to the
force of the above observations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
therefore did seek to lend plausibility to their contention with the reminder
that there is likewise included in the constitutional provision in question the
task incumbent on the Auditor General to "bring to the attention of the
proper administrative officer expenditures of funds or property which, in his
opinion, are irregular, unnecessary, excessive, or extravagant." From
which, by <span style="">a </span>process
of construction rather latitudinarian in character, they would imply that on
the Auditor General alone rests the determination of whether or not criminal
liability is incurred for any anomaly discovered in the course of his audit or
examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a conclusion is at war
with the controlling doctrine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
construed in Guevara v. <span class="SpellE">Gimenez</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
at most such <span style="">a
</span>duty goes no further then requiring him to call the attention of the
proper administrative officer of the existence of such a situation but does not
even extend to the power "to refuse and disapprove payment of such
expenditures, * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Much less then could it justify the assertion devoid of any legal justification
that even the ascertainment of any possible criminal liability is likewise a
part and parcel of such constitutional competence of the Auditor <span class="GramE">General.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>How, then,
can it be said that their plea is thereby strengthened?</p>

<p class="BODY">There is likewise an invocation by appellants of alleged
statutory support for their untenable view.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is likewise in vain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that
appellants have to go on is the concluding paragraph of section 657 of the
Revised Administrative Code:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Accounts once finally settled shall in no case be opened or
reviewed except <span style="">as </span>herein provided." The paragraph immediately preceding
should have disabused the minds of appellants of any cause for optimism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that it provides for is that in case any
settled account "appears to be infected with fraud, collusion or error of
calculation or when new and material evidence is discovered, the Auditor
General may, within three years after original settlement, open such account,
and after a reasonable time for his reply or appearance, may certify thereon a
new balance." The official given the opportunity for a reply or appearance
is the provincial auditor, for under the first paragraph of this particular
section, the Auditor General at any time before the expiration of three years
after the making of any settlement by a provincial auditor, may, of his own
motion, review and revise the same and certify a new balance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere does it appear that such a statutory
grant of authority of the Auditor General to open revised settled accounts
carries with it the power to determine who may be prosecuted in the event that
in the preparation thereof a crime has been committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conclusive effect of the finality of his
decision on the executive branch of the government thus relates solely to the
administrative aspect of the matter.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">From the constitutional, no less than the statutory standpoint
then, this claim of appellants finds no support.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has nothing but novelty to call for any
attention being paid to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
singularly unpersuasive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To repeat, it
would be to stretch to unwarranted limits the constitutional power thus
conferred on the Auditor General to accede to such a plea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing is better settled than that, broad
and comprehensive as it is, it does not include a participation in the
investigation of charges to determine whether or not a criminal prosecution
should be instituted.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, the first two errors of the appellants which would impugn the order of
dismissal for reaching a similar conclusion are disposed of.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. The third assigned error by appellants would find fault with
the lower court's reliance on the well-settled doctrine that as a general
principle, no action lies to enjoin fiscals from conducting investigations to
ascertain whether an offense has been committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To demonstrate its equally groundless
character, it suffices to refer to Ramos v. Torres,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
dismissing an original action for prohibition instituted by five of the six
petitioners, now appellants,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
to cut short further proceedings based on <span class="GramE">an information</span>
accusing them of <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> through falsification
of public and commercial documents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the opinion of the present Chief Justice, it is emphatically affirmed:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Upon a review of the record, we are
satisfied that petitioners herein have not established their right to the writ
prayed for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it is well-settled <span style="">that, </span>as a matter of general rule, the
writ of prohibition will not issue to restrain criminal prosecution."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
An excerpt from the opinion of Justice Sanchez in Hernandez v. <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Albano</span></st1:place><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">was </span>then quoted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Agreeably to the foregoing, a rule — now of long standing and
frequent application — <span style="">was </span>formulated
that ordinarily criminal prosecution may not be blocked by court prohibition or
injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Really, if at every turn
investigation of <span style="">a </span>crime will
be halted by a court order, the administration of criminal justice will meet
with an undue setback.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the
investigative power of the Fiscal may suffer such <span style="">a </span>tremendous shrinkage that it may end up in hollow sound rather
than as a part and parcel of the machinery of criminal justice."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Nor is the accused person thereby left unprotected for, as was noted by the
Chief Justice, referring to <span class="SpellE">Gorospe</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Peñaflorida</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
he could defend him­self from any possible prosecution by establishing that he
did not commit the act charged or that the statute or ordinance on which the
prosecution is based is invalid or in the event of conviction, he could
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the general rule admits of
exceptions, no showing has been made that petitioners can appropriately invoke
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As they failed in their previous
action of prohibition in Ramos v. Torres, so they must now.</p>

<span class="GramE"><i>Ibid</i>, p. 813.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The authoritative excerpt from the opinion of the present Chief Justice
reads as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Under our Constitution,
the authority of the Auditor General, in connection with expenditures of the
Government is limited to the auditing of expenditures of funds or property
pertaining to, or held in trust by, the Government or the provinces or
municipalities thereof (Article XI, section 2, of the Constitution).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such function is limited to a determination
of whether there is a law appropriating funds for a given purpose; whether a
contract, made by the proper officer, has been entered into in conformity with
said appropriation law; whether the goods or services covered by said contract
have been delivered or rendered in pursuance of the provisions thereof, as
attested to by the proper officer; and whether payment <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
has been authorized by the officials of the corresponding department or
bureau.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If these requirements have been
fulfilled, it is the ministerial duty of the Auditor General to approve and
pass in audit the voucher and treasury warrant for said payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has no discretion or authority to disapprove
said payment upon the ground that the aforementioned contract was unwise or
that the amount stipulated thereon is unreasonable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he entertains such belief, he may do no
more than discharge the duty imposed upon him by the Constitution (Article XI, section
2), 'to bring to the attention of the proper administrative officer
expenditures of funds or property which, in his opinion, are irregular,
unnecessary, excessive or extravagant'.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This duty implies <span style="">a </span>negation of the power to refuse and disapprove payment of such
expenditures, for its disapproval, if he had authority <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
would bring to the attention of the aforementioned administrative officer the
reasons for the adverse action thus taken by the General Auditing Office, and,
hence, render the imposition of said duty unnecessary."</p>

Section 655 of the Administrative Code reads <span style="">as </span>follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<u>Finality of decision made by Auditor</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- A decision of the Auditor General or of a
provincial auditor upon any matter within their respective powers shall be
conclusive upon the executive branches of the Government, subject to appeal or
review as hereinafter provided."</p>
