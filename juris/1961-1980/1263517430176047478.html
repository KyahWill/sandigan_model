				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">It may very well be, as noted by jurists of repute, that to stress
the element of a promise as the basis of contracts is to acknowledge the
influence of natural law.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Nonetheless, it does not admit of doubt that whether under the civil law or the
common law, the existence of a contract is unthinkable without one's word being
plighted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So the New Civil Code
provides:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"A contract is a meeting
of minds between two persons whereby one binds himself, with respect to the
other, to give something or to render some service."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
So it is likewise under American law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"A contract is a
promise or a set of promises for the breach of which the law gives a remedy, or
the performance of which the law in some way recognizes as a duty."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The law may go further and require that certain formalities be
executed. Thus, for a mortgage to be validly constituted, "it is
indispensable, * * *, that the document in which it appears be recorded in the
Registry of Property." The same <span class="SpellE">codal</span> provision
goes on:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"If the instrument is not
recorded, the mortgage is nevertheless binding between the parties."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The question before us in this appeal from a lower court
decision, one we have to pass upon for the first time, is the effect, if any,
to be given to a mortgage contract admittedly not registered, only the parties
being involved in the suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower
court was of the opinion that while it "created a personal, obligation
[it] did not establish a real estate mortgage."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
It did not decree foreclosure <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff-appellant appealed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We view the matter differently and reverse
the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case for the plaintiff, Mobil Oil Philippines, Inc., now
appellant, was summarized in the lower court order of <st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1966</st1:date>, subject of this appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"In its complaint plaintiff alleged that on Feb. 9, 1965 defendants
Ruth R. <span class="SpellE">Diocares</span> and Lope T. <span class="SpellE">Diocares</span>
entered into a contract of loan and real estate mort­gage wherein the plaintiff
extended to the said defendants a loan of P45,000.00; that said defendants also
agreed to buy from the plaintiff on cash basis their petroleum requirements in
an amount of not less than 50,000 liters per month; that the said defendants
will pay to the plaintiff 9-1/2% per annum on the diminishing balance of the
amount of their loan; that the defendants will repay the said loan in monthly
installments of P950.88 for a period of five (5) years from February 9, 1965;
that to secure the performance of the foregoing obligation they executed a
first mortgage on two parcels of land covered by Transfer Certificates of Title
Nos. T-27136 and T-27946, both issued by the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
agreement further provided that in case of failure of the defendants to pay any
of the installments due and pur­chase their petroleum requirements in the
minimum amount of 50,000 liters per month from the plaintiff, the latter has
the right to foreclose the mortgage or recover the payment of the entire
obligation or its remaining unpaid balance; that in case of foreclosure the
plaintiff shall be entitled to 12% of the indebtedness as damages and
attorney's fees. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>A copy of the loan and
real estate mortgage contract executed between the plaintiff and the defendants
is attached to the complaint and made a part thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The com­plaint further alleges that the
defendant paid only the amount of P1,901.76 to the plaintiff, thus leaving a
balance of P43,098.24, excluding interest, on their indebtedness. The said
defendants also failed to buy on cash basis the minimum amount of petroleum
which they agreed to purchase from the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff, therefore, prayed that the
defendants be ordered to pay the amount of P43,098.24, with interest at 9-1/2%
per annum from the date it fell due, and in default of such payment that the
mortgaged properties be sold and the proceeds applied to the payment of
defendants' obligation."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants, Ruth R. <span class="SpellE">Diocares</span> and Lope
T. <span class="SpellE">Diocares</span>, now <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>,
admitted their indebtedness as set forth above, denying merely the alleged
refusal to pay, the truth, according to them, being that they sought for an
extension of time to do so, inasmuch as they were not in a position to comply
with their obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They further set
forth that they did request plaintiff to furnish them with the statement of
accounts with the view of paying the same on installment basis, which request
was, however, turned down by the plaintiff.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then came a motion from the plaintiff for a judgment on the
pleadings, which motion was favorably acted on by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was stated in the order appealed
from:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The answer of the defendants
dated <st1:date year="1965" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1965</st1:date> did
not raise any issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary,
said answer admitted the material allegations of the complaint. The plaintiff
is entitled to a judgment on the pleadings."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As to why the foreclosure sought by plaintiff was denied, the
lower court order on appeal reads thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The Court cannot, how­ever, order the foreclosure of the mortgage
of properties, as prayed for, because there is no allegation in the complaint
nor does it appear from the copy of the loan and real estate mortgage contract
attached to the complaint that the mortgage had been registered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said loan agreement although binding
among the parties merely created a personal obligation but did not establish a
real estate mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The document
should have been registered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Art. 2125,
Civil Code of the Phil.)"<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion is thus limited to ordering
defendants "to pay the plaintiff the account of P43,098.24, with interest
at the rate of 9-1/2% per annum from the date of the filing of the complaint
until fully paid, plus the amount of P2,000.00 as attorneys' fees, and the
costs of the suit."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence this appeal, plaintiff-appellant assigning as errors the
holding of the lower court that no real estate mortgage was established and its
consequent refusal to order the foreclosure of the mortgaged properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As set forth at the outset, we find the
appeal meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court
should not have held that no real estate mortgage was established and should
have ordered its foreclosure.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court predicated its inability to order the fore­closure
in view of the categorical nature of the opening sentence of the governing
article<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
that it is indispensable, "in order that a mortgage may be validly
constituted, that the document in which it appears be recorded in the Registry
of Property." Not that it ignored the succeeding sentence:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"If the instrument is not recorded, the
mortgage is nevertheless binding between the parties." Its conclusion,
however, is that what was thus created was merely "a personal obligation
but did not establish a real estate mortgage."</p>

<p class="BODY">Such a conclusion does not commend itself for approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">codal</span> provision
is clear and explicit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if the
instrument were not recorded, "the mortgage is nevertheless binding
between the parties." The law cannot be any clearer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Effect must be given to it as written.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mortgage subsists; the parties are
bound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As between them, the mere fact
that there is as yet no compliance with the requirement that it be recorded
cannot be a bar to fore­closure.</p>

<p class="BODY">A contrary conclusion would manifest less than full respect to
what the <span class="SpellE">codal</span> provision ordains.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The liability of the mortgagor is therein
explicitly recognized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To hold, as the
lower court did, that no foreclosure would lie under the circumstances would be
to render the provision in question nugatory.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That we are not allowed to do.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What the law requires in <span class="SpellE">unambigous</span> language
must be lived up to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No interpretation
is needed, only its application, the un­disputed facts calling for it.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover to rule as the lower court did would be to show less
than fealty to the purpose that animated the legislators in giving expression
to their will that the failure of the instrument to be recorded does not result
in the mortgage being any the less "binding between the parties." In the
language of the Report of the Code Commission:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"In article [2125] an additional provision is made that if the
instrument of mortgage is not recorded, the mortgage, is nevertheless binding
between the parties." <a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
We are not free to adopt then an interpretation, even assuming that the <span class="SpellE">codal</span> provision lacks the forthrightness and clarity that
this particular norm does and therefore requires construction, that would
frustrate or nullify such legislative objective.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is the reason difficult to discern why such an exception
should be made to the rule that is indispensable for a mortgage to be validly
constituted that it be recorded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Equity
so demands, and justice is served.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
is thus full acknowledgment of the binding effect of a promise, which must be
lived up to otherwise the freedom a contracting party is supposed to possess
becomes meaningless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could be said of
course that to allow foreclosure in the absence of such a formality is to
offend against the demands of <span class="SpellE">jural</span> symmetry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is "indispensable" may be
dispensed with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an objection is far
from fatal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would not be the first
time when logic yields to what is fair and what is just. To such an
overmastering requirement, law is not immune.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the lower court order of February 25, 1966 is
affirmed with the modification that in default of the payment of the above
amount of P43,028.94 with interests at the rate of 9-1/2% per annum from the
date of the filing of the complaint, that the mortgage be foreclosed with the
properties subject thereof being sold and the proceeds of the sale applied to
the payment of the amounts due the plaintiff in accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With costs against defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.</p>
