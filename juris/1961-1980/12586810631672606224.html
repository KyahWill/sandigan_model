<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">These are four (4) different 
appeals from a decision and an order of the Public Service Commission, dated 
March 15, and </span><st1:date month="7" day="16" year="1965"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 16,

respectively.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Manila Electric Company - 
hereinafter referred to as the MERALCO - is a domestic corporation, operating 
electric light, heat and power system in the City of 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, and several cities and

10, 1955</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
it filed with the Public Service Commission - hereinafter referred to as the PSC 
- two (2) applications, namely, one for the reduction of rates for 
non-residential customers and commercial customers (PSC Case No. 85889), and 
another for the reduction of rates for residential customers (PSC Case No. 
85890). On </span><st1:date month="8" day="24" year="1955"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 24, 
1955</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
MERALCO filed a third application, this time for the reduction of general power 
rates (PSC Case No. 89893). The last application was provisionally approved on 
</span><st1:date month="8" day="31" year="1955"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 31, 
1955</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
whereas the first two (2) were granted on </span><st1:date month="9" day="24" year="1955"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 24, 
1955</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Prior thereto, or on June 9, 
1954, Dr. Pedro Gil had applied for the examination of the books of account of 
the MERALCO, which was eventually undertaken by the General Auditing Office - 
hereinafter referred to as the GAO - early in May, 1956. The GAO having 
submitted its report late in May, 1956, the three (3) cases were set for hearing 
on June 22 of the same year. On the date last mentioned the parties appeared 
before an officer of the PSC and an "informal hearing," for the alleged purpose 
of defining the issues, was held. Thereupon, Dr. Gil submitted the cases, 
relying upon the GAO report and his letter to the PSC, dated </span><st1:date month="6" day="7" year="1956"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Jun 7, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
suggesting an 8% return on the invested capital. On </span><st1:date month="7" day="31" year="1956"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 
31, 1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
the MERALCO objected to said report. Similarly, the Solicitor General submitted 
the cases upon the aforementioned GAO report and said letter of Dr. Gil and upon 
another letter-report of the GAO to the PSC, dated November 21, 1955. Other 
parties made common cause with Dr. Gil.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On December 27, 1957, the PSC 
rendered a decision directing the MERALCO to reduce its rates as 
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On appeal taken by the MERALCO, 
said decision of the PSC was, on June 30, 1964, set aside by the Supreme 
Court<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" style1=""><span class="style2style1style4"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[1]</span></sup></span><sup></sup></span> and the cases 
remanded to the lower court, for further proceedings and rendition of the 
corresponding judgment. Soon later, or on October 8, 1964, the PSC caused the 
three (3) cases to be set for hearing on November 16, 1964. Earlier, or on 
October 15, 1964, the MERALCO had, however, moved to withdraw its aforementioned 
petitions for revision of rates. After due hearing, this motion was granted on 
November 10, 1964.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">About two (2) weeks before, or on 
October 22, 1964, the MERALCO had, moreover, filed another petition<span style1=""><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1style4"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[2]</span></sup></span><sup></sup></span>seeking approval of a 
revised (increased) rate schedule, and of the "Terms and Conditions of Service" 
and the "Standard Rules and Regulations" appended to the application, for the 
purpose of providing a fair return on the present value of its property now 
devoted to public service and of attracting foreign capital with which to expand 
its facilities in order to meet the requirements of its present and future 
customers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Said petition was opposed by the 
Republic of the Philippines, the City of Manila, Ricardo Rosal and a number of 
other entities and Individuals. After due hearing, in the course of which 
testimonial and documentary evidence were introduced, the parties filed their 
respective memoranda. Subsequently, or on March 15, 1965, the PSC rendered its 
decision, the dispositive part of which reads: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"WHEREFORE, the Public Service 
Commission disapproves the proposed rate schedule submitted by the MERALCO dated 
October 22, 1964 and in lieu thereof, hereby authorizes and approves a modified 
rate increase as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">For Residential Service, instead 
of 32.5% (in crease as proposed) the Commission authorizes an increase of 23% 
which is hereby approved;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">For General Services, instead of 
30.99% (increase as proposed) the Commission authorizes an increase of 
24.99%;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">For General Power, instead of 
25.90% (increase as proposed) the Commission authorizes an increase of 
24.90%.<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The corresponding schedules for 
the rates authorized herein are hereto attached as Annexes ‘A', ‘A-1’ and 'A-2' 
and are made part of this decision. The above increase of rates is herein 
authorized and approved subject to the condition, that a substantial portion of 
the increased revenues resulting from the revision of rates allowed herein, 
shall be devoted exclusively to the acquisition of equipment to meet the demands 
of public service, to avoid a deterioration of the 
service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The Commission believes that the 
'Terms and Conditions of Service’ attached to MERALCO's application of October 
22, 1964 (Annex 'C’ and 'Standard Rules and Regulations' attached to said 
application (Annex 'D') should be the subject of a separate application and, 
therefore, no action is taken thereon in this decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The increases hereinabove 
APPROVED and AUTHORIZED shall be effective from the date of this decision, and 
Annexes A, A-1 and A-2 cancel and supersede all previously authorized rate 
schedules, including the wholesale power 
rate."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">What transpired immediately 
thereafter is set forth in our decision in Manila Electric Co. vs. PSC et al., 
L-24406 (June 29, 1965), from which we quote: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">“After promulgation and 
publication of the decision,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" style1=""><span class="style2style1style4"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[3]</span></sup></span><sup></sup></span> which expressly 
provided that the increases 'shall be effective from the date of this decision’, 
the Solicitor General filed, on March 18, 1965, a petition for reconsideration, 
and on March 19, 1965, moved ex parte to suspend the effectivity of the decision 
authorizing the rate increases. On the same day, and without notice to, or 
hearing of, the applicant, the Commission issued an order suspending the 
effectivity of the decision (Annex B, Petition). Applicant MERALCO (Petitioner 
herein) moved for a hearing to enable it to oppose the order of suspension, but 
no action was taken on its motion. In the meantime, other motions seeking 
reconsideration of the decision were filed, and petitioner MERALCO filed its 
opposition to the same on March 23. On the same date, respondent Medina issued 
an order requiring applicant to answer the motions for reconsideration within 20 
days and the movants 20 days to reply (Annex 'C'). By telegram of March 29, 
respondent Commissioner Enrique Medina, ordered that the motions for 
reconsideration be not calendared until his arrival, and that oppositors 'be 
notified and given legal period for the reconsideration and also to reply’ 
(Annex 'D'). On March 31, said Commissioner (Medina) issued an order expressing 
the desire that all motions for reconsideration and oppositions thereto 'be 
heard and argued simultaneously, to save time and effort’, and directed the 
Secretary of the Commission to call his attention as soon as the reglementary 
period to file motions for reconsideration expired, 'with the end in view of 
setting all motions for reconsideration and all oppositions thereto in one 
setting’ (Annex 'E’, Petition). In view thereof, MERALCO resorted to this Court, 
claiming the aforementioned orders to be invalid and without, or in excess of, 
jurisdiction and charging the respondents, particularly Medina, with a scheme to 
delay the hearing and resolution of the motions for 
reconsideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Respondent Commissioners and the 
Republic of the Philippines answered, alleging that the orders complained of 
were legal, valid and within the jurisdiction of the Commission; that the orders 
of Commissioner Medina alone, Annexes ‘C’ and 'E1’, were interlocutory and 
lawfully issued by him as presiding officer of the Commission. Such is also the 
City of Manila's answer."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On June 29, 1965, we rendered the 
aforementioned decision in L-24406, granting the writs therein prayed for, 
annulling the PSC order of March 19, 1965,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" style1=""><span class="style2style1style4"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[4]</span></sup></span><sup></sup></span> and directing the

its decision of March 15, 1965.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On July 16, 1965, two (2) orders 
were registered in the Office of the Secretary of the PSC. One, filed at about 
2:52 p.m., was signed by five (5) members of the PSC,<span style1=""><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1style4"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[5]</span></sup></span><sup></sup></span> the dispositive part

the Solicitor General and even that of Mayor Viliegas to be acceptable, it is 
our considered opinion that the average rate increase of 23.7% as contained in

reconsidered and reduced with respect to residential customers only, in the

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The other order, filed on July 
16, 1965, at about 4:01 p.m., although dated June 14, 1965, was signed by PSC 
Commissioner Medina and concurred in by Associate Commissioner Panganiban,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" style1=""><span class="style2style1style4"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[6]</span></sup></span><sup></sup></span> and favored the 
granting of the motions for reconsideration above mentioned. Appeals were taken 
from said order of July 16, 1965, and the aforementioned decision of March 15, 
1965, by the Meralco (G. R. No. L-24762), Ricardo Rosal (G. R. No. L-24841), the 
Republic of the Philippines (G. R. No. L-24854), and the City of 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> (G. R. No. 
L-24872).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The MERALCO, has, however, 
questioned the timeliness of the appeals taken by the Republic of the 
Philippines and the City of Manila-hereinafter referred to as the Republic and 
the City-upon the ground that said appeals had been interposed beyond the period 
of 15 days-after notice of the order denying the motions for 
reconsideration-prescribed in Section 36 of the Public Service Act (Commonwealth 
Act No. 146).<span style1=""><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1style4"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[7]</span></sup></span><sup></sup></span> 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The MERALCO has, also filed a 
motion for dismissal of the appeal of Ricardo Rosal, alleging that his motion 
for reconsideration of the decision of March 15, 1965, was filed on April 12, 
1965, or more than 15 days after March 25, 1965, when he received notice of said 
decision, in violation, allegedly, of Section 34 of Commonwealth Act No. 
146.<span style1=""><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1style4"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[8]</span></sup></span><sup></sup></span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It should be noted, however, that 
said 15 days expired on </span><st1:date month="4" day="9" year="1965"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 9, 
1965</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
which was a holiday, it being Bataan Day; that </span><st1:date month="4" day="10" year="1965"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 
10, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
was Saturday, on which day the offices of the PSC are closed; and that 
</span><st1:date month="4" day="11" year="1965"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 11, 
1965</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> was 
Sunday. In other words, the first working day immediately following the date of 
expiration of said period - which date happened to be a holiday - was 
</span><st1:date month="4" day="12" year="1965"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 12, 
1965</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
Accordingly, said motion for reconsideration of Rosal was filed within the 
reglementary period, and his appeal has been seasonably 
perfected.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Let us now take up the appeals of 
the Republic and the City. As above indicated, the MERALCO maintains that said 
appellants had only 15 days from notice of the order of the PSC dated July 16, 
1965, within which to perfect their appeal, pursuant to Section 36 of 
Commonwealth Act No. 146, which, the MERALCO maintains, is controlling. Upon the 
other hand, the Republic and the City allege that they had, for purposes of 
appeal, the period of 30 days prescribed in Rule 44, Section 1, of the Rules of 
Court,<span style1=""><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1style4"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[9]</span></sup></span><sup></sup></span> which should prevail 
over that prescribed in Section 36 of Commonwealth Act No. 146, said Rule being 
subsequent, in point of time, to this statute. Replying thereto, the MERALCO 
insists that Commonwealth Act No. 146 must prevail over the Rules of Court, not 
only because the former has, constitutionally, a higher status than the latter, 
but, also, because the former is a special legislation, enacted exclusively for 
the PSC.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The last part of MERALCO’s 
argument is, however, weakened by the fact that Rule 44, Section 1, of the Rules 
of Court, refers specifically to appeals "from a final award, order or decision 
of the Public Service Commission x x x," among others. At any rate, the 15-day 
period provided in the last part of the first sentence of Section 36 of 
Commonwealth Act No. 146, governs only when the motion for reconsideration has 
been denied. It has no application when the motion is granted, because, then, 
there results, in contemplation of law, a new decision, which may be reviewed on 
application filed with the Supreme Court within thirty (30) days from notice of 
said decision or of the order granting the motion for new trial, pursuant to 
both, the first part of the first sentence of said Section 36 of Commonwealth 
Act No. 146, and Rule 44, Section 1, of the Rules of 
Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the cases under consideration, 
the motions for reconsideration of the Republic and the City were, in effect, 
granted, although not to the full extent sought by the movants. In fact, the 
order of the majority of the PSC, dated July 16, 1965, explicitly declares that 
the average rate increase of 23.7% sanctioned in the decision of March 15, 1965, 
was thereby "rejected, reconsidered and reduced with respect to residential 
customers only," in the manner already adverted to. It is not disputed that the 
appeals of the Republic and the City have been taken within thirty (30) days 
from notice of said order of July 16, 1965. Consequently, MERALCO's objection to 
the timeliness of said appeals, as well as to that of Ricardo Rosal, should be, 
as it is hereby overruled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Referring now to the merits of 
the rate increases authorized in the appealed decision of March 15, 1965, as 
amended by the order of July 16, 1965, the issues raised may be summarized as 
follows, namely: (1) Are rate increases proper considering the circumstances 
obtaining in these cases? (2) What rate of earnings should be allowed? (3) What 
shall be the basis for the computation of said earnings? (4) Is the reduction of 
rates directed in the order of July 16, 1965, legally justifiable? 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On the first issue, the Republic, 
the City and Ricardo Rosal submit a negative answer, upon the ground that, from 
1956 to 1964, the MERALCO has consistently made net profits ranging from over 
P14,000,000.00 to over P28,000,000,00 a year, which, it is claimed, constitute a 
fair and reasonable return for the capital invested in said enterprise. The bulk 
of their arguments refers, however, to the manner or method of determining the 
amount of said capital and/or the value of the assets of the MERALCO. Indeed, 
the question whether or not the net profits in previous years constitute a fair 
return depends upon the amount of the investment made and/or the appraisal of 
the assets of the institution, which are the subject matter of the issues 
hereinafter to be taken up. For the time being, it will suffice to quote the 
following passage of the decision of March 15, 1965, which has not been sought 
to be refuted by any of the parties herein. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In approving as we hereby do, a 
slight in crease of rates in favor of Meralco, we desire to make it clear that 
except for minor blackouts, the service of Meralco has been and is considered by 
the PSC and by the public in general as adequate and satisfactory up to the 
present, but unless proper precautions are taken, few years from now the service 
may be different, the wear and tear, the rust, the passing of time, the increase 
of population and the ever growing needs of industry and commerce, are 
inevitable, and so the service of Meralco will deteriorate to the prejudice of 
the public service unless proper measures are taken to meet such situation. 
<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The Commission would like to avoid a 
repetition of the state of affairs of PLDT; the unpleasant deterioration of the 
PLDT's public service, its apparent failure to cope with the situation and to 
satisfy the demands of the public since 1959 or earlier, should not be repeated. 
The situation was so alarming, that in 1963, the PSC had no other alternative 
but to accede to and approve a 47% rate increase for commercial and 40% increase 
for residential telephones , over and above the rates already increased by 50% 
since 1950 (PSC Case No. 16533) for the purpose of enabling the PLDT to obtain a 
large foreign loan which it could not obtain locally in order to prosecute an 
urgently needed reconstruction and expansion program to Improve the service and 
to meet demands of the public. The same thing will happen to Meralco's service a 
few years from now, unless some bold step is taken to meet the demands of public 
service;</span></em> it is therefore our considered opinion that it is better to 
approve now a modest increase (23% for residential service and approximately 25% 
for General Services and General Powers) than to have to approve later on a 50% 
increase plus another 40% and 47% increase, as it happened with the PLDT, 
<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">with the added advantage that the 
satisfactory and adequate service rendered by Meralco today will not be 
interrupted. It is therefore the considered opinion of the undersigned that a 
modest increase may be approved, with the express condition that a substantial 
portion of the increased revenues resulting from the revision of rates 
authorized herein shall be devoted exclusively to the acquisition of equipment, 
accessories and supplies to meet the demands of public service in the future, to 
avoid a possible deterioration of the present adequate and satisfactory 
service".</span></em> (Underscoring ours.)<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In short, the exigencies of the 
present and the future-viewed in the light of recent developments and the 
experience gained in connection with the operation of another public utility 
analogously situated - imperatively require, not only that measures be taken to 
offset the effects of the wear and tear upon MERALCO's lines, equipment and 
other facilities (already strained by the needs of the unprecedented increase of 
population and the rapid expansion of trade, commerce and industry in the City 
of Manila and its environs, and the impact of modern electric appliances) and to 
avoid a deterioration of the adequate and satisfactory services it has 
heretofore rendered, but, also, that additional and improved equipment and 
facilities be acquired, installed and used to meet the ever growing demands for 
electricity in all fields of endeavor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">These measures, in turn, 
represent a financial outlay of such magnitude <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" style1=""><span class="style2style1style4"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[10]</span></sup></span><sup></sup></span> that - it seems 
conceded - the MERALCO is incapable of making with its present resources. 
Although it may raise the funds necessary therefor, either by increasing its 
capitalization or through loans, the first alternative is fraught with the 
danger - which is clear and present, owing to the scarcity and timidity of local 
capital - that foreigners may eventually, if not surely, control an industry so 
vital to our economy and national security. Hence, the only alternative left, 
consistently with the policy of nationalism and independence underlying our 
political and legal system, is to secure foreign loans.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is obvious, however, that 
foreign capitalists would not extend their credit facilities without a 
reasonable assurance that the borrower is financially able to comply with its 
obligations under the corresponding contract of loan. This simply means that the 
revenues of the borrower must be such as to justify the expectation that it 
could and would seasonably meet said obligations. Such revenues, in the case of 
the MERALCO, depend upon its rate schedules. Hence, the need of revising the 
same.<span style1=""><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1style4"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[11]</span></sup></span><sup></sup></span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This brings us to the main 
question in this case, namely: What is the fair rate of return or profit upon 
which the schedule of rates chargeable by the MERALCO should be based? The PSC 
has fixed it at 12% of the present value of the MERALCO assets devoted to public 
service. The Republic, the City and Ricardo Rosal assail this conclusion of the 
PSC on several counts. They maintain that: (1) 12% is too high a rate of 
earning, and should be lowered; (2) the basis for the computation should be 
other than the present value of said assets; and (3) the assessment of said 
present value is excessive, and should be reduced.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">With respect to the return 
allowable to the MERALCO it is urged that the rate authorized by the PSC is 
higher than that prevailing in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">United 
States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. It is well settled, however, 
that the rate of return permissible depends upon existing conditions.<span style1=""><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1style4"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[12]</span></sup></span><sup></sup></span> In the Philippines, 
our decisions have consistently adopted the 12% rate for public utilities and 
the PSC has done no more than adhere to the established jurisprudence thereon. 
Indeed, the GAO report concedes that 12% is the fair rate of return for the 
MERALCO. This is not the proper occasion to inquire into the wisdom of such 
jurisprudence, although it is a matter of common knowledge that the prevailing 
rates of interest on loans in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> are generally higher than those 
charged in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">United 
States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. The fact is that, in view of 
this circumstance,<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> nobody would lend the 
necessary funds to the MERALCO, if its returns were fixed at a lower rate. 
</span></em>The reason is obvious: capitalists would prefer to lend their 
resources to other public utilities, because the latter would, generally, be in 
a better position to pay a higher rate of interest and offer a greater assurance 
of stability and capacity to meet its obligations, all other things being 
equal.<span style1=""><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1style4"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[13]</span></sup></span><sup></sup></span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Then, also, the interest due to 
the lenders would have to be paid by the MERALCO out of its net earnings. As a 
consequence, the same would have to be somewhat higher than otherwise, in order 
that the borrower could reasonably warrant to the lender it's (borrower's) 
ability to pay the debt, and <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">still retain 
a margin of earnings sufficient to encourage or justify it's (borrower's) 
investment in the enterprise</span></em>. Otherwise, the stockholders of the 
public utility would prefer, either to withdraw their investment and shift the 
same to another more profitable venture, or to refrain, at least, for the time 
being, from embarking on a program of replacement of its old lines, 
installations, equipment and other facilities-, as well as of expansion and 
improvement of his services. In either case, the <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">public would suffer 
thereby.</span></em><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">For this reason, the decision 
appealed from, as amended, provides that the increase therein sanctioned is 
subject to <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"x x x <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">the express condition</span></em> that a 
substantial portion of the increased revenues resulting from the revision of 
rates authorized herein shall be devoted exclusively to the acquisition of 
equipment, accessories and supplies to meet the demands of public service in the 
future, to avoid a possible deterioration of the present adequate and 
satisfactory service."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">If the MERALCO were not 
constrained to borrow for the purpose of financing the undertakings it proposes 
and is required by the circumstances to pursue, the rate of return for its 
investment could, in all probability, be reduced. Indeed, before it had decided 
to initiate said undertakings, MERALCO had, not only never increased its rates - 
despite the fact that almost all other enterprises<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" style1=""><span class="style2style1style4"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[14]</span></sup></span><sup></sup></span> have raised their 
rates - but, also, volunteered to reduce the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It goes without saying that the 
rates of return are understandably lower in the United States where there is a 
comparative abundance of capital and it is, therefore, relatively easier to 
raise funds locally, either by increasing the capitalization - without the 
danger adverted to above - or through loans, under conditions less onerous than 
those usually obtaining in the Philippines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The next question for 
determination is the basis upon which the rate of earnings allowable to the 
MERALCO shall be computed, in order to fix the schedule of rates chargeable by 
said enterprise. MERALCO maintains that said schedule should be premised upon 
the present value of its assets as of the year 1963. The Republic and the City 
have, in effect, accepted this theory, in principle, although they do not agree 
with the method used in the assessment of MERALCO's assets. Upon the other hand, 
Ricardo Rosal urges that the rates should be founded upon the amount of the 
investment made by MERALCO's stockholders or the "historical cost" formula. The 
PSC has adopted the present or market value theory, as the basis for the 
computation of the earnings allowable to and the rate schedule chargeable by the 
MERALCO, as well as the method of valuation used and the appraisal made by the 
same, after making therefrom some deductions recommended by 
GAO.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">With respect to the "historical 
cost" formula urged by Rosal, it should be noted that the present or market 
value theory adopted by the PSC is in consonance with the practice consistently 
adhered to in this jurisdiction and upheld in an uninterrupted line of decisions 
of this Court.<span style1=""><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1style4"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[15]</span></sup></span><sup></sup></span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">And said decisions are borne out 
by the weight of authority in other jurisdictions. <span style1=""><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1style4"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[16]</span></sup></span><sup></sup></span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Rosal argues that the market 
value theory may be acceptable under normal conditions, but not when the same 
are abnormal - as, he claims, they are now in the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> - when the prices are high, 
because of the present rate of exchange of the American dollar in relation to 
our peso. Although, during the operation of our foreign exchange control law, 
the official rate of exchange was two pesos to a dollar, such was not, however, 
the true rate of exchange in actual practice. In fact, one of the most potent 
factors in favor of the removal of said control was the artificiality of the 
effects thereof. Then too, there is nothing to indicate that the prevailing rate 
of exchange will, in the foreseeable future, vary materially in our favor. 
Again, if and when there should be a substantial change for the better, insofar 
as we are concerned, the PSC could take such measures as may be meet and proper 
under the new conditions then existing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The revised schedule of rates of 
the MERALCO was determined by the PSC as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The main target of attack in this 
computation is its first item, namely the net value of MERALCO’s utility plants, 
which was fixed by the PSC at P415,427,353.00. The appraisal thereof by the 
MERALCO was P420,275,000.00 at the beginning of 1963 and P455,772,000.00, at the 
end of the year, or an average of P438,024,000.00 for the whole year. Upon the 
other hand, the Republic relies upon the GAO report fixing the value of said 
utility plants at P340,471,251.00. The difference between the MERALCO is 
appraisal and that made by GAO is due mainly to the method used by each in 
determining the present or market value of said plants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The MERALCO appraiser applied 
what is known as the "trending method." in its decision of </span><st1:date month="3" day="15" year="1965"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 15, 
1965</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
PSC described this method, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Meralco’s principal witness with 
respect to the present value of its property and equipment, other than land, was 
Mr. E. C. Edgar, Manager of the Economic Engineering Department of Gilbert 
Associates, Inc., a </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> engineering firm originally 
organized in 1906. Mr. Edgar testified that he had specialized in public utility 
valuation matters since his graduation from Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology in 1935; that he had been familiar with Meralco's properties since 
1946; that, in June, 1962, he had initiated the studies the result of which he 
presented at the hearing; and that he had determined the December 31, 1962 
present cost for Meralco’s power plants by employing the so-called ‘trending 
method”. Mr. Edgar described this method as follows: He had first segregated 
each type of such expenditures by kind of material, labor and the like, going 
into the manufacture of the particular property item; this segregation was 
audited by the firm of Sycip, Gorres, Velayo and Company so that there would be 
no question as to the segregation by virtue of such independent review, check 
and verification; he then developed and applied specific price increase factors 
for each of such groupings; and in this way, he repriced basic peso costs in 
accordance with the increase in cost of the various peso materials utilized and 
the appropriate peso labor employed and, similarly, he repriced dollar items in 
accordance with the increase in their costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"He emphasized that his valuation 
for Meralco’s power plant (and the other Meralco property which he valuated) was 
designed to express the value of all Meralcois property in service in terms of 
the 1963 purchasing power of the peso; that Meralco can only collect revenues 
from its customers in pesos of current purchasing power; that,by expressing its 
property in terms of pesos with 1963 purchasing power, a correct matching of 
Meralco’s revenues derived from the use of its facilities and the value of such 
facilities in terms of the same monetary unit is achieved; and that the property 
which he was evaluating was that actually in 
service."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Upon the other hand, the GAO 
fixed the value of MERALCO’s utility plants by ascertaining the cost of 
production per kilowatt and multiplying the same by the total capacity of said 
plants, less the corresponding depreciation. In the language of the decision 
appealed from:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The appraisal-method employed by 
the GAO for Meralco’s power plants does not seem to be satisfactory. It used as 
its base for determining the current cost of Meralco’s steam generating stations 
the cost per kilowatt to Meralco of installing its Rockwell Station Unit No. 8 
which was placed in service in 1963. This unit is a 66,000 KW Unit. The first 
five Rockwell units are 27,000 KW units and units Nos. 6 and 7, as well as No. 
8, are 66,000 KW units. The five Blaisdel’ units range in size from 4,000 KW to 
12,000 KW. The net effect of the GAO’s method is to substitute, for the current 
cost of the 13 steam generating units actually in service the cost per kilowatt 
which would result if Meralco’s thermal power plants consisted of 5.51 
generating units, each with a capacity of 66,000 KW and each installed in 1963. 
From this theoretical cost figure thus developed by the GAO, it then subtracted 
the depreciation reserve (restored on a present value basis) which had been 
accumulated with respect to the 13 units actually in 
existence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The cost of Rockwell Unit No. 8 
is not the <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">complete cost </span></em>of 
the unit because this was an <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">incremental 
addition to an existing station and did not take account of the cost of some of 
the facilities previously installed in the Station in connection with earlier 
units which are properly assignable in part to Unit No. 8. Meralco has 
demonstrated that the cost per kilowatt for Rockwell Unit No. 8,</span></em> 
should be increased by about 10% if it were to be used as the kind of standard 
suggested by the GAO Committee, and about P14,000,000.00 of the difference 
between the Meralco and GAO determination of present value of steam power plants 
would be eliminated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Meralco also questions the 
propriety of the deduction by the GAO of the depreciation reserve of 
approximately 20% from the value per kilowatt assigned by the GAO Committee on 
the basis of the cost of Rockwell Unit No. 8. It urges that there is virtually 
no depreciation applicable to that Unit and that it is inconsistent to use the 
cost of that Unit as a standard of value and then to deduct the accumulated 
depreciation applicable to the other 12 units. Meralco points out that if no 
such deduction is made, and if the 10% increase in cost per kilowatt of Rockwell 
Unit No. 8 referred to in the preceding paragraph is taken into account, then 
the GAO’s method would produce a total present value for Rockwell and Blaisdell 
station in excess of that claimed by Meralco. We believe that there is merit in 
Meralco’s position on this matter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"We have also noted Meralco’s 
argument that acceptance of the GAP <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Committee’s method would necessitate greatly 
increased depreciation allowance in the early lives of facilities and, in the 
case of rapidly growing utilities, would lead to higher consumer 
rates.</span></em><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Since, as noted above, the GAO’s 
method of determining the present value of Meralco’s power plants <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">is basically not acceptable because it involves 
substituting the value of theoretical facilities not in service for the value of 
actual facilities which are in service and because it accords insufficient 
recognition</span></em> to the underlying purpose of present value 
determinations, we find it unnecessary to discuss further the claimed defects in 
the application of the GAO's method.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The reasonableness of the 
valuation of Meralco’s steam power plants developed by Gilbert Associates, Inc., 
is attested by data released by the U. S. Federal Power Commission. Such data 
indicate that the recent cost per kilowatt in the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">United 
States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> for units of the 50,000 to 
75,000 KW size is $199 and for units of the 22,000 to 49,000 KW size is $228. 
Expression of such costs in pesos at a P3.91 per $1 conversion rate would result 
in current costs for such unit of P778 and P891, respectively. These are costs 
in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">United 
States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> where labor construction costs 
are higher than in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> but such elements as ocean 
freight, import duties, etc. are not present. The average current costs for 
Rockwell Units 1-5, inclusive, each of which is a 27,000 KW unit, as determined 
by Gilbert Associates, Inc. is P697 or well below the comparable P891 per KW 
figure derived from the Federal Power Commission data. The average current cost 
of Rockwell Units 6 and 7, each of which is a 66,000 KW unit, as determined by 
Gilbert Associates, Inc. is P563 per KW, or again well below the P778 per KW 
comparable figure derived from the Federal Power Commission data. The Federal 
Power Commission data do not include units as small as those in the Blaisdell 
Station, but the average current cost of P1,016 per KW for the units in this 
station, as determined by Gilbert Associates, Inc., appears to be in line, 
bearing in mind the fact that the cost per kilowatt in small units is 
substantially greater than in large ones.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"What has been said with respect 
to Meralco's steam generating stations is even more applicable to its Botocan 
hydro-electric station. Gilbert Associates, Inc. valued Botocan by trending the 
surviving peso and dollar components of the cost of Botocan into 1963 peso and 
dollar costs. The GAO, on the other hand, based its determination of the value 
of Botocan on the cost of the National Power Corporation's much larger Binga 
hydro-electric project. Yet the data presented by GAO with respect to Binga 
demonstrate that<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> the cost per kilowatt 
for one hydroelectric project will not accurately measure the cost of another 
hydro-electric project</span></em> - even one built by the same agency on the 
same river. <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Hydro project costs are 
greatly affected by site conditions, permissible water storage.available haad 
and the like. The cost of one hydro-electric does not measure the cost or value 
of another</span></em> - at least so long as both are economically advantageous 
in the electric systems of which they are a part.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"For the reasons stated, we are 
inclined to accept the valuation of Meralco’s power plants as determined by 
Gilbert Associates, Inc." (Underscoring 
ours.)<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We find no cogent reason to 
disturb either the facts upon which the foregoing conclusions of the PSC are 
premised or the conclusions drawn from said facts, both being, by and large, 
supported by the records.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is urged that the present 
value theory is now an obsolete doctrine, it having been rejected by the Supreme 
Court of the United States in Federal Power Commission vs. Hope Natural Gas Co. 
(320 U. S. 591, 88 L. ed. 333), in which the prudent investment or modified 
original cost theory was allegedly adopted. This assertion is inaccurate. In 
said case the Court did not reject the present or fair market value theory. It 
merely refused to interfere with the action taken by the Federal Power 
Commission in applying said prudent investment or modified original cost 
theory.<span style1=""><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1style4"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[17]</span></sup></span><sup></sup></span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As regards the working capital of 
the MERALCO, we note that the latter claimed therefor P17,884,000.00, which was 
reduced by the PSC to P10,739,132.00, after making some deductions recommended 
by the GAO. Similarly, the MERALCO had fixed its operating expenses at 
P81,020,337.00, which, in line with the opinion of the GAO, was reduced by the 
PSC to P80,558,039.00. Thus, MERALCO’s working capital and operating expenses 
were assessed by the PSC in accordance with the view taken by the 
GAO.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In other words, the revised rates 
authorized in the decision of </span><st1:date month="3" day="15" year="1965"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 15, 
1965</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
were substantially supported by the policy of authorizing the MERALCO to secure 
a net return of 12% on the present or market value, as of 1963, of its property 
actually devoted to public service. But, then, MERALCO alleges, the PSC had 
acted arbitrarily in establishing exceptions and directing a reduction in the 
rates for residential customers, as provided in the order of </span><st1:date month="7" day="16" year="1965"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 16, 
1965</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. The 
reasons given in said order were: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Hardest hit by the rate increase 
are the poor people who consume electric currents of from 1 to 100 kwh. Those 
who use from 1 to 14 kwh., under the decision sought to be reconsidered, pay an 
increase of 16% while those who consume from 14 kwh. to 20 kwh. pay an increase 
of 22%. The full 23% is charged for consumption starting from 30 kwh. and 
upwards, and up to 28% increase for a consumption of 90 
kwh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"According to data available, of 
the 348,943 total residential customers of the Meralco, one-half are those who 
consume from 1 to 100 kwh. The consumers of from 100 kwh to 300 kwh. may safely 
be classified as well-to-do customers since their capacity already involves the 
use of electrical appliances, like TV sets, radios, electric ranges, air 
conditioners, electric fans, electric irons, etc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"It is on behalf of the poor 
people that the Solicitor General and Mayor Villegas are loyally battling for.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Of course, in a democracy the 
instrumentality of the State favors not only one segment of society, like 
favoring only the poor, or favoring only the rich; it must favor the public good 
or well-being, the reason for its existence. And so it is that in determining a 
reasonable compensation for the services of a public utility, it should be just 
to the public and just to the Company; but the more enlightened reason is that 
if it cannot be just to both .... it must in any event be just to the 
public."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The order appealed from does not 
give any specific figures that would permit us to estimate the amount of the 
reduction that would thus be effected in the revenues and returns of the 
MERALCO, as determined in the original decision, dated </span><st1:date month="3" day="15" year="1965"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 15, 
1965</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
Neither has the MERALCO supplied the figures necessary to show that the 
modifications provided in the order of July 16, 1965, are materially 
inconsistent with the basic principles or premises established and adopted in 
said decision and confirmed in the order appealed from. And, since the findings 
of and determinations by administrative organs, in matters which are within 
their peculiar competence, should be respected by courts of justice, unless 
clearly devoid of factual or legal foundation, and no such flaw has been shown 
in the cases at bar, we deem it improper, at this time, to review the 
modifications thus effected by said order. At any rate, it should always be 
understood that if, after having been in operation long enough to reasonably 
ascertain the effects of the contested modifications, the same should prove to 
be unjust and unfair, the PSC may, after due notice and hearing, grant such 
relief as may be proper to remove the resulting evils, if any, and promote 
public interest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The City maintains, also, that 
the appealed decision and the appealed order are null and void for lack of 
jurisdiction of the PSC to entertain MERALCO's application for revision 
(increase) of its rate schedules: (1) because said application includes 
territories which are beyond the City, for which MERALCO has, allegedly, no 
legislative franchise; and (2) because, although possessing a legislative 
franchise for the City, MERALCO has no certificate of public convenience to 
operate therein, as required by the Public Service Law.<span style1=""><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1style4"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[18]</span></sup></span><sup></sup></span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We find no merit in this 
pretense. To begin with, the alleged lack of legislative franchise of the 
MERALCO to operate in areas outside the City, but adjoining the same, as well as 
the absence of a certificate of public convenience to operate in the City 
proper, might affect, not the jurisdiction of the PSC, but MERALCO's cause of 
action, or its right to seek a revision of rates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Secondly, pursuant to Act No. 484 
of the Philippine Commission, approved and effective on October 20, 1902, and 
Republic Act No. 150, approved on June 14, 1947, the MERALCO may operate an 
electric system in the "City of Manila and its suburbs ." It is true that in PSC 
Case No. 23044, the PSC held, in an order dated April 4, 1963, that the term 
"suburbs", in said laws, does not include territory outside the perimeter of the 
City, although adjoining the same. However, said order has, in effect, 
authorized the continuance of MERALCO's operation within the disputed area for 
one year from the date thereof, by giving the MERALCO said period of time within 
which to secure the corresponding legislative franchise and certificate of 
public convenience. Besides, the order was set aside by this Supreme Court in G. 
R. No. L-21435.<span style1=""><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1style4"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[19]</span></sup></span><sup></sup></span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In fact, even prior thereto, or 
on June 20, 1964, Congress had passed Republic Act No. 4159, extending, for 30 
years, the time within which the MERALCO may operate "throughout the City of 
Manila and its suburbs", and, according to the Explanatory Note of the Bill<span style1=""><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1style4"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[20]</span></sup></span><sup></sup></span> which, upon 
approval, became Republic Act No. 4159, its purpose is to extend, for said 
period, MERALCO's authority to operate "throughout the City of Manila and the 
Cities and Municipalities now being serviced by it" (underscoring 
ours).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Thirdly, in A. L. Ammen 
Transportation Co. vs. Golingco (43 Phil. 286), we held that a certificate of 
public convenience issued by the PSC is a prerequisite to the operation of a 
public utility in the Philippines, unless the same was in operation when our 
first law on public utilities (Act No. 2307) went into effect.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" style1=""><span class="style2style1style4"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[21]</span></sup></span><sup></sup></span>The MERALCO was then 
in operation, its franchise having been granted by said Act No. 484 of the 
Philippine Commission,<span style1=""><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1style4"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[22]</span></sup></span><sup></sup></span>and carried into 
effect by Ordinance No. 44 of the City in 1903.<span style1=""><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1style4"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[23]</span></sup></span><sup></sup></span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The MERALCO has moved for the 
dismissal of the appeal of the Republic upon the ground that its brief had been 
filed after the expiration of the reglementary period therefor. Upon submission 
of the Republic's opposition to said motion and of MERALCO’s reply thereto, we 
resolved to defer action thereon until after the case is considered on the 
merits. Considering the circumstances surrounding the delay in the filing of 
said brief, and the fact that the issues therein raised are, likewise, taken up 
in the briefs of the City and Ricardo Rosal, as well as the public interest 
involved in these cases, we deem it best, in the exercise of our discretion, to 
deny the aforementioned motion of the MERALCO.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"IX. Applicant's forecast of the 
electric power requirements of its service area discloses that such requirements 
may reasonably be expected to treble in the next 10 years. This will require the 
addition to the system of approximately 1,100,000 KW of additional generating 
capacity and related additions to applicant's transmission, subtransmission and 
distribution facilities. Almost all of such equipment must be purchased from 
foreign sources. In addition, during this period it will be necessary to replace 
part of applicant's existing facilities as such facilities complete their 
service lives. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"X. In order to meet this mammoth 
construction program for the next decade, applicant will require additional 
capital on the order of P840,000,000. The bulk of such capital must come from 
foreign sources, not only because capital of this magnitude is not available in 
the Philippines but also because, even if it were available, absorption by 
applicant of a substantial part of this amount of capital in the Philippines 
would greatly restrict the availability of capital for other industries and 
businesses. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"XI. Applicant and its 
predecessors have successfully met the electric power needs of the 
</span><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Manila</span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> area for approximately 60 years. 
With this record of satisfactory performance, applicant has demonstrated in the 
past three years that it possesses the standing and reputation with foreign 
sources of capital that should enable it to obtain the capital which it will 
require provided it is permitted to earn at a rate which will maintain its 
financial integrity and cover the interest and dividend requirements of its 
securities. Such demonstrations included: (a) Applicant's borrowing in 1962-63 
of dollars $9,400,000 on a Serial Bank loan from a group of 9 U.S. Banks; (b) 
applicant's obtaining in 1963 of $13,400,000 of credit to finance Tegen Station 
unit No. 1; and (c) applicant's issuance and sale in 1964 of $8,000,000 of 
20-year bonds to a group of U.S. insurance companies and other U. S. 
institutional investors. All of these required the most strenuous efforts over 
several months and even then could be achieved only because applicant had a 
relatively low debt ratio (about 35%) prior to the first of these transactions 
and, therefore, had room in its capital structure to take on the debt 
obligations by which such funds were obtained. These transactions have resulted 
in increasing applicant's debt ratio to 48% as of </span><st1:date month="10" day="1" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 
1, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
with the consequence that applicant must have substantial additional earnings to 
maintain the coverage of its fixed charges (primarily interest) to maintain the 
status of applicant's debt obligations as institutional grade securities. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"XII The primary sources of 
external foreign capital from which applicant can expect to obtain funds to 
finance its construction program are insurance companies, pension funds, and 
other institutional investors of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">U. 
S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and other parts of the free 
world. Such investors generally are not willing to purchase the debt securities 
of an electric public utility unless the utility's operating income available 
for interest in recent periods is several times the combined interest 
requirements of the utilities outstanding debt obligations and those obligations 
which are to be issued. The increased rates here proposed will enable applicant 
to meet such a standard."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

are taken into consideration in determining the reasonableness of the return. 
Having fixed the rate based and found the cost of operation, the next question 
is related to the percentage of rate of return. Whether a particular percentage, 
or rate is reasonable depends upon numerous considerations, the most frequently 
mentioned being the risks to which the principal and income from it are 
subjected, whether these risks be moral or physical or otherwise, the uniformity 
and certainty of the return, the character of the business, the locality in 
which it is placed, the density of population, whether competition exists, the 
returns secured in the locality from other investments of a similar nature, 
whether the return is gross or net, for example, whether it is clear of taxes or 
other expenses, the necessity of obtaining money to provide good service, the 
size and comparative financial strength of the company, the ability of the 
company to borrow money, the demand for money, the prevailing rate of interest 
in the community in which the enterprise is located, the desirability of 
attracting capital, the necessity of providing surplus for contingencies, the 
competency of the management, the advisability of rewarding superior management, 
the character of service rendered, the previous financial history of the 
company, whether it has been poor or prosperous, and the market value of money. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"It is said that the question of 
the reasonableness of the return cannot be determined without reference to the 
interest of the public; that the value of the service and the financial 
condition of locality served must be taken into account. It is held that no one 
element is sufficient in itself, but that all enter as governing factors in the 
problem; that there is no inflexible rule as to the rate of return to be 
allowed, each case depending upon its own circumstances, x x x" (Guiding

whether the one theory or the other is more reasonable. The great weight of 
authority is certainly in favor of the standard of present value as the basis of 
determining rates." (Guiding Principles of Public Service Regulation, by Henry

favor of the formula applied by the Commission and against the present value 
theory, but because the Commission was not bound to use any single formula or 
combination of formulas; because it is the result reached not the method 
employed that is controlling; because "if the total effect of the rate order 
cannot be said to be unjust and unreasonable, judicial inquiry under the Act is 
at an end"; because the order of the Commission fixing rates "is the product of 
expert judgment which carries a presumption of validity"; because the 
rate-making process involves a balancing of the investor and the consumer 
interests; because the standard of the return to the equity owner should be 
commensurate with returns on investments in other enterprises having 
corresponding risks; because such returns should, moreover, be sufficient to 
assure confidence in the financial integrity of the enterprise so as to maintain 
its credit and to attract capital; and because it is not important to determine 
the various permissible ways in which any rate base on which the return is 
computed may be arrived at, if the Court is of the view that the end result in 
the case cannot be condemned, under the Act as unjust and unreasonable.
