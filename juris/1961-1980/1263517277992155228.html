				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a suit<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[2]</sup></font>
to annul a <span class="SpellE">notarial</span> deed of donation <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>vivos</u></span>, covering ten (10) parcels of land in <span class="SpellE">Sibalom</span>, Antique, executed by plaintiff's sister, Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>, in favor of defendant Consuelo G. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span>, which deed plaintiff himself, a minister of the
Philippine Independent Church, signed as a witness and which his nephew <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> also signed as
a witness at plaintiff's instance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff's claim is that the execution thereof is tainted with fraudulent
misrep­resentation - that the document is merely one for the administration of
properties, not a donation. The lower court, in its decision of <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1963</st1:date> penned by His Honor,
Judge <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> O. <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span>,
dis­missed the complaint, <span class="GramE">declared</span> the deed of
donation legal and valid and Consuelo G. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> owner
of the donated ten (10) parcels of land, with costs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this appeal direct to this Court.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[3]</sup></font></p>

<p class="BODY">Following are the events leading to the donation:</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant Consuelo G. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> was close
to Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> even when she was still a child.
Because <span class="SpellE">Baltazara</span> <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>,
elder sister of Carmen, was the wife of Consuelo's uncle, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gella</span>, and was her godmother.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Everytime</span> she went
to <span class="SpellE">Sibalom</span> to visit and stay with her uncle and aunt,
she met Carmen who was then staying with <span class="SpellE">Baltazara</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She fondly called Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tia</span> Carmen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By
1925, Carmen and Consuelo's relationship was closer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For in that year, the <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span>
transferred their residence to <span class="SpellE">Sibalom</span> where
defendant, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span>,
Consuelo's husband, became the President of the Sanitary Division.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> in time
became the family physician of the Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gellas</span> and
also of Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During the last war, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span>,
who was a guerilla assigned in <span class="SpellE">Kalibo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span>, on a number of occasions had to travel by foot from <span class="SpellE">Kalibo</span> just to be able to administer treatment to <span class="SpellE">Baltazara</span> who was then suffering from cancer of the tongue.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in 1952, Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> went
with Consuelo G. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
to follow up Carmen's claim for <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> and pension
with the US Veterans Administration in connection with the services of Carmen's
son, <span class="SpellE">Jeremias</span>, a member of the USAFFE who died during
the last war.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Atty. Jose <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span>, son of the <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span>, then
working with the US Veterans Administration, helped Carmen accom­plish the
required papers, for said claim and submitted the same to the USVA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1953, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span>
had to go to <st1:place>Mindanao</st1:place>, to contact one officer and one
enlisted man who certified to <span class="SpellE">Jeremias</span>' record of
service, thus completing the paper work in support of the claim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This resulted in USVA giving Carmen a lump
sum payment for the <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> of her son, <span class="SpellE">Jeremias</span>, and a monthly pension of P65, later increased to
P75.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that on <st1:date year="1955" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1955</st1:date>, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span>
went to <span class="SpellE">Sibalom</span> on an urgent call because Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> had suffered a stroke.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She became partly paralyzed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From then on, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span>
attended to her.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first week of December 1955, plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> came over to the house of the <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span> at <st1:city><st1:place>San Jose</st1:place></st1:city>,
told them of Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde's</span> desire to see
them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The couple went to Carmen's
house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Carmen informed them that the
reason for the call was that she wanted to donate her properties to Consuelo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Reason for the donation was the fear
entertained by Carmen that her brother, <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>, a
gambler, would only waste her properties if she predeceased him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Carmen then wanted an assurance that from the
produce of the lands, the <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span> would support her
and her brother, <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>, construct a house for
them, and repair, put in good condition, and maintain Carmen's family
mausoleum.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span>
accepted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All of these were taken up in
the presence of plaintiff.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the afternoon of that same day, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span>
went to see Atty. <span class="SpellE">Esdras</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Tayco</span>,
grandson of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gella</span>, and the person agreed upon
between Carmen and Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> to prepare the deed of
donation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The draft was prepared by
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Tayco</span> with the use of data taken from the tax
declarations and certificates of title obtained by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span>
from the Provincial Assessor and the Register of Deeds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> went
back to Carmen with the draft.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He read
the draft to her, explained the contents thereof in the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span>
dialect. Carmen's reaction was: "It is all right, make it clear to avoid
trouble." Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> returned the draft to Atty.
<span class="SpellE">Tayco</span> for the latter to put the deed in final shape.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1955" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1955</st1:date>,
Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> went back to Carmen <span class="SpellE">Ytur­ralde</span>
at <span class="SpellE">Sibalom</span> with the deed of donation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff and his nephew, <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>, were there.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> read the
document in the presence of plaintiff, translated and explained the contents
thereof to Carmen in the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> dialect. Having
expressed her conformity, Carmen was asked by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span>
to affix her <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> on the docu­ment. Plaintiff
looked for something hard on which to place the papers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> helped
Carmen imprint her <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span>. Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span>
then gave the document to plaintiff for the latter to sign as witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff scanned the pages thereof, signed,
and in turn asked his nephew, <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span>, to do
likewise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1955" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1955</st1:date>, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span>
brought Atty. <span class="SpellE">Tayco</span> to the house of Carmen to have
the deed of donation ratified by the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Tayco</span> read and trans­lated the deed and
explained the contents to her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Carmen
told Atty. <span class="SpellE">Tayco</span> that she was agreeable to what was
stated in the document.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1955" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1955</st1:date>,
plaintiff went to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> at Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin's</span> expense, stayed in the home of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span class="SpellE">Crespo</span>, daughter of the <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Shortly
after plaintiff left, the <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span> had to take Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Antique</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Provincial</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in <st1:city><st1:place>San Jose</st1:place></st1:city> so she could be well
attended.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Carmen stayed there for about
a week.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After which, at her suggestion,
she was taken to the house of the <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Returning from <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
in May 1956, plaintiff stayed with his sister and the <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span>
in the latter's home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After one year,
plaintiff transferred to <span class="SpellE">Sibalom</span> in the house
constructed for him and his sister by the <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span>,
who provided him with a servant, gave him rice, money for his food and pocket
money.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span>
attended to his needs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Carmen, however,
continued to live with the <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span> until her death on

herein referred above, in full possession of all my mental faculties, hereby
give, transfer and convey, by way of DONATION unto the said Consuelo G. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span>, her heirs, successors, and assigns, the

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">At the bottom of the foregoing four-page

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span> took steps to have the deed
registered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They learned that the <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place>
titles were with the spouses Mariano <span class="SpellE">Vagilidad</span> and
Luz <span class="SpellE">Managuit</span> upon loans from them obtained by
plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The spouses <span class="SpellE">Vagilidad</span>
refused to part with the titles upon the averment that the obligation really
was Carmen's, not <span class="SpellE">Cipriano's</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This led the <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span>
to take two court actions:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>First</u>
a petition in the cadastral proceedings to procure delivery of the titles to
them; and <u>Second</u>, upon learning that there was an alleged document of
mortgage executed by Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> in favor of the
<span class="SpellE">Vagilidads</span> dated February 14, 1956, a civil suit in
the Antique court of first instance, with the <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span>
and Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> as plaintiffs against the <span class="SpellE">Vagilidads</span> to annul that mortgage which covers some of the
donated properties.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The annulment of mortgage suit resulted in the lower court's judgment in favor
of the <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That case was brought before us on appeal.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="NUM">1. We first go into the theory advanced by plaintiff in his effort
to procure a reversal of the judgment below, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>,
brother of the deceased Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>, was the
latter's nearest of kin.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1955" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1955</st1:date>, Carmen suffered
from cerebral hemorrhage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She became a
paralytic, and, according to plaintiff, she "could not speak nor
stand".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A certain Dr. <span class="SpellE">Salumbides</span> attended her. Sometime in November 1955,
defendant spouses, the <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span>, visited Carmen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the course of the conver­sation, the
spouses told Carmen that because she was sick and her brother was already old,
they (the spouses <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span>) could administer Carmen's
properties. On <st1:date year="1955" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1955</st1:date>,
Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> again came to Carmen's house with papers
in his hand, and without waste of time, "talked to the patient who was not
answering", grabbed the thumb of the patient and had it marked on the
papers.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
According to plain­tiff, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> then asked him to
sign the document as witness, told him that the same was, "for the
administration" of Carmen's properties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff signed the document and, in his own words, "I [plaintiff]
requested this <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> [referring to his nephew, <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>] to sign and
he signed also the document."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> in turn claimed that at the time he signed he did
not know of the contents of the document, and that an inquiry from his uncle
then elicited the following answer: "It was supposed to be the ad­ministration
of the properties of Carmen."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff admits that upon his return in May 1956, he and, his
sister Carmen lived in the, house of the <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span>;
that he trans­ferred to <span class="SpellE">Sibalom</span> in the house
constructed for him and his sister by the spouses <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span>;
that Carmen continued to live with the <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span> until
her death; that the <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span> supported Carmen and
plaintiff until Carmen's death on January 23, 1960; and that the <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span> also defrayed the burial expenses of Carmen.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was on January 26, 1960, after Carmen's burial, that plaintiff
allegedly asked Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> to settle the accounts of
the deceased Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> and to turn over to him
her properties so that he could settle Carmen's obligations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> answered
plaintiff by saying that it was not necessary because he, the plaintiff,
"was the adopted son of the deceased", to which he remonstrated that
"he was the real brother of the deceased."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Thereafter, plaintiff approached a certain Atty. Tan to find out what the
contents of the document were which Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> asked
him and his sister to sign.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was only
then that he discovered for the first time that the document was not a contract
for the administration of Carmen's properties but a deed of donation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Will this version resist an impartial appraisal?</p>

<p class="NUM">2. On the question of whether or not at the time the document was
executed the deceased Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> knew what she
was doing and had the power of speech, evidence there is that clearly supports
the affirmative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At that time, Carmen
was suffering from <span class="SpellE">hemilegia</span>, paralysis of the right
half of her body.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was bedridden, it
is true, but otherwise feeling all right.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She could talk coherently, audibly, and properly, could answer questions
sensibly, could express her ideas clearly.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But if the foregoing from the testimony of the spouses <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> were not sufficient, there is the evidence coming
from Atty. <span class="SpellE">Esdras</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Tayco</span>,
the scrivener of the deed of donation, who, unable to accompany Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> on December 10, 1955, left blank spaces in the
acknowledgment thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So Atty. <span class="SpellE">Tayco</span> tes­tified. And then, we find the following from his
testimony:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
you saw Carmen on December 15 in her house what did you do in connection with
this deed of donation?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
asked her if she is agreeable with what I wrote in the deed and she is
agreeable in signing the deed of donation and she told me that she is agree­able
to the deed she executed on December 10, 1955.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did
you read, explain and translate to her in the local dialect the contents and
the terms of the said deed?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
explained to her the contents of the document in the local dialect.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
other words she was made to understand the contents of the document?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir, I see to it that she understood the con­tents of that deed of
donation."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Implicit in this testimony is that, <span class="SpellE">really<span class="GramE">,Carmen</span></span> <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span> was
possessed of the power of speech and her mental faculties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That the testimony of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Tayco</span> rings with sincerity may be gleaned from the
following admission on page 17 of appellant's brief: "Se <span class="SpellE">admite</span> <span class="SpellE">que</span> no <span class="SpellE">hubo</span>
<span class="SpellE">inteligencia</span> <span class="SpellE">colusiva</span> <span class="SpellE">entre</span> <span class="SpellE">los</span> <span class="SpellE">apelados</span>
y el <span class="SpellE">abogado</span> <span class="SpellE">Esdras</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Tayco</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">Added weight to the foregoing is the following testimony of
instrumental witness <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>,
plaintiff's witness and nephew of plaintiff, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
were conversing with each other, is it not?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
a matter of fact Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> was also talking to
Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>, is it not?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, sir.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How
about <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>,
did he also have occasion to talk to his sister while you were there?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
do not know.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No,
while you were there, was there any occasion where <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
talked to her sister Carmen?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir, <u>they</u> <u>were</u> <u>telling</u> <u>stories</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They
were talking to each other, Carmen and <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Cipriano</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> is it not? Just answer the question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir, <u>they</u> <u>were</u> <u>talking to</u> <u>each</u> <u>other</u>."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But plaintiff would want to impress upon this Court that the
foregoing is not a faithful translation from the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span>
dialect used by <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>
while testifying.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What flaws this
argument is that the words in <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> imputed to this
witness and set forth on page 16 of his brief nowhere appear in the transcript
of steno­graphic notes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They must be
discarded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>More than this, plaintiff is
bound by the transcription of <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yturralde's</span> testimony just reproduced. Plaintiff did not
move to amend the same below.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His
failure to do so stops him from raising this question on appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Very recently, we held that where the
integrity of the stenographic record is intact, and no one takes any step to
correct the alleged error in the transcript before the records are elevated to
the appellate court, "the presumption that the stenographer regularly
performed her duty stands."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3. Plaintiff's cry of fraud is that the document signed was one
for administration, not a donation.</p>

<p class="BODY">A rule of long standing which, through the years, has been
adhered to is that a <span class="SpellE">notarial</span> document is evidence of
the facts in clear, unequivocal manner therein expressed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has in its favor the presumption of
regularity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To contradict all these, as
plaintiff now seeks to do, there must be evidence that is "clear,
convincing and more than merely preponderant."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Our task now is to weigh the evidence with a view a ascertaining whether
plaintiff has made out a case conformably to the foregoing standard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is undisputed that plaintiff has been a
priest of the Philippine Independent Church for a long time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He talks and writes Spanish very well.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He knows how to read English.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The judge below, who signed the decision and
who had the opportunity to observe plaintiff on the witness chair, gave the
opinion that although plaintiff was already old and a little bit deaf, he was
"fairly intelligent to say the least, and definitely x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> not feeble-minded." This is the man who claims
to have been misled by defendant Dr. <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition to the foregoing, other circumstances there <span class="GramE">are</span> which betray plaintiff's testimony as thoroughly
unbelievable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the intention of the <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span> were to palm off donation for mere administration,
they would not have chosen such a time when not only plaintiff but the latter's
nephew, a person also of mature age, were present.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They would not have then exhibited the
document, allowed the execution thereof. The ways of fraud are such that it is
unlikely that the <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span> would risk the success of
their alleged nefarious scheme in the presence of those who, by the nature of
things, are bound to protect the interests of a close relation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Also, there is plaintiff's own testimony on rebuttal that he knew
all along that "Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> is interested in the
wealth of Carmen."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
The way plaintiff described the highly suspicious attitude of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> is quite interesting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Says plaintiff on direct examination:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
<st1:date year="1955" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1955</st1:date>, what
happened if any in that house of Carmen?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
<span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> and I, with papers in his hands, with­out
waste of time, he talked to the patient who was not answering.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
else?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> did was to grab the thumb of the patient
and then had <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> on the paper."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">And then, on cross-examination, he
testified:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
your direct testimony you also said that when Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span>
arrived in the house of the deceased on that day he talked to the patient, is
that correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Without
waste of time Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> talked.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To the patient?</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir, he was talking to the patient and I was hearing also.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
did Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> talk about?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
grabbed the thumb of the patient and then imprint it in a piece of paper."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">If plaintiff really believed that Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span>
acted in a manner which would evoke suspicion, coupled with his own alleged
knowledge that said Dr. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span> was interested in the
wealth of his sister, then it stands to reason to say that he must have been on
guard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His normal reaction would have
been to stave off execution of the deed of donation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But according to him, he did not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, defendants’ evidence is
that said document was handed over to plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even if we concede that he knows no English,
the very title of the document must have arrested his attention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The English word "DONATION" was there.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That is the equivalent of the Spanish word
"DONACION", which, of course, he understands.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact indeed that plaintiff's present suit was started at a
time when the donor, Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>, was already
dead strikes a note of implausibility on plaintiff's claim pressed upon the
Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Because, during
the lifetime of Carmen, she joined defendants in the suit against the <span class="SpellE">Vagilidads</span> filed on </span><st1:date year="1956" day="29" month="12"><span class="GramE">December 29, 1956</span></st1:date><span class="GramE"> for the purpose of annulling the mortgage in favor of the latter
in order to give effect to the very donation now being questioned by plaintiff.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If Carmen <span class="SpellE">Yturralde</span>,
at the time that suit against the <span class="SpellE">Vagilidads</span> was
started on December 29, 1956 to the date of her death on January 23, 1960, ever
entertained the belief that she was duped into signing the deed of donation,
certainly during that span of over three years, she could have complained and
asked that her name be stricken out from that suit, and she herself could have
commenced an action for the annulment of the donation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That she did not do so is a circum­stance
clear enough that the very party interested really intended a donation to take
place.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff himself on rebuttal admitted that he knew of this
litigation between the <span class="SpellE">Azurins</span> and the <span class="SpellE">Vagilidads</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And yet,
he did nothing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He waited until Carmen
could no longer be able to sustain the donation and give the lie to his present
complaint. While plain­tiff's theory is that he learned of the donation only
after the death of his sister in 1960, yet, as rightly observed by the trial
court, "he committed the '<span class="SpellE">lapsus-linguae</span>' of
stating that he secured the docu­ment [of donation] from Atty. <span class="SpellE">Tayco</span> before he left for Manila" in 1955 - long before
the death of Carmen. Surely, these circumstances are indicative of lack of
merit of plaintiff's case.</p>

<p class="BODY">We thus find that plaintiff has not discharged his heavy
burden.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The following from <u>El</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Hogar</u></span> <u>Filipino</u> <u>vs.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Olviga</u></span>,
60 Phil. 17, 21, finds full application:</p>

<blockquote>"A brief analysis of such evidence will show how insufficient
it is to overcome or detract from the eviden­tiary force of the public

instrument was signed in the presence of two instrumental witnesses and appears
to have been ratified by <span class="SpellE">Timoteo</span> before a notary
public.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the biased and interested
testimony of a grantor and the vague and uncertain testimony of his son are
deemed suffi­cient to overcome a public instrument drawn up with all the
formalities prescribed by the law then there will have been established a very
dangerous doctrine which would throw wide open the doors to fraud."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find, as did the lower court, that the deed of donation was
