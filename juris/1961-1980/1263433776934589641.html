<p class="BODY">On June 1, 1964, petitioner, Philippine Virginia Tobacco
Administration (defendant in Civil Case No. Q-8478), PVTA for short, a
government entity existing under Republic Act No. 2265 and respondent, L &amp;
C Corporation (plaintiff in Civil Case No. Q-8478), L &amp; C for short, a
domestic corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Philippines,
executed a purchase agreement under which the latter shall buy from the former
42 million kilos of Grades "A", "B", and "C" of <span class="SpellE">redried</span> <span class="SpellE">fluecured</span> Virginia

1964-1965, an amount of 2.4 million kilos of blending tobacco, it appearing
that the initial national requirements for the importation of blending tobacco

that the only tobacco available from PVTA stocks for disposal at public bidding
had a total of approximately eight million kilos of the 1964 crop; and that at
the 4 to 1 ratio under R.A. 4155, the quantity for importation constituted
approximately 2 million kilos of foreign blending tobacco, thus leaving a
balance of 2.4 million kilos for im­portation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1964</st1:date>,
the petitioner invited bidders for the purchase of eight million kilos of
Grades "D" and "E" of PVTA tobacco stock, crop year 1964,
to be exported in consideration of the right to import two million kilos of
foreign leaf tobacco for blending purposes.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="23" month="12">December 23, 1964</st1:date>,
the petitioner adopted Resolution No. 356, authorizing respondent L &amp; C to
import during the fiscal year 1964-1965 an additional amount of two million
kilos of blending tobacco, provided that no portion of the imported tobacco
shall be allowed to be brought into the country unless the counterpart
exportation of local <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="1">January 4, 1965</st1:date>,
the respondent L &amp; C filed a complaint for injunction with prayer for

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1965</st1:date>,

Resolution Nos<i>. </i>283 and 356, both series of 1964, Appendix 'C' shall

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1965</st1:date>,
as a supplement to the aforementioned Compromise Agreement, the petitioner PVTA

exportation of 9.6 million kilos of PVTA tobacco and the importation of 2.4

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1965</st1:date>,

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="29" month="3">March 29, 1966</st1:date>,
the respondent L &amp; C filed a motion with the lower court for the issuance
of a special writ of execution to enforce the aforementioned compromise
agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner made representations with the Office of the
President to authorize the exportation of 9.6 million kilos of local tobacco
and the importation of 2.4 million kilos of blending tobacco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The export-import agreement, however, was not
approved at the same time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1966, only
four million kilos of local tobacco were allowed to be exported and one million

</span>So, on <st1:date year="1966" day="12" month="8">August 12, 1966</st1:date>,
the petitioner and respondent executed an agreement denominated as the
"Renegotiated Memorandum of Agreement"<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span> which
allowed the export of only four million kilos of PVTA tobacco out of the 9.6
million kilos as agreed upon in the Memorandum Agreement dated <st1:date year="1965" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1965</st1:date> and the import of one

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="5" month="9">September 5, 1967</st1:date>,
a "Revised Memorandum of Agreement"<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">9</span></span> was entered into by the petitioner and

of 5.6 million kilos of <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
leaf tobacco with the right to import 1.4 million kilos blending tobacco.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 17, 1968, the respondent L &amp; C filed another motion
with the lower court for the issuance of a special writ of execution to order
the petitioner to implement the original purchase agreement of June 1, 1964,
and to authorize the importation of 4.4 million kilos of blending tobacco as
provided for in the aforementioned PVTA Board Resolution Nos. 183 and 356.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner alleged that despite its opposition on the ground
that the respondent L &amp; C has not yet completed the Renegotiated Memorandum
of Agreement for 5.6 million kilos, the lower court issued an order dated June
14, 1968 for the implementation of the June 1, 1964 purchase agreement,
commanding petitioner to make representation with the Office of the President
with the end in view of obtaining clearance for the plaintiff to import
blending tobacco.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration which was
denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the petitioner was
constrained to enter into another Memorandum Agreement with the respondent L

<p class="BODY">The abovementioned Memorandum Agreement of August 21, 1968 was
then submitted to the Office of the President which approved the same, subject

Presidential Economic Staff<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">12</span></span></a> dated October 15, 1968, requiring
L &amp; C to export without import rights, one-half (1/2) kilo for every four
(4) kilos exported and entitled to import rights at the rate of 4 to 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This agreement, as amended, was approved by

withdrawn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1969" day="18" month="7">July 18, 1969</st1:date>, the lower court issued an order
setting aside the conditions imposed in the letter of the Director General of
the Presidential Staff.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 23, 1971, the respondent L &amp; C filed with the lower
court a motion for the issuance of a special writ of execution requiring PVTA
to implement the purchase agreement of June 1, 1964 and Memorandum Agreement of
August 21, 1968 for the sale of 24.4 million kilos of PVTA tobacco and the
importation of 6.1 million kilos of blending tobacco pursuant to Republic Act
No. 4155 and restraining petitioner from disposing of its tobacco stock by
public bidding or any other means until compliance therewith.</p>

<p class="BODY">In said motion, respondent L &amp; C alleged that when it was
about to complete the exportation of 17.6 million kilos of export tobacco and
the import rights corresponding thereto, it requested PVTA to start
implementing the provision regarding the remaining balance of 24.4 million
kilos export tobacco and the import rights corresponding thereto in the
proportion established by R.A. 4155; that in reply to L &amp; C's request, PVTA
informed L &amp; C that while it was willing to allow L &amp; C to purchase
24.4 million kilos, it was not disposed to grant any import rights corresponding
to said 24.4 million kilos of tobacco to be purchased by L &amp; C; that this
is not denied by PVTA since it was readying to dispose all of its existing
stocks of PVTA tobacco in a public bidding on August 4, 1971, wherein
successful bidders would be granted corresponding right to import blending
tobacco in the statutory proportion of 1 kilo for every 4 kilos of local
tobacco purchased by the successful bidder.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">14</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On August 4, 1971, the petitioner PVTA filed an opposition
alleging that the decision of the lower court, dated April 27, 1965 had become <span class="SpellE"><u>functus</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>, as
it was superseded by the Memorandum Agreement of August 21, 1968, and that
consequently the respondent judge has no jurisdiction to issue a special writ
of execution of said decision and to implement the original purchase agreement
of July 1, 1964, as it is provided in paragraph 19 of said agreement that:</p>

<blockquote>"19.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The quantity of 17.6 million kilos out of the
42 million kilos covered by the Contract of June 1, 1964 having already been
covered by the export-import transactions in connection with the 4.4 million kilos
to be imported, the implementation of the Contract Purchase of June 1, 1964 as
to the balance of 24.4 million kilos shall be the subject of further
renegotiations inasmuch as, this part of the implementation of the Contract of
Purchase of June 1, 1964 cannot be undertaken at the same time with the other
phases of this Agreement."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">15</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1971" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1971</st1:date>,
the lower court overruled the opposition and issued an order granting a special
writ of execution as prayed for by L &amp; C, a portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Upon consideration of the premises, the Court finds the
contention of the plaintiff entirely well-founded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As contended by the plaintiff, paragraph 19
of the memorandum agreement of August 21, 1966, was not intended for the
purpose of determining whether or not the plaintiff was to be granted import
rights corresponding to the balance of 24.4 million kilos of local tobacco to
be bought by the plaintiff but was for the purpose of agreeing on the schedule
of the said importation and the corresponding importation of blending tobacco
in a workable staggered schedule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
the defendant now to claim that it is not disposed to grant to the plaintiff
any import rights corresponding to the balance of 24.4 million kilos of PVTA
tobacco to be purchased by the plaintiff and on top of it to dispose of its
existing stock of tobacco in a public bidding to other commercial entities, who
are most probably in competition with the plaintiff and to deprive it from
importing blending tobacco pursuant to its undertaking in accordance with the
provisions of Republic Act 4155 would be in derogation of plaintiff's
rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court has noted from the
records that <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of previous negotiations between
the parties leading to the signing of several memorandum agreements to
implement the decision, the plaintiff has been repeatedly compelled to seek the
aid of the Court to order the defendant to perform its obligation."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">16</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the PVTA filed the present petition for <i>certiorari</i>
and prohibition with a prayer for preliminary injunction to set aside said
order of the respondent judge on the ground that the judge acted with grave
abuse of discretion, lack of jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court, in its Resolution dated <st1:date year="1979" day="2" month="3">March 2, 1979</st1:date>, granted the preliminary injunction prayed
for by the petitioner upon the posting of a bond of P10,000.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">17</span></span></a></p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Whether or not the petition for <i>certiorari</i>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Whether or not the respondent judge can compel
petitioner to allow the sale of 24.4 million kilos of PVTA tobacco to and the
importation of 6.1 million kilos of blending tobacco by the respondent.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the first issue, the respondent contends that since the present
petition is an original action for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the
Revised Rules of Court, the petitioner must establish lack or excess of
jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion on the part of respondent court and
in addition, absence of appeal or of any plain or speedy and adequate remedy in
the ordinary course of law; that the questioned order of respondent court was
issued upon the petition of private respondent for the issuance of special writ
of execution to compel the petitioner to implement one of two agreements
approved by the respondent court in its decision of April 27, 1965 by allowing
L &amp; C to purchase the balance of 24.4 million kilos of local tobacco and to
import blending tobacco in the amount of 6.1 million kilos after PVTA was given
an opportunity to be heard and in fact PVTA had filed an opposition thereto;
that the petition was even set for hearing; that the order of the court in
favor of L &amp; C was but an exercise by the court of its jurisdiction and
even granting that the court's findings and conclusions were erroneous (and
actually they were not), the petition for <i>certiorari</i> will not lie
against said order; and that the questioned order was not only within the
court's jurisdiction and competence but was in accordance with laws and facts.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">18</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In answer to respondent's memorandum, the petitioner contends
that the respondent judge did not merely err in the judgment, but acted without
jurisdiction and with grave abuse of discretion in issuing the aforementioned
order because the writ of execution does not conform to any final court
decision or order or any court approved compromise agreement as there is none
which compels petitioner to sell to respondent L &amp; C 24.4 million kilos of
PVTA tobacco and allow it to import 6.1 million kilos of blending tobacco; and
that as such the order of execution has no basis.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">19</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's contention is tenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court finds that there is no decision or
court approved compromise agreement which could be the subject of a writ of execution
to compel the petitioner to sell 24.4 million kilos of PVTA tobacco to the
respondent L &amp; C and allow it to import 6.1 million kilos of foreign
blending tobacco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The compromise
agreement of April 10, 1965 and the purchase agreement of June 1, 1964 strongly
relied upon by the respondent does not provide that the purchase of 42 million
kilos of PVTA tobacco will entitle respondent L &amp; C to import 10.5 million
kilos of blending tobacco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said compromise
agreement provides, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that
the purchase agreement shall remain in full face and effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent judge, in rendering the questioned order, relied
upon the Memorandum Agreement of <st1:date year="1968" day="21" month="8">August
 21, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, said
agreement did not give respondent L &amp; C the right to import 6.1 million
kilos of blending tobacco if it were to purchase 24.4 million kilos of PVTA
tobacco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It merely reduced the amount of
tobacco to be purchased and exported under the <st1:date year="1964" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1964</st1:date> agreement from 42 million kilos to 17.6
million kilos with the collateral right to import 4.4 million kilos of blending
tobacco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under paragraph 19 of said
agreement, the right to purchase the balance of 24.4 million kilos was even
"subject to further renegotiation".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This means that there was still no contract or agreement over the balance
of 24.4 million kilos which would be the basis of a right to import.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of such contract, there are no
rights and obligations which can be enforced by a writ of execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">There being no decision or court approved compromise agreement providing
for the right to export 24.4 million kilos of PVTA tobacco and to import 6.1
million kilos of blending tobacco, the respondent judge had no jurisdiction to
issue the order of execution in question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The writ of execution must conform with the judgment to be executed as
it may not vary the terms of the judgment it seeks to enforce.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">20</span></span></a>
Thus, a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of
Court is the proper remedy in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the second issue, the petitioner cannot be compelled to sell
to the L &amp; C 24.4 million kilos of PVTA tobacco and to allow said L &amp; C
to import 6.1 million kilos of blending tobacco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, as previously pointed
out, a perusal of the terms of the 1964 purchase agreement and the court approved
compromise agreement of 1965 reveals no provision which can be construed as
granting to respondent L &amp; C the right to import 10.5 million kilos of
blending tobacco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the second place,
the respondent cannot rely on Section 4 of R.A. 4155.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The 1964 purchase agreement was entered into
on <st1:date year="1964" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1964</st1:date>, before R.A.
4155 took effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only laws existing at
the time of the execution of contract are applicable to said transaction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well-settled is the statutory rule that
statutes have no retroactive effect unless otherwise provided therein.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">21</span></span></a>
Nothing in R. A. 4155 provides that it should have retroactive effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that subsequent transactions of the petitioner and the
respondent transpired at the time R.A. 4155 had already taken effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, it should be noted that the
importation of blending tobacco is not a matter of right which can be availed
of by every Filipino purchaser-exporter of local PVTA tobacco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 4 of R.A. 4155 provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Importation
of foreign leaf tobacco only for blending purposes</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No person shall import leaf tobacco except as
herein provided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the Philippine
Virginia Tobacco Administration Board believes that it is necessary to improve the
quality of locally made Virginia cigarettes, the Philippine Virginia Tobacco
Administration may authorize any Filipino citizen or Filipino controlled corporation
or company to import, subject to rules and regulations promulgated by the
Philippine Virginia Tobacco Administration, foreign leaf tobacco for blending
purposes:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, That the importer is
required to purchase local Virginia leaf tobacco from the Philippine Virginia
Tobacco Administration and export the same at the ratio not more than one
kilogram of imported foreign leaf tobacco to every four kilograms of exported
local Virginia leaf tobacco purchased by the importer from the Philippine
Virginia Tobacco Administration which shall be exported simultaneously or
earlier than the importation x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<b><o:p></o:p></b></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clear from the foregoing that the PVTA has the discretion
to grant import rights if it believes that the importation of foreign leaf
tobacco is necessary to improve the quality of locally made <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
cigarettes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere fact that a
Filipino citizen or entity holds a contract to purchase PVTA tobacco for
exportation does not necessarily give him the right to demand that he be
allowed to import blending tobacco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
such purchase and exportation of PVTA tobacco are conditions precedent to the
grant of the privilege to import, it is further required that importation of
blending tobacco is necessary to improve the quality of locally-made <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
cigarettes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the PVTA is not
obliged to grant the Filipino purchaser-exporter the privilege to import
blending tobacco.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sale of tobacco stock by public bidding, as scheduled by the
PVTA, with the collateral import rights at the ratio of 1 to 4 million kilos
pursuant to R.A. 4155 to be given to the successful bidder, implies that there
is a need for the importation of foreign blending tobacco in order to improve
the quality of locally-made Virginia cigarettes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, however, does not affect the alleged
import rights of L &amp; C.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
respondent L &amp; C has no right yet to import 6.1 million kilos of blending
tobacco because paragraph 19 of the 1968 agreement reads:</p>

<blockquote>". . . the implementation of the contract of Purchase of June
1, 1964 as to the balance of 24.4 million kilos shall be the subject of further
renegotiation inasmuch as, this part of the implementation of the contract of
Purchase of June 1, 1964 cannot be undertaken all at the same time with the
other phases of this Agreement."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph 19 is clear that only the sale of the balance of 24.4
million kilos of PVTA tobacco is subject to further renegotiation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing is said about the import rights of
6.1 million kilos of blending tobacco.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioner PVTA has not refused to further renegotiate as to the
sale of the 24.4 million kilos of PVTA tobacco to the respondent L &amp; C.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it is admitted that the petitioner
is allowing the respondent L &amp; C to purchase 24.4 million kilos of PVTA
tobacco but without the import rights of 6.1 million kilos of blending
tobacco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere fact that the
respondent L &amp; C was allowed to purchase the 24.4 million kilos of PVTA
tobacco does not necessarily give said respondent the right to demand that it
be allowed to import 6.1 million kilos of blending tobacco.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for <i>certiorari</i> is
granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order of the respondent
judge, dated <st1:date year="1971" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1971</st1:date>,
is declared void and set aside, without pronouncement as to costs.</p>
