				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal by oppositor
Republic of the Philippines from the decision of the Court of First
Instance of Sulu granting, in its naturalization case No. 16, the
petition for citizenship of Ang Dit Kue, <i>alias</i> Atchay Ang, filed therein on 31 May 1958.
  <p>Applicant-appellee's testimonial evidence showed that -</p>
  <p>Ang
Dit is single and was born on 17 June 1936 in Bilaan, Jolo, Sulu, where
he has since resided; that beginning 1 May 1958, he was employed as a
bookkeper with a monthly salary of P250 at the Wah Pin Pawn Shop,
which, however, closed its business at the end of the year; that from 1
January 1959, he was employed in a temporary capacity by his aunt, Liu
Kim Ang, in her <i>sari-sari</i> store at a monthly salary of P120;
that he did not file any income tax returns; that he can speak and
write English and the Tausug dialect; that he finished his elementary
education at the Jolo Central School and his secondary education at the
Notre Dame of Jolo; that he has never left the Philippines, has
socially mingled with Filipinos, has a sincere desire to embrace and
learn our customs; is not opposed to organized government; is not a
polygamist or a believer in polygamy; had not been convicted of any
crime involving moral turpitude, nor is suffering from any incurable or
contagious disease; had conducted himself in a proper and
irreproachable manner; and is a believer in the principles underlying
the Constitution.</p>
  <p>The lower court, satisfied that the
petitioner, Ang Dit Kue, met the requirements of the Naturalization
Law, granted his petition, as aforesaid. Whereupon, the government
interposed this appeal.</p>
  <p>The oppositor-appellant is correct in
challenging the reliability, credibility and sufficiency of the
testimonies of petitioner-appellee's vouching witnesses, Lulsa Roldan,
a housewife, and Tomas Paredo, a retired government employee. In their
affidavit, Exhibit "E", attached to the petition for naturalization,
they deposed as follows: </p>
  <blockquote>"That we have personal
knowledge that the petitioner is and during all such periods has been a
person of good repute and morally irreproachable, attached to the
principles underlying the constitution of the Philippines; and that it
is our opinion that the petitioner has all the qualifications necessary
to become a citizen of the Philippines and is not in any way
disqualified under the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 473,
according to our best belief and information."</blockquote>

  <p>On
the witness stand, however, Luisa Roldan admitted, on
cross-examination, that she did not know what are the qualifications
and disqualifications of an applicant for citizenship; and, as for
Tomas Paredo, he stated merely that they are that one must not have
committed any crime or wrong, violated no law, not a drunkard or
gambler and can vote (t.s.n., 17 January 1959, pp. 6-7, 18-19).</p>
  <p>
The admitted absence of knowledge by witness Roldan of the
qualifications and disqualifications of an applicant for naturalization
totally incapacitates her as a vouching witness, for how could she
vouch, as she did in her affidavit, for what she did not know?</p>
  <p>The
knowledge by Paredo of the qualifications and disqualifications of an
applicant for citizenship is superficial. The statements of these
witnesses in their joint affidavit so vary from their testimonies in
court that their words can not be taken at their face value and they
have thus given themselves away as unqualified to rate as "credible
persons" within the meaning of the naturalization law (V. Ong <i>vs</i>. Republic, L-10642, 30 May 1958).</p>
  <p>Neither
is petitioner's employment lucrative. His non-filing of an income tax
return, because he is "not liable for income tax yet", confirms that
his income is low. Precedents are numerous<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
that an income of P250 a month is not sufficient to satisfy the
statutory requirement of a lucrative calling or occupation. Besides,
petitioner's employment by his own aunt is uncertain (in his own words
"temporary"), and the likelihood of his becoming a public charge is not
far-fetched, his savings of P1,600 and his college education
notwithstanding.</p>
  <p> For the foregoing reasons, the appealed
decision should be, as it is hereby, reversed, with costs against the
petitioner-appellee, Ang Dit Kue. Petition for naturalization is
ordered dismissed.</p>
 <em>Concepcion, C. J., Barrera, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, Zaldivar</em> and <em>Sanchez, JJ.,</em> concur.
