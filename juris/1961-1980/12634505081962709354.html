INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, RICE AND CORN ADMINISTRATION (RCA), AND NARIC WORKERS' UNION,
RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>SANCHEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The meat of the case, as tendered by the pleadings below, is
whether Rice and Corn Administration [RCA] should be held answerable -from June
14, 1962 when the National Rice and Corn Corporation [NARIC] ceased to exist
and RCA was created - for an obligation created by <u>agreement</u> confirmed
in a partial judgment of the Court of Industrial Relations [CIR]<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
rendered on February 16, 1953, directing NARIC to pay 25% additional
compensation for overtime work, night work, and work rendered on Sundays and
legal holidays by its laborers and employ­ees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The present case had its incipiency in a petition filed with CIR<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
on <st1:date year="1963" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1963</st1:date>, almost
ten years to the date of the CIR partial decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners are 147 workers and employees,
allegedly in the service of RCA, who lodged the petition in their individual
capacity, not as union members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
pray that respondent RCA be required to comply with <span class="SpellE">CIR's</span>
<st1:date year="1953" day="16" month="2">February 16, 1953</st1:date> partial
judgment from June, 1962 and to pay attorneys' fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some of the petitioners were former NARIC
employ­ees, others allegedly were recently employed by RCA and never employed
by NARIC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record is not altogether
clear as to whether petitioners are members of the <span class="SpellE">Naric</span>
Workers' <st1:place>Union</st1:place> [NWU].<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For, they claim they are not, a fact negated, and no evidence was taken
by CIR thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">RCA pleaded disclaimer upon the averment, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>., that because "RCA was created under
Republic Act 3452 since June 14, 1962 as a service agency or instrumentality of
the government to implement a government policy and program pursuant to R.A.
3452, the law applicable governing the extra hours of work of employees of the
Administration, is no longer Commonwealth Act 444 known as the Eight Hour Labor
Law but Commonwealth Act 246 known as the Budget Act"; and that "the
liabilities transferred from the NARIC to the RCA are those liabilities
incurred by the NARIC but not those to be incurred by the RCA such as the
claims for overtime from creation of the RCA on June 14, 1962 stated in the
herein petition."</p>

<p class="BODY">Allowed to intervene, NWU moved to dismiss upon the ground of <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of incidental case No. 746-V (21) - filed 10 days
after the petition below - which is a petition similar in terms to the
aforesaid petition filed <span style="">in </span>CIR
by the 147 laborers and employees, in that the union also sought to compel RCA
to pay its laborers and employees <span style="">under
</span>the same partial decision, from June 14, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be noted that Case No. 746-V (21)<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
is filed as an incident in Case No. 746-V of the Court of Industrial Relations
where said partial judgment was entered.</p>

<p class="BODY">CIR, through then Associate Judge <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span>
I. Martinez, on <st1:date year="1963" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1963</st1:date>,
sustained the <span class="SpellE"><u>pendency</u></span> <u>of</u> <u>another</u>
<u>action</u> theory advocated by NWU.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1964</st1:date>,
acting on petitioners' motion for reconsideration, CIR <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>,
in a resolution, affirmed the order of Associate Judge <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span>
<span style="">I. </span>Martinez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Presiding Judge Jose S. Bautista dissented in
an opinion subsequently filed on <st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="3">March
 30, 1964</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The resolution <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> finally disposed of
petitioners' case below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this appeal
to review the order and resolution <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> aforesaid.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not go along with
the majority of the CIR judges in their ruling that this case should be
dismissed upon the ground of <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of another
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The action referred to is Case
746-V (21), which is a petition - filed as aforesaid <u>after</u> the petition
below was lodged in court - also to enforce the 1953 partial judgment in Case
746-V.</p>

<p class="BODY">The 1953 judgment in that case (746-V) was against NARIC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is contended on one side that RCA is
responsible for <span class="SpellE">NARIC's</span> obligation thus created.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But a genuine issue was raised in RCA's
answer:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the law of its creation,
RCA should not be held liable from the time it was constituted on <st1:date year="1962" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1962</st1:date>, for any continuing
obligation under the 1953 partial judgment aforesaid contracted by NARIC which
had ceased to exist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>RCA did not
contract that obligation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In effect then, petitioners' action herein is a <u>fresh</u> <u>suit</u>
against RCA to enforce <span class="SpellE">NARIC's</span> continuing liability
against RCA as <span class="SpellE">NARIC's</span> successor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is idle to contend that the present should
be but an incident of the former suit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For, petitioners here do not seek to alter or clarify the partial
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither could the present
petition be considered as one for execution of the partial judgment of 1953.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because judgment for execution is against a
defeated party or its privies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No <span class="SpellE">privity</span>, if RCA is to be believed, exists here between RCA
and NARIC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is a question which, in
our opinion, demands serious consideration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>CIR should have passed upon it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pendency</span> of another similar petition presented <u>ten</u> <u>days</u>
after the present case was commenced in court should not have stood on the
way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>First</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because the identity of party respondent in
the previous 1953 case (Case 746-V), from which Case 746-V (21) sprang, <u>and</u>
in the present 1963 case (Case 1799-V) deserves explicit determination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Second</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If at all, it is posterior Case 746-V (21)
which should be held in abeyance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, CIR stopped proceedings therein pending decision by this Court
of the present case.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is there merit then to
RCA's defense that it is not liable for <span class="SpellE">NARIC's</span>
continuing obligation aforesaid from and after its constitution on <st1:date year="1962" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1962</st1:date>?</p>

<p class="BODY">This is the poser because RCA concedes that under the law of its
creation, Republic Act 3452, it should answer for all the liabilities
contracted by NARIC, but only those incurred <u>prior</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>date</u>
<u>of</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>NARIC's</u></span> <u>abolition</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Congress, by said Republic Act 3452, approved on <st1:date year="1962" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1962</st1:date>, created RCA, in
pursuance of its declared policy, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 1. It is hereby declared to be the policy of the
Government that in order to stabilize the price of <span class="SpellE">palay</span>,
rice and corn, it shall engage in the purchase of these basic foods directly
from those tenants, farmers, growers, producers and landowners in the
Philippines who wish to dispose of their produce at a price <u>that</u> <u>will</u>
<u>afford</u> <u>them</u> <u>a</u> <u>fair</u> <u>and</u> <u>just</u> <u>return</u>
for their labor and capital investment and whenever circumstances brought about
by any cause, natural or artificial, should so require, shall sell and dispose
of these commodities to <span style="">the consumers
at areas of consumption <u>at</u> <u>a</u> <u>price</u> <u>that</u> <u>is</u> <u>within</u>
<u>their</u> <u>reach</u>."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">RCA is, therefore, a government machinery to carry out a declared
government policy just noted, and not for profit.</p>

<p class="BODY">And more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By law, RCA depends
for its continuous operation on appropriations yearly set aside by the General
Appropriations Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So says Section 14
of Republic Act 3452:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 14. The sum of one hundred million pesos is hereby
appropriated, out of any funds in the National Treasury not otherwise
appropriated, for the capitalization of the Administration:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>, That the annual operational
expenses of the Administration shall not exceed three million pesos of the said
amount:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>, <u>further</u>,
That the budget of <span style="">the </span>Rice and
Corn Administration for the fiscal year nineteen hundred and sixty-three to
nineteen hundred and sixty-four and the years thereafter shall be included in
the <span style="">General Appropriations submitted to
Congress."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">RCA is not possessed of a
separate and distinct corporate existence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the contrary, by the law of its creation, it is an office directly
"under </span><span style="">the Office of the
President of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it is, that
petitioners' claim against RCA must have to be planted upon Section 13 of R.A.
3452 which reads<span style="">:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 13.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The National
Rice and Corn Corporation is hereby abolished and all its assets, <u>liabilities</u>,
functions, powers which <u>are</u> <u>not</u> <u>inconsistent</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u>
<u>provisions</u> <u>of</u> <u>this</u> <u>Act</u>, and all personnel are
transferred to the Administration."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accent here is on the legal provision that liabilities which
RCA is under obligation to respect are those of the defunct <span style="">NARIC </span>"which are not inconsistent
with the provisions" of Republic Act 3452.</p>

<p class="BODY">But petitioners forge the argument that amongst the liabilities
transferred to and to be met by RCA from <span class="SpellE">NARIC's</span>
abolition in June, 1962 is the continuation by RCA of the payment of 25%
additional com­pensation assumed by <span style="">NARIC
</span>under the 1953 judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thrust upon us then is the problem of ascertaining whether the liabilities
under <span class="SpellE">CIR's</span> said decision are inconsistent with the
provisions of R.A. 3452.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our answer is
in the affirmative.</p>

<p class="BODY">To begin:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At bottom, that
decision was rendered in pursuance of an agreement touching on one aspect of
employment - payment of extra compensation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was legally possible for NARIC to enter into such an agreement which
was, indeed, incorporated in the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>NARIC was a corporation, as aforesaid.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But with the RCA, a different picture is presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A mere instrumentality of the national
government performing primarily govern­mental functions to promote general
welfare, the terms and conditions of employment of its laborers and employees,
such as herein petitioners, are governed by law.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
They are subject to civil service rules.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They are governed by the WAPCO Salary Plan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Explicit and unmistakable is Section 5 of R.
A. 3452 which, in part, reads:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> He
[General Manager] shall fix the number and, subject to WAPCO salary plan
allowed by the Civil Service, salaries of, and appoint, subject to the Civil
Service Law and with the consent of the Board of Administrators, such
subordinate employees as may be necessary for the proper discharge of the
duties of the Administration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He shall
suspend or otherwise discipline, for cause and subject to Civil Service Law,
any subordinate employee of the Administration with the consent of the Board of
Adminis­trators and perform such other duties as may be assigned by the
Board."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">By Section 562 of the Revised Administrative Code, as amended, the
legal hours of labor of employees in every branch of the government service
shall be "eight (8) hours a day, for five (5) days a week or a total of
forty (40) hours a week, exclusive of time for lunch:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
However, "[w]hen the interests of the public service so require, the head
of any Department, Bureau, or Office may extend the daily hours of labor, in
what manner so ever fixed, for any or all of the employees under him, and may
likewise require any or all of them to do overtime work not only on workdays
but also on holidays."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The foregoing
notwithstanding, Congress had not left the workers and employees - previously
with the NARIC and now with RCA - without ample protection.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 259 of the Revised Administrative Code states that
"[<span class="SpellE">i</span>]n the absence of special provision, persons
regularly and permanently appointed under the Civil Service Law or whose
salary, wages, or emoluments are fixed by law or regulation shall not, for any
service rendered or labor done by them on holidays or for other overtime work,
receive or be paid any additional compensation; x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." The <u>special</u> <u>provision</u> contemplated
in the statute just mentioned is paragraph 32, Section 7-I of Commonwealth Act
246, otherwise known as the Budget Act, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"(32) <u>Additional</u> <u>compensation</u> <u>for</u> <u>overtime</u>
<u>service</u>. - Officers and employees of the National Government, except
secretaries and undersecretaries of departments, chiefs of bureaus and offices,
and those occupying positions of similar category, when working overtime on
Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, or during half-day sessions, and after five
o'clock post meridian on regular working days to finish work that must be
completed within a specified time, <u>when</u> <u>authorized</u> <u>by</u> <u>the</u>
<u>President</u>, may be paid from any unexpended balance of the appropriation
for salaries and wages authorized in any annual General Appropriation Act,
compensation at rates to be fixed by the heads of departments concerned, with
the approval of <span style="">the </span>President,
which shall not exceed the rate of their regular compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such additional compensation shall not
exceed, for any one month, the equivalent of the regular compensation, nor
shall it exceed, for any one year, fifty per centum of such regular com­pensation."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph 16 of RCA's answer below avers:</p>

<blockquote>"That the President of the Philippines, thru the Executive
Secretary, has authorized under certain limits the payment of extra hours of
work on ordinary days and on Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays under the
pro­visions of the said Commonwealth Act No. 246 which the President has
authority to do under the provisions of said law;".</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing averment is not without prop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Through the years since the enactment of R.A.
3452 on <st1:date year="1962" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1962</st1:date>, the
President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
had authorized payment of overtime compensation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 29, 1962, the President allowed additional pay for
overtime service rendered by RCA personnel in "the procurement,
warehousing, milling and distribution of rice and in the inspection and
inventory of property, to effectively implement the massive <span class="SpellE">palay</span>
procurement program of the President and the stabilization function of the
RCA", for the period from July 1, 1962 to December 31, 1962 "pursuant
to Section 7-I (32) of Commonwealth Act No. 246, <span style="">as </span>amended, subject to availability of funds and the usual
audit", pro­vided "that at no time shall such additional compensation
exceed for any one month the equivalent of the regular compensation, nor shall
it exceed for any one year fifty per centum thereof." This authority was,
on <st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="10">October 24, 1963</st1:date>,
extended up to <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In April, 1964, RCA was granted authority to pay overtime com­pensation
to the replacement personnel of the Security Department from January 1 up to <st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="10" month="6">June
 10, 1964</st1:date>, overtime pay was given RCA personnel for services
rendered "in connection with the unloading, checking, transporting,
storage and distribution, including the financing and accounting of imported
rice, from <st1:date year="1964" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1964</st1:date>
to <st1:date year="1964" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1964</st1:date>."</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 21, 1965, RCA employees who were required to render
“overtime services during the period from March 16 to May 31, 1965" were
granted meal allowance only, "pursuant to GAO General Circular No. 301,
series of 1939, <span style="">as </span>amended;"
and payment to employees who have rendered overtime services from June 1 to
June 30, 1965 was approved as an exceptional case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="7">July
 2, 1965</st1:date>, overtime compensation was authorized <span style="">for </span>RCA employees who rendered
services in connection with the unloading and stockpiling of imported rice for
the months of July, August, and September, 1965.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>RCA employees whose work involved the
distribution of rice from July 1 to <st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="12">December
 31, 1965</st1:date>, were granted meal allowance upon the condition that
"over­time services of only needed personnel shall be required."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="4">April 5, 1966</st1:date>,
the President permitted meal allowance and transportation expenses to RCA
personnel for overtime services rendered and to be rendered after office hours
or beyond their tours of duty effective <st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="1">January
 5, 1966</st1:date> until <st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="6">June 30,
 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 3, 1967, payment of meal allowance and ordinary
transportation expenses was allowed to not more than 20% of the RCA personnel
at any one time, for overtime services rendered and to be rendered up to
December, 1967 in connection with the distribution of rice and corn grits.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts just recited prove the consistent administrative inter­pretation
by the Office of the President as to what may, under the law, be granted RCA
workers and employees for overtime work and work on Sundays and holidays.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
from time to time, authorized such payments.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Not a matter of right, such compensation was given upon authority of
Section 7-I (32) of the Budget Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
would seem incongruous if said employees and laborers, for­merly of NARIC, were
allowed to recover under the partial judgment rendered on February 16, 1953 in
CIR Case 746-V instituted by NARIC Workers' Union against NARIC here in
dispute, and at the same time reap the benefits under the aforesaid Budget
Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, they are no longer NARIC
workers and employees but workers and employees of RCA which operates by law
"under the Office of the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>."</p>

<p class="BODY">While executive construction is not necessarily binding upon
courts, it is entitled to great weight and consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reason for this is that such construction
comes from the particular branch of government called upon to implement the
particular law involved.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
We adhere to the interpretation just mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp;

by the court below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While we disagree
with CIR on the basis of the dismissal of the petition, namely, <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of another action, we nonetheless affirm the order
and resolution of dismissal, upon the ground that petitioners are not entitled

action against RCA.</p>
