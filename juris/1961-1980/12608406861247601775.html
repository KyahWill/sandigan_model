				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Plaintiffs brought this action before the Court of First Instance of 
Pangasinan praying that they be declared owners of the land therein described; 
that the original certificate of title issued in the name of defendants be 
cancelled and transferred to plaintiffs; and that defendants be ordered to 
execute a deed of reconveyance over said land and to pay damages.
<p>Defendants, in their answer, set up the defense that the complaint does not 
state sufficient cause of action and that, even if it does so state, the action 
has already prescribed. After plaintiffs and defendants had presented their 
evidence, the court rendered judgment dismissing the complaint with costs. 
Plaintiffs have appealed.</p>
<p>It appears that on November 1, 1947, plaintiffs filed an application for the 
registration in their name of the parcel of land in litigation; that on November 
29, 1947, defendants filed an opposition thereto; that upon agreement of the 
parties, the heading of the case was postponed to January 20, 1949, which, upon 
petition of the parties, thru their counsel, was postponed to March 28, 1949; 
that on March 28, 1949, the court again postponed the hearing upon petition of 
plaintiffs' counsel to June 16, 1949, and later again upon the instance of 
plaintiffs' counsel the hearing was postponed until further assignment; that 
when on September 8, 1949 the hearing was called for the last time, plaintiffs 
failed to show up, either personally or thru counsel, in spite of the fact that 
their counsel was duly notified thereof, and so the court dismissed their 
application while it allowed the oppositors to present their evidence; that, 
thereafter, decision was rendered decreeing the registration of the land in the 
name of oppositors.</p>
<p>The main theme of appellants is that the trial court erred in dismissing the 
complaint notwithstanding their claim that the hearing in the registration case 
was held in their absence and, therefore, the decision was rendered therein 
without having been given their day in court, or an opportunity to present their 
evidence. In other words, appellants claim that the trial court erred in 
dismissing their case without considering their plea that if they failed to 
appear at the hearing in the registration case it was because they were not duly 
notified thereof either by the court or by their counsel. Hence, they claim, the 
judgment rendered therein is a nullity and can have no binding effect upon 
them.</p>
<p>There is no merit in this contention. The evidence extant in the record shows 
that the hearing of the registration case has been postponed several times upon 
petition of plaintiffs' counsel to the extent that the last postponement was 
until further assignment. And when the hearing was again set upon order of the 
court, appellants' counsel again moved for postponement, which the court granted 
postponing the hearing for the last time to September 8, 1949, but when this 
date came, appellants failed to show up, either personally or thru counsel, in 
spite of the fact that their counsel was duly notified of the hearing. It 
clearly appears that their failure to appear at the hearing of the registration 
case was not due to lack of notice but for reasons that only themselves can 
explain.</p>
<p>It is true that their counsel now claims that their failure to appear at that 
hearing was due to the failure of their former counsel to notify them thereof 
even if he received the notice of the court, but this claim is clearly 
untenable, for under our rules notice to counsel is notice to the party he 
represents. In fact, the rule requires that the notice of hearing should be 
served upon counsel if the party has any, unless the court directs 
otherwise.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> Moreover, if appellants' 
claim is true, the remedy was to file a petition for relief under Rule 38, but 
they failed to do so. Instead, they filed the instant action after the lapse of 
almost 10 years. They are, therefore, guilty of laches, if not of negligence, 
and so only themselves should be blamed for their present plight.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed without 
costs.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L.,
