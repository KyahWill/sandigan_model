				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DISCIPLINARY ACTION AGAINST
ATTY. CLEMENTE M. SORIANO IN L-24114, PEOPLE'S HOMESITE
AND HOUSING CORPORATION AND UNIVER­SITY OF THE PHILIPPINES VS. HON. EULOGIO MENCIAS, ELPIDIO TIBUR­CIO, MARCELINO TIBURCIO, ET AL.

				<BR><STRONG>CASTRO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">By virtue of a pleading entitled "Appearance" filed
with this Court on October 10, 1969, <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, a mem­ber of the Philippine Bar since January 19,
1954, entered his appearance in the present case (L-24114, PHHC and U. P. <span style="">vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Mencias</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span>, et al.) as "chief counsel of
record" for the respondents <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span>, et al.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This act in itself would have been innocuous <span class="GramE">were</span>
it not for the fact that it was done one year and eight months after the
decision in this case became final.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Wittingly or unwittingly, therefore, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
was in effect asking this Court to exhume this case from the archives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We thus considered it needful that he <span class="GramE">explain</span> in full and in writ­ing his unprecedented, if not
altogether <span class="SpellE">bizzare</span>, behavior.</p>

<p class="BODY">His subsequent explanation did not, however, serve to dissuade
this Court from requiring him to show <span class="GramE">cause</span> why dis­ciplinary
action should not be taken against him for entering an appearance at such a
late date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He forthwith came with a re­cital
of the circumstances under which he had agreed to have his services retained by
the respondents <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span>, et al.</p>

<p class="BODY">He alleged that sometime during the first week of October, 1969
the respondent <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span>,
in his own behalf and as attorney-in-fact of the other respondents, went to him
to engage his professional services in two cases, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>this termi­nated case (L-24114), and the case
entitled "Varsity Hills vs. Hon. <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> C.
Mariano, etc., et al."<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(L-30546).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>At their
conference, <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span>
supposedly informed Atty. <span class="SpellE">So­riano</span> of the precise
status of each of the two cases, thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that the <u>Varsity Hills</u> case was set for hearing by this Court on
Oc­tober 27, 1969, white the present case was still pending and the date of
hearing thereof was yet undetermined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
addition to <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio's</span>
representations, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> allegedly relied upon
the assurance <span style="">of </span>a mutual
acquaintance, Atty. Anto­nio J. <span class="SpellE">Dalangpan</span> - that
indeed these two cases were pending in this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so Atty. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
prepared a letter-contract dated <st1:date year="1969" day="8" month="10">October
 8, 1969</st1:date>, by virtue of which he agreed to render professional
services in the two cases in consideration of a con­tingent fee of 143.33
hectares of land out of the 430 hectares (more or less) involved in the two
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was on the same date, <st1:date year="1969" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1969</st1:date>, that he then caused
the preparation of his written appearance in the present case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, it is interesting to note that the contin­gent
fee of 143.33 hectares of land would find no justification if Atty. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> were to render his professional services solely in
the <u>Varsity Hills</u> case, for in this latter case, the records of which we
are in a position to take judicial notice, an area of only about 19 hectares is
involved,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
the bulk of the property claimed by the respondents having been litigated <span style="">in </span>the present case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The entry of appearance of a counsel in a case which has long been
sealed and terminated by a final judgment, besides <span style="">being an </span>unmitigated absurdity in itself and an unwarranted an­noyance
to the court which pronounced the judgment, is a sore deviation from normal
judicial processes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It detracts heavily
from the faith which should be accorded final judgments of courts of justice,
generating as it does in the minds of the litigants, as well as of the public,
an illusory belief that something more can be done toward overturning a final
judicial mandate.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the incident before us, we find Atty. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
grossly remiss and inexcusably precipitate in putting an officious finger into
the vortex of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was <span class="GramE">wanting</span> in the reasonable care which every member of the Bar
must needs exercise be­fore rushing into the midst of a case already litigated
or under litigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before taking over a case handled by a peer in the Bar, a lawyer
is enjoined to obtain the conformity of the counsel whom he would
substitute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And <span style="">if this cannot be had, then he </span>should, at the very least, give
notice to such lawyer of the con­templated substitution.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Soriano's</span> entry of appearance in the present
case as "chief counsel of record" for the respon­dents in effect
sought to preempt the former counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ne­mesio</span>
Diaz, of the premier control over the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although at the hearing of the present incident he averred that he
exerted efforts to communicate with Atty. Diaz to no avail, we are far from
being convinced that he really did so.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nowhere in his writ­ten manifestations to this Court did he make mention
of such efforts on his part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
subsequent assertions to the contrary are plainly mere afterthoughts.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, we note that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
has joined one Atty. <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> T. <span class="SpellE">Doria</span>
as counsel for the respondents in the <u><span style="">Varsity
Hills</span></u><span style=""> </span>case now
pending before this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Doria</span>, who was counsel of record in that case even prior to
October 10, 1969, certainly knew the status of the present case since the scope
of our decision in the latter is a prime issue raised in the <u><span style="">Varsity Hills</span></u><span style=""> </span>case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Clearly, therefore, when Atty. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
accepted the two cases for the respondents, especially the <u>Var­</u><u><span style="">sity Hills</span></u><span style=""> </span>case, he had not bothered at all to communicate with Atty. <span class="SpellE">Doria</span>, as is the befitting thing to do when a lawyer asso­ciates
with another in a pending cause.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
He did not bother either to comprehend the substance of the <u><span style="">Varsity Hills</span></u><span style=""> </span>case before accepting the said case,
something which is elementary in the lawyer's trade.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had he been less precipitate in his actions,
he would have surely detected the existence of a final judgment in the present
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Further still, if it were true, as claimed by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> at the hearing of this <span class="GramE">incident,
that his clients complained to him about having been left out in the cold by
their former lawyer,</span> then that circumstance of itself should have
indicated to him the imperative need for verification of the true status of the
present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
cannot lean on the supposed assurance of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Dalangpan</span>
that the case was still pending with this Court - which assurance Atty. <span class="SpellE">Dalangpan</span>, at the hearing of this inci­dent, categorically
denied having given.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What Atty. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> should have done, in keeping with the reasonable
vigilance exacted of members of the legal profession, was to pay a verification
vi­sit to the records section of this Court, which is easily and quick­ly
accessible by car or public conveyance from his office (<st1:place><st1:placename>May</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>, <st1:address><st1:street><span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Avenue</st1:street>, <st1:city>Manila</st1:city></st1:address>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If his <span class="GramE">office were</span>
situated in the province and he did not have the time to come to the Sup­reme
Court building in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, he could
have posed the proper query to the Clerk of Court by registered mail or by
telegram.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find Atty. <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> guilty of gross neg­ligence in the performance of
his duties as a lawyer and as an officer of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This inexcusable negligence would merit no
less than his suspension from the practice of the law pro­fession, were it not
for his candor, at the hearing of this inci­dent, in owning his mistake and the
apology he made to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the
sense of this Court, however, that he must be as he is hereby severely
censured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Soriano</span></span><span style=""> is </span>further likewise warned that any future similar act will be
met with heavier disciplinary sanction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Atty. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> is hereby ordered, in the
present case, to forthwith withdraw the appearance that he has entered as chief
counsel of record for the respondents <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span>, et al.</p>

<p class="BODY">Let a copy of this resolution be attached to the personal record
of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
