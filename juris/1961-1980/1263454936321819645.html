				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from a dismissal, after trial, of a petition for <u>quo</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span> (Civil Case No. 306 of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>,
Branch V, <span class="SpellE">Gapan</span>) challenging the eligibility of the
herein respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Abes</span>, to the position of mayor of <span class="SpellE">Peñaranda</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, to which he
was duly proclaimed elected in the elections of 14 November 1967.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mayor-elect <span class="SpellE">Abes</span> (<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
herein) had been convicted of the crime of counterfeiting treasury warrants and
sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of six (6) years and one (1) <span style="">day </span>to eight (8) years, eight (8)
months, and (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u>,<u>
</u>and to pay a fine of five thousand pesos (P5,000.00).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After he had partially served his sentence,
he was released from confinement on <st1:date year="1959" day="7" month="4">7
 April 1959</st1:date> by virtue of a conditional pardon granted by the
President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
remitting only the unexpired portion of the prison term and fine (Annexes
"F" &amp; <span style="">"G" </span>to
the Petition for Quo <span class="SpellE">Warranto</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without the pardon, his maximum sentence
would have been served on <st1:date year="1961" day="13" month="10">13 October
 1961</st1:date> (Annex "F” to Petition for Quo <span class="SpellE">Warranto</span>,
CFI Record Wrapper, page 12).</p>

<p class="BODY">With the approach of the 1967 elections, <span class="SpellE">Abes</span>
applied for registration as a voter under the new system of registration, but <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the Election Registration Board of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Peñaranda</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
denied his application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The denial
notwithstanding, he filed his certificate of candidacy for the office of mayor,
and in the ensuing elections in November, he came out the winner over three
other aspirants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="16" month="11">16 November 1967</st1:date>, the municipal board of canv<span style="">assers </span>proclaimed <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
<span class="SpellE">Abes</span> fully elected mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner-appellant Lacuna placed second.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="23" month="11">23 November 1967</st1:date>,
Lacuna filed his petition for <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span>
with application</span> for preliminary injunction in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="7" month="12">7 December 1967</st1:date>,
on the same day when hearing was held on the application for preliminary
injunction, the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
granted to the respondent, Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Abes</span>, an absolute
and unconditional pardon and stored to him "full civil and political
rights".</p>

<p class="BODY">After the scheduled hearing on 21 December 1967 and the
submission of memoranda, the court, with commendable dispatch, rendered, on 28
December 1967, its decision, dismissing the petition for <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>w</u><u><span style="">arranto</span></u></span></span>
with application for preliminary injunction and declaring the eligibility of
mayor-elect <span class="SpellE">Abes</span> to the position of mayor, in <span style="">v</span>iew<span style=""> </span>of the Presidential full pardon granted him before he qualified
for the office.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Lacuna appealed to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's theory is that, by reason of his conviction and
non-registration as a voter, <span class="SpellE">Abes</span> was not a qualified
voter "at the time of the election", and was therefore, ineligible to
the position of mayor, because Section 2174 of the Revised Administrative Code
requires the qualifications of a voter for eligibility to an elective municipal
office; that the restoration to him of his civil and political rights by the
presidential plenary pardon on 7 December 1967 did not retroact to move the
disqualification existing anterior to the grant of the pardon.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span> defense is two-pronged:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>first, that at the time of the elections he
was a qualified voter, notwithstanding his non-registration, because
registration as elector is not a qualification and because the term or duration
of his disqualification arising from his conviction has expired; and, second,
that the absolute pardon blotted out all the consequences of his conviction,
including <span style="">his </span>disqualification.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court rejected the theory of the petitioner, passed <u>sub</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>silentio</u></span> the respondent's first defense, but
sustained him on the second. </p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>On the first defense of
respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Abes</span></span><span style="">, </span>it must be
remembered that <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> conviction of a crime
penalized with <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">prision</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><u>mayor</u> carried the accessory
penalties of <u>temporary abs<span style="">ol</span>ute
disqualification</u> and <u>perpetual special disqualification</u><u><span style=""> from the right of suffrage</span></u><span style=""> </span>(Article 42, Revised Penal Code); and
Section 99 of the Revised Election Code disqualifies a person from voting if
had been sentenced by final judgment to suffer one year or more or
imprisonment.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The accessory penalty of <u><span style="">temporary
absolute disqualification</span></u><span style=""> </span>disqualifies
the convict for public office and for the right to vote, such disqualification
to last only during the term of the sentence (Article 27, paragraph 3, &amp;
Article 30, Revised Penal Code) that, in the case of <span class="SpellE">Abes</span>,
would have expired on <st1:date year="1961" day="13" month="10">13 October 1961</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">But this does not hold true with respect to the other accessory
penalty of <u>perpetual special disqualification for the exercise of the right
of suffrage</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This accessory penalty
deprives the convict of the right to vote or to be elected to or hold public
office <u>perpetually</u>, as distinguished from temporary special
disqualification, which lasts during the term of the sentence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 32, Revised Penal Code, provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 32.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Effects of
the penalties of perpetual temporary special dis</u><u><span style="">qualification</span> for the exercise of the right of suffrage</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The perpetual or temporary <span style="">special disqualification for the exercise of
the right of suffrage shall deprive the offender perpetually or during the term
of the sentence, according to the </span>nature of said penalty, of the right
to vote in any popular election for any public office or to be elected to such
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the offender shall not
be permitted to hold any public office during the period of disqualification."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">The
word "perpetually" and the phrase "during the term of the
sentence" should be</span><span style=""> applied <span class="SpellE">distributively</span> to their respective antecedents; thus the
word </span><span style="">"perpetually” </span>refers
to the perpetual kind of special disqualification, while the phrase
"during the term of the sentence” refers to the temporary special
disqualification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The duration between
the <u>perpetual</u> and the <u>temporary</u> (both special) are necessarily
different because the provision, instead of merging their durations into one
period states that such duration is "according to the nature of said
penalty" --- which means according to whether the penalty is the perpetual
or the temporary <span style="">special </span>disqualification.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since, under the criminal code, the second accessory penalty of
perpetual special disqualification <u>for the exercise of the right of suffrage</u>,
deemed imposed on <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Abes</span>,
did not expire<span style=""> </span>on 13 October
1961, or thereafter, he was, at the time of the election on 14 November 1967,
not qualified to vote or be voted for, or to hold public office, if the effect
of his subsequent absolute pardon is not to be considered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is thus thrown back upon his second
defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the decisive issue in the case becomes whether or not a
plenary pardon, granted after the election but before the date fixed by law for
assuming office, had the effect of removing the disqualifications prescribed by
both the criminal and electoral codes.</p>

<p class="BODY">On this point, appellant Lacuna urges that the presidential
prerogative mercy is prospective in operation and, when granted to <span class="SpellE">Abes</span> on 7 December 1967 did not retroact to the time of the
election; that <span class="SpellE">Abes</span>' political and civil rights were
lost through his conviction and were restored, not at the time of the election,
but only upon the grant of the plenary pardon; that, not being a qua lifted
voter <span style="">at </span>the
time of the election, <span class="SpellE">Abes</span> was not eligible to the
office in question.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Certain authorities (67 C. J. S.578) do hold that a pardon is not
retrospective.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
But the view consistently adopted in this jurisdiction is that the pardon's
effects should not be unnecessarily limited as it would lead the impairment of
the pardoning power, which was not contemplated in the Constitution (<span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> vs. Labrador, 71 Phil. 34, 39; <span class="SpellE">Pelobello</span> vs., Palatino, 72 Phil. 441; <span class="SpellE">Mijares</span>
<span class="SpellE"><span style="">vs.Cu</span>storio</span>,
73 Phil. 507).</p>

<p class="BODY">More specifically, this Court, in <span class="SpellE">Pelobello</span>
vs. Palatino, 72 Phil. 441, through Justice Laurel, stated:</p>

<blockquote>“------------------ .<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Without the necessity of inquiring into the historical background of the
benign prerogative of mercy, we adopt the broad view expressed <span style="">in </span><span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> vs. <st1:place>Labrador</st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">C.R.No</span>. 47941, promulgated December 7, 1940<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
that subject to the limitations imposed by the Constitution, the pardoning
power cannot be restricted or controlled by le­gislative action; that an
absolute pardon not only blots out the crime committed but <u><span style="">removes all disabilities resulting from
conviction;</span></u><span style=""> </span>and that
when granted after the term of imprisonment has expired, absolute pardon <u>removes
all that is left of the con</u>­<u><span style="">sequences
of conviction</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>While there may be force <span style="">in </span>the
argument which finds support in well considered cases that the effect of
absolute pardon should not be extended to cases of this kind, we are of the
opinion that the better view in the light of the constitutional grant in this
jurisdiction is not to unnecessarily restrict or impair the power of the Chief
Executive who, after inquiry into the environmental facts, should be at liberty
to atone the rigidity of law <u>to the extant of <span style="">relieving </span>completely the <span style="">p<span style="">arty </span></span><span style="">or </span></u><u><span style="">parties
concerned from the accessory and resultant </span><span style="">disabilities of criminal conviction</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>----------------------.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Under these circumstances, it is
evident that the purpose in granting him absolute pardon was to en­able him to
assume the position in deference to the popular will; and the pardon was thus
extended on the date mentioned hereinabove and before the date fixed
------------- for assuming office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
see no reason for defeating this wholesome purpose by a restrictive judicial
interpretation of the constitutional grant to the Chief Executive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We, therefore, give efficacy to executive
action and disregard what at bottom is a technical objection." (Emphasis <span style="">s</span>upplied)<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the authority of the three cases previously cited, we
conclude that the pardon granted to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Abes</span> has removed his disqualification, and his election and
assumption of office must be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Lacuna emphasizes the non-registration of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Abes</span></span><span style=""> as </span>a voter <span style="">in </span>order to differentiate the case at bar from <span class="SpellE">Pelobello</span>
vs. Palatino, 72 Phil, 441.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact
stressed does not, however, make the cases dissimilar, because registration as
a voter is not a qualification for a candidate or a <span style="">voter, within the meaning </span>of "qualified voter" in
Section 2174 of the Revised <span style="">Administrative
</span>Code it is merely a step towards voting (Rocha vs. <span class="SpellE">Cordis</span>,
103 Phil. 327).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the
non-registration of <span class="SpellE">Abes</span> as voter <span style="">was </span>predicated upon the same
disqualifying effects of his previous conviction that were blotted out by the
plenary <span style="">pardon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">FOR THE FOREGOING REASONS</b>,
The appealed decision <span style="">is hereby </span>affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No <span style="">costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
