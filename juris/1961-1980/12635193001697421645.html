				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner National Development Company continues to resist an
award in favor of respondent Esteban <span class="SpellE">Galamgam</span>,
husband of one of its employees who died of pulmonary tuberculosis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To justify its adamant stand, petitioner
would invoke what it considered sufficient legal barriers, the late filing of
the claim and the insufficiency as a basis for an unfavorable judgment of a
failure to controvert, which petitioner would downgrade as a pure
technicality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To state the grounds thus
relied upon is to demonstrate their lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute that the deceased Juana <span class="SpellE">Saribay</span>
<span class="SpellE">Galamgam</span> worked for many years as a weaver in the
textile department of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
was danger to the health of those thus employed in view of the fibers of cotton
dust flying around causing petitioner subsequently to furnish gas masks to its
laborers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her services dated back to
before World War II.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the while she
was at her post eight hours a day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
was time also when she was on the night shift.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a result, she suffered several illnesses, for which she was treated by
the company doctor until on <st1:date year="1953" day="30" month="6">June 30,
 1953</st1:date>, her employment was terminated because of her recurrent
ailments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not until <st1:date year="1959" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1959</st1:date> that she filed a notice
and claim for compensation, being a victim of the dreaded disease of pulmonary
tuberculosis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She died on <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After her death, now respondent Esteban <span class="SpellE">Galamgam</span>, her husband, was made party claimant in her
stead.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision on such a claim ordered petitioner, as employer, to
pay P3744.00 as compensation benefits, P500.00 as reimbursement for medical
expenses incurred, P200.00 as burial expenses as well as the additional sum of
P38.00 to the Workmen's Compensation Commission as administrative costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal to the Workmen's Compensation Commission,
there was an <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the above decision with
the modification that the burial expenses should be eliminated and that
claimant <span class="SpellE">Galamgarn</span> was entitled to ten percent of the
amount due as compensation in the sum of P374.40 as attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion for reconsideration was filed by
petitioner, which was denied for lack of merit on <st1:date year="1968" day="18" month="9">September 18, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, its decision of <st1:date year="1968" day="9" month="8">August 9,
 1968</st1:date> stands.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then came the petition for <i style="">certiorari</i>
of <st1:date year="1968" day="7" month="10">October 7, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As set forth at the outset, there is no legal
justification for the reversal sought.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For its first ground,
petitioner would impugn the delay of six years before the claim was filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is its view that the requirement that a
claim for compensation should be made not later than two months after the date
of the injury or sickness or, in case of death, not later than three months
after death, is jurisdictional.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Reference to Operators, Incorporated v. <span class="SpellE">Cacatian</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
would readily make evident how frail is the reed thus relied upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was there stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is much too late in the day to
complain about the long delay in instituting the claim here of seven
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court in 1965 categorically
declared that the failure to file a claim within the statutory period does not
affect the jurisdiction of the Workmen's Compensation Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a doctrine found mention in a 1968
decision, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> Sugar Mills v. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
de <span class="SpellE">Espeleta</span>, citing two cases decided the year
before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first, it took the
claimant eight years and in the second, nine years before the right to
compensation was sought to be enforced.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Its non-jurisdictional character was stressed anew in <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> Milling Co., Inc. v. Workmen's Compensation
Commission, announced less than two months later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the same effect are later cases likewise
of 1968 vintage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have had occasion
this year to rule similarly."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Insofar as the other
contention raised by petitioner to demonstrate what it considered a weakness of
the decision, namely, that its failure to controvert is not to be attended with
such a grave result, this is what its petition states:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is submitted that if this
technicality is allowed without the issue of compensability being squarely met
and considered, grave injustice will be committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is so because should it be found that
there was really no evidence of sickness while claimant was in the employ of
petitioner, then there would have been no need to file any notice of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> and there would have been no right to
controvert that would be renounced."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner seems to be unaware of the doctrine constantly adhered to by this
Court as to the disastrous consequence visited on the employer who fails to
controvert.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A recent decision of this
Court should provide the necessary enlightenment:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"There is an even more formidable
obstacle to the success of this petition to set aside the decision of the
Workmen's Compensation Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
noted therein:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Considering therefore
that the injury sustained by the claimant arose out of and in the course of his
employment and respondent company having failed to controvert the right of the
claimant within the ten-day period prescribed in Section 45 of the Act, the
compensability of the present claim, its reasonableness and validity, is now
beyond challenge.â€™ The absence of controversion is fatal to any defense that petitioner
could interpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we have held in a
host of decisions in compliance with the clear and express language of the
Workmen's Compensation Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any
assertion to the contrary is doomed to futility."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Workmen's Compensation
Commission of <st1:date year="1968" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1968</st1:date>

Sec. 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act reads in full:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"No compensation proceeding under this
Act shall prosper unless the employer has been given notice of the injury or
sickness as soon as possible after the same was received or contracted, and
unless a claim for compensation was made not later than two months after the
date of the injury or sickness, or in case of death, not later than three
months after death, regardless of whether or not compensation was claimed by
the employee himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such notice may be
given and such claim made by any person considering himself entitled to the
compensation or by any other person in his behalf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case medical, surgical, and hospital
services and supplies have been furnished voluntarily by the employer, notice
of the injury or sickness within the time limit above mentioned shall not be
necessary, and if the employer has voluntarily made the compensation payments,
the claim for compensation to be made within the time limits abo<i>v</i>e
established shall no longer be necessary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(As amended by Section 7 of Commonwealth Act No. 210.)</p>
