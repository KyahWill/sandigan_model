of the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission which reversed the
decision of the Acting Referee of Regional Office No. VIII awarding
compensation benefits to petitioner Victoria D. <span class="SpellE">Despe</span>
under the provision of the Workmen's Compensation Act (Act 3428), as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner was employed as a school teacher by the respondent
Bureau of Public Schools on <st1:date year="1930" day="30" month="6">June 30,
 1930</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime in 1967, she
started complaining about the swelling and pain on her wrist joints and of
sinusitis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her ailments diagnosed by her
attending physician, <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. Mila B. <span class="SpellE">Basco</span>,
as "Frontal Sinusitis and Rheumatoid Arthritis", slowly progressed in
the subsequent years until on <st1:date year="1972" day="22" month="7">July 22,
 1972</st1:date>, she had to be confined at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>Doctors</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> for treatment due to
severe attack from said illness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
her confinement in the hospital she went back to work again, but because of the
off and on recurrence of her illness, she was forced to apply for optional
retirement at the age of 61 on <st1:date year="1973" day="30" month="9">September
 30, 1973</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two weeks thereafter or on <st1:date year="1973" day="16" month="10">October 16, 1973</st1:date>, she filed a claim for compensation with
the Workmen's Compensation Unit, No. 8, Department of Labor, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
which claim respondent Republic did not controvert.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support of her claim, petitioner submitted
a Physician's Report signed by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Rudolfo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabotabo</span>, certifying to her illness as "Rheumatoid
Arthritis, left and right wrist joints; Urinary Tract Infection; and Sinusitis
Maxillary, bilateral; all of which are recurrent".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was the same physician who advised her to
retire from her job as he found her suffering from 60% loss of use of both
hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In June 1974, petitioner was
examined by Dr. Francisco <span class="SpellE">Dayak</span>, Compensation Rating
Medical Officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After evaluating her
supposed disability, she came up with the finding that petitioner is not
suffering from any.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the
Chief of the Workmen's Compensation Unit notified petitioner on <st1:date year="1974" day="28" month="6">June 28, 1974</st1:date> of the denial of her
claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1974</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a motion to set aside the tentative adjudication by the Chief
of the Workmen's Compensation Unit denying her claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion was granted and the case was set
for hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="11" month="2">February 11, 1975</st1:date>,
the Regional Office rendered a decision awarding petitioner the sum of P366.95
as medical benefits and P6,000.00 as disability compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place><st1:placename>Respondent</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Republic</st1:placetype></st1:place> was also required to pay
attorney's fees in the amount of P300.00 and administrative fees of
P61.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A copy of the decision was
received by respondent Republic on <st1:date year="1975" day="3" month="3">March
 3, 1975</st1:date> to which it filed a motion for reconsideration on <st1:date year="1975" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1975</st1:date> on the ground that the
decision is not supported by substantial evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the records of the case were
automatically elevated to the Workmen's Compensation Commission in accordance
with Sec. 4, Rule 15<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Rules of the Workmen's Compensation Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After review of the records, the respondent
Commission denied the payment of disability benefits to petitioner solely on
the basis of the service record of the petitioner and the finding of the Compensation
Rating Medical Officer, Dr. Francisco <span class="SpellE">Dayak</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this petition for review.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that the respondent Commission was justified
under Sec. 49, par. 5<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
of Act 3428 and by Sec. 1, Rule 10 of the Rules of the Workmen's Compensation
Commission to entertain the appeal of respondent Bureau of Public Schools
because the same was filed in due time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But, respondent Commission should have dismissed the appeal of
respondent Republic pursuant to the provision of Sec. 2, Rule 15 of the Rules
of the Workmen's Compensation Commission because it is clear from the record
that respondent Republic has not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> the
claim of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well settled is the
doctrine that failure to controvert the right of claimant to compensation
benefits within the statutory period is a renunciation of the right to
challenge the claim and a waiver of all non-jurisdictional defenses and there
is nothing that the employer can legally prove in relation thereto.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus with its failure to controvert the claim of the petitioner within the
statutory period, the respondent Republic cannot even raise the defense that
the illness of the petitioner is not compensable because it is not work
connected or aggravated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even
granting that the claim was <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>, still there
is no legal basis for the respondent Commission to deny the claim of petitioner
solely on the basis of her service record.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Claim is made that the service record of petitioner shows that it has
not filed any application for sick leave before she retired on <st1:date year="1973" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1973</st1:date> and that her only
sick leave was from November 3, to <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="12">December
 31, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere fact that
no sick leaves appeared on her record immediately before her retirement does
not necessarily prove that petitioner suffered from no disability at the time
of her retirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The possibility is
not to be discounted that at those times that petitioner was absent due to her
illness, her <span class="SpellE">sickleaves</span> for some reason or another
were not so reflected on her record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
fact, however, that her optional retirement at the age of 61 was approved by
the Government Service Insurance System is a clear indication that she has met
the conditions regarding applications for optional retirement under
Commonwealth Act No. 186, as amended by Rep. Acts No. 1616 and No. 4968 payable
by the employer pursuant to Memorandum Circular No. 133 of the Office of the
President:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said Circular among others
provides that x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
"all such applications shall not be recommended for approval unless funds
are available in the bureau or office concerned for the payment of the applicant's
retirement gratuity over and above the fund requirements of its programmed
projects and activities and provided any of the following circumstances or
conditions is present:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)<span class="SpellE">xxxxx</span>; or (2) The employee-applicant is below 65 years of
age, is physically incapacitated to render further efficient service."</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, it cannot be denied that the illnesses which constrained
petitioner to apply for optional retirement occurred during the course of her
employment as a public school teacher.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As such, there is the presumption mandated by Section 44 of the
Workmen's Compensation Act<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
that the employee's illness either arose out of, or at least was aggravated by
said employment; and with this legal presumption, the burden of proof shifts to
the employer and the employee is relieved of the burden to show causation.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case before Us, respondent has not only failed to controvert the claim
of petitioner within the statutory period but also failed to offer sufficient
proof that the illness of petitioner was not work connected or work aggravated.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, the decision of the Workmen's
Compensation Commission is hereby reversed and set aside and a new one rendered
