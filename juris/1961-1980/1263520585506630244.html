of the Court of Tax Appeals, in its CTA Case No. 1705, declaring respondent <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> Min­ing Company, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> for short) exempt from paying the real property tax
assessed against it by the Provincial Assessor of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>

the facts of this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Samar</span></span></st1:place><span style=""> is a domestic corporation engaged in the
mining industry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the mining claims
and the mill of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> are located inland and at a
great distance from the loading point or pier site, it decided to construct a
gravel road </span>as <span style="">a convenient
means of hauling its ores from the mine site at <span class="SpellE">Buug</span>
to the pier area at <span class="SpellE">Pamintayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>; that as an initial step in the construction
of a 42-kilometer road which would traverse public lands <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>,
in 1958 and 1959, filed with the Bureau of Lands and the Bureau of Forestry
miscellaneous lease applications for </span>a <span style="">road right of way on lands under the jurisdiction of said bureaus where
the proposed road would traverse; that having been given temporary permit to
occupy and use the lands applied for by it, said respondent constructed a road
thereon, known as the <span class="SpellE">Samico</span> road; that although the
gravel road </span>was <span style="">finished in
1959, and had since then been used by the respondent in hauling its iron ores
from its mine site to the pier area, and that its lease applications were
approved on October 7, 1965, the execution of the corresponding lease contracts
were held in abeyance even up to the time this case was brought to the Court </span>of

Appeals of <span class="SpellE">Zam­boanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>,
(hereinafter referred to as Board, for short), contesting the validity of the
assessment upon the ground that the road having been constructed entirely on a
public land cannot be considered an improvement subject to tax with­in the
meaning of section 2 of Commonwealth Act 470, and invoking further the decision
or this Court in the case of <span class="SpellE">Bis­lig</span> Bay Lumber
Company, Inc. vs. The Provincial Government of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>,
G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-9023, promulgated on </span><st1:date year="1956" day="13" month="11"><span class="GramE">November 13, 1956</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1965</st1:date>, after the parties
had submitted a stipulation of facts, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>
received a resolution of the Board, dated <st1:date year="1964" day="22" month="12">December 22, 1964</st1:date>, affirming the validity of the
assessment made by the Provincial Assessor of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> under tax declaration No. 3340, but holding
in abey­ance its enforceability until the lease contracts were duly executed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 16, 1965, <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> moved to
reconsider the resolution of the Board, praying for the cancellation of tax
declaration No. 3340, and on August 3, 1965, <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> received
Resolution No. 13 not only denying its motion for reconsideration but modifying
the Board's previous resolution of December 22, 1964 declaring the assessment
immediately enforceable, and that the taxes to be paid by <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>
<span style="">should accrue or commence </span><span style="">with </span><span style="">the year 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When </span><span style="">its </span><span style="">second motion for reconsideration was again denied </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">the Board, </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Samar</span></span></st1:place><span style="">
elevated the case to the Court of </span><span style="">Tax
</span><span style="">Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals to take cognizance
of the case was assailed by herein petitioners (the Board and the Provincial
Assessor of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>)
due to the failure <span style="">of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> </span>to first pay the realty tax imposed upon it
before interposing the appeal, and prayed that the resolution <span style="">of </span>the Board appealed from be
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="28" month="6">June 28, 1967</st1:date>, the <span style="">Court of </span>Tax Appeals ruled that it had jurisdiction to entertain
<span style="">the </span>appeal and then reversed the
resolution <span style="">of the Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span>Court of Tax Appeals ruled that
since the road is constructed on public lands such that it is an integral part
of <span style="">the lands </span>and not an
independent improvement thereon, and that upon the termination of the lease the
road as an improvement will automatically be owned by the national government, <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> should be exempt from paying the real estate tax
assessed against it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dissatisfied with
the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals, petitioners Board and <span class="SpellE">Placido</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Lumbay</span>, as Provincial
Assessor of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>,
interposed the present petition for review before this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue to be resolved in the present appeal <span style="">is </span>whether or not respondent <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place> should pay realty tax on the assessed
value of the road it constructed on alienable or disposable public lands <span class="SpellE">tnat</span> are leased to it by the government.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners maintain that
the road is an improvement and, therefore, taxable under Section 2 of the
Assessment Law (Commonwealth Act No. 470) which provides as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 2.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Incidence of real
property tax</u>.</span> - Except in chartered cities, there shall be levied,
assessed, and collected, an annual <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span>
tax on real property including land, buildings, machinery, and other
improvements not hereinafter specifically exempted."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is no question that
the road constructed by respondent </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Samar</span></span></st1:place><span style=""> on the public lands leased to it by the
government is an improvement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as to
whether the same is taxable under the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
provision </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the Assessment Law, this question has already
been answered in the negative by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case of <span class="SpellE">Bislig</span> Bay Lumber Co., Inc. vs.
Provincial Government of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>, 100 Phil., 303,
where a similar issue was raised as to whether the timber </span>concessionaire
should be required to pay realty tax for the road it constructed at its own
expense within the ter­ritory of the lumber concession granted to it, this
Court, after citing Section 2 of Commonwealth Act 470, held:</p>

<blockquote>"Note that said section authorizes the levy of real tax not
only on lands, buildings, or machinery that may be erected thereon, but also on
any other improvements, and considering the road constructed by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> on the timber concession granted to it as an
improvement, appellant assessed the tax now in dispute upon the authority of
the above provision of the law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is the theory of appellant that, inasmuch as the road was
constructed by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> for its own use and benefit
it is subject to real tax even if it was constructed on a public land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, it is the theory of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> that said road is exempt from real tax because (1)
the road belongs to the national government by right of accession, (2) the road
cannot be removed or separated from the land on which it is constructed and so
it is part and parcel of the public land, and (3), according to the evidence,
the road was built not only for the use and bene­fit of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
but also of the public in general.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We are inclined to uphold the theory of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, it cannot be dis­puted
that the ownership of the road that was constructed by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
belongs to the government by right of accession not only because it is in­herently
incorporated or attached to the timber land leased to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
but also because upon the expiration of the concession, said road would ul­timately
pass to the national government (Articles 440 and 445, new Civil Code; <span class="SpellE">Tobatabo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Molero</span>, 22 Phil.,
418).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the second place, while the
road was constructed by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> primarily for its
use and benefit, the privilege is not exclusive, for, under the lease contract
entered into by the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> and the <span class="GramE">government,</span> its use can also be availed of by the employees
of the government and by the public in general.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> In other
words, the government has practically reserved the rights to use the road to
promote its varied activities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Since, as above shown, the road in quest­ion
cannot be considered as </span>an <span style="">improvement
which belongs to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, although in part is for
its benefit, it is clear that the same cannot be the subject of assessment
within the meaning of section 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 470.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"We are not oblivious of the fact that the present assessment <span style="">was </span>made by appellant on the strength
of an opinion rendered by the Secretary <span style="">of
</span>Justice, we find that the same is predicated on authorities which are
not in point, for they refer to improvements that belong to the lessees
although constructed on lands belonging to the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is
well settled that </span>a <span style="">real tax,
being a burden upon the capital, </span>shod <span style="">be </span>paid by <span style="">the owner of
the land and </span>not by a <span class="SpellE"><span style="">usufructuary</span></span><span style="">
(Mercado vs. <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, 67 Phil., 608; Article 597, new
Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span>
is but a partial <span class="SpellE">usufructuary</span> of the road in
question."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Again, in the case of
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, et al. </span>vs. <span style="">Santos, et al., 105 Phil., 963, this Court
ruled that the lessee who introduced improvements consisting of dikes, gates
and guard-houses on swamp lands leased to him by the Bureau of Fisheries, in <span class="SpellE">convertihg</span> the swamps into fishponds, is exempt from
payment of realty taxes on those improvements.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"We however believe that the assessment on the improvements introduced
by defendant on the fishpond has included more than what is authorized by
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The improvements as assessed
consist of dikes, gates and guard­houses and bodegas totals P6,850.00 which
appellants are not now questioning, but they dispute the assessment on <span style="">the </span>dikes and gates in this wise:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'After the swamps were leased to appellants,
the latter cleared the swamps and built dikes, by pushing the soil to form
these dikes in the same way that paddies are built on lands intended for the
cultivation <span style="">of <span class="SpellE">palay</span>,
the only difference being that dikes used in fishponds are relatively much
larger than the dikes used in <span class="SpellE">ricelands</span>.' </span>We <span style="">believe this contention to be correct,
because those dikes can really </span>be <span style="">considered
as in­tegral parts of the fishponds and not as independent improvements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They cannot </span>be taxed <span style="">under </span><span style="">the assessment law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
assessment, therefore, with regard to improvements should </span>be <span style="">modified by ex­cluding the dikes and
gates."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is contended by petitioners that the ruling in the <span class="SpellE">Bislig</span> case is not applicable in the present case because
if the concessionaire in the <span class="SpellE">Bislig</span> case was exempt
from paying the realty tax it was because the road in that case was constructed
on a timberland or on an <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">indisposable</span></u></span><u><span style="">
public </span>land,</u> while in the instant case what is being taxed is the
13.8 kilometer portion or the road traversing <u><span style="">alienable public lands</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>This contention has no merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pronounce­ment in the <span class="SpellE">Bislig</span>
case contains no hint whatsoever that the road was not subject to tax because <span style="">it </span>was constructed on inalienable
public lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is emphasized in the <span class="SpellE">Bis­lig</span> case is that the improvement is exempt from
taxation because it is an integral part of the public land on which it is
constructed and the improvement is the property of the government by right of
accession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Section 3(a) of the
Assessment Law (Com. Act 470), all properties owned by the government, without
any distinction, are exempt from taxa­tion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is also contended by
petitioners that the Court of Tax Appeals can not take cognizance or the appeal
of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> from the resolution of the Board assessing
realty tax on the road in question, because <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> had
not first paid under protest the realty tax assessed against it as required
under the provisions of Section 54 of the Assessment Law (Com. Act 470), which
partly reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 54.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u><span style="">Restriction upon power of Court to impeach tax</span></u><span style="">.</span></span><span style=""> -- </span>No court shall entertain any suit assailing the validity of
a tax assessment under this Act until the taxpayer shall have paid under
protest the taxes assessed against him, nor shall any court declare any tax
invalid by rea­son ...."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The extent and scope of the jurisdiction of the Court of Tax
Appeals regarding matters related to assessment of real property taxes are
provided for in Section 7, parag­raph (3) and Section 11 of Republic Act No.
1125, which <span style="">partly read as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 7.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Jurisdiction</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Tax Appeals shall exercise
exclusive ap­pellate jurisdiction to review by appeal, as herein provided -</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">(3)
<span style=""> </span>Decisions of provincial or city Board of
Assessment Appeals in cases in­volving the assessment and taxation of real
property or other matters arising under the Assessment Law, including rules and
regula­tions relative thereto."</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 11.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Who may appeal; effect of appeal</u>. -
Any person, association or cor­poration adversely affected by a decision or
ruling of<span style=""> </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> any provincial or city Board of Assessment Appeals
may file an ap­peal in the Court of Tax Appeals within thirty days after the
receipt of such de­cision or ruling."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In this connection the
Court or Tax Appeals, in the decision appealed from, </span><span style="">said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Prior to the enactment or Republic Act No. 1125, all civil
actions involving the legality of any tax, impost or assessment were under the jurisdiction
of the Court of First Ins­tance (Sec. 44, Republic Act No. 296).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear, therefore, <span class="SpellE">tnat</span>
before the creation of the Court or Tax Appeals all cases <span style="">involving </span>the legality of assessments
for real property taxes, as well as the refund thereof, were properly brought
and <span style="">taken cognizance </span>by the said
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, with the passage by
Congress and the approval by the President of Republic Act No. 1125, the
jurisdiction over cases involving the validity of realty tax assessment were
trans­ferred from the Court of <span style="">First
Instance to the </span>Court of Tax Appeals (See <span style="">Sec. </span>22, <span style="">Rep. </span>Act
No. 1125).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only exception to the
grant of ex­clusive appellate jurisdiction to the Tax Court relates to <u>cases
involving the refund of real property taxes</u> <span style="">which </span>remained with the Court of First Instance <span style="">(See </span>City of <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span>,
et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Gatmaitan</span>, et al., G.R. No. L-19129, <st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="2">Feb<span style="">ruary
 28, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"A critical and analytical study of Section 7 of Republic Act
No. 1125, in re­lation to subsections (1), (2) and (3) thereof, will readily
show that it was the intention of Congress to lodge in the Court of Tax Appeals
the exclusive appellate jurisdiction over cases involving the le­gality of real
property tax assessment, as distinguished from cases involving the refund of
real property taxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To require the
taxpayer, as contended by respondents, to pay first the disputed real property
tax before he can file an appeal assailing the legality and validity of the
realty tax as­sessment will render nugatory the appellate jurisdictional power
of the Court of Tax Appeals as envisioned in Section 7(3), in relation to
Section 11, of Republic Act No. 1125.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
we follow the contention of respondents to its logical conclusion, we cannot
conceive of a case involving the lega­lity and validity of real property tax
assessment, decided by the Board of Assessment Appeals, which can be appealed
to the Court of Tax Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
position taken by respondents is, therefore, in conflict with the Explanatory
Note contained in House Bill No. 175, submitted during the First Session, Third
Congress of <span style="">the </span>Republic of the
Philippines, and the last paragraph of Section 21 of Republic Act No. 1125
which provides as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">Any law or part of law, or any executive order, rule or regulation
or part thereof, inconsistent with the provisions of this Act is here­by

<blockquote>"Accordingly, we hold that this Court can entertain and give
due course to petitioner's appeal assailing the legality and validity of the
real property tax assessment here in ques­tion without paying first the
disputed real property tax as required by Section 54 of the <span style="">Assessment Law."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

of City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cabanatuan</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> vs. <span class="SpellE">Gatmaitan</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">, </span>said:</p>

<blockquote>"... if the real estate tax has already been paid it is futile
for a taxpayer to take the matter to the City Board of Assessment Appeals for
the jurisdiction of that body is merely confined to the determination of the
reasonableness of the assessment or taxation of the property and is not
extended to the authority of requiring the refund of the tax unlike cases
involving assessment <span style="">of </span>internal
revenue taxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances, we
hold that this case comes under the jurisdiction of the proper court of first
instance it involving the refund of a real estate tax which does not come under
the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> portion of the decision of this Court, We
gather that the only question that may be brought before the City or Provincial
Board of Assessment Appeals is the question which relates to the reasonableness
or legality of the realty tax that is assessed against a taxpayer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such being the case, </span><span style="">it </span><span style="">would be unjust to require the realty owner to first pay the tax, that
he precisely questions, before he can lodge an appeal to the Court of Tax
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe that it is not the
intendment of the law that in questioning before the Court of Tax Appeals the
validity or reasonableness of the assessment approved by the Board of
Assessment Appeals the taxpayer should first pay the questioned tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is Our view that in so far as appeals from
the decision or resolution of the Board of Assessment Appeals, Section 54 of
Commonwealth Act 470 does not apply, and said section can be considered as
impliedly repealed by Sections 7, 11 and 21 of Republic Act 1125.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">IN VIEW OF THE
FOREGOING</span></b><span style="">, the decision of
the Court of Tax Appeals, appealed from, is affirmed, without pronouncement as
to costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
