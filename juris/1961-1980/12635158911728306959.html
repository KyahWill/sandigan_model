the purchases of foreign exchange subject matter of this case; that the
Exemption Committee of defendant Central Bank of the Philippines informed
plaintiff that its application for exemption from the payment of the 25% margin
on the sale of foreign exchange was denied; that plaintiff requested for a
reconsideration of the denial of its application for exemption and that Atty.
Andres T. <span class=SpellE>Velarde</span> (Plain­tiff's counsel in the
instant case), in his letter to defendant dated September 19, 1962, demanded,
in behalf of the plaintiff, the refund of the margin fees subject hereof; </p>

<p class=NUM>“13. That on September 26, 1962, Mr. Jesus C. <span class=SpellE>Razon</span>,
the Acting Exe­cutive Officer of the Exemption Committee advised Atty. <span

<p class=BODY>On February 4, 1964 the trial court (Judge <span class=SpellE>Arsenio</span>
<span class=SpellE>Solidum</span> presiding) rendered its decision in favor of
the plaintiff and against the defendant.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It found that the amendments effected on L/C No. 590051 did not materially
change its terms and conditions, and consequently held that the plaintiff's
remittance <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'>of foreign </span>exchange
under <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>said </span>letter of credit is
exempt from the payment of margin fee under Republic Act No. 2609 by virtue of
the provision of its Section 3, which states:</p>

<blockquote><span class=GramE>SEC. 3.</span> The provision of this Act shall
not apply to liquidation of drafts drawn under letter of credit nor of
contractual obligations calling for the payment of foreign exchange issued,
approved and outstanding as of the date of this Act takes effect and the
extension thereof, with the same terms and conditions as the original
contractual obligations; x <span class=SpellE>x</span> <span class=SpellE>x</span>&quot;
</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>Not satisfied with the decision of the lower court, the defendant
brought this appeal.</p>

<p class=BODY>In its brief appellant avers that the said Court erred:</p>

<p class=NUM>1. In holding that plaintiff-<span class=SpellE>appellee’s</span>
remittance of foreign exchange under L/C No. 590051 is exempt f<span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>rom </span>the payment of the margin fee
under Section 3 of Republic Act No. 2609, although the extension provided for
in said letter of credit after the date of the <span class=SpellE>effectivity</span>
of the Margin <span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>Law </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'>was not with the same terms
and conditions</span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'> as </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'>the original letter of
credit;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=NUM>2. In holding that defendant-appel­lant's construction or
interpretation of the exemption from the payment of the margin fee under
Section 3 of Republic Act No. 2609 are (sic) narrow which is not justified by
the purpose and objective sought to be accomplished by law;</p>

<p class=NUM>3. In ordering the defendant-appel­lant the payment (sic) to
plaintiff-<span class=SpellE>appellee</span> the sum of P8<span class=GramE>,000.00</span>
as attorney's fees and the costs of this suit.</p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'>Regarding the first
assignment of error, appellant's contention, among others, is that the
amendment of August 20, 1959 materially changed the terms and conditions of the
origi­nal letter of credit because it gave new right to <span class=SpellE>appellee</span>,
namely, the right to approve the good working condition of the centrifugal cast
iron pipe machine before payment was made, which right was not included in the
original terms and conditions of the letter of credit; that the amendment of
August 24, 1959 likewise materially changed such terms and conditions because
the &quot;foundry equipment&quot; referred to therein was entirely distinct and
separate from the &quot;complete set of centrifugal cast iron pipe
machine&quot; imported </span>under L/C No. 590051; that said &quot;foundry <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'>equipment&quot; was not included in the </span>amendment
of January 27, 1959, such that without the amend­ment of August 24, 1959, the
United Export Clothing Co., Inc., was not bound to ship the same to <span
class=SpellE>appellee</span>:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>that the
amend­ment of August 28, 1959 changed the <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'>terms
and </span>conditions of <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'>the original
letter of credit because </span>without the amendment the <span class=SpellE>Societe</span>

class=SpellE>appellee</span>, said firm being <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt'>entirely different from the United Export Clothing Co., Inc., of New
York, U.S.A.; that there was therefore a change of </span>parties to the letter
of credit insofar as the centrifugal machine was concerned; that the <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'>amendment of September 25, </span>1959 to
allow shipment from any Australian port also changed the terms and conditions
of the original letter of credit and the cancellation of said amendment on
November 12, <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>1959 </span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'>did not operate to </span>exempt <span

the amount of the letter of credit by $150.00 and, therefore, there was a
change in its terms and conditions; and that although the letter of credit
never exceeded <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'>its </span>original
amount of $115,253.19 the $150.00 was also remitted to cover freight charges
and thus increased the disbursement.</p>

</span><span class=SpellE>x</span> the court finds itself in favor of the
contention of the plaintiff that said first amendment dated August 20, 1959
(Exhibit '1-D’), to its original letter of credit did not in any way materially
change its terms and conditions but that, on the contrary, it strengthened the
impossibility of salting dollars abroad because under said amendment no
remittances of dollar could be made to plaintiff's shipper abroad without
previous assurance that the machineries imported by the plaintiff were in ‘good

centrifugal cast iron pipe machine, was already covered by the prior amendment
of January 27, 1959, or before the <span class=SpellE>effectivity</span> of
Republic Act No. 2609, and it did not materially alter the terms and conditions
of plaintiff's original letter of credit, aside from the fact that again said
amendment did not in any way increase the dollar allocation of the plaintiff as
specified in the same letter of credit.&quot;</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>Specifically, the foundry equipment mentioned in the amendment of
<st1:date Month="8" Day="24" Year="1959">August 24, 1959</st1:date> consisted
of a centrifugal blower, forty feet of foundry roller chain, and foundry scale

not integral parts of the centrifugal cast iron pipe machine they were
certainly ac­cessories thereto.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As
explained by <span class=SpellE>appellee's</span> plant operation manager, the
blower is used to accelerate the process of cool­ing the manufactured pipes;
the roller chain is part of the &quot;pipe extracting device&quot; of the
machine; and the scale spare parts are for the purpose of weighing the finished
pipes to determine that they conform strictly to standard specifications.<span

<blockquote>It appears from the partial stipulation of
facts that as early as January 27, 1959, that is prior to the passage of
Republic Act No. 2609, the original <span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>letter
</span>of credit of plaintiff, L/C 590051, was already assignable because of
the first amendment (Exhibit ‘1-B’), by add­ing the phrase 'AND/OR ASSIGNEES'
after beneficiary's name.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Consequently,
that portion of the amendment referring to the assignment of the sum of
$48,500.00 out of plaintiff's original letter of credit to the <span
class=SpellE>Societe</span> <span class=SpellE>Generale</span> de Cen­trifugation
does not subject said amount to any payment of margin fee for the simple reason
that said assignment was duly authorized long before the <span class=SpellE><span
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>effectiv­</span>ity</span> of Republic Act
No. 2609.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Further­more, at no time was
the total amount of said letter of credit ever increased and the confirmation
requested in the amend­ment was necessary for the liquidation of the draft
payable to <span class=SpellE>Societe</span> <span class=SpellE>Generale</span>
de Centrifugation, under Section 3 of Republic Act No. 2609.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;As regards the other amendment which was made on September <span
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>25, 1959, to the effect that 'CREDIT 590051
UNITED </span>EXPORT AMEND TO ALLOW SHIPMENT FROM ANY AUSTRALIAN PORT' (Exhibit
'1-F’), <span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>it is </span>admitted that said
amendment was dis­regarded because it was cancelled by <span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>12, </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>1959.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hence, the contention of the </span>defendant
that such <span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>fact did not exempt the
remittances un­der </span>the letter of credit of the plaintiff <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>from payment of
margin fee </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>has absolutely no
merit.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;Finally, it <span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>is </span>argued
by the defendant that the amendment of November 5, 1959, which reads 'CREDIT
590051 SOCIETE GENERALE AMEND TO INCREASE AMOUNT BY $150 TO COVER ADDITIONAL
FREIGHT CHARGES (Exhibit '1-G’), has materially changed plaintiff's original
letter of credit because its amount was increased by $150.00.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This contention is not borne out by the
record for it is very clear that at no time was the amount of plaintiff's
original letter of credit ever changed and much less increased.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Rather, on the contrary, it appears that the
total amount disbursed or utilized by the plaintiff under the said letter of
credit never exceeded its original amount <span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold'>of </span>$115,203.19.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Moreover,
it is shown by the evidence of the plaintiff that when it requested said sum of
$150.00 from the Philippine National Bank, as per plaintiff's letter (Exhibit
‘C-1’), plaintiff categorically requested said bank not to amend its letter of
credit but that it be granted a non-recurring dollar quota allocation for the
sum of $150.00.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, the defendant,
thru its agent, the Philippine National Bank, informed the plaintiff that said
amount of $150.00, was purchased by the plaintiff in Manila and sent to <span
class=SpellE>Societe</span> <span class=SpellE>Generale</span> de
Centrifugation under Mail Transfer, as shown by Exhibit 'C-2'.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hence, the amendment of <st1:date Month="11"
Day="5" Year="1959">November 5, 1959</st1:date> (Exhibit <span
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>‘1-G’</span>)<span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold'>, </span>was made not only against plaintiff's express instruction but
through the mistake and inadvertence of the Philippine National Bank.&quot;</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>It need only be added in connection with this amount of $150 to
cover additional freight charges, that <span class=SpellE>appellee</span> paid
in 25% margin fee thereon, but not as part of the letter of credit.</p>

<p class=BODY>Under the second assignment of error appellant submits that exemption
provisions in a statute are construed strictly against the party claiming th<span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt'>e</span>n; that the &quot;terms and
conditions&quot; in section 3 of Republic Act No. 2609 refer to all the terms
and conditions off the letter of credit and not only to the amount thereof; that
the amendments to L/C No. <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'>590051
changed the terms and conditions of the original letter of credit although the
amount involved was never increased: and that to construe Section 3 liberally
would defeat the purpose of the Margin Law because it would give importers who
had out­standing contractual obligations as of the passage of the law the
liberty to change the terms and conditions thereof as long as their amounts
were not increased, thereby evading payment of the margin fee and creating an
excessive demand upon the country's international reserve.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

proposition, that exceptions from the coverage of a statute are strictly
construed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But such construction

appellant, which would rule out from the exemption therein pro­vided the
amendments hereinbefore set forth, although they did not materially change the
