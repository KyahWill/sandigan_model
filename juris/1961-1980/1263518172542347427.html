from the Judgment of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>,
in its Criminal Case No. N-250, convicting him of the crime of murder and
sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></u>
and to indemnify the heirs of the victim in the amount of P6,000.00 and to pay
the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The indictment against the
said accused-appellant is a reconstitu­tion of one formerly filed<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
that was burned or destroyed along with all court records and those in the
fiscal' s office when fire gutted the old Capitol building of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> City on 7 June 1959, after trial of the case had
commenced.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that around midnight of 24 July 1956, at the
enclosed ground floor of the house of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Camerino</span>
in barrio <span class="SpellE">Medicion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Imus</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, while a group of persons were playing a game of

at a table lighted by a 50-watt bulb with a conical lampshade, a person stepped
inside, pointed a gun and fired several shots at close range at one of the
players, Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> by name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the ensuing scuffle, the gun-wielder
disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First-aid treatment was
administered to <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>, after which he was brought
that same evening to the Philippine General Hospital in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
where he was admitted at <st1:time minute="55" hour="12">12:55</st1:time> A. M.

therein for the following injuries:</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> was
discharged from the hospital on <st1:date year="1956" day="16" month="9">16
 September 1956</st1:date>, and, in the opinion of the attending physician, the
injuries permanently disabled the patient.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was brought home to <span class="SpellE">Imus</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>, where he remained
paralyzed and bed-ridden until he died on <st1:date year="1957" day="5" month="6">5 June 1957</st1:date>, due to heart failure caused by the paralysis
produced by the injuries to his spine.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found the accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span>
Dominguez as the person who intruded into the gambling den and shot Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> based on five (5) considerations, all of which are
assailed as erroneous findings by said appellant in his assignment of
errors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These considera­tions are as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>(1) the statement of the deceased in the hospital pointing to the
accused as his assailant which statement may very well be considered as an
'ante-mortem' declaration, the same having been made by the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span>
under consciousness of impending death; (2) the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
silence when pointed to by the victim on that occasion; (3) the testimony of
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Camerino</span> positively identifying the accused as
the <span class="SpellE">gunwielder</span>; (4) the presence of gun powder
residue in both his hands; and (5) the inherent weakness of his defense, which
is 'alibi'." (Decision, Appellant's Brief, page 97)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution also showed that in Criminal Case No. 235 of the
Justice of the Peace of <span class="SpellE">Kawit</span>, the deceased <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> had been charged with physical injuries, for mauling
and assaulting appellant Dominguez a few months before the shooting, but <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> was acquitted (Exhibit "H").</p>

<p class="BODY">In his appeal brief, accused-appellant lays considerable stress
on the fact that while prosecution witness Pedro <span class="SpellE">Camerino</span>,
in his testimony in chief, asserted that on the midnight in question, while he
was at the ground floor of his house with about 15 persons, the deceased
Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> among them, playing <span class="SpellE"><u>monte</u></span>, the accused <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span>
Dominguez entered, approached the gambling table and shot <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>,
who was seated just across the table; that <span class="SpellE">Camerino</span>
told the people not to touch anything while he called for the police; that a
policeman and PC Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Desalla</span> arrived and took down <span class="SpellE">Lacson's</span> declaration; then <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>
was brought to the Philippine General Hospital; and that while in the hospital,
<span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> pointed to the accused (who was brought
thither by some PC soldiers) as the person who shot him; yet in the course of
his cross-examination, witness <span class="SpellE">Camerino</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>testified that he did not actually see <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> Do­minguez fire at <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>;
that he had previously testified that he saw Dominguez shoot <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> because that was what other people told him and that
he merely thought it was Dominguez because he knew him to be an enemy of <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, the trial judge discounted <span class="SpellE">Camerino's</span>
about face because the retraction came only after a long recess, and his direct
testimony tallied with his statement given to PC investigator <span class="SpellE">Liberato</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamundong</span>, shortly after
the crime was committed, and later subscribed and sworn to before judge Joaquin
<span class="SpellE">Parcero</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>,
wherein Pedro <span class="SpellE">Camerino</span> positively stated that he saw <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> Dominguez fire at <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We see no reversible error in this
appreciation of the trial court, considering its opportunity to closely observe
the witness, and the fact that <span class="SpellE">Camerino's</span> original
identification of the appellant herein as the gunman is supported by other circumstances
of record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor was the recognition made
incredible by the concentration of the lamp's light on the gaming table, for
the surface of the latter could reflect sufficient light into the room to
render appellant's recognition by <span class="SpellE">Camerino</span> and the deceased
entirely possible.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the assistant PC provincial commander at the time, Major <span class="SpellE">Dawa</span>, testified that at the Philippine General Hospital he
brought accused-appellant close to the victim and inquired from the latter
whether the accused was the one who did the shooting, and <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>
answered in the affirmative without the accused making any denial of the
imputation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The paraffin cast of appel­lant's
hands were found by Captain Crispin B. Garcia to be positive for gunpowder
residues, and no reason is shown why these peace officers, Major <span class="SpellE">Dawa</span> and Captain Garcia, should falsely impute the crime to
the appellant herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, appellant
had a motive to commit the crime, since it was shown that the deceased <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> had mauled the appellant herein a few months before
the shooting, and for which <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> was charged by the
accused with the crime of physical injuries in the Justice of the Peace Court
of <span class="SpellE">Kawit</span>, in Criminal Case No. 235 of that
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>
was ultimately acquitted would in the normal course of events, all the more
enhance appellant's animosity against the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, appellant denied that he was identified by the
deceased at the hospital, and likewise contradicted harboring any grudge
against the late <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court, however, refused to accord
credence to his manifestly interested denials, as against those of the peace
officers, and We see no reversible error in such estimate of the credibi­lity
of the opposing testimonies.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant also urges that the testimony of expert
Garcia should be discounted, arguing that Garcia was not the one who made the
paraffin casts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This pretense is,
however, destroyed by appellant's own attempts to explain the powder traces
appearing in the casts, by his uncorroborated explanation that he had been
handling matches and lighting rockets (<span class="SpellE">Kuitis</span>) prior
to the examination, which in itself is an implied admission that the paraffin
casts examined by the chemist were those of appellant's hands.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with herein appellant that the court below erred in
holding the transcription of <span class="SpellE">Lacson's</span> declarations in
the Hospital, written down by Major <span class="SpellE">Dawa</span> and <span class="SpellE">thumbmarked</span> by the victim (Exhibit "D"), to be
admissible as a dying declaration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not
only was there a long in­terval (ten months and twelve days) between its
execution on 24 July 1956 and <span class="SpellE">declarant's</span> death on 5
June 1957, but also the text of the declaration itself shows that the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span> himself was in doubt as to whether he would die
or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main text of Exhibit
"D" is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span>
Dominguez Body Guard of <span class="SpellE">Elano</span> <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span>
We had a case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was defeated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't know if I can make it I was shot at <span class="SpellE">Medicion</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
playing <span class="SpellE">madjong</span>. Pedro <span class="SpellE">Camerino</span>
saw him and <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Campana</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I want him apprehended and imprisoned.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is he the very person?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do you know his name?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He is <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span>
Dominguez.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How do you know him?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He was near me."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Note that the expression "I don't know if I can make
it", while evincing some doubt as to <span class="SpellE">declarant's</span>
recovery, fails to show that he believed him­self <u>in extremis</u>, "at
the point of death when every hope of recovery is extinct", which is the
sole basis for admitting this kind of declarations as an exception to the
hearsay rule.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The unreliability of the alleged dying declaration is further emphasized by the
statement therein that <span class="SpellE">declarant</span> was playing <u>mahjong,</u>
when the evidence of both defense and prosecution is overwhelming that the game
being played was <span class="SpellE"><u>monte</u></span>, cards and not mahjong
tiles having been found on the table by the PC investigator, Sergeant <span class="SpellE">Tamundong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
error, however, in admitting this Exhibit "D" does not warrant a
reversal of the conviction, there being on record other evidence, both direct
and circumstantial, previously discussed, adequate to establish appellant's
guilt beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's defense of alibi and the credibility of his witnesses
is urged in the eighth assignment of error of his brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The version is that the accused-appellant
was, at the time of the shooting, in the house of his "<span class="SpellE">ninong</span>",
<span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ilano</span>; <span class="SpellE">Ilano</span> and his family had gone to see movies, leaving the
accused to watch the house; when the <span class="SpellE">Ilano</span> family
returned at eleven o'clock in the evening, the accused went to his room at the
ground floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ilano</span>
read for sometime, then went up to sleep, telling accused Dominguez to do
likewise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moments later, <span class="SpellE">Ilano</span> heard the closing of the door downstairs and presumed
that Dominguez had gone to bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about
<st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning, PC
soldiers led by the then Provincial Commander arrived, and, after ex­plaining
their purpose, brought Dominguez away.</p>

<p class="BODY">Aside from the weakness of the defense of alibi, as repeatedly
held by this Court, appellant's version of his whereabouts has wide-open leaks
that discredit it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For <span class="SpellE">Ilano's</span> house was only about a kilometer away from the
scene of the crime; and there is no certainty that when <span class="SpellE">Ilano</span>
heard the closing of the door at the ground floor Dominguez was inside the
room, for the sound of a closing door is consistent with the possibility that
he had left the house thereafter to proceed to <span class="SpellE">Camerino's</span>
house.</p>

<p class="BODY">The same doubtfulness attends the testimonies of defense
witnesses Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Sañez</span> and Eduardo Santos to the
effect that they were present during the gambling game, had witnessed the
shooting but did not recog­nize the shooter because of the darkness but that
they were certain that it was not the accused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court below aptly remarked on his point, "if they could not
recognize the malefactor because of the darkness, how can they say also with
certitude, that it was not the accused?"</p>

<p class="BODY">In accordance with recent jurisprudence, starting with People vs.
<span class="SpellE">Pantoja</span>, L-18793, <st1:date year="1968" day="11" month="10">11 October 1968</st1:date>, 25 SCRA 468, the amount of
indemnification to the heirs of the deceased should be increased to P12,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>FOR THE FOREGOING REASONS</b>, the appealed de­cision is
hereby affirmed, with the sole modification that the indemnity to the heirs of
Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> be in the amount of P12,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against accused-appellant.</p>
