				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Amongst the candidates for Congressman for the second district of
<span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> in the November 1969 elections were peti­tioner
Rogelio O. <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> and respondent Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Sanga</span>, both of the Liberal Party.</p>

<p class="BODY">Factual background of the dispute is the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1969</st1:date>,
the Provincial Board of Canvassers of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
started the canvass of votes cast for the office of Congressman, second
district of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Canvass terminated on <st1:date year="1969" day="17" month="12">December
 17, 1969</st1:date>, except with respect to the returns from sixteen precincts
of San Luis, which were found to be "not authentic".<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Through
</span>a referral made on <st1:date year="1969" day="18" month="12">December
 18, 1969</st1:date>, the canvassing board elevated the matter to the
Commission on Elections (<span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 23, 1969, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span>
petitioned <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
for a review of the action taken by the canvassing board on <span style="">various returns:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>from all precincts in <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span>
and from some precincts in <span class="SpellE">Candaba</span>, Mexico, San
Fernando, San Luis, San Simon, and <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Tomas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He specifically questioned the returns from
Precincts 35-A and 36 of <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span> where his (<span class="SpellE">Tiglao's</span>) name and votes were said to have been
deliberately omitted from the returns.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Having heard both the referral and <span class="SpellE">Tiglao's</span>
petition, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, on <st1:date year="1969" day="27" month="12">December 27, 1969</st1:date>, directed the board to use the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> copies of the returns from the questioned sixteen
pre­cincts of San Luis, required petitioner to submit a bill of parti­culars on
the 76 disputed returns from <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span> allegedly
prepared at gunpoint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> also resolved the questions raised as to some
returns and directed further investigation as to others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hearing was continued on <st1:date year="1969" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1969</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1969</st1:date>,
however, petitioner moved to reconsider the December 27 resolution of <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Averment
was made that, although the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> copies of the
returns from sixteen precincts of San Luis appeared to be clean, they were pre­pared
at gunpoint - armed men had forced the inspectors to increase the votes of
another candidate, Federico <span class="SpellE">Taruc</span>, and reduce the
votes of <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> but leaving untouched the votes of <span class="SpellE">Sanga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was thus
prayed that the ballot boxes of said precincts be opened, the ballots therein
counted, and new returns <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> prepared.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1969</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> reconsidered its Decem­ber 27 resolution as
to Precincts 16, 20, 21 and 23 of San Luis, the reason being that petitioner
had presented affidavits with res­pect to said precincts tending to show that
the returns <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> were prepared at gunpoint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Sanga</span>
was ordered to answer said averment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> also decided that in Precinct 38, <span class="SpellE">Candaba</span>, where <span class="SpellE">Tiglao's</span> votes
were "6" in figure but "zero" in word, the latter should be
made to prevail without prejudice to a judicial recount if the result will be
affected thereby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the precincts of
<span class="SpellE">Apalit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> gave
petitioner until <st1:date year="1970" day="2" month="1">January 2, 1970</st1:date>
to file a bill of particulars with supporting affidavits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hearing was continued to <st1:date year="1970" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1970</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 2 and 5, 1970, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span>
filed his bill of particulars and supplemental bill of particulars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Supporting affidavits by members of the board
of inspectors, alleging that the returns were made at gunpoint, were presented
for 11 precincts of <span style="">San Luis, namely,
Precincts 3, 4, 8, 9, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 23.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to petitioner, these 11 precincts
involved about 2,000 votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the 76
precincts of <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span>, an affidavit of an OQC-CNEA rep­resentative
was submitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tiglao's</span>
averment in a general way is that the "[e]lection returns were prepared at
gun point."<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span>
further made observations on the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> copies of
the returns from <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span>, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the entries of votes therein were
different from those appearing in the provincial treasurer's copies; that the </span><span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> copies had <span class="SpellE">tamperings</span> and
erasures; and that the <span class="SpellE">Com­elec</span> copies, on the one
hand, and the provincial treasurer's copies, on the other, were prepared by two
different hands on two different occasions.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On January 8, 1970, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> resolved, in reference to the 11 contested
precincts of San Luis (Precincts 3, 4, 8, 9, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 23),
that it has no power to open the ballot boxes thereof, count the votes therein
and prepare new returns</span> <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> likewise
took the view that it would serve no purpose to decide the question of whether
or not the returns from those precincts were prepared at gunpoint. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>And this, because, <span style="">so <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> says, although it can exclude from
the canvass gun point returns as held in the second <span class="SpellE"><u>Pacis</u></span>
case,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> "[t]he cause for Petitioner would not
be benefited by such ruling for thereby the margin of respondent Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Sanga</span> over him would be in­creased because in said returns
Petitioner had appeared to have garnered more votes than respondent Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Sanga</span>."<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> also ruled that no evidence there is to support the
claim that the 76 election returns from <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span> were
made at the point of a gun.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1970" day="9" month="1"><span style="">January
 9, 1970</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> declared that as to the returns from <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span>, there is no necessity to make a comparison between
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> copies and the provincial treasurer's
copies because the latter have been found by the canvassing board to be
authentic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
also ruled that all copies of the return from Precinct 8, San Luis, were
tampered but that, however, the tally sheet retrieved from the ballot box was
found clean wherein <span class="SpellE">Sanga</span> obtained "1" and <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> "5". <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
confirmed the action of the canvassing board - which read the same number of
votes for the two candidates - with prejudice to a judicial recount if the
result will be affected.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1970" day="26" month="1"><span style="">January
 26, 1970</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, resolving the remaining issues, found, <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that the returns for some precincts of <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span> were clean and regular on their faces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As for Precincts 35-A and 36, <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> noted the
omission of <span class="SpellE">Tiglao's</span> name in the returns <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> due to honest mistake, but that judicial cor</span>rection
which is the proper remedy can no longer be availed of because of the testimony
of the chairmen and poll clerks of said precincts that they could not remember
whether <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> actually received votes in said
precincts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to Precinct 6,
San Simon, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> gave 75 votes to respondent <span class="SpellE">Sanga</span> because of the testimony of the poll clerk that the
superimposition of "75" over "0" <span style="">opposite <span class="SpellE">Sanga's</span> name was made by the
chairman of the board of inspectors but </span>was <span style="">not initialed by him due to oversight.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> thus ordered the provincial board of
canvassers to reconvene </span>and <span class="SpellE"><span style="">recanvass</span></span><span style=""> the
votes </span>in <span style="">accordance with its
resolutions </span>and "to <span style="">proclaim
the presumptive winner for Member </span>of the House of Representatives <span style="">for the 2nd District of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
at </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="17"><span style="">5:00

 January 30, 1970</span></st1:date><span style=""> unless
restrained by </span>the <span style="">Supreme </span>Court."</p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">would appear, based on
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> resolutions, that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> would receive 13,794 votes as against respondent <span class="SpellE">Sanga's</span> 14, 041 votes, a difference of 247 </span>votes in <span style="">favor of </span>the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On January 30, 1970, petitioner
<span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> came to this Court on appeal by way of
certiorari asking for the following <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) upon petitioner's </span>averment that
the returns <span style="">from Precincts 3, 4, 8, 9,
15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 23 of San Luis, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, in­volving<span style="">&nbsp; </span>about 2,000 votes, were prepared at gunpoint,
to direct <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> to order under its supervision the
boards of inspectors of said precincts to reconvene, open the ballot boxes of
these pre­cincts in the presence of all parties concerned, count and tally </span>the
votes <span style="">and, on the basis thereof,
prepare authentic returns; (2) </span>to <span style="">direct
a comparison amongst the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> copies, the
provincial treasurer's copies, and the ballot box copies of the election
returns from all the 76 precincts of <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, to determine </span>whether <span style="">or not the entries thereon were made by one
hand or two hands; (3) to reject the election return from Precinct 6 of San
Simon, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, for being tampered and
correspondingly deduct seventy-five (75) votes credited to respondent <span class="SpellE">Sanga</span> on the basis thereof; (4) upon the averment that
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tiglao's</span> name and corresponding votes were
omitted from the returns a Precincts 35-A and 36 of <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span>,
to order <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> to </span>recount the votes cast
therein for petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> <span style="">and complete the returns; and (5) pending the result </span>of the <span style="">petitions for judicial recount and for
correction of returns for some precincts, to direct that no proclamation be
made of any candidate for Congressman-elect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We stopped the
proclamation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But the facts do not end
here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, before petitioner came to
this Court, or more precisely, on </span><st1:date year="1970" day="27" month="1"><span style="">January 27, 1970</span></st1:date><span style="">, petitions for judicial correction of
election returns under Section 154 of the Revised Election Code</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> were brought by the corresponding boards of
election inspectors in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
(Election Cases 3653, 3654, 3655, 3656, 3657, 3658 and 3659).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was there uniformly alleged that after the
close of the polls on election day and the inspectors were about to prepare the
returns, a group of fully armed men entered their res­pective polling places,
fired shots in the air and people scampered for safety; that in the course of
the confusion and commotion, the inspectors made mistakes in crediting <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> with less number of votes,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1970" day="28" month="1"><span style="">January
 28, 1970</span></st1:date><span style="">, the <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> court authorized the correction of the election
returns with the result that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span>
received an additional number of votes - 336 votes in all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">However, on </span><st1:date year="1970" day="29" month="1"><span style="">January
 29, 1970</span></st1:date><span style="">, respondent
<span class="SpellE">Sanga</span> filed </span>with <span style="">the <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> court a petition for
intervention and alternative motion for reconsideration asking the court to
reconsider its previous deci­sion of January 28.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day, January 29, the <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> court modified its order setting aside its January
28 decision insofar as Precincts 15, 16, 18, 20 and 21 are concerned because,
so the court said, It had no jurisdiction thereon since <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
had already acted on these precincts. However, the court reaffirmed its action
in connection with Precincts 9 and 19 on the given ground that <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> did not pass any resolution over said precincts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1970" day="4" month="2"><span style="">February
 4, 1970</span></st1:date><span style="">,
petitioners, in the cases for judicial correction, asked the <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> court to reconsider its January 29 order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was there brought out that a petition for
correction is perfectly compatible with a previous finding by <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> that the returns sought to be corrected are
authentic and/or clear returns.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1970" day="7" month="2"><span style="">February
 7, 1970</span></st1:date><span style="">, the <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> court ruled that the foregoing motion for
reconsideration was meritorious and the inspectors were authorized to correct
the returns from the dif­ferent precincts concerned (Precincts 9, 21, 20, 19,
16 and 15) except as to Precinct 18 covered by Election Case 3658.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this, because, according to the court, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> had already definitely ruled that in Precinct 18
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> should be credited with 36 votes
instead of zero.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thus it is, that as it
now develops, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> would be credited
with 292 additional votes in the following </span>manner:</p>

<span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It must be also stated
here that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> filed, on January 16,
1970, a petition for judicial recount in the <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>

<p class="BODY">1. As prayed for by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span>,
proclamation really cannot be had under the circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are still questions pending before the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> involving the
election returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, there is
the petition to recount the votes in Precinct 38, <span class="SpellE">Candaba</span>,
and Precincts 8 and 18, San Luis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
the <st1:date year="1970" day="7" month="2">February 7, 1970</st1:date> order
of the <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> court authorizing the correction of
returns from Precincts 9, 21, 20, 19, 16 and 15, San Luis, is the subject of a
motion for reconsidera­tion by respondent <span class="SpellE">Sanga</span>.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We believe it to be the
duty of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> to
act on this pending motion promptly to the end that canvass may be completed
without delay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The remedy as to the
remaining precincts (Precincts 3 and 4) </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">San Luis may not be
had in <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because, following the course of action in the six precincts just
mentioned (Precincts 9, 21, 20, 19, 16 </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">15), their
respective boards of inspectors should have petitioned the court for correction
of the returns.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We next address ourselves
to petitioner's averment that <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> should have
ordered a comparison between the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> copies and
the provincial treasurer's copies of the returns from the 76 precincts of <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span> to prove that the returns were made by different
hands on different occasions.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is not much to this point.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No need there is to require <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> to make a
comparison between different copies if the purpose is to ascertain whether said
copies were prepared by different hands.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The canvassing board has found the provin­cial treasurer's copies to be
authentic, clean and regular on their face.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner himself concedes that the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
copies were tampered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No more logical
deduction there could be than that what should be used in the canvass are the
provincial treas­urer's <span class="SpellE">untampered</span> copies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We discern no error here on the part of <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We now take up the
question raised as to Precinct 6, San Simon.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There, it will be recalled that all copies of the returns bear a superimposition
as to the votes of respondent <span class="SpellE">Sanga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The figures "75" were clearly
written over the figure "0".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So it is, that instead of <span class="SpellE">Sanga</span> appearing to
have received no vote in said precinct, he is now credited with 7 5 votes in the
return <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The tally sheet retrieved from the ballot box is no help because it is
not now before us, aside from the fact that averment is made that it is
unsigned.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is testimony before
<span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> that it was the chairman of the board of
inspectors who wrote in the 75 votes but who forgot to initial the change.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It </span>was <span style="">because of this that <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> ruled that such
change was not a tampering but simply a correction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus did <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
give <span class="SpellE">Sanga</span> the 75 votes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This brings to mind the
case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Balindong</u></span> <u>vs</u>. <u>Commission</u>
on <u>Elections</u>, L-29610, March 28, 1969, 27 SCRA 567, 584, 585.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The following pertinent
passages therein are significant:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Even conceding that the alteration of '13' to '8' was done by
the election inspectors, yet such act was unauthorized by, and contrary to, the
pro­visions of Section 154 of the election code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ins­pectors could not plead ignorance to
this, on the assumption that they really discovered the 'mis­take'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such is a <span class="SpellE">strategem</span>
we are not prepared to legitimize.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For,
the dispiriting lesson in past elections is that election returns are tampered
to favor a candidate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<div align="center"><blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote></div>

<blockquote>Election returns should be maintained inviolate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once the return is made and the cer­tificates
of votes of candidates are issued, no one, not even the inspectors themselves,
may make any change without authority.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We should not place at the whim of the inspectors, or any person for
that matter, the fortunes of the candidates for a given position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, the can­didates' fate depends in a
great measure upon the election return preserved and unsullied, and unspoiled
by hands of man. Tampering, falsification spoliation <span style="">of returns </span>or making spurious returns must have to be
discouraged."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Hewing to the line drawn
by <span class="SpellE"><u>Balindong</u></span>, we cannot give our imprimatur to
<span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> view.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The correction having been made without the positive authority of the
other members of the board and such correction not having been </span>initialed
<span style="">by them, the original entry for <span class="SpellE">Sanga</span> may not be considered as altered. </span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The foregoing thus
funnels us down to the conclusion that as to Precinct 6, San Simon, respondent <span class="SpellE">Sanga</span> should not be favored with 75 votes. The return for
him should remain as it originally was - zero.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">4. Let us turn our attention to Precincts 35-A and 36, <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span>. Concededly, the name of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> does not appear on the face of the returns for these
precincts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span>
view is that this could be a proper case for judicial correction, but that such
remedy is no longer availing because the members of the board of inspectors, in
the words of <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, "could not remember
whether petitioner received any votes" in said pre­cincts.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It would seem to us that
the fact that the boards of ins­pectors of said precincts forgot to write the
name of candidate <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> on the returns makes the
same incomplete.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is our belief that
they have not done their duty under the law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Section 150 of the Revised Election Code specifically states that
"[<span class="SpellE">i</span>]<span class="SpellE">mmediately</span> after
the count, the board of inspectors shall make, <u>complete</u> and sign a
written statement thereof in quadrupli­cate."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Because of the incompleteness of the
returns, no complete canvass of the votes can be had.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A precept that has by now taken roots is that
an incomplete canvass of votes is illegal and cannot be the basis of a subsequent
proclamation.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The foregoing lead us to
the conclusion that under the broad powers of <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
which should be exer</span>c<span style="">ised with
the end in view of insuring free, orderly and honest elections,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> should
have ordered the boards of inspectors of Precincts 35-A and 36, <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span>, to open the ballot boxes, count the votes for
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span>, if any, and make new returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This procedure has been clearly outlined by
this Court in <span class="SpellE"><u>Mutuc</u></span> <u>vs</u>. <u>Commission</u>
<u>on</u> <u>Elections</u>, <u>supra</u>, where we said that "<span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> should direct the opening of the ballot box x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> for the purpose of retrieving
the copy of the election return deposited therein so that it may be used in
canvassing anew the votes cast, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> and, should it be found that the ballot box copy is like­wise
blank or incomplete, the Commission should order a count of the ballots, giving
notice, for this purpose, to all the candidates."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
