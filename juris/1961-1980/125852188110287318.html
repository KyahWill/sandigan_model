<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner Chung Te Interposed 
this appeal from the decision of the Director of Patents giving due course to 
the application of respondent Ng Kian Giab for registration of the trademark 
"Marca Piña" and representation thereof, and rejecting his own application for 
registration of the same trademark and a similar 
representation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner filed his application 
on </span><st1:date month="11" day="25" year="1958"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 25, 
1958</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
alleging therein that since </span><st1:date month="1" day="8" year="1951"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 8, 
1951</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> he 
had been using the trademark on undershirts (de 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">hilo</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">), T-shirts, and baby dresses. 
Because of the confusing similarity between said trademark and that applied for 
on July 16, 1957 by Ng Kian Giab, an interference was declared as existing 
between the two applications.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1style3"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[1]</span></sup></span> Ng Kian Giab stated in his 
application that he had been using the trademark on undershirts since December 
6, 1955. At the hearing both parties presented testimonial as well as 
documentary evidence to prove their respective claims of priority of adoption 
and use. Respondent Director of Patents, however, declared that neither of them 
"satisfactorily adduced definite and conclusive proof of their asserted dates of 
first use of the trademark “Marca Piña"; and relying on the rule that "<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">in inter partes cases</span></em>, when neither of 
the parties have (has) satisfactorily proven the date of first use alleged in 
their applications, such date shall be confined to the filing date of the said 
application,"<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1style3"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[2]</span></sup></span> granted the application of 
senior party applicant Ng Kian Giab. Junior party applicant Chung Te moved for 
reconsideration of the decision, but the Director declined to reconsider, hence 
this appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Chung Te avers that respondent 
Director erred (1) in not giving due weight to his documentary evidence which 
tends to prove that he has been using the trademark since 1951; (2) in not 
finding that respondent Ng Kian Giab had admitted he first used the trademark 
only in 1955; (3) in disregarding petitioner's prior application No. 5544, and 
thus finding that respondent had filed his application earlier than petitioner; 
and (4) In declaring respondent as the prior user when there is no substantial 
evidence in support thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The rule is that the findings of 
fact by the Director of Patents are conclusive on the Supreme Court provided 
they are supported by substantial evidence.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1style3"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[3]</span></sup></span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Respondent Director disregarded 
all the evidence submitted by both parties and relied exclusively on the filing 
dates of the applications in reaching his conclusion as to the dates of first 
use by the senior party applicant and the junior party applicant, respectively. 
Even if the evidence for both parties were entirely unreliable - and we do not 
find it so - we cannot completely disregard the fact that on March 13, 1957 an 
application for the registration of the same trademark "MARCA PIÑA and 
Representation" was filed by Chung Te (Application No. 5544), although it was 
subsequently considered abandoned by reason of his failure to answer<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1style3"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[4]</span></sup></span> the communication of the 
Principal Trademark Examiner dated September 25, 1957.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1style3"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[5]</span></sup></span> To be sure, for the purpose 
of determining who was the junior party applicant in the <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1style3"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[6]</span></sup></span> interference the filing 
date of said abandoned application may not properly be considered. But in the 
peculiar situation obtaining in this case, where the testimonial evidence for 
both parties has been entirely disregarded, and reliance is placed solely on the 
filing dates of the applications as proof of the respective dates of first use, 
then the abandoned application filed by the <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">junior party applicant</span></em> becomes cogent 
evidence to show that he first used the trademark as of the date of its 
filing.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1style3"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[7]</span></sup></span> Chung Te's petition in said 
abandoned case was duly submitted in evidence and forms part of the record. 
(Exhibits X, X-1, to X-3).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The fact, however, is that there 
is other substantial evidence adduced by petitioner tending to show that he 
first used the trademark in question as early as February 1952. For a long time 
petitioner was the purchasing agent for his father-in-law, who owned the Liong 
Bee Shirt Factory. Afterwards he decided to go into the same business for 
himself. His father-in-law, who theretofore had been using the trademark "Marca 
Piña," transferred it to him. In January 1951 he started laying the groundwork 
for his own factory. Jose Lim,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1style3"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[8]</span></sup></span> whom he had engaged the 
previous year, helped him with the preliminary paper work, registered the 
factory's first books of accounts with the Bureau of Internal Revenue, and when 
the business was officially launched in 1952, continued therein as bookkeeper. 
In January 1951 petitioner started producing undershirts labeled "Marca Piña". 
However, he sold them under the firm name of his father-in-law because he had 
yet no license in his own name.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Julieta Francisco testified that 
she started working with petitioner in 1951. Her job was to sew skippers and 
"sandos" and to affix the trademark "Marca Piña" (Exhibit B-1) and "Pineapple" 
on the nape of the neck of each finished undershirt. The trademark, (Exhibit 
B-2), she added, as well as the legend indicating the size of the undershirt 
(Exhibit B-3) were pressed on the lower portion of the garment (Exhibits E and 
E-1). The undershirts were then placed inside cellophane wrappers (Exhibit C), 
put together in half dozens by means of paper labels (Exhibits F and F-1), and 
then placed in box containers (Exhibit D). All these exhibits (Exhibits C, F, 
F-1 and D) bear the trademark in question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="11" day="20" year="1951"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 20, 
1951</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> the 
factory became a member of the Philippine Chinese Underwear Manufacturers 
Association (certificate of membership, Exhibit N). According to Juanito Vitug, 
secretary of the association, before a firm was admitted as member it was 
required to inform the association of the trademark it was using to Identify its 
products; and he found that among the files of the association the sample labels 
"Marca Piña" (Exhibit O) submitted by petitioner when he applied for membership 
were included.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="1" day="31" year="1952"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 31, 
1952</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> the 
City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> granted petitioner a permit to 
operate a shirt factory (Exhibit T). On </span><st1:date month="2" day="1" year="1952"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 1, 
1952</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> he 
paid the corresponding business taxes (Exhibits U, U-1 to U-3). On February 5, 
1952 the Bureau of Commerce issued to him a certificate of registration as 
private merchant (Exhibit V) and two days later a certificate of registration of 
the business name "Liong Sun Shirt Factory" (Exhibit W). It appears from his 
application that he had commenced business on </span><st1:date month="2" day="1" year="1952"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 1, 
1952</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">He obtained the labels he was 
using from the Asiatic Press. On </span><st1:date month="2" day="7" year="1952"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 7, 
1952</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> he 
bought 5000 pieces of "Marca Piña" box labels (Exhibit Q). On </span><st1:date month="12" day="29" year="1952"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 29, 
1952</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> he 
purchased 100,000 "Marca Piña" shirt labels and 10,000 "Marca Piña" cover labels 
(Exhibit Q-1). And on </span><st1:date month="7" day="21" year="1954"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 21, 
1954</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> he 
bought 100,000 sheets of "Pineapple Brand" shirt labels (Exhibit Q-2). The box 
labels were delivered by him to the Avenue Paper Box Factory, which used them in 
covering the cardboard boxes (a sample is Exhibit D) which petitioner had 
ordered from it (Exhibit S, dated March 17, 1952; Exhibits S-1 to S-7). 
Petitioner also ordered boxes from the De Luxe Cardboard Box Factory (Exhibits 
AA and AA-1). Co In, manager of the Asiatic Printing Press, affirmed that 
petitioner had purchased "Marca Piña” labels from him, while Tan Dy, manager of 
the Avenue Paper Box Factory, attested that he used the "Marca Piña" box covers 
in covering the boxes which petitioner had ordered from him.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1style3"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[9]</span></sup></span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="11" day="19" year="1952"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 19, 
1952</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
petitioner ordered from the Victory Printing Company 500 calendars (Exhibit Z), 
one of which (Exhibit Z-1) was submitted in evidence. Written thereon are the 
words: "LIONG SUN Shirt Factory, Manufacturer of the well known brand 'Pineapple 
and Piña” the best cotton and De Hilo Skippers."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner first sold skippers 
under his firm name "Liong Sun Shirt Factory" on </span><st1:date month="2" day="1" year="1952"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 1, 
1952</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> to 
Tay Liong Kian (Receipt No. 1, Exhibit L) and Yap Suy Yu (Receipt No. 2, Exhibit 
R). Both of these customers regularly bought skippers and undershirts by the 
dozens as shown by receipts dated from that time up to </span><st1:date month="7" day="14" year="1952"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 14, 
1952</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
(Exhibits L-1 to L-9, R-1 to R-10). Although the receipts do not state that the 
merchandise purchased bore the trademark "Marca Piña”, both customers testified 
that what they bought had that label. At the time of the hearing Tay Liong 
Kian<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1style3"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[10]</span></sup></span> had a store in Yangco 
Market. On the otherhand, at the time he bought undershirts, Yap Suy Yu had a 
store at Tabora Market.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">According to the statement 
(Exhibit G-1) attached to the application (Exhibit G) of respondent Ng Klan Giab 
he first used the trademark on </span><st1:date month="12" day="6" year="1955"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 6, 
1955</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. At 
the hearing he sought to prove that his family had been using it since 1946. 
Where an applicant for registration of a trademark states under oath the date of 
his earliest use, and later on he wishes to carry back his first date of use to 
an earlier date he then takes on the greater burden of presenting "clear and 
convincing evidence" of adoption and use as of that earlier date.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1style3"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[11]</span></sup></span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">To prove such earlier date 
respondent relies purely on testimonial evidence consisting of the declarations 
of his father Ng Kian Soy, his brother Ng Kian Kee, their supposed seamstress 
Genoveva Santos, and two customers Diego Magpantay and Cleto Sarmiento. The 
substance of their testimony is as follows: since 1946 Ng Kian Soy operated a 
general merchandise store, the Sin Kian Ning Store, <sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</span> </sup>in Batangas, 
Batangas, where he sold polo shirts bearing the trademark. After the fire in 
1953 the family rebuilt their store and expanded the business by including the 
undershirts with the same trademark. The name of the store was changed to 
Hongkong bazaar. From 1946 to 1955 they merely bought ready made polo shirts and 
undershirts to each of which they then sewed the label “Marca Piña” before 
resale to the public. In 1955 the father transferred the business to Ng Kian 
Kee, who put up a factory the Hongkong T-Shirt Manufacturer and started 
producing undershirts bearing the trademark. When he decided to continue his 
studies in 1957, he, in turn, transferred the business to the respondent. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Such testimonial evidence falls 
short of the kind of proof required of respondent. It is doubtful that 
respondent’s would pay Genoveva Santos as high as P0.02 per label (which did not 
even bear his name) on polo shirts which he had purchased ready-made, and which 
he could very well have sold without any label. 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Santos</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> testified that the stamped label 
used was only “Marca Pinña” without any representation or name of the owner 
(Exhibit 1-D), while Magpantay said there was representation of a pineapple on 
the labels used by respondent’s family. To explain the discrepancy, Sarmiento, 
who testified later, declared that there three kinds of labels used (Exhibits 
1-A, 1-B and 1-C), two of which bore the representation of of a pineapple, and 
these were attached to goods of better quality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">While Ng Kian Kee declared that 
they rebuilt their store several months after the fire in 1953, Sarmiento, who 
was supposed to be a regular customer, said they had no store in 1954, and they 
resumed selling garments only in 1955. </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Santos</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> declared that from 1954 up to 
the time the business moved to </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> (in 1958) her job was to sew 
labels on ready made polo shirts. In answer to a leading question, she added 
“undershirts” . But in 1955 the factory was already in operation and producing 
undershirts to which labels were attached in the process of production, 
rendering her services unnecessary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The documentary evidence show 
clearly that respondent’s use began only in 1955. The business tax receipt in 
the name of Ng Kian Kee is dated </span><st1:date month="10" day="18" year="1955"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 18, 
1955</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
(Exhibit 6). In his application for original registration of the business name 
“Hongkong T-Shirt Manufacturer,” Ng Kian Kee stated that his business<span style="">&nbsp; </span>was that of the Manufacturing T-shirts, and 
that as of that date, October 25, 1955, the same was not yet in operation. It 
seems that it actually started operation on </span><st1:date month="12" day="3" year="1955"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 3, 
1955</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
date of its Receipt No. 1 (Exhibit 4-A). It sold its first half dozen 
undershirts bearing the trademark on </span><st1:date month="12" day="5" year="1955"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 5, 
1955</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
(Receipt No. 7, Exhibit 4-G). Noteworthy is the fact that in his statement 
attached to the application respondent alleged that he first used the trademark 
“on or about </span><st1:date month="12" day="6" year="1955"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 6, 
1955</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">,” 
which statement appears to be truth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">From all the foregoing we are 
convinced that petitioner has established prior use and adoption of the 
questioned trademark, for which reason he and not respondent Ng Giab is the one 
entitled to registration thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE, the decision of the 
Director of Patents is reversed. Petitioner is adjudged prior user of the 
trademark MARCA PIÑA and representation thereof, and its registration in his 
name is hereby ordered; and the resolution of this Court dated </span><st1:date month="12" day="24" year="1965"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 24, 
1965</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
enjoining petitioner to comply with the decision appealed from is set aside.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><sup><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; color: red; font-family: Verdana;">[5]</span></sup><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> In his communication, the 
Principal Trademark Examiner stated that examination ex parte of the application 
disclosed the following defects: (1) the word “Marca” being commonly used in the 
trade to indicate mark, must be duly disclaimed in the “Statement”; (2) the 
application would be declared in interference with the application of Ng Kian 
Giab (Serial No. 4765) filed on July 16, 1957; and (3) for verification purposes 
of trademark use, the applicant or his duly authorized representatives was 
required to submit a simple of the goods bearing “Marca Piña and Representation” 
within ten days from receipt of the communication.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

junior party and will be regarded as having the burden of proof. (Rule 184,

the abandoned claim is not relied on as a prior publication, it is competent and 
cogent evidence to determine the nature and date of the invention which the 
inventor claims to have embodied in working form. Smith <i>vs</i>. Hall, 81 L.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><sup><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; color: red; font-family: Verdana;">[8]</span></sup><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> Actually petitioner engaged the 
services of Lim and his nephew Jose Tantioco, although he paid the salary of 
only one employee. The two alternated in keeping the books of the 
factory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><sup><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; color: red; font-family: Verdana;">[9]</span></sup><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> The Director found that the mere 
purchase of labels and boxes, without more, cannot be regarded as trademark use. 
Such purchase of labels together with proof of sale of garments produced by 
petitioner, reasonably gives rise to the presumption of the use of the labels on 
the products sold.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><sup><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; color: red; font-family: Verdana;">[10]</span></sup><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> Respondent Director did not 
believe this witness on the ground that since he was only 23 years old at the 
time he testified on August 7, 1962, then he was only 10 years old in 1949 when 
he first became a merchant, and he was only 13 years old in 1952 when he started 
purchasing undershirts from petitioner, which facts naturally render his 
testimony suspect. It is apparent, however, that the stenographer who took down 
his testimony had misheard his age when he stated it. He was 33 years old when 
he testified. He could not have been less than 18 years old when he made the 
purchases in 1952, because some of the receipts show that he already a residence 
certificate then. The same thing happened with respect to Julieta Francisco, 
who, according to the stenographic notes was only 24 years old when she 
testified on </span><st1:date month="6" day="16" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 16, 
1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
thus leading respondent<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ng Kian Giab to 
brand her testimony as unworthy of credence because she was only 14 years old 
when she first started working for petitioner in 1951. During the course of her 
testimony she, however, clearly stated that she was then almost 34 years 
old.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

his earliest use and then amends his oath and by proof attempts to show an 
earlier date, he is then under a heavy burden, and his proof must be “clear and

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Mr. McKay, who had been a member 
of the firm for many years, verified the application for registration No. 168, 
074, which was filed in the Patent Office on </span><st1:date month="1" day="24" year="1922"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 24, 
1922</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, by 
Hall, Hartwell &amp; Co., and in the application stated that the mark had been 
used since about </span><st1:date month="10" day="1" year="1921"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 1, 
1921</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. It 
will be seen that this application was made within a few months of the date set 
out in the application as the first date of use, and was made by a member of the 
firm who certainly should have knowledge of the date of first use far greater 
than any of the witnesses produced. When such an affidavit has been made at 
about the time of the event, a greater burden of proof should be, and is 
required in order to carry the date of use back to a prior date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Elder Mfg. Co vs. International Shoe Co. 194

Kian Soy was granted a municipal license for his general merchandise store 
(Exhibit 16), which certificate does not in any way prove use of the trademark 
as of the time. Note also that at the hearingNg Kian Soy emphasized that he sold 
only polo shirts in his store. <o:p></o:p></span></p></div></div>
