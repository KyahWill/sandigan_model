				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Plaintiff-appellant R. F. Navarro (doing business under the firm name of R. 
F. Navarro &amp; Company) appeals directly to us from the order of the Court of 
First Instance of Rizal (in Civil Case No. 1733-P) dismissing his complaint for 
lack of cause of action, on the assertion that only questions of law are 
involved herein.
<p>The material and pertinent allegations of plaintiff's complaint are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"2. On September 19th, 1956, defendant formally offered to plaintiff the sale 
of from 15,000 to 20,000 metric tons of molasses, 185-degrees gravity, 60% sugar 
by invert, at P50.00 per metric ton, ex-warehouse San Carlos and Bais, Negros 
Occidental, giving him up to noon of September 24th, 1956 within which to accept 
the offer, with the admonition that upon its failure to hear from him by them, 
the defendant shall feel free to negotiate the sale with other possible 
buyers;<br>"3. On September 21st, 1956, answering an inquiry made by the 
plaintiff, the defendant advised the latter that the cost of pumping the 
molasses offered by it for sale is P1.20 per metric ton in San Carlos district 
and P3.00 per metric ton in Bais district and that the date of delivery thereof 
shall start from February on to March, April and May, 1957 as milling in the 
districts indicated (San Carlos and Bais) starts during the month of 
January;<br>"4. Promptly at five minutes hefore noon of September 24th, 1956, 
plaintiff formally accepted the offer of sale tendered by the defendant by 
informing the latter in writing that he binds himself to purchase from it the 
proferred 20,000 metric tons of molasses in question for P50.00 per metric ton, 
and the day after (September 25th, 1956) plaintiff, upon the request of 
defendant, made the following1 clarifications of his agreement to purchase the 
said molasses,—(1) 20,000 metric tons of Philippine molasses, 185-degrees 
specific gravity, 60% sugar by invert; (2) Price—P50.00 Philippine currency, per 
metric ton ex-warehouse; (3) shipments to be in quantities of 3,000 or more 
metric tons every each shipment during the months of February, March, April and 
May until the whole amount has been completely shipped; and (4) payment shall be 
by irrevocable divisible and assignable domestic letter of credit to be opened 
in a local bank in defendant's favor;<br>"5. On the same day plaintiff made the 
foregoing clarifications of his acceptance of the sale, the defendant hurriedly 
advised plaintiff that it committed a typographical error in indicating the 
specific gravity of the molasses at 185-degrees which should be only 85-degrees, 
the latter being the highest for molasses at 60% sugar by invert, and requesting 
plaintiff that the 'specific gravity' be amended accordingly, which correction 
and amendment plaintiff readily agreed to and accepted;<br>"6. That neither on 
September 24th, 1056 when plaintiff exercised his option nor on September 25th 
when he requested plaintiff to clarify his acceptance to indicate the manner of 
payment, nor upon the submittal of the clarification which was presented by 
plaintiff himself and received by the defendant, thru its President, Amado 
Garcia, and for three days there-after, there was no single word, effort or hint 
that the defendant's offer, accepted by the plaintiff, was qualified in any way 
whatsoever;<br>"7. That on September 24th, 1956, relying upon the consummation 
and perfection of the purchase and sale of 20,000 metric tons of molasses in 
question as indicated above, plaintiff, through his business associate here in 
Manila (J.D. Quirino) continued negotiations for the resale of said molasses to 
foreign buyers of said, commodity by immediately communicating the availabity of 
said commodity through letters, cablegrams and long-distance calls to the 
latter's business contacts in U.S.A., and Japan, and utimately disposing and 
reselling the said molasses for forward deliveries in accordance with 
plaintiff's agreement with the defendant;<br>"8. On September 28th, 1956, three 
days after an agreement had been consummated on the price, quantity and quality 
of said molasses and the manner of payment thsreof, the defendant, belatedly and 
abruptly adviced plaintiff of its desire to add certain additional conditions to 
be incorporated in the formal contract of purchase and sale then under 
preparation by it for signature,—which were never even mentioned nor hinted at 
in its original offer or proposal, on the untenable pretext that they were 
'standard conditions' on all contracts for the sale of said commodity, the most 
onerous of which were,—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(<em>a</em>) That upon the signing of the contract of purchase and sale, 
plaintiff shall pay defendant in cash an amount equivalent to 50% of the 
purchase value of the molasses;<br>"(<em>b</em>) That to cover the remaining and 
unpaid balance of the purchase price, plaintiff shall open with the Philippine 
National Bank an irrevocable domestic letter of credit in favor of defendant; 
which shall be assignable, and divisible; and<br>"(<em>c</em>) That in 
negotiating the said letter of credit, plaintiff shall allow defendant 
immediately to withdraw from the same the corresponding amount representing 50% 
of the value of the molasses withdrawn from the central, upon presentation of 
the requisite certificate thereof (certainly a condition which, taken with 
(<em>a</em>) above, is most one-sided in favor only of the 
seller);</p></blockquote>
<p>"9. On October 2nd, 1956, plaintiff personally conferred with the defendant's 
manager, Amado G. Garcia, with a view of threshing out the difficulties 
necessarily evoked hy the foregoing conditions belatedly demanded by the 
defendant, but the latter remained adamant in its attitude and the day after 
(October 3rd, 1956), it peremptorily gave plaintiff up to noon again of October 
26th, 1956, within which to decide upon his acceptance of said additional 
conditions with the warning that if he failed to do so, it would feel to advise 
its planters concerned that they could negotiate their molasses with other 
parties:<br>"10. On October 5th, 1956, plaintiff, in a spirit of cooperation and 
in his desire to insure the success of his purchase of the molasses in question, 
reiterated to the defendant his readiness and willingness,—already imparted to 
it during their conference on October 2nd—to assist defendant in working to 
certain financing transactions with the bank whereby it may be possible to 
provide in the letter of credit to be opened in favor of the defendant authority 
to draw cash advances up to 50% of the contract value of the molasses, trader 
certain conditions, and alternatively, plaintiff expressed his willingness to 
satisfy defendant's desire to be paid in advance an amount equivalent to 50% of 
the purchase value of the molasses, but provided, that their original agreement 
of P50.00 per metric ton were to be converted into what is known as 'equal 
standard condition,' under which the purchase value would be only P32.00 per 
metric ton;<br>"11. On the very same day and evidently without even any attempt 
to consider the matter further, defendant simply and rudely turned down the 
foregoing friendly gesture of the plaintiff caused by the additional conditions 
demanded by the defendant in its letter of September 28, 1956 (indicated in par. 
7 above), and bluntly informed plaintiff that in view of his non-acceptance of 
said conditions it would not continue with the sale of the molasses in question 
to plaintiff and that it felt free to offer the same to any other interested 
buyer;"</p></blockquote>
<p>Claiming breach of contract, plaintiff prayed that judgment be rendered 
ordering defendant to comply with and perform its contractual obligations, 
pursuant to its agreement with plaintiff of September 19 and 24, 1956 and in 
case of failure to do so, to pay plaintiff any and all damages he may suffer by 
reason of such non-compliance, plus moral damages, and to pay plaintiff 
reasonable attorney's fees and actual costs of the litigation.</p>
<p>As heretofore stated, upon defendant's motion to dismiss on the ground that 
it (complaint) states no cause of action for the reason that "there is no 
binding contract between" plaintiff and defendant, under Article 1479 of the New 
Civil Code, the trial court dismissed the action in an order which in part 
reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">"ORDER</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp;*</p>
<p>"The defendant contends that the complaint states no cause of action because 
defendant's promise to. sell, although accepted by the plaintiff, is not 
supported by any consideration distinct from the price and, under Article 1479 
of the New Civil Code, is not binding. Article 1479 provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'A promise to buy and sell a determinate thing for a price certain is 
reciprocally demandable.<br>'An accepted unilateral promise to buy or sell, a 
determinate thing tor a price certain is binding upon the promissor if the 
promise is supported by a consideration distinct from the 
price.'</p></blockquote>
<p>"Although the existence of a lawful consideration or cause to support a 
contract is presumed, yet from the allegations of the herein complaint, it is 
apparent that the defendant's promise to sell is not supported by any 
consideration. In fact, the absence of any consideration of the option given to 
the plaintiff was admitted by plaintiff's counsel in his oral argument opposing 
the defendant's motion to dismiss. Plaintiff, however, contends that the option 
became binding on the defendant when plaintiff gave notice of its acceptance and 
that having been accepted within the period of the option, the offer can no 
longer be withdrawn and, in any event, such withdrawal is ineffective because 
there had already arisen an existing bilateral contract which can be 
enforced.<br>"The case of Southwestern Sugar &amp; Molasses Co. <em>vs</em>. 
Atlantic Gulf &amp; Pacific Co. 97 Phil., 249; (51 Off. Gaz. 3447) is 
practically on all fours with the case at bar. In said case, on March 24, 1953, 
defendant Atlantic Gulf &amp; Pacific Co. granted an option to plaintiff 
Southwestern Sugar &amp; Molasses Co. to buy its barge for P30,000.00 to be 
exercised within ninety days. On May 11, 1953, Atlantic Gulf wrote Southwestern 
Sugar that it was exercising its option and that it be notified as soon as the 
barge was available. On May 12, 1953, Atlantic Gulf replied that their 
understanding was that the 'offer of option' is to be cash transaction and to he 
effected at the time the barge was available. On June 25, 1953, Atlantic Gulf 
informed Southwestern Sugar that the barge could not be turned over to the 
latter On June 27, 1953, Southwestern Sugar instituted an action for specific 
performance in line with the accepted option, depositing with the Court the 
purchase price of P30,000.00. Atlantic Gulf, relying upon Article 1479 of the 
New Civil Code contended that the option was not valid because it was not 
supported by any consideration apart from the price. Southwestern Sugar 
contended the option became binding on Atlantic Gulf when plaintiff gave notice 
of its acceptance during the option period, citing as its authority Article 1324 
of the New Civil Code which provides that 'when the offeror has allowed the 
offeree a certain period to accept, the offer may be withdrawn at any time 
before acceptance by communicating such withdrawal except when the option is 
founded upon a consideration, as something paid or promised.' Upholding the 
contention of Atlantic Gulf and holding that the promise to sell was not valid 
because it was not supported by a consideration distinct from the price, the 
(Supreme) Court stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'There is no question that under Article 1479 of the New Civil Code "an 
option to sell" or a "promise to buy or to sell", as used in said article, to be 
valid must be "supported by a Consideration distinct from the price". This is 
clearly inferred from the context of said article that a unilateral promise to 
buy or to sell, even if accepted, is only binding if supported by a 
consideration. In other words, "an accepted unilateral promise" can only have a 
binding effect if supported by a consideration. Here, it is not disputed that 
the option is without consideration. It can, therefore, be withdrawn 
notwithstanding the acceptance made of it by appellee.'<br>'It is true that 
under Article 1324 of the New Civil Code, the general rule regarding offer and 
acceptance is that, when the offerer gives to the offeree a certain period to 
accept, "the offer may be withdrawn at any time before acceptance" except when 
the option is founded upon consideration, but this general provision must be 
interpreted as modified by the provision of Article 1470 above referred to," 
which applies to "a promise to buy and sell" <em>specifically</em>. As already 
stated, this rule reqwires that a promise to sell to be valid must be supported 
by a consideration distinct from the price.'</p></blockquote>
<p>"On the strength of the above ruling laid down in the above-cited case of 
Southwestern Sugar &amp; Molasses Co. <em>vs</em>. Atlantic Gulf &amp; Pacific 
Co., <em>supra</em>, the facts of which arc identical with those alleged in the 
present complaint, this Court rules that, since the herein defendant's promise 
to sell is not supported by any consideration distinct from the price, said 
promise is not valid and not enforceable. Plaintiff's complaint does not, hence, 
state a cause of action.<br>"While under the allegations of the present 
complaint, herein defendant may have assumed a clear obligation to sell its 
molasses to plaintiff at P50.00 per metric ton and, under the complaint, said 
defendant may have no justifiable reason not to proceed with the sale, yet, this 
Court cannot do otherwise than declare the option not binding and unenforceable 
in view of the clear provisions of the law on the matter. Thus, said the Supreme 
Court in the above mentioned case of Southwestern Sugar <em>vs</em>. Atlantic 
Gulf:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'While under the "offer of option" in question, appellant has assumed a clear 
obligation to sell its barge to appellee and the option has been exercised in 
accordance with its terms, and there appeairs to be no valid or justifiable 
reason for the appellant to withdraw its offer, this Court cannot adopt a 
different attitude because the law on the matter is clear. Our imperative duty 
is to apply it unless modified by Congress.'</p></blockquote>
<p>"WHEREFORE, the Court sustains, as it hereby sustains the defendant's motion 
to dismiss and hereby declares plaintiff's complaint dismissed, without 
costs.</p>
<p>"SO ORDERED."</p></blockquote>
<p>His motion for reconsideration having been denied, plaintiff interposed this 
appeal.</p>
<p>It is the contention of plaintiff-appellant that "the lower court erred in 
characterizing the transaction had between plaintiff and the defendant as an 
accepted unilateral promise to buy or to sell, and in deciding that as there was 
no consideration therefor, Article 1479, paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, and the 
ruling in Southwestern Sugar &amp; Molasses Co. <em>vs</em>. Atlantic Gulf &amp; 
Pacific Co., 51 Off. Gaz., 3447, are applicable thereto."</p>
<p>In support of his claim, appellant seeks in his brief to differentiate his 
case from that of Southwestern Sugar &amp; Molasses Company <em>vs</em>. 
Atlantic Gulf &amp; Pacific Company relied upon by the trial court by arguing 
that what was involved in the Atlantic Gulf case was a mere option, while here 
the transaction is a bilateral promise to sell and buy which requires no 
consideration distinct from the selling price.</p>
<p>This contention is not borne out by the facts alleged in the complaint. In 
the first place, as noted by the trial court in its order denying plaintiff's 
motion for reconsideration, plaintiff' himself, in paragraph 6 of his complaint, 
referred to the transaction as <em>an "option" which he exercised on September 
24, 1956</em>. Then again, in his memorandum in lieu of oral argument, he 
expressly <em>agreed that the offer made by defendant and described in paragraph 
2 of plaintiff's complaint is an option, a unilateral promise to sell</em>. (See 
page 4 of the memorandum.) And, undoubtedly, this is the offer, the option, the 
unilateral promise to sell that was accepted by plaintiff five minutes before 
the deadline—noon of September 24, 1956. (See first part of paragraph 4 of the 
complaint.) This acceptance, without consideration, did not create an 
enforceable obligation on the part of the defendant. The offer, as well as the 
acceptance, did not contemplate nor produce an immediately binding and 
enforceable contract of sale. Both lacked a most essential element—the manner of 
payment of the purchase price. In fact, it was only after the exercise of the 
option or acceptance of the unilateral promise to sell that the terms of payment 
were first discussed. This was in connection with the clarification of 
plaintiff's acceptance which was transmitted to defendant on September 25, 1956. 
(See last part of paragraph 6 of the complaint.) Plaintiff's offer of a domestic 
letter of credit was not accepted by defendant who insisted on a cash payment of 
50% of the purchase value, upon signing of a contract. (See paragraphs 8 and 9 
of the complaint.) Plaintiff, on the other hand, agreed to accede to this 
provided the price is reduced from P50.00 per metric ton to P32.00. Defendant 
reiected plaintiff's alternative counter-offer. In the circumstance, there was 
no complete meeting of the minds of the parties necessary for the perfection of 
a contract of sale.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> Consequently, 
appellee was justified in withdrawing its offer to sell the Molasses in 
question. (See Zayco <em>vs</em>. Serra, 44 Phil., 236; Montinola <em>vs</em>. 
Victorias Milling Co., et al., 54 Phil., 783, and Batangan <em>vs</em>. 
Cojuangco, 78 Phil., 431.)</p>
<p>In view of the conclusion we have reached, it would not be necessary to pass 
upon appellee's motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>Wherefore, finding no reversible error in the order appealed from, the same 
is hereby affirmed, with costs against the plaintiff-appellant. So 
ordered.</p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Paredes,</em> and 
<em>Dizon, JJ.,</em> concur.<br><em>Concepcion</em> and <em>Reyes, J.B.L., 
JJ.,</em> concur in the result. <br><br><br>
