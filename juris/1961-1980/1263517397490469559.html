				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review of the decision of the Court of Appeals
(In CA-G.R. Nos. 30064-R and 30065-R), raising as only issue the correctness of
the appellate court's reduction of a donation <span class="SpellE"><u>propter</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>nuptias</u></span>, for being <span class="SpellE">inofficious</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The established facts of this case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagua</span>
was the original registered owner of 3 parcels of land situated in <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, referred to
as Lot No. 998, with an area of 11,080 sq. m., more or less, and covered by O.
C. T. No. 362; Lot No. 6541, with an area of 808 sq. m., more or less, covered
by O. C. T. No. 6618; and Lot No. 5106, with an area of 3,303 sq. m., covered
by O. C. T. No. 8137.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime in 1917, <span class="SpellE">Lagua</span> and his wife <span class="SpellE">Alejandra</span> <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>, in <span style="">a </span>public
instrument, donated Lots 998 and 6541 to their son Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Lagua</span>, in consideration of the latter's marriage to <span class="SpellE">Bonifacia</span> Mateo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
marriage was celebrated on <st1:date year="1917" day="15" month="5">15 May 1917</st1:date>,
and thereafter, the couple took possession of the properties, but the
Certificate of Title remained in the donor's name.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1923, the son, Alejandro, died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His widow, <span class="SpellE">Bonifacia</span>
Mateo, and her infant daughter lived with her father-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagua</span>, who then
undertook the farming of the donated lots.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It seems that at the start, <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagua</span> was giving to <span class="SpellE">Bonifacia</span> the
owner's share of the harvest from the land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In 1926, however, <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> refused to deliver
the said share, thus prompting <span class="SpellE">Bonifacia</span> to resort to
the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, from where she obtained a judgment awarding to
her possession of the two lots, plus damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1941" day="31" month="7">31 July 1941</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagua</span> executed a
deed of sale of the same two parcels of land in favor of his younger son, <span class="SpellE">Gervasio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This sale
not­withstanding, <span class="SpellE">Bonifacia</span> Mateo was continuously
given the owner's share of the harvest until 1956, when it was altogether
stopped, It was only then that <span class="SpellE">Bonifacia</span> Mateo
learned of the sale of the lots to her brother-in-law, who had the sale in his
favor registered only on <st1:date year="1955" day="22" month="9">22 September
 1955</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence, TCT
Nos. 19152 and 19153 of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>
were issued to <span class="SpellE">Gervasio</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Bonifacia</span> Mateo and her daughter, <span class="SpellE">Anatalia</span>, assisted, by her husband, Luis <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>, went to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> (Civil Case No. T-339), seeking annulment of the
deed of sale in favor of <span class="SpellE">Ger­vasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagua</span> and for recovery of possession of the
properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1957" day="3" month="1">3 Jan­uary 1957</st1:date>, judgment was rendered in the case
--</p>

<blockquote>“- - - - - declaring the sale executed by <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lagua</span> in favor of the other defendants, <span class="SpellE">Gervasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagua</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sotera</span> <span class="SpellE">Casimero</span>, as null and void
and non-existent; ordering the Register of Deeds for the province of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, to cancel Transfer Certificates of Title Nos.
19152 and 19153; condemning the defendants to pay jointly and severally to the
plaintiffs the sum of P200.00; ordering the defendants <span class="SpellE">Gervasio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lagua</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sotera</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagua</span> to vacate and deliver the possession over the two
parcels of land to the plaintiffs, and to pay the costs of this suit."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The decision became final, and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacia</span> Mateo and her daughter, <span class="SpellE">Anatalia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lagua</span>, were installed in possession of the land.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 18 August 1957, the spouses <span class="SpellE">Gervasio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lagua</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sotera</span> <span class="SpellE">Casimero</span> commenced in the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, an action
against <span class="SpellE">Bonifacia</span> Mateo and her daughter for
reimbursement of the improvements allegedly made by them on Lots 998 and 6541,
plus damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dismissed by the Justice
of the Peace Court for being barred by the judgment in Civil Case No. T-339,
therein plaintiffs appealed to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> where the case was docketed <span style="">as </span>Civil Case No. T-433.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about the same time, another case was
filed, this time by <span class="SpellE">Gervasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagua</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagua</span>, for
annulment of the donation of the two lots, insofar as one-half portion thereof
was concerned (Civil Case No. T-442).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was their claim that in donating the two lots, which allegedly were all that
plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagua</span>
owned, said plaintiff not only neglected leaving something for his own support
but also prejudiced the <span class="SpellE">legitime</span> of his forced heir,
plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Gervasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagua</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Being intimately related, the two cases were heard jointly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1958" day="12" month="11">Nov­ember
 12, 1958</st1:date>, while the cases were pending final resolution, plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagua</span> died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1960" day="23" month="12">23
 December 1960</st1:date>, the court rendered a single decision dismissing
Civil Case No. T-433 for lack of cause of action, plaintiffs spouses <span class="SpellE">Gervasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagua</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sotera</span> <span class="SpellE">Casimero</span> having been
declared possessors in bad faith in Civil Case No. T-339 and, therefore, not
entitled to any reimbursement of the expenses and improvements put up by them
on the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other suit, Civil Case
No. T-442, was, likewise dismissed on the ground of prescription, the action to
annul the donation having been brought only in 1958, or after the lapse of 41
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants' counterclaims were
similarly dismissed although they were awarded attorneys' fees in the sum of
P150.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals (CA-GR
Nos. 30064 and 30065-R).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said tribunal,
on <st1:date year="1966" day="18" month="3">18 March 1966</st1:date>, affirmed
the ruling of the trial court in Civil Case No. T-433 denying plaintiffs' claim
for reimbursement of the improvements said to have been made on the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In regard to the annulment case (C.F.I. No.
T-442), however, the Court of Appeals held that the donation to Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Lagua</span> of the 2 lots with a combined area of 11,888 square
meters exceeded by 494.75 square meters his (Alejandro's) <span class="SpellE">legitime</span>
and the disposable portion that <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagua</span> could have freely given by will, and, to the same
extent, prejudiced the <span class="SpellE">legitime</span> of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano's</span> other heir, <span class="SpellE">Gervasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagua</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The donation
was thus declared <span class="SpellE">inofficious</span>, and defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> were ordered to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span>
to plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Gervasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagua</span>
a portion of 494.75 square meters to be taken from any convenient part of the
lots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The award of attorneys' fees to
the defendants was also eliminated for lack of proper basis.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Bonifacia</span> Mateo, et al., then resorted
to this Court, assailing the decision of the Court of Appeals insofar as it
ordered them to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> a portion of the lots to
herein respondent <span class="SpellE">Gervasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagua</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is petitioners' contention that (1) the
validity of the donation <span class="SpellE"><u>propter</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">nuptias</span></u> having been finally determined in Civil Case
No. T-339, any question in derogation of said validity is already barred; (2)
that the action to annul the donation, filed in 1958, or 41 years after its
execution, is abated by prescription; (3) that a donation <span class="SpellE"><u>propter</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">nuptias</span></u> is re­vocable only for any of the grounds
enumerated in Article 132 of the new Civil Code, and inofficiousness is not one
of them; and (4) that in determining the <span class="SpellE">legitime</span> of
the <span class="SpellE">Lagua</span> brothers in the hereditary estate of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagua</span>, the Court of
Appeals should have applied the provisions of the Civil Code of 1889, and not
Article 888 of the new Civil Code.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' first two assigned errors, it may be stated, are
non-contentious issues that have no bearing in the actual controversy in this
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of them refer to the <u>validity</u>
of the donation - a matter which was definitively settled in Civil Case No.
T-399 and which, precisely, was declared by the Court of Appeals to be
"beyond the realm of judicial inquiry".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reality, the only question this case
presents is whether or not the Court of Appeals acted correctly in ordering the
reduction of the donation for being <span class="SpellE">inofficious</span>, and
in ordering herein petitioners to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> to
respondent <span class="SpellE">Gervasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagua</span>
an uniden­tified 494.75-square meter portion of the donated lots.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are in accord with the Court of Appeals that Civil Case No.
442 is not one exclusively for annulment or revocation of the entire donation,
but of merely that portion thereof allegedly trenching on the <span class="SpellE">legitime</span> of respondent <span class="SpellE">Gervasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagua</span>;<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
that the cause of action to enforce <span class="SpellE">Gervasio's</span> <span class="SpellE">legitime</span>, having accrued only upon the death of his father
on 12 November 1958, the dispute has to be governed by the pertinent provi­sions
of the new Civil Code; and that a donation <span class="SpellE"><u>propter</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">nuptias</span></u> properly may be reduced for being <span class="SpellE">inofficious</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Contrary to the views of appellants (petitioners), donations <span class="SpellE"><u>propter</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">nuptias</span></u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>(by reason of marriage) are with­out onerous
consideration, the marriage being merely the <u>occasion</u> or <u>motive</u>
for the donation, not its <span class="SpellE"><u>causa</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being liberalities, they remain subject to
reduction for inofficiousness upon the donor's death, if they should infringe
the <span class="SpellE">legitime</span> of a forced heir.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be noted, however, that in rendering the judgment under
review, the Court of Appeals acted on several unsupported assumptions:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the three (3) lots mentioned in the
decision (Nos. 998, 5106 and 6541) were the <u>only</u> properties composing
the net hereditary estate of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagua</span>; that Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Lagua</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gervasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagua</span> were his <u>only</u>
legal heirs; that the deceased left no unpaid debts, charges, taxes, etc., for
which the estate would be answerable.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
In the computation of the heirs' <span class="SpellE">legitime</span>, the Court
of Appeals also considered only the area, not the value, of the properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">The infirmity in the above course of action lies in the fact that
in its Article 908 the new Civil Code specifically provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 908.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To determine
the <span class="SpellE">legitime</span>, the value of the property left at the
death of the tes­tator shall be considered, deducting all debts, and charges,
which shall not include those imposed in the will.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"To the net value of the hereditary estate, shall be added the
value of all donations by the testator that are subject to collation, at the
time he made them."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In other words, before any conclusion about the legal share due
to a compulsory heir may be reached, it is necessary that certain steps be
taken first.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The net estate of the
decedent must be ascertained, by de­ducting all payable obligations and charges
from the <u>value</u> of the property owned by the deceased at the time of his
death; then, all donations subject to collation would be added to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the <span class="SpellE">partible</span>
estate thus determined, the <span class="SpellE">legitimes</span> of the compulsory
heir or heirs can be estab­lished; and only thereafter can it be ascertained
whether or not a dona­tion had prejudiced the <span class="SpellE">legitimes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, in order that a donation may be
reduced for being <span class="SpellE">inofficious</span>, there must be proof
that the value of the donated property exceeds that of the disposable free
portion plus the <span class="SpellE">donee's</span> share as <span class="SpellE">legitime</span>
in the properties of the donor.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
In the present case, it can hardly be said that, with the evidence then before
the court, it was in any position to rule on the inofficiousness of the
donation involved here, and to order its reduction and <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
of the deducted portion to the respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>FOR THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS</b>, the decision of the
Court of Appeals, insofar as Civil Case No. 442 of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
is concerned, is hereby set aside and the trial court's order of dismissal
sustained, <span style="">with­out </span>prejudice to
the parties' litigating the issue of inofficiousness in a proper proceeding,
giving due notice to all persons interested in the estate of the late <span class="SpellE">Cip­riano</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagua</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without costs.</p>
