				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Pursuant to Department of Finance Order No. 22 dated May 19, 1960
(effective April 25, 1960), the Bureau of Customs, in converting the value of
importations from dol­lars to pesos, added to the peso value the 25% margin fee
imposed by Republic Act 2609, for purposes of determining the customs duties
and special import tax due on said <span style="">shipments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Alleged in this case are two causes of action:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><u><span style="font-weight: normal;">First Cause of
Action<o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Caltex</span> (<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>)
Inc. (hereinafter called <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span> for short) imported
crude oil through the <st1:place><st1:placetype>port</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Batangas</span></st1:placename></st1:place> during the period
from <st1:date year="1960" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1<span style="">960</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>to <st1:date year="1961" day="12" month="4">April 12, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the various shipments of crude oil <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span> paid to <span style="">the </span>Bureau
of Customs the sums of P1,231,081.00 and P<span style="">2,</span>235,788.00 as customs duty and special
import tax, res­<span style="">pectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without </span>the margin fee being added to
the peso value of the crude oil, <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span> would have
been liable only for P995,897.00 as customs duty an P1,809,911.00 as spe­<span style="">cial import tax.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><u><span style="font-weight: normal;">Second Cause of
Action<o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class="BODY">From August 27, 1960 to April 22, 1961 <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span>
received 14 shipments of various articles entered through <span style="">the port of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>For </span>the shipments <span style="">it paid to the Bu</span><span style="">reau </span>of Customs P18,897.33 in customs
duty, and P24,556.82<span style=""> in </span>special
import tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sans the margin fee, the
customs duty and special import tax would have been only P15,193.13 and
P19,784.77, respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contending, in both Instances, that the 25% margin should not be
considered in converting the value of the importations from dollars to pesos
for purposes of impos­ing customs duty and special import tax due thereon, <span class="SpellE">Cal­tex</span> filed formal protests with the Collectors of Customs
of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, and
claimed the difference in the total amount of P669,537.25.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both Collectors denied the pro­tests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appeals to the Commissioner of Customs proved
fu­tile, hence <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span> went to the Court of Tax
Appeals, which court rendered the following judgment on May 25, 1965:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered dismissing the
petition for review, with costs against the petitioner."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Caltex</span> timely appealed to this Court
from said judg­ment, raising the issue of whether or not the Bureau of Customs
correctly added the margin fee of 25% to the peso value of the importations for
purposes of determining the customs duty and special import tax due
thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated differently, the
question is, should the tax base of the customs duty and special import tax
include the 25% margin fee?</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Caltex</span> supports the negative for two
reasons, namely, (1) that the 25% margin is not among the items enumerated in
Section 201 of the Tariff and Customs Code and Section <span style="">3 </span>of Republic Act 1394 which constitute the value of im­ported
articles for purposes of imposing the customs duty and special import tax; and
(2) that the margin fee is not a part of the conversion rate of our currency.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Commissioner of Customs admits that the margin fee does <span style="">not constitute a part </span>of the value of
the impor­tations in question as provided for in Section 201 of the Tariff and
Customs Code and Section <span style="">3 </span>of
Republic Act 1394, but maintains, sustained by the Court of Tax Ap­peals, that
it (margin fee) is part of the rate of <span style="">ex</span>change.</p>

<p class="BODY">The view of the Commissioner of Customs and the Court of Tax
Appeals that the margin fee is part of the rate of exchange must be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 204 of the Tariff and Customs Code provides that for the
assessment and collection of import duty upon imported articles and for other
purposes, the value and prices thereof quoted in foreign currency shall be
conver­ted into the currency of the Philippines at the <u>current</u> <u>r</u><u><span style="">ate</span></u><span style=""> </span>of exchange or value specified or published, from time to time,
by the Central Bank of the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The phrases "current rate of exchange" and "value
specified or published, from time to time, by the Central Bank" do not
necessarily mean the par value of the peso as fixed by Section 1 of the Coinage
Act of March 2, 1903 of the United States Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They mean the value of the peso as fixed by
the Central Bank regardless of the par value of the peso under the Coinage Act
of 1903.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the time the Coinage Act was enacted - March 2, 1903 - the
value of a particular gold currency was prin­cipally determined by, and
dependent upon, its gold point content.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No direct control was exercised by governments over exchange rates: But
as foreign exchange transactions progressed through the years the different trading
coun­tries gradually became less dependent upon the "gold point"
system and shifted to "controlled" exchange rates which is an
intermediate classification unfixed by gold points but controlled to some
extent by government action.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Con­trol by government action of the exchange rate was the motivating factor
when our own Congress provided for a built-in authority in Section <span style="">74 </span>of Republic Act 265 to the Central
Bank to establish a uniform margin on foreign exchange.</p>

<p class="BODY">A margin levy on foreign exchange is a form of ex­change control
or restriction designed to discourage im­ports and encourage exports, and
ultimately "curtail any excessive demand upon the international
reserve"<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
in or­der to stabilize the currency.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Originally adopted to cope with balance of payment pressures, exchange
restrictions have come to serve various purposes, such as limiting non­essential
<span style="">imports, protecting </span>domestic
industry - and when combined with the use of multiple currency rates - provid­ing
a source of revenue to the government, and are in many developing countries
regarded as a more or less inevitable concomitant of their economic development
programs.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The different measures of exchange control or restriction co­ver different
phases of foreign exchange transactions, i.e., in quantitative restriction, the
control is on the amount of foreign exchange allowable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of the margin levy, the immediate
impact is <span style="">on </span>the rate of foreign
ex­change; in fact, its main function is to control the ex­change rote without
changing the par value of the peso as fixed in the <span class="SpellE">Bretton</span>
Woods Agreement Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a member nation
is not supposed to alter its exchange rate (at par value) to correct a merely
temporary disequilibrium in its <span style="">balance
of payments.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> <span style="">By
its nature, </span>the margin levy is part of the rate of exchange as fixed by
the government.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The legality of the
imposition of the margin levy in relation to the so-called <span class="SpellE">Bretton</span>
Woods Agreement Act and the Central Bank Act has been sustained by Us in
Chamber of Agriculture and Natural Resources of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> vs. Central Bank, L-23244, </span><st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="6"><span style="">June 30,
 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The argument therefore that its imposition
insofar as it would affect the rate or exchange of our <span style="">currency has no </span>legal effect is of no moment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is reassuring to note that as a matter of <span style="">policy, the International </span>Monetary
Fund has not outlawed the adoption of exchange restrictions but recognized that
the elimination of such restrictions <span style="">will
take </span>some time.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Moreover, the goal in imposing the margin
levy - to stabi­<span style="">lize our currency - is
the </span>very same objective being under­taken by the International Monetary
Fund as provided for by <span style="">Article IV, </span>Section
4(a) of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The margin levy, as contemplated by the
following provision in Section 1 of Republic Act 2609:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In implementing the provisions of <span style="">this </span><span style="">Act, </span><span style="">along </span>with other monetary, credit and fiscal measures to stabilize
the economy, the monetary authorities shall take steps for the adoption of a
four-year program of gradual <span style="">decontrol."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">is not permanent and will eventually </span><span style="">be done away with as soon as fundamental
disequilibrium in the monetary posi­tion of the country <span style="">is corrected.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As to the contention that
the <span style="">margin levy is a tax o</span>n the
purchase of foreign exchange and hence should not form part of the exchange
rate, suffice it to state that We have already held the contrary for the reason
that a <span style="">tax is levied </span>to provide
revenue for government operations, while the proceeds of the margin fee are
applied to strengthen our country's international reserves.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With respect to the
special import tax, Republic Act 1394 does not specify the rate of exchange to
be used in </span><span style="">its </span><span style="">determination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is observed however that Section 3 of
Republic Act 1394 which provides for the tax base upon which it could be
computed is similar to Section 201 of the Tariff and Customs Code which
provides for the tax base upon which customs duties are imposed, and that both
provisions have the <span style="">same source - Rule
13(a) </span>of the Phi<span style="">lippine Tariff </span></span>Act
of 1909.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both <span style="">provisions are in <span class="SpellE"><u>pari</u></span> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">materia</span></u></span><i><span style=""> </span></i>and should therefore be construed and <span style="">applied si­</span><span style="">milarly, in </span>the sense that for
purposes of reckoning <span style="">the </span><span style="">special </span>import
tax due on the imported <span style="">articles in </span><span style="">ques­tion, the </span>value
<span style="">of </span>said
articles expressed <span style="">in foreign cur­rency
should be </span>converted at the current <span style="">rate of exchange which </span>includes the margin levy of 25%.</p>
