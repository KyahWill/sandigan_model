deceit and trickery deceived the herein petitioner into affixing his signature
on a document purportedly necessary in the adjudication of petitioner's social
security claim; That the herein respondent notarized the said document in
connivance with his relatives, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> Santos, by placing and affixing his <span class="SpellE">notarial</span> seal below petitioner's signature showing
supposedly that petitioner has been sworn and subscribed before him at <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, on September 26,
1963, the contents of the document showing that petitioner received from the <span class="SpellE">Santoses</span> or from the T. Santos Transportation Co., the
total amount of P2,662.63, representing full and complete payment of
compensation due him for the loss of his left arm; That in truth and in fact,
the herein petitioner never went to <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, much less swore or subscribed before the respondent

P2,662.63; * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="22" month="2">February 22, 1965</st1:date>,
we issued the following resolution:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The respondent in Administrative Case No. 652 (<span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Balbarona</span> vs. Atty. <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span>
Santos) is ordered to file, within 10 days from notice hereof, an answer to the
complaint (not a motion to dismiss)."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the answer of respondent Santos, filed on April 7, 1965, there
was a vehement and emphatic denial of "the charge of deceit and gross
violation of his oath of office as a lawyer" with the further affirmation
"that he has not given, willingly or wittingly, aid and consent to do
falsehood nor consent to the doing of the same in court, for his or anybody
else's benefit, to the prejudice of anyone, more particularly the petitioner
herein." Respondent while admitting "an award dated August 23, 1963,
issued by the Acting Regional Ad­ministrator, Regional Office No. 4, Department
of Labor, Manila, directing the T. Santos Transportation Co., Inc., to pay the
peti­tioner compensation benefits in the amount of P2,662.63," denied the
allegations of deceit and trickery, the truth of the matter being, according to
him:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"On September 26, 1963, the
petitioner, was for the first time met by the respondent when in the company of
Mr. <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> Santos and <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
Santos, manager and proprietor res­pectively of the above-mentioned transportation
company, they came asking the respondent to administer an oath to the
petitioner, attest­ing to the truth of matters stated in receipt for P2,662.63,
which they themselves brought.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent then was in the Rural Bank of <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>,
Inc. at <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
where he acts as Bank Notary and Legal Counsel." He closed his explanation
in his answer thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"As is the
usual procedure, the respondent asked the petitioner herein if he understands
the meaning of what he is signing, explaining further, in the vernacular, <span class="GramE">the</span> nature of the document.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This question was answered in the affirmative by the petitioner herein,
as well as the question if he swears to the truth of the contents of the
document.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner then affixed his
signature and presented his Residence Certificate, followed by the affixing of
respondent's signature and <span class="SpellE">notarial</span> seal."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The matter was then referred to the Solicitor-General for
investigation, report and recommendation in our resolution of <st1:date year="1965" day="21" month="4">April 21, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The report of the then Solicitor-General, the Honorable Antonio
P. <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, now a member of this Court, was submitted
on <st1:date year="1968" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As noted therein:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"This is a case involving public
document duly notarized, to which complainant claims he signed without being
aware of the contents thereof, while re­spondent on the other hand denies the
imputation stating that he signed after explaining the contents thereof in the
vernacular."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Then came statement therein of what transpired next:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Com­plainant testified during the
hearing of <st1:date year="1966" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1966</st1:date>,
in the absence of respondent (pp. 53-54 rec.), but he was never cross-examined,
as he failed to appear in subsequent scheduled hearings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last hearing of this case was <st1:date year="1967" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1967</st1:date>, with only re­spondent
appearing and since then complainant has not moved for the continuance of the
hearing or at least for the formal offer of his evidence."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Under the above circumstances, it was his recommendation:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It appearing that not all the evidence
had been presented to justify a report on the merits, provisional dismissal at
the moment would be in order."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution of January 31, 1968, we required complainant <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span> <span class="SpellE">Balbarona</span> to comment
within 10 days from notice on the above report of the then Solicitor-General <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Up to this
date, no such comment had been filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is quite obvious, there­fore, that complainant, for reasons best known to him,
had lost any further interest in prosecuting the charge against respondent <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, the recommendation
for a provisional dismissal appears to be justified.</p>
