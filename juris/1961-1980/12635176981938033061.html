				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1956" day="7" month="7">July 7, 1956</st1:date>
<span class="SpellE">Basilia</span> <st1:country-region><st1:place>Austria</st1:place></st1:country-region>
<span class="SpellE">vda</span>. de Cruz filed with the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (Special Proceedings 2457) a peti­tion for
probate, <u>ante</u> <u>mortem</u>, of her last will and testament.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The probate was opposed by the present
petitioners Ruben Austria, Con­suelo Austria-<span class="SpellE">Benta</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Lauro</span> Austria <span class="SpellE">Mozo</span>, and
still others who, like the petitioners, are nephews and nieces of <span class="SpellE">Basilia</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This oppo­sition
was, however, dismissed and the probate of the will allowed after due hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">The bulk of the estate of <span class="SpellE">Basilia</span>,
admittedly, was destined, under the will to pass on to the respondents Perfecto
Cruz, Benita Cruz-<span class="SpellE">Meñez</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isagani</span>
Cruz, Alberto Cruz, and Luz Cruz-<span class="SpellE">Salonga</span>, all of whom
had been assumed and declared by <span class="SpellE">Basilia</span> as her own
legally adopted children.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1959" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1959</st1:date>,
more than two years after her will was allowed to probate, <span class="SpellE">Basilia</span>
died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Perfecto Cruz was
appointed executor without bond by the same court in accordance with the provisions
of the decedent's will, notwithstanding the block­ing attempt pursued by the
petitioner Ruben Austria.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, on November 5, 1959, the present petitioners filed in
the same proceedings a petition in intervention for partition <span style="">al­</span>leging in substance that they are
the nearest of kin of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">B</span>asilia</span>,
and that the five respondents Perfecto Cruz, et al., had not in fact been
adopted <span style="">by </span>the decedent in
accordance with law, in effect rendering these respondents mere strangers to
the decedent and with<span style="">out any right to
succeed as heirs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding opposition by the respondent Perfecto Cruz, as
executor of the estate, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> allowed the petitioners'
intervention by its order of December 22, 1959, couched in broad terms, as
follows: "The Petition in Intervention for Partition filed by the
above-named <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> [Ruben Austria, et al. ]<span style=""> </span>dated <st1:date year="1959" day="5" month="11">Nov­ember 5, 1959</st1:date> is hereby granted."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, the contending sides debated the matter of
authenticity or lack of it of the several adoption papers produced and
presented by the respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On motion
of the petitioners Ru­ben Austria, et al., these documents were referred to the
National Bureau of Investigation for examination and advice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The N.B.I. re­port seems to bear out the
genuineness of the documents, but the <span style="">petitioners,
evidently dissatisfied with the results, managed to ob­tain a preliminary
opinion from a Constabulary questioned-document examiner whose views undermine
the authenticity of the said documents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioners Ruben Austria, et al., thus moved the lower court to
refer the adoption papers to the Philippine Constabulary for further
study.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners likewise located
former personnel of the court which appeared to have granted the questioned
adoption, and obtained written depositions from two of them denying any </span><span style="">know</span><span style="">ledge of the pertinent adoption proceedings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1963</st1:date>,
more than three years after they were allowed to intervene, the petitioners
Ruben Austria, et al., moved the lower Court to set for hearing the matter of
the genuineness of the adoption of the respondents Perfecto Cruz, et al., by
the late <span class="SpellE">Basilia</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>B<span style="">efore </span>the date set by the
court for hearing arrived, how­ever, the respondent <span style="">Benita </span>Cruz-<span class="SpellE">Meñez</span>, who entered an
appear­ance separately from that of her brother Perfecto Cruz, filed on
February 28, 1963 a motion asking the lower court, by way of alter<span style="">native relief, to confine the petitioners'
intervention, should it be permitted, to properties not disposed of <span style="">in </span>the will of the decedent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1963</st1:date>,
the lower court heard the respondent Benita's motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both sides subsequently submitted their
respec­tive memoranda, and finally, the lower court issued an order on <st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1963</st1:date>, delimiting the
petitioners' intervention to the pro­perties of the deceased which were not
disposed of in the <span style="">will.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners moved the lower court to reconsider this latest
order, eliciting thereby an opposition from the respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="10">October
 25, 1963</st1:date> the same court denied the petitioners' mo­<span style="">tion </span>for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">A second motion for reconsideration which set off a long exchange
of memoranda from both sides, was summarily denied <span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="21" month="4">April 21, 1964</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence this petition <span style="">for <u>certiorari,</u>
</span>praying this Court <span style="">to an­</span>nul
the orders of June 4 and October 25, 1963 and the order <span style="">of April </span>21, 1964, all restricting petitioners' intervention to
properties that were not included in the decedent's testamentary dispositions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The uncontested premises are clear. Two interests are lock­ed in
dispute over the bulk of the estate of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Arrayed on one side are the petitioners Ruben
Austria, Consuelo Austria-<span class="SpellE">Benta</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lauro</span> Austria <span class="SpellE">Mozo</span>, three of a
number of nephews and nieces who are concededly the nearest surviving blood
relatives of the decedent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other
side are the respondents brothers and sisters, Perfecto Cruz, Benita Cruz-<span class="SpellE">Meñez</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isagani</span> Cruz, Al­berto
Cruz and Luz Cruz-<span class="SpellE">Salonga</span>, all of whom heirs in the
will of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Basilia</span>, and all of whom claim
kinship with the dece­dent by virtue of legal adoption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the heart of the controversy is <span class="SpellE">B<span style="">asilia's</span></span><span style=""> last will -- immaculate in its extrinsic
validity since </span>it <span style="">bears the
imprimatur of duly conducted probate proceedings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The complaint in
intervention filed in the lower court assails the legality of the tie which the
respondent Perfecto Cruz and his brothers and sisters claim to have with the
decedent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court had, however,
assumed, by its orders in question, that the validity or invalidity of the
adoption is not material nor decisive on the efficacy of the institution of
heirs; for, even if the adoption in question were spurious, the respondents
Perfecto Cruz, et al., will nevertheless succeed not as compulsory heirs but as
testamen­tary heirs instituted in <span class="SpellE">Basilia's</span>
will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This ruling apparently finds
support in article 842 of the Civil Code which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"One who has no compulsory heirs may dispose of by will all
his estate or any part of it in fa­vor of any person having capacity to
succeed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"One who has compulsory heirs may dispose of his estate
provided he does not contravene the provisions of this Code with regard to the <span class="SpellE">legitime</span> <span style="">of said
heirs."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The lower court must have assumed that since the petitioners <span style="">ne</span>phews and niece are not compulsory
heirs, they do not possess that interest which can be prejudiced by a free-wheeling
testamen<span style="">tary disposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners' interest is confined to
properties, if any, that have not been disposed of in the will, for to that
extent intestate succession can take place and the question of the veracity of
the adoption acquires relevance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners nephews and niece, upon the other hand, insist
that the entire estate should descend to them by intestacy by reason of the
intrinsic nullity of the institution of heirs embodied in the decedent's
will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have thus raised squarely the
issue <span style="">of whether or not such
institution of heirs would retain efficacy <span style="">in</span> the event there exists proof that the adoption of the same
heirs </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">the decedent is false.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners cite, as the controlling rule, article 850 of the
Civil Code which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"The statement of a false cause for the insti­tution of an
heir shall be considered as not written, unless it appears from the will that
the testator would not have made such institution if he had known the fal­sity
of such cause."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Coming closer to the center of the controversy, the petitioners
have called the attention of the lower court and this Court to the follow<span style="">ing pertinent portions of the will of the
deceased which recite:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The tenor of the language used, the
petitioners argue, gives rise <span style="">to </span>the
inference that the late <span class="SpellE">Basilia</span> was deceived into
believing <span style="">that she was legally bound to
bequeath one-half of her entire estate to the respondents Perfecto Cruz, et al.
as the latter’s <span class="SpellE">legitime</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners further contend that had the
deceased known the adoption to be spurious, she would not have instituted the
respon­dents at all -- the basis of the institution being solely her belief
that they were her compulsory heirs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Proof therefore of the falsity of the adoption would cause a nullity of
the institution of heirs and the opening of the estate wide to intestacy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did the lower court then abuse its discretion
or act in violation of the rights of the par­ties in barring the petitioners
nephews and niece from registering their claim even to properties adjudicated
by the decedent in her will?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Before the institution of heirs may be annulled under arti­cle
850 of the Civil Code, the following requisites must concur: <u>First</u>, the
cause for the institution of heirs must be stated in the will; <u>second</u>, the
cause must be shown to be false; and <u>third</u>, <span style="">it </span>must appear from the face of the will that the testator would
not have made such institution if he had known the falsity of the cause.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners would have us imply, from the use of the terms,
"<span class="SpellE"><u>sapilitang</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">tagapagmana</span></u>"
(compulsory heirs) and "<span class="SpellE"><u>sapilitang</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>mana</u></span><u>”</u> (<span class="SpellE">legitime</span>),
that the impelling reason or cause for the <span style="">institution of the respondents was the testatrix's belief that under
the law she could not do otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
this were indeed what prompt­ed the testatrix in instituting the respondents,
she did not make it known in her will.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Surely if she was aware that succession to the <span class="SpellE">legitime</span>
takes place by operation of law, independent of her own wishes, she would not
have found it convenient to name her sup­posed compulsory heirs to their <span class="SpellE">legitimes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
express adoption of the rules on <span class="SpellE">legitimes</span> should
very well indicate her complete agreement with that statutory scheme.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even this, like the peti­tioners' own
proposition, is highly speculative of what was in the mind of the testatrix
when she executed her will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One fact
prevails, however, and it is that the decedent's will does not state in a spe</span>cific
or unequivocal manner the cause for such institution of heirs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot annul the same <span style="">on </span>the basis of guess work or
uncertain implications.</p>

<p class="BODY">And even if we should accept the petitioners' theory that the
decedent instituted the respondents Perfecto Cruz, et al. sole­ly because she
believed that the law commanded her to do <span style="">so, on </span>the false assumption that her adoption of these respondents
<span style="">was va­</span>lid, still such
institution must stand.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 850 of the Civil Code, quoted above, is a positive
injunction to ignore whatever false cause the testator may have written in his
will for the institution of heirs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
institution may be annulled only when one is satisfied, after an examination of
the will, that the testator clearly would not have made the institution if he
had known the cause for it to be false.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Now, would the late <span class="SpellE">Basilia</span> have caused the
revocation of the institution of heirs if she had known that she was mistaken
in treating these heirs as her le­gally adopted children? Or would she have
instituted them nonethe­less?</p>

<p class="BODY">The decedent's will, which alone should provide the answer, is
mute on this point or at best is vague and uncertain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The phrases, "<span class="SpellE"><u>mga</u></span><u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">sapilitang</span> <span class="SpellE">tagapagmana</span></span></u><span style="">"
</span>and <span style="">"<span class="SpellE"><u>sapilitang</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">mana</span></u>," </span>were borrow­ed from the
language of the law on succession and were used, respectively, to describe the
class of heirs instituted and the abstract object of the inheritance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They offer no absolute indication that the
decedent would have willed her estate other than the way she did if she had
known that she was not bound by law to make allowance for <span class="SpellE">legitimes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her disposition of the free portion of her
estate (<span class="SpellE"><u>libre</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">disposicion</span></u></span><u><span style="">)</span></u><span style=""> </span>which largely favored the respondent Perfecto Cruz, the latter's
children, and the children of the respondent Benita Cruz, shows a perceptible
inclination on her part to give to the respon­dents more than what she thought
the law enjoined her to give to them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Compare this with the relatively small devise of land which the decedent
had left for her blood relatives, including the petition­ers Consuelo Austria-<span class="SpellE">Benta</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lauro</span> <span class="SpellE">Mozo</span> and the children of the petitioner Ruben Austria.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were we to exclude the respondents Perfecto
Cruz, et al. from the inheritance, then the petitioners and the other nephews
and nieces would succeed to the bulk of the estate by intestacy -- a result
which would subvert the clear wishes of the decedent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whatever doubts one entertains in his mind should be swept away
by these explicit injunctions in the Civil Code: "The words of a will are
to receive an interpretation which will give to every ex­pression some effect,
rather than one which will render any of the expressions inoperative; and of
two modes of interpreting a will <span style="">that
is </span>to be preferred which will prevent intestacy."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Testacy is favored and doubts are resolved on its side,
especially where the will evinces an intention on the part <span style="">of the testator to </span>dispose of
practically his whole estate,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
as was done <span style="">in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover, so compelling is the
principle that intestacy <span style="">should be </span>avoided
and the wishes of the testator allowed to prevail, that we <span style="">could </span>even vary the language of the
will for the purpose of giving it <span style="">effect.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>A probate court has found, by final
judgment, that the late <span class="SpellE">Basilia</span> Austria <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Cruz was possessed of testamentary capacity
and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>her last will executed free from
falsification, fraud, trickery or un­due influence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this situation, it becomes our duty to
give <span style="">full ex­</span>pression to her
will.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At all events, the legality of the adoption of the respondents by
the testatrix can be assailed only in a separate action brought for that
purpose, and cannot be the subject of a collateral attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To the petitioners' charge that the lower court had no power to
reverse its order of December 22, 1959, suffice it to state that, as born by
the records, the subsequent orders complained of served merely to clarify the
first -- an act which the court could legally do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every court has the inherent power to amend
and control its processes and orders so as to make them conformable to law and
