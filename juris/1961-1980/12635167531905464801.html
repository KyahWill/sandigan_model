				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Original action of mandamus and <span style="">prohibition pray­</span>ing in effect
that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) respondent judge be prohibited
to enforce the judgment of conviction against petitioner; (2) said respondent
judge be enjoined, instead, to give due course to petitioner's appeal from said
judg­ment to this Court; and (3) that the records of his case be forwarded to
this Court for proper disposition of his appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In brief, the facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">In Criminal Case No. 301 of the Municipal Court of Bontoc,
Mountain Province, on April 18, 1960, peti­tioner who was the accused therein,
pleaded guilty to an amended complaint charging him thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The undersigned prosecuting officer under oath accuses
PHILANDER LON­GAO for the crime of HOMICIDE THRU RECKLESS IMPRUDENCE punishable
under Article 365, Par. <span style="">7, </span>enumeration
No. 2, of the Revised Penal Code committed as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 29th day of February, 1960, at 8:30 a.m.
in the morning, in the municipality of Bon­toc, Mt. Province, Philippines, and
within the jurisdiction of this Honor­able Court, the above-named accused while
operating his car bearing plate No. 35-264, series of 1960, without taking the
necessary precaution and without due regard to Traffic Rules and Regulations
and in flagrant vio­lation of the Automobile Law as said accused was driving on
the wrong lane, did then and there wilfully, unlaw­fully and feloniously ran
over <span style="">the </span>person of ANDRE
NGELANGEL which caused the death of the latter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Contrary to law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Upon entering such plea, he asked for
leave to prove the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender and this
request was granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After proper
proceeding, the court rendered a judgment of conviction which pertinently
reads:</p>

<blockquote>"The offense charged is defined and penalized under paragraph
7, <span style="">enu</span>meration
2, Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The penalty therein prescribed is <u><span style="">prision</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>correccional</u>
in its medium and maximum periods of from two (2) years, four (4) months and
one (1) day to six (6) years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ac­cused
has two mitigating circumstances, namely, voluntary plea of guilty and
voluntary surrender, in his favor with no aggravating circumstance against
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This being the case the penalty to
be imposed, according to enumera­tion 5, Article 64 of the Revised Pe­nal Code,
shall be the penalty next lower to that prescribed by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The penalty next lower to that of <u>prision</u>
<u>correccional</u> in its medium and maximum periods is <u>arresto</u> <u>mayor</u>
in its maximum period to <u>prision</u> <u>correccional</u> in its minimum
period of from four (4) months and one (1) day to two (2) years and four (4)
months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Applying the Indeterminate
Sentence Law the Court finds that the penalty imposable upon the herein accused
is from one (1) month and one (1) day to two (2) years and four (4) months.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"FOR THE FOREGOING, judgment is hereby rendered sentencing the
accused, PHILANDER LONGAO, to suffer an indeter­minate imprisonment of two (2)
months and one (1) day of <u>arresto</u> <u>mayor</u> to one (1) year and eight
(8) months of <u>prision</u> <u>correccional</u>, to indemnify the heirs of the
deceased, Andrew Ngelangel in the amount of SIX THOUSAND (P6,000) PESOS,
Philippine Currency, plus the amount of ONE THOUSAND (P1,000.00) PESOS,
Philippine Currency, for the mental anguish caused upon said heirs, and, in
case of insolvency, to suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, and to
pay the costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On April 23, 1960, petitioner perfected an appeal directly to
this Supreme Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
This appeal was dis­missed, however, on March 25, 1961, since under the cir­cumstances,
it was opined that the <span style="">same </span>should have been made to the Court of First Instance of
Mountain Province.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereupon, petitioner
pursued a new appeal from respond­ent court, but when the case reached the
Court of First Instance, the appeal was dismissed, the said court hold­ing that
contrary to the ruling of this Court, the appeal should have been made
here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records were forwarded here by
order of the court even without any appeal being made by either party and
naturally, there being no appeal, the records were sent back to the Court of
First Instance which, <span style="">in </span>turn, returned the same to the respondent court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the respondent court, the private prosecutor sought the
execution of the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
was no­tified to appear for <span style="">said </span>execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon receiving such notice, petitioner moved
to reconsider the order for his appearance, claiming that the judgment had not
yet become final and could still be appealed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This motion was denied, and when the petitioner failed to appear, his
arrest was ordered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again,
reconsideration was asked; petitioner further prayed that his appeal be given
due course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both prayers were denied, so
petitioner tried to appeal to the Court of First Instance, but in his or­der of
June 2, 1964, respondent judge refused to allow the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All these adverse orders are now the subject
of the instant proceeding.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to his grounds for appeal from the judgment of conviction
based on his plea of guilty, petitioner raised only two simple issues, to
wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that it was error to base the
penalty imposed on him on the paragraph numbered 2 of Article 365 of the
Revised <span style="">Penal Code instead of on </span>the
first paragraph thereof; and (2) that the award of P6,000 indemnity to the
heirs for the death of the victim plus P1,000 moral damages is excessive.</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition to these facts, it is alleged in the answer of
respondent in this case that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"x x
x as a matter of fact respondent is of the firm <span style="">belief that petition</span>er being a United States Citizen has left the
Islands surreptitiously and clandestinely since petitioner knew of the decision
and asked his former counsel to make an appeal to this Court which has
subsequently been dismissed; Respond­ent specifically denies that petitioner is
a resident of Besao, Mt. Province"; and that "his right to appeal has
been waived because he has fled the Islands and in fact is not a resident of
the Philippines temporarily or otherwise since the promulgation of the decision
of the Municipal Court of <span style="">Bontoc, </span>Mountain
Province, up to the present," and these allegations are not denied, the
petitioner not having filed any reply to such new matter alleged in the answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under these circumstances, and inasmuch as the main case itself
is now more than eight years old, no substan­tial justice can be attained by
resolving the technical questions raised by petitioner as to whether or not he
has been unduly deprived of his right to be heard on appeal. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>After all, he pleaded guilty to the charge and
does not pretend that such plea is vitiated in any respect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, it is quite obvious that
his main appeal could not have prospered.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, this action can be declared to have be­come moot and
academic because of the undenied allegation in the answer of respondent that
petitioner has already left this jurisdiction and has thus waived his main
appeal on the merits, pursuant to Our rulings to such effect since People vs.
Wilson &amp; Dolores, 52 Phil. 907, almost forty years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, We held:</p>

<blockquote>"The law upon the subject is well settled, and the authorities
are practically unanimous that in the absence of a statute regulating the
practise, <span style="">it </span>is within the sound
discretion of the appellate court to determine whether the case shall be
postponed to await the recapture of the accused, or the appeal shall be
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this rule applies whether
the accused escapes from custody in jail or is constructively in custody <span style="">by </span>being admitted to bail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Warwick vs. State, 73 Ala, 486; People vs.
Redinger, 55 Cal., 290; Bronk vs. Bronk, 46 Fla, 474; McGowan vs. People, 104
I11., 100; State vs. Scott, 70 Kan., 692; Wilson vs. Com. 10 Bush [Ky.], 526;
State vs. Wright, 32 La. Ann., 1017; People vs. Genet, 59 N.Y., 80; State vs.
Jacobs, 107 N.C., 772; Tyler vs. State, 3 Okla. Crim. 179; U.S. vs. Revidas, 4
Phil., 271.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>See also note in 3 Ann.
Cas., 512.) The principle upon which this rule rests is that a party appealing
who flees the jurisdiction, pending the appeal, is in contempt of the authority
of the court and of the law and places himself in position to speculate on the
chances for a rever­sal, meanwhile keeping out of the reach of justice and
preparing to render the judgment nugatory or not, at his option.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such conduct is into­lerable and does not
invite leniency on the part of the appellate court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The defendant has fled to a foreign country, is now a
fugitive from justice, and there is a presumption that the judgments of the
court below are in accordance with the law and the facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said judgments against Joseph L. Wilson are
therefore declared final, and his appeal is dismissed with the costs against
the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So ordered."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Since his appeal may be considered as
waived, there is no useful purpose in determining whether it has been pro­perly
made or not.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rather than just consider this present case incon­sequential,
however, We have opted to take a look at the possible merits of petitioner's
appeal from his convict­ion, and We find from a mere reading of his brief in
G.R. No. L-16898 that there is absolutely no merit in any of the only two
assignments of error aforementioned which petitioner made in said brief
relative to the judgment of conviction against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His theory that the respondent court erred in
basing his penalty on the paragraph num­bered 2 of Article 365 of the Revised
Penal Code reading thus:</p>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When, by imprudence
or negli­gence and with violation of the Auto­mobile Law, the death of a person
shall be caused, in which case the defendant shall be punished by <u><span style="">pri­</span>sion</u>
<u>correccional</u> in its medium and maximum periods.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">because no evidence was presented proving
that he had violated the Automobile Law when he ran over his victim has
absolutely no legal basis, it being a fact that he had pleaded guilty to the
above-quoted amended complaint which explicitly alleges that the crime was
committed by petitioner "in flagrant violation of the Automobile
Law." Needless to say, a plea of guilty is an unqualified ad­mission of
the facts alleged in the criminal complaint, except <span style="">as </span>to the amount of damages that may be alleged therein, and can
thus be the basis of a judgment with­out the need of evidence to prove them.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the indemnity awarded to the heirs of the deceased
child, namely, P6,000 as indemnity for death and P1,000 for moral damages, the
same cannot be consider­ed excessive.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"From the time the New Civil Code took ef­fect (in 1950), the
courts could properly have awarded P9,000 as compensatory damages for death
caused by <span style="">a </span>crime or
quasi-delict." (People vs. Pantoja, G.R. No. L-18793, October 11, 1968)
The incident involved in this petition took place in 1960, more than ten years
after this Court held in People vs. Amansec, <span style="">80 </span>Phil. 424, that indemnity for death should be P6,000.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then also, there is the point that the People of the Philippines
has not been joined as respondent in this action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This non-joinder is fatal because the People
is an indispensable party in any proceeding involving incidents in a criminal
case, it being directly interested in the proper prosecution of all criminal
cases, at least, when the interests of the state are involved as distin­guished
from the interests of the offended parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Without prejudice to passing on the technical pro­cedural questions
raised by petitioner in a more appro­priate case, the remedies herein sought
should be denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These remedies are
basically ones in equity and We cannot say that petitioner has established the
premises for e­quitable relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, substantial justice <span style="">is </span>better
served by giving due course to the conviction of petitioner which appears,
anyway, to be not without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition <span style="">is </span>dismissed, with costs against petitioner.</p>
