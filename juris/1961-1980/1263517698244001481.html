decision of the Court of Appeals, from which <span class="GramE">We</span> quote:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the morning of <st1:date year="1960" day="17" month="3">March 17, 1960</st1:date>,
an <span class="SpellE">Izuzu</span> First Class passenger bus owned and operated
by the defendant, bearing Plate No. TPU-14871-Bulacan and driven by <span class="SpellE">Laureano</span> <span class="SpellE">Casim</span>, left <span class="SpellE">Lingayen</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasi­nan</span>, for <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among its paying passengers was the deceased,

frontally hit the rear side of a <span class="SpellE">bullcart</span> filled with
hay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result the end of a bamboo
pole placed on top of the <span class="SpellE">hayload</span> and tied to the
cart to hold it in </span>place, hit the right <span style="">side </span>of the windshield of the bus.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The protruding end of the bamboo pole, about 8 feet long from the rear
of the <span class="SpellE">bullcart</span>, penetrated through the glass
windshield and landed on the face <span style="">of <span class="SpellE">Poli<span style="">cronio</span></span></span>
<span class="SpellE">Quintos</span>, Jr. who, because of the impact, <span style="">fell </span>from his seat and was sprawled on
the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pole landed on his left
eye and the bone of the left side of his face was fractured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He suffered other mul­tiple wounds and was
rendered unconscious due, among other causes to severe cerebral
concussion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A La <span class="SpellE">Mallorca</span>
passenger bus going in the opposite direction towards <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, reached
the scene <span style="">of </span>the mishap and it
was stopped by Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Felino</span> <span class="SpellE">Bacani</span>
of the municipal police force of <span class="SpellE">Minalin</span> <span style="">who, </span>in the
meantime, had gone to the scene to investigate.<span style="">&nbsp;

<span class="SpellE">Quintos</span>, Jr. and three other injured men who rode on
the <span class="SpellE">bullcart</span> aboard the La <span class="SpellE">Mallorca</span>

 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
at <st1:city><st1:place>San Fernando</st1:place></st1:city> for medical as­sistance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding such assistance, <span class="SpellE">Policronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Quintos</span>, Jr. died at <st1:time minute="15" hour="15">3:15 p.m.</st1:time> on the same day, <st1:date year="1960" day="17" month="3">March 17, 1960</st1:date>, due to traumatic
shock due to cerebral in­juries."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The private respondents, <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>, Prima
and Junta, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Quintos</span>, are the sisters and
only surviving heirs of <span class="SpellE">Policronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Quintos</span>, Jr., who died single, leaving <span class="GramE">no
descendants nor</span> ascen­dants. Said respondents herein brought this action
against herein petitioner, Villa <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> Transit, Inc.,
as owner and operator of said passenger bus, bearing Plate No.
TPU-14871-Bulacan, for breach of the contract of carriage between said
petitioner and the deceased <span class="SpellE">Policronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Quintos</span>, Jr., to recover the aggregate sum of P63<span class="GramE">,750.00</span> <span style="">as </span>damages,
including attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
petitioner - defendant in the court of first instance - contended that the
mishap was due to a fortuitous event, but this pretense was rejected by the
trial court and the Court of Appeals, both of which found that the accident and
the death of <span class="SpellE">Policronio</span> had been due to the
negligence of the bus driver, for whom petitioner was liable under its contract
of carriage with the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
language of His Honor, the trial Judge:</p>

<blockquote>"The mishap was not the result of any unfore­seeable
fortuitous event or emergency but <span style="">was </span>the
direct result of the negligence of the driver of the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant must, therefore, respond for
damages resulting from its breach of contract for carriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the complaint alleged a total damage of
only P63<span class="GramE">,750.00</span> although as elsewhere shown <span style="">in </span>this decision the damages for wake
and burial <span style="">ex­</span>penses, loss of
income, death of the victim, <span style="">and </span>attorneys
fee reach the aggregate of P79,615.95,<span style="">
this Court finds it just that said damages be as­sessed at total of only P63,
750.00 as prayed for in plaintiffs' amended complaint."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of the decision of
the trial Court reads:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered ordering the defendant
to pay to the plaintiffs the amount of P63<span class="GramE">,750.00</span> as
damages for breach of contact of carriage resulting from the death of <span class="SpellE">Policronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Quintos</span>, Jr."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">which</span>, as above
indicated, was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. Hence, the present petition
for review on certiorari, filed by <span style="">Villa
</span><span class="SpellE">Rey</span> Transit, Inc.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only issue raised <span style="">in </span>this
appeal is the amount of damages recoverable by private respondents herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The determination of such amount depends,
mainly upon two (2) factors, namely: <span style="">(1)
</span>the num­ber of years on the basis of which the damages shall be
computed; and (2) the rate at which the losses sustained by said respondents
should be fixed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first factor was based by the trial court - the view of which
was concurred in by the Court of Appeals - upon the life ex­pectancy of <span class="SpellE">Policronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Quintos</span>, Jr., which
was placed at 33-1/3 years - he being over 29 years of age (or around 30 years
for pur­poses of computation) at the time of his demise - by applying the
formula (2/3 x [80-30] = life expectancy) adopted in the American Expectancy
Table of Mortality or the actuarial or Combined Experience Table of
Mortality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand,
petitioner maintains that the lower courts had erred in adopting said formula
and in not acting in accordance with <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Surro</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
in which the damages were computed on a four (4) year basis, despite the fact
that the victim therein was 39 years old, at the time of his death, and had a
life expectancy of 28.90 years.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case cited is not, however, controlling in the one at
bar.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>
case, <u>none</u> of the parties had questioned the propriety of the four-year
basis adopted by the trial court in making its award of damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both parties appealed, <span style="">but </span>only as regards the <u>amount</u>
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs assailed the
non-inclusion, in its computation, of the bonus that the corporation, which was
the victim's employer, had awarded to deserving officers and employees, <span style="">based upon the profits earned less than two
(2) months before the ac­cident that resulted in his death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants in turn, objected to the sum
awarded for the fourth year, which was treble that of the previous years, based
upon the increases given, in that fourth year, to <u>other</u> employees of the
same corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither this objection
nor said claim for inclusion of the bonus was sustained by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the same had not thereby laid
down any rule on the length of time to be used in the computation of
damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, it declared:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The determination of the indemnity to be awarded to the heirs
of a deceased person has therefore <u>no fixed basis</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Much is left to the dis­cretion of the
court considering the moral and ma</u><u><span style="">terial
damages involved</span></u><span style="">, and so it
has been said that <u>'(t<span class="GramE">)here</span> can be no exact or
uniform rule for measuring the value of a human life and the mea­sure of
damages cannot be arrived at by precise mathematical calculation</u>, but <u>the
amount recover­able depends on the particular facts and circum­stances of each
case</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The life expectancy of the
deceased or of the beneficiary, whichever is shorter, is an important factor.' <span class="GramE">(25 C.J.S. 1241.)</span> Other factors that are usually considered
are: (1) pecuniary loss to plaintiff or beneficiary (25 C.J.S. 1243-1250); (2)
loss of support (25 C.J.S., 1250-1251); (3) loss of service (25 C.J.S.
1251-1254); (4) loss of society (25 C.J.S. 1254-1255); (5) mental suffering of
bene­ficiaries (25 C.J.S., 1258-1259); and (6) medical and funeral expenses (25
C.J.S., 1254-1260)."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, life expectancy is, not only relevant, but, also, an <u>important
</u>element in fixing the amount recoverable by private respon­dents
herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although it is not the <u>sole</u>
element determinative of said amount, no cogent reason has been given to warrant
its disre­gard and the adoption, in the case at bar, of a purely arbitrary stan­dard,
such as a four-year rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, the
Court of Appeals has not erred in basing the computation of petitioner's
liability upon the life expectancy of <span class="SpellE">Policronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Quintos</span>, Jr.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the r<span style="">ate
at </span>which the damages shall be computed, petitioner impugns the decision
appealed from upon the ground that the damages awarded therein will have to be
paid <u>now</u>, whereas most of those sought to be indemnified will be suffered
<u>years later.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This argument is
basically true, and this is, perhaps, <span style="">one
of the reasons why the <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> case points out the
absence <span style="">of a </span>"fixed
basis" for the ascertainment of the damages <span style="">recoverable in </span>litigations like the one at bar. Just the same, the
force of </span>the <span style="">said argument of
petitioner herein is offset </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">the fact that, although <span style="">payment </span>of the award in the case at
bar <span style="">will have to take place upon the </span>finality
of the decision therein, the liability of <span style="">petitioner herein had been </span>fixed at the rate only <span style="">of P2<span class="GramE">,184.00</span> a year,
which is the annual </span>salary of <span class="SpellE">Policronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Quintos</span>, Jr. <span style="">at the
time of his </span>death, <span style="">as </span>a
young "training assistant" in the <span class="SpellE">Bacnotan</span>
Cement Industries, <span style="">Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In </span>other words, unlike the <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> case, on which petitioner re<span style="">lies, </span>the lower courts did not
consider, in the present case, <span class="SpellE">Poli­cronio's</span>
potentiality and capacity to </span><u><span style="">increase</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">his
future income.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, upon the
conclusion of his </span><u><span style="">training</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">period,
he was supposed to have a better job and be promoted from time to time, and, hence,
to earn more, if not - considering the growing importance of trade, commerce
and industry and the conco<span style="">mitant </span>rise
in the income level of officers and employees therein - much more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, it should be noted, also, that We are mainly
concerned with the determination of the losses or damages sustained by the
private respondents, as dependents and intestate heirs of the deceased, and
that said damages consist, <u>not</u> of the full amount of his earnings, but
of the support they received or would have received from him had he not died in
consequence of the negligence of peti­tioner's agent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fixing the amount of that support, <span class="GramE">We</span> must reckon with the "necessary expenses of his own
living", which should be deducted from his earnings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it has been consistently held that
earning capacity, as an element of damages to one's estate for his death by
wrongful act is necessarily his <u>net</u> earning capacity or his capacity to
acquire money, <u><span style="">'less the necessary
expense for his own living.</span></u><span style="">"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Stated otherwise, the amount
recoverable is <u>not</u> the loss of the <u><span style="">entire</span></u><span style=""> </span>earning,
but rather the loss of that <u><span style="">portion</span></u><span style=""> </span>of the earnings which the beneficiary
would have received.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
In other words, only net earnings, not gross earning, are to be consi­dered,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
that is, the total of the earnings <u>less</u> expenses necessary <span style="">in the creation of such earnings or income</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and less living and other incidental
expenses.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">All things considered, We are of the opinion that it is fair and
reasonable to fix the deductible living and other expenses of the de<span style="">ceased at the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,184.00</span>
a year, or about P100.00 a month, and that, consequently, the </span>loss
sustained by his sisters may <span style="">be roughly
estimated at P1,000.00 a year or P33,333.33 for the 33-1/3 years of his life
expectancy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this sum of P33<span class="GramE">,333.33</span>, the follow­ing should be added: (a) P12,000.00,
pursuant to Arts. 104 and 107 of the Revised Penal Code, in relation to Article
2206 of our Civil Code, as construed and applied by this Court;</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> (b) P1<span class="GramE">,727.95</span>,
actually spent by private respondents for medical and burial expenses; and (c)
attorney's fees, which was fixed by the trial court, at P500.00, but which, in
view of the appeal taken by petitioner herein, first to the Court of Appeals
and later to this Supreme Court, should be </span><span style="">in­</span><span style="">creased to P2,500.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, the amount adjudged in the decision appealed from should be reduced to
the aggregate sum of P49<span class="GramE">,561.28</span>, with interest
thereon, at the legal rate, from </span><st1:date year="1961" day="29" month="12"><span style="">December 29, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, date of the promulgation of the decision of
