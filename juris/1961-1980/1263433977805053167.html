the demeanor of these witnesses, "the testimonies of these witnesses on
the shooting incident and the identification of the accused Angeles were given
in a very spontaneous, natural, consistent and reasonable manner which are all
the earmarks of truth which became more credible in the cross-examination to which
they have been exposed."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

him; and before the incident, she already met the accused when he was looking
for her license.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the trial

before because accused is a policeman and she believes that a policeman cannot
be arrested and as a matter of fact, she has a phobia on policeman, is an
indication of the naturalness of her testimony especially when the court
observes that this witness is not highly intelligent."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It is also the observation of the trial

<p class="BODY">With respect to witness Rosario <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Ablola</span>, the trial court believes that the
credibility of her testimony was enhanced when she declared that she did not
testify in the William <span class="SpellE">Limson</span> cases because actually
she did not see <span class="SpellE">Limson</span> during the shooting incident
and it is hard to tell a lie and that the person she saw then was accused
Angeles who was then two or three yards away from the door.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
It is also difficult to <span style="">question the
credibility of witness <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> on the mere ground
that she did not immediately point to the accused Angeles on June 23, 1969,
after the crime was committed, because she explained that she knew accused
Angeles was a policeman and she was afraid to talk and she was emboldened only
when she knew that William <span class="SpellE">Limson</span> was convicted.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It is the trial court's observation that
"what actually happened is that before the conviction of William <span class="SpellE">Limson</span>, everybody was afraid to testify against Angeles
because of his being a policeman, but after <span class="SpellE">Limson</span>
was convicted by this court, the witnesses were encouraged to testify for they
realized that nobody can be above the law."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

of three assailants in the shooting incident at the Melrose Kitchenette on June
23, 1969, witness <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> Ramos testified that
she saw the accused Angeles at around 6:00 p.m. or about two hours before the
incident, peeping inside the Melrose Kitchen­ette with a companion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This witness also stated that she saw the
accused Angeles at the Playboy Theater after the shooting incident and he
immediately ran upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These proven
cir­cumstances clearly implicate accused Angeles in the shooting <span style="">incident.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">No evidence exists indicative of any evil or bad motive as to why
witnesses Romero, <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> and Ramos would falsely
testify against the accused Angeles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
mere fact that before the shooting incident of June 23, 1969, accused Angeles
called the attention of the spouses de <span class="SpellE">Ablola</span>
(Rosario <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> de <span class="SpellE">Ablola</span>)
about an alleged violation of an ordinance prohibiting selling liquor after
2:00 a.m., and merely warned them, would not be sufficient reason or motive for
witness Rosario <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> de <span class="SpellE">Ablola</span>
to testify falsely against accused Angeles.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The natural reaction of the spouses would be to be grateful for the
conside­ration given them by the accused Angeles in not filing charges but
merely warning them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same conclusion
can be derived when accused Angeles asked for the license of witness Lydia
Romero before the shooting incident and nothing was done to arrest her.<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">The inevitable conclusion is that the credibility of the
witnesses Romero, <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> and Ramos were never
successfully assailed, hence their version of what happened during the shooting
incident speaks the truth.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the evidence presented by the senior ballistic expert of
the Manila Police Department, Washington <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span>, to
the effect that a ballistic examination of the two firearms surrendered by the
accused Angeles (Exhibits "E-2-Angeles" and "E-3-Angeles")
indicated that the recovered slugs were not fired from those guns and there
were no indications of barrel swapping for both guns,<a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">to Our mind, such evidence becomes of
no moment to accused Angeles in the face of clear positive identification made
by witnesses Romero and <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> that he was one of
the three assailants who fired guns during the shooting incident at the Melrose
Kitchenette on June 23, 1969.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it is
sufficiently proven that accused Angeles was one of the three who fired guns
during that incident, it becomes unnecessary to identify correctly the gun that
he fired, as the gun that he used might be different from the guns he
surrendered for ballistic test, two months after the incident.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The principal defense of accused Angeles is an alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He declared, supported by the testimonies of
Angel <span class="SpellE">Rebullido</span> and Mauro <span class="SpellE">Friera</span><a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a>
that at the time of the shooting incident at Melrose Kitchenette, accused
Angeles was in <span class="SpellE">Norva's</span> place, then at <span class="SpellE">Kaggie's</span> Kitchenette.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Aside from the legal truism that alibi is considered a weak defense
because it can easily be fabricated and it is so easy for witnesses to get
confused as to dates, it can not prevail against the positive identification of
the accused by credible witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
indispensably necessary in order to establish an alibi successfully that the
accused was at some other place at the time the crime was committed, and that
it was physically impossible for him to be in the place where the crime took
place.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, accused Angeles was positively identified by
witnesses Romero and <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> that he was at Melrose
Kitchen­ette at the time of the shooting and he was one of the three persons
who entered and fired shots that evening of <st1:date year="1969" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was no showing of a physical impossibility for accused to be at
Melrose Kitchenette during the shooting incident because accused Angeles and
his witnesses declared they were then at <span class="SpellE">Norva’s</span>
Kitchenette and <span class="SpellE">Kaggie's</span> place, which are places in
the vicinity of Melrose Kitchenette.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court did not give much credence to the testimony of
Angel <span class="SpellE">Rebullido</span>, Mauro <span class="SpellE">Friera</span>
and accused Angeles to prove the alibi because said sworn declarations
"lack spontaneity, frankness and sincerity of a credible testimony.”<a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial <span style="">court did not believe in the testimony of witness <span class="SpellE">Friera</span>
