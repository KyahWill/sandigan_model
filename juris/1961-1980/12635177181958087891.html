				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This appeal by the National Waterworks &amp; Sewerage Autho­rity
(NAWASA) from the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span> in civil case 1522 was certified to this Court by the
Court of Appeals on the ground that only one question of law is presented for
resolution, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>whether the CFI
correctly denied the verbal manifestation made by the appellant (NAWASA) in
open court for the appointment of a commissioner to appraise the waterworks <span style="">sys­tem </span>of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
(<st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bohol</span></st1:placename></st1:place>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 23, 1962 the plaintiff, the Province of <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span>, sued the NAWASA, alleging (1) that the plaintiff is
the owner of the <span class="SpellE">Tag­bilaran</span> Waterworks System,
situated on a parcel of land in barrio <span class="SpellE">Dampas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tagbilaran</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span>, containing an
area of 1,228 sq. m. and described in original certificate of title 178; (2)
that on March 31, 1959, without paying any compensation, the NAWASA took from
the plaintiff the possession, custody and control of the said waterworks system
including its assets, and has since been operating the same and receiving fees
from its water consumers to the exclusion, and to the prejudice, of the
plaintiff; and (3) that despite repeated de­mands, the NAWASA has refused and
failed, and still refuses, to pay or reimburse to the plaintiff the reasonable
value of the said <span style="">waterworks system
which is P190,163.27, or return the possession, custody and control
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so the plaintiff prays,
alternative­ly, that the </span>NAWASA <span style="">be
ordered to pay the plaintiff the sum of P190,163.27 with legal interest from
March 31, 1959 until fully paid, or that it be ordered to return to the plaintiff
the possession, control and custody of the said waterworks system together </span>with
<span style="">all </span><span style="">its assets, including the amount of P16,496.06 which the NAWASA
received from the plaintiff on the said date, and other amounts it has received
for operating the said waterworks system.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In its answer, the NAWASA
prays for the dismissal of the complaint; at the same time it counterclaimed
for recovery of P80,000 for necessary improvements and expenses, P50,000 </span><span style="">for </span><span style="">actual moral damages, and P20,000 for attorney's fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="11"><span style="">November
 21, 1962</span></st1:date><span style=""> the
plaintiff filed its answer to the counterclaim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1964" day="23" month="6"><span style="">June 23,
 1964</span></st1:date><span style=""> the parties
submitted the following stipula­tion of facts:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"1. <span style=""> </span>That plaintiff is the owner of the <span class="SpellE">Tagbila­ran</span> Waterworks System;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That on <st1:date year="1959" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1959</st1:date>, plaintiff delivered to defendant, only for
the latter's, administration, the said <span class="SpellE">Tagbilaran</span>
Waterworks System;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That, presently, plaintiff wants to recover
from defendant the administration over said Water­works System;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4. <span style=""> </span>That, on the other hand, defendant insists on
continuing with its administration over the Water­works System;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the parties are trying to enter into an
amicable settlement for which reason this Honorable Court is requested to defer
the hearing of this case un­til <st1:date year="1964" day="17" month="7">July
 17, 1964</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00 a.m.</st1:time>,
on which date the par­ties will inform this Honorable Court whether or not they
have entered into such amicable settlement."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">When the case was called
for trial on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="17" month="7"><span style="">July 17, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, the NAWASA made the following admissions:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the plaintiff is the owner of the parcel
of land described in paragraph 2 of the complaint;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>and
that the value of the pieces of proper­<span style="">ty
described in paragraph III of the complaint is P190,163.27, as alleged in the
said complaint."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiff then rested its case. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The trial was thereafter postponed several
times, all on motion of the defendant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="7"><span style="">July 16,
 1965</span></st1:date><span style=""> the court
issued the following order:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

parties admit the following facts:</blockquote>

presentation of the evidence of the defendant, but defendant instead of pre­senting
evidence, made only a verbal manifes­tation through its counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span> M. Cue, that a commissioner be appointed to ass­ess
the property of the plaintiff in the possession of the defendant; but this
petition was de­nied by the Court.'</p></blockquote></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As already stated, the
NAWASA appealed upon </span>the following <span style="">lone
question of law:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did the lower court err
in denying <span class="SpellE">NAWA<span style="">SA's</span></span></span>
verbal <span style="">manifestation for the
appointment of a commissioner to ap­praise the waterworks system of the
plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This lone issue may be
summarily disposed of by recogniz­ing the correct nature of the present appeal,
which is </span>one from an <span style="">interlocutory
order of the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is all too
well-settled </span>to <span style="">require any citation
of authorities that an interlocutory order can­not be the subject of an appeal,
as it does not dispose of the case on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The word "interlocutory" refers to
"something intervening between the commencement and the end of a suit
which de­cides some point or matter but is not a final decision of the whole
controversy."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At all events, the verbal
motion made by the NAWASA in open court for the appointment of a commissioner
to appraise the waterworks system was, to our mind, made half-heartedly. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The counsel for NAWASA has not shown and did
not offer to show that there was need of reference of the matter to a
commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the motion was denied
in open court, the NAWASA simply rested its case without requesting a
reconsideration of the denial or submitting any evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THE NAWASA was afforded every opportunity to </span>pre<span style="">sent its evidence, as can be gleaned from the
fact that there was a 26-month delay in the hearing caused by no less than 13
postponements, all at the behest of the NAWASA itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">What the NAWASA should
have done, if it seriously desired to project the issue of just compensation or
fair market value, tak­ing into account what it now claims as the depreciation
of the pro­perties of the waterworks system, was to file the proper motion in
writing with the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, accompanied by supporting
affidavits </span>and other documents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The NAWASA did not even attempt to present in evidence the records of
the properties and other assets of the waterworks system which are in its
control, possession and custody, to prove the matter of just compensation and
the fact of depreciation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, this appeal by the NAWASA is hereby dis­missed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against the NAWASA.</p>
