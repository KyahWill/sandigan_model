<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1975</st1:date>,
the Workmen's Compensation Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> rendered a decision
reversing the award made by the acting chief of section, thus prompting herein

as a special civil action.</p>

<p class="BODY">By resolution dated <st1:date year="1976" day="16" month="2">February
 16, 1976</st1:date>, this COURT required respondents to submit their comments

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1976</st1:date>,
respondent Workmen's Compensation Commission submitted its comment justifying
its assailed decision of <st1:date year="1975" day="31" month="12">December 31,
 1975</st1:date> in the following tenor:</p>

<blockquote>"In reversing the award, the Com­mission found that, indeed,
the deceased did not die due to PTB as found by the regional office and as
alleged in the Notice and Claim for Compensation but due to cancer of the left
lung.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Even the
petition (page 3, par. 1) points out the real cause of death.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It reads:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'An outright Award was granted in this case, basing the ailment of
PTB (sic) [pulmonary tuberculosis] the truth of the matter, (sic) Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Galang</span> died on <st1:date year="1970" day="9" month="12"><span style="">December 9, 1970</span></st1:date><span style="">, due to cancer of left lung ailment
(sic).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the Award was based on PTB
as the cause of death whereas, the death certificate shows Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Galang</span> succumbed to cancer of the left lung.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attached herewith is a <span class="SpellE">xerox</span>
copy of the death certificate issued by the local civil registrar, marked as
Annex 'B' and made an integral part hereof.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Moreover, the evidence of claimant does not clearly establish
the causal connection between the illness (cancer of the left lung) and the
employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The physician's report of
sickness or accident states that such causal relation cannot be
determined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Never­theless, the evidence
shows that the right to compensation was seasonably <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
contrary to the findings of the Regional Office that it was not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Notice and Claim for Compen­sation was
filed on <st1:date year="1975" day="4" month="1">January 4, 1975</st1:date> and
<span style="">the respondent in <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>
of said claim also filed its Employer's Report of Accident or Sickness on </span><st1:date year="1975" day="13" month="1"><span style="">January
 13, 1975</span></st1:date><span style=""> which is

the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period required by law.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The claim for compensation is considered (as) already barred
by Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Notice and Claim for Compensation was
filed only on January 3, 1975 which is almost five (5) years from the time of
death and way beyond the fixed period of 'not later than two (2) months after
injury or sickness or not later than three (3) months after death x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Considering the fact that the employer had no actual
knowledge of death (not) until the filing of the claim in 1975 and there being
a timely <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>, the failure to give 'notice
of the injury or sickness as soon as possible' and present the claim on time,
is jurisdictional" (pp. 83-87, rec.).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="3" month="4">April 3, 1976</st1:date>,
private respondent Procter and Gamble PMC submitted its comment (pp. 70-74,
rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent failed to seasonably controvert the claim
within fourteen (14) days from the disability or death or within ten (10) days
after it had knowledge of the alleged illness or death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The employer need not be notified of the
illness or death if he had knowledge of the fact, either personally or through
his agent or representative or responsible officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A foreman or "boss" in charge of a
crew or gang of men is an agent or representative of the employer and his
knowledge of the injury or death is sufficient under the statute (<span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> Transportation vs. WCC, L-16490, June 29, 1963,

and Phil. Manufacturing Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Nabor</span>, 40 OG, 9th
Supp. p. 164).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A verbal report of the
accident or illness to the foreman of the<span style="">
company dispenses with the necessity of a written notice (Phil. Manufacturing
Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Nabor</span>, <u>supra</u>).<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that private respondent itself acknowledged that
it first knew of the decedent's illness on <st1:date year="1970" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1970</st1:date> through its foreman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on <st1:date year="1970" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1970</st1:date>, the deceased was confined at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename>

respondent, through its factory personnel manager, gave notice of its <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Section 45 of the Workmen's Compensation Act directs that the <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> shall be made "either on or before the

<p class="BODY">While it is true that the actual cause of death of deceased
employee Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Galang</span> was cancer of the left lung
and not PTB, this alone will not preclude<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>payment of compensation benefits in favor of herein <span style="">petitioner, for it is a settled doctrine in
our jurisdiction that the law presumes in the absence </span>of substantial
evidence to the contrary that a claim is compensable, and so rigid is the rule
that <u>even where the cause of death is unknown the right to compensation
subsists</u>, the reason being that the Workmen's Compensation Act is a social
legislation designed to give relief to the working man (Industrial Textile Mfg.
Co. of the Phil. vs. <span class="SpellE">Florzon</span>, et al., L-21969, August
31, 1966, 17 SCRA 1104 and reiterated in Domingo <span class="SpellE">Vallo</span>

<p class="BODY">The contention of private respondents to the effect that the
notice and claim for death compensa­tion benefits was only filed after almost
five (5) years (January 3, 1975) after decedent's death on December 9, 1970 and
not within three (3) months after said death, as provided for in Section 24,
Act 3428, as amended, and therefore, has already been barred by prescription, is
without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In <span class="SpellE">Tecla</span> <span class="SpellE">Magpantay</span> vs. Workmen's

"[I]t should be stressed that a claim for death benefits under the
Workmen's Compensation Act prescribes in 10 years under the New Civil Code
(Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span> Don Pedro vs. WCC and P.
Villanueva, L-24987, July 31, 1968, 24 SCRA 484; National Development Company
vs. <span class="SpellE">Rongavilla</span> and WCC, L-21963, Aug. 30, 1967, 20
SCRA 1172; Manila Railroad Company vs. Perez and WCC, L-20171, June 29, 1965,
14 SCRA 504; and LUZTEVECO vs. De Leon, et al., Nov. 28, 1959, 106 Phil. 562,
569)." This doctrinal rule has been reiterated on <st1:date year="1976" day="29" month="10">October 29, 1976</st1:date> in <span class="SpellE">Vallo</span>
vs. WCC, et al., (supra), when this COURT, through Justice <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>
Palma, held:</p>

<blockquote>"This is not the first time that such defense of prescription
has been raised by the employer, and in <u>Manila Railroad Co. vs. Perez and
the Workmen's Compensa­tion Commission</u>, the Court through then Justice,
later Chief Justice, Roberto <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, ruled that
the failure to file the claim within the period provided in the aforementioned
Sec. 24 does not affect the jurisdiction of the Commission to entertain said
claim, and that com­pensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act as amended
is a liability vested by statute which prescribes in <u>ten years</u> <span style="">pursuant to Article 1144 (2) of the Civil
Code (L-20171, June 29, 1965, 14 SCRA 504, 510, citing <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span>
Milling Co. vs. WCC, L-10533, May 13, 1957; Century Insurance Co. vs. F.A.
Fuentes, L-16039, August 31, 1961; Luzon Stevedoring Co. vs. de Leon, L-9521,
November 28, 1959).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule is
especially true where there is no showing that the employer sustained damage as
a result of the delayed filing of the claim (National Development Co. vs. WCC
&amp; <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>, per <span class="SpellE">Regala</span>,
J., L-21724, April 27, 1967, 19 SCRA 861)."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Since it is not disputed that herein claim for death compensation
benefits under the Workmen's Compensation Act was filed within five (5) years
from decedent's death, the Regional Office No. 4, Workmen's Compensation Unit
of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> has jurisdiction to
entertain said claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next vital issue to be determined and upon which hinges the
compensability or non-compensability of herein petitioner's claim for death
compensation benefits is whether cancer of the left lung sustained by and which
ultimately caused the death of the deceased was contracted or directly caused
by such employment, supervened or was either aggravated by or the result of the
nature of such employment, as ground for compensation pursuant to the
provisions of Section 2 of the Workmen's Compensation Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent contends that it is not and laid
the burden to prove the contrary on the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">This contention is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No less than private respondent disclosed the glaring fact that deceased
employee Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Galang</span> was in its employ as a
factory worker from May 23, 1947 (Annex "D", Employer's Report of
Accident or Sickness, WCC records) up to May 8, 1970, when he was stricken ill
resulting ultimately in his hospitalization, operation, medical treatment and
subsequent death on December 9, 1970.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
the time of his sickness the deceased was a deodorizer operator in private
respondent's factory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the
deceased was in the continuous employ of private respondent for 23 years, 6
months and 16 days working for eight (8) hours, five (5) days a week in the
factory which manufactures soap, edible oil, and detergents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can be rightly presumed that when the
deceased <span style="">started working with private
respondent, he was of g</span>ood and sound health, free from any kind of
disease, as a condition precedent for his employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is valid ground to make the assumption
that within the factory compound of private respondent there <span class="GramE">predominates</span>
the smell of soap, edible oil and detergents, as well as such other chemical
necessarily used in the manufacture of said products.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are also present several machines which
at times emit smoke (negligible though they may be) which tend to add pollution
to the air within the factory compound.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such was the <span class="GramE">atmosphere</span> to which the deceased
employee was exposed at private respondent's factory as a worker for the
duration of 23 years, 6 months and 16 days.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Taking into account this situation and the absence of substantial proof
on the part of respondent that cancer of the lung is not work-connected and/or
the result of the nature of decedent's employment, this COURT is not prepared
to abandon its oft-repeated rule that a claim for compensation is presumed
compensable under the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>WE even went further and held that "so
rigid is the rule that even where the cause of death is unknown, the right to
compensation subsists, the reason being that the Workmen's Compensation Act is
a social legislation designed to give relief to the working man" (<span class="SpellE">Vallo</span> vs. WCC and the Rep. of the Philippines, <u>supra</u>,
citing Industrial Textile Mfg. Co. of the Philippines vs. <span class="SpellE">Florzon</span>,
et al., ibid.).</p>

assuming the employee's illness may be ruled out an occupational disease or
that the causal link between the nature of his employment and his ailment has
been insufficiently shown, nevertheless, it is to be presumed as mandated by
Section 44 of the Workmen's Compensation Act that the employee's illness which
supervened during his employment either arose out of, or was at least
aggravated by said employment and with this presumption, the burden of proof
shifts to the employer and the employee is relieved of the burden to show
causation" (<span class="SpellE">Talip</span> vs. WCC No. 425, May 31, 1976;
see also Maria Cristina Fertilizer Corp. vs. <span style="">WCC, 60 SCRA 228).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">controverting</span> petitioner's claim for
compensation, respondent merely made it of record that it "gives its
notice of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> on the right to compensation
of Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>" (Letter to Regional Office
No. 4 by respondent's factory personnel manager dated June 30, 1970) and said <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> was reiterated in its employer's report of
accident or sickness dated January 13, 1975 "on the ground that the
illness which resulted in the death of employee, Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>,
is not work connected or aggravated by the nature of his job".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These alone do not comply with the "sub­stantial
evidence rule" needed to overcome the presumption of compensability under
the Workmen's Compensation Act and the jurisprudence on the matter laid down by
this COURT in favor of the grant of compensation benefits to employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, in case of doubt the case should
be resolved in favor of the claimant for the reason that the provisions of the
Workmen's Compensation Act as a piece of social legislation must be liberally
construed to attain the purpose for which it was enacted (Ramon vs. <span class="SpellE">Poblete</span>, et al., 40 OG 3474).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, Courts have generally held that a
spirit of liberality should characterize the interpretation of the Workmen's
Compensation Act, for the reason that it is to be classed as remedial
legislation (International Harvester Co. v. Industrial Com­mission, 157 Wis.
167, 147 N.W. 53, Am. Case 1916 B, 330).</p>

<p class="BODY">Expert medical testimony need not be required to demonstrate that
cancer can be induced by abrasive detergent chemicals like those involved in
the manufacture of soap and other detergents which is the business of private
