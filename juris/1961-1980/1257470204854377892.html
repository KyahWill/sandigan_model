				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a special civil action of certiorari with petition for a writ of 
preliminary injunction filed by herein petitioners Cipriano Martinez, as 
ex-administrator, and his bondsmen Jose Miñano and Cecilia M. Vda. de Miñano 
(the latter in representation of her deceased husband Francisco Miñano), in 
Special Proceedings Nos. V-53 and V-841 of the Court of First Instance of 
Romblon, seeking to set aside respondent court's orders of January 18 and June 
30, both of 1961, directing the respondent Clerk of Court and concurrently 
ex-officio provincial sheriff to issue a writ of execution against the 
petitioners bondsmen of ex-administrator Martinez, for the recovery of the 
amount of P3,015.11, proceeds of the sale of copra belonging to the estate under 
administration.
<p>The records disclose that on June 24, 1954, the respondent court, Judge 
Pascual Santos then presiding, issued in the cases below, an order of this 
tenor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">"ORDER</p>
<p>When these cases were called for hearing, Atty. Democrito M. Castro filed a 
manifestation, and the undersigned, as presiding Judge, called the parties in 
chamber to settle amicably all differences between the parties, and they arrived 
at an agreement, but after it has been prepared, Atty. Democrito M. Castro and 
his clients did not come to sign. The Court laments this attitude, because it 
constitutes a manifest obstruction to terminate these proceedings and put an end 
to the estranged relation among the parties, who are brothers and sisters. The 
approval, therefore, of the Project of Partition is held in abeyance.</p>
<p>"Upon examination of the account of the administrator, the Court arrived at 
the conclusion that the amount he is charging for 180 days is excessive, as well 
as expensive, for appearing before the Court. Without obtaining any authority 
from the Court, he has delivered amounts to the heirs of Lorenzo Ramirez, in 
excess of the income that he received as proceeds from the products of the 
properties of these two special proceedings, and appearing in his report, as if 
he had advanced the same.</p>
<p>"The Court, therefore, disapproves his account, and discharges him as 
administrator, appointing the Clerk of Court Atty. Constancio L. Marquez as 
administrator of these two special proceedings with the bond of P1,000.00.</p>
<p>"The actual administrator Cipriano Martinez is hereby ordered that all 
proceeds from the sale of the products of the properties of these two special 
proceedings be deposited in the Office of the Clerk of Court immediately.</p>
<p>"IT IS SO ORDERED."</p></blockquote>
<p>Notified of said order, petitioner Martinez, on July 10, 1954, filed a motion 
for reconsideration protesting against his relief without being given a day in 
court and claiming that the delivery of the amounts to the heirs of the deceased 
Lorenzo Ramirez was made in pursuance to the agreement mentioned in the 
above-quoted order of the court. No action on this motion for reconsideration 
appears in the records.</p>
<p>On August 6, 1954, respondent Ines Ramirez (one of the heirs) filed a motion 
(petition) asking the court to order petitioner Martinez to deposit in court the 
proceeds of the copra sold, on the ground that the sale took place after he was 
discharged as administrator of the estate on June 24, 1954. To this motion, 
petitioner Martinez filed an opposition (answer) claiming that he sold the copra 
in question on June 15, 1954 while he was still administrator of the estate, and 
not on June 24 as respondent Ramirez had claimed.</p>
<p>On October 18, 1954, respondent Ramirez filed another motion (petition) 
praying the court to order petitioner Martinez to render an account of the sale 
of the copra.</p>
<p>Without awaiting the court's action on said petition, petitioner Martinez, on 
May 10, 1955, filed in court an account corresponding to the months of April to 
June, 1954, including therein the amount of P3,015.11, proceeds of the sale of 
the copra in question.</p>
<p>On June 22, 1957 (or 2 years, 10 months, and 16 day3 thereafter),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the court, this time presided by Judge 
Jose Evangelista, issued the following order:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">"ORDER</p>
<p>"This is a petition, dated August 6, 1954, filed by the counsel for Inez 
Ramirez, asking that the former administrator, Cipriano Martinez, be ordered to 
deposit with the Clerk of this Court the proceeds of the sale of ten tons of 
copra.</p>
<p>"It appears that said former administrator sold ten (10) tons of copra 
belonging to these testate and intestate proceedings, after he was relieved as 
administrator and without authority of this Court. On the other hand, the 
account of said former administrator had been disapproved by this Court, and he 
is under obligation to file a new account, in accordance with the orders of this 
Court dated June 14, 1954 and June 20, 1956.</p>
<p>WHEREFORE, the former administrator, Cipriano Martinez, is hereby ordered to 
file a new account of his administration within ten (10) days from receipt of 
notice of this order. Said administrator is further ordered to deposit with the 
Clerk of Court the proceeds of the sale of the ten (10) tons of copra which he 
disposed of after he was dismissed by the Court as administrator.</p>
<p>"SO ORDERED."</p></blockquote>
<p>On July 23, 1957, petitioner Martinez filed a manifestation reiterating that 
the copra in question was sold by him before his removal, without hearing, as 
administrator of the estate, and asking that the order to deposit be 
reconsidered as the proceeds of the sale had already been included in the new 
account submitted by him which he asked to be approved. Again, nothing appears 
in the records to show that action has been taken on this petition or on the new 
accounts submitted since May 10, 1955.</p>
<p>On January 16, 1960 (or 2 years, 6 months, and 25 days thereafter), 
respondent Ramirez filed an <i>ex-parte</i> motion for execution against 
petitioner Martinez, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. That the ex-administrator, Cipriano Martinez, has sold ten (10) tons of 
copra, and said ex-administrator did not deposit the proceeds of the sale to the 
Clerk of Court, in spite of several orders issued to that effect by this 
Honorable Court.</p>
<p>"2. That this Honorable Court, on October 23, 1959, ordered the said 
ex-administrator, Cipriano Martinez "to appear and explain during the next 
hearing of this special proceedings why until now he has not deposited the sale 
of ten (10) tons of copra.</p>
<p>"3. That this special proceedings are set for hearing today, January 16, 
1960, but the said ex-administrator, Cipriano Martinez did not appear, and did 
not-deposit the product of the sale of ten (10) tons of copra.</p>
<p>"WHEREFORE, it is respectfully requested, to avoid further delay, that the 
Clerk of Court be ordered to issue the order of execution against said Cipriano 
Martinez and his bondsmen. This petition is aside from whatever action and 
relief this Honorable Court may deem proper, said ex-administrator Cipriano 
Martinez, having defied and disobeyed the orders of this Honorable 
Court."</p></blockquote>
<p>On January 18, 1960, the court, this time presided by respondent Judge 
Raymundo Villacete issued an order, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">"ORDER</p>
<p>"Considering the written <i>ex-parte</i> petition for issuance of an order of 
execution filed by counsel for Ines Ramirez, the Court finding the same legally 
in order, hereby grants the said petition.</p>
<p>"The Clerk of Court is hereby ordered to issue an order of execution against 
the bondsmen of ex-administrator Cipriano Martinez, for the collection of the 
amount of P3,015.11 (proceeds of the) sale of 10,836 kilos of copra, which he 
has not deposited with the office of the Clerk of Court, in spite of several 
orders issued to that effect.</p>
<p>"SO ORDERED."</p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioner Martinez filed a motion for reconsideration of said order, but 
respondent Judge denied the same, in an order dated June 30, 1960, which 
states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">"ORDER</p>
<p>"The telegraphic request of Atty. Democrito M. Castro for the transfer of the 
date of the hearing of his motion is hereby denied.</p>
<p>"Considering the manifestation and motion for reconsideration, the order of 
this Court dated January 18, 1960 in the above-entitled special proceedings 
filed by Atty. Democrito M. Castro, the same is hereby denied for lack of 
merit.</p>
<p>"The Court hereby reiterates its order dated January 19, 1960, ordering the 
Clerk of Court to issue a Writ of Execution against the bondsmen of 
ex-administrator Cipriano Martinez, for the recovery of the amount of 
P3,015.11.</p>
<p>"SO ORDERED."</p></blockquote>
<p>Pursuant to said order, the Clerk of Court issued a writ of execution on 
January 18, 1961 and an alias writ on February 3, 1961, but both were returned 
unsatisfied.</p>
<p>On August 9, 1961, petitioners Martinez,, Jose Miñano and Cecilia M. Vda. de 
Miñano filed with us the present petition for certiorari with preliminary 
injunction against respondents Judge Villacete, Clerk of Court and ex-officio 
provincial sheriff Constancio L. Marquez, and Ines Ramirez. In due time, we 
issued a writ of preliminary injunction restraining respondents or their 
representatives from enforcing the writ of execution, upon petitioners' filing a 
bond of P1,000.00.</p>
<p>The only question to be determined in this case is whether respondent Judge 
acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction, in 
issuing the order of execution in question.</p>
<p>Section 1, Rule 39, of the Rules of Court, provides that "Execution shall 
issue upon a <i>final judgment or order</i> upon the expiration of the time to 
appeal when no appeal has been perfected". Stated otherwise, only a final, not 
interlocutory, judgment or order may be executed (Mendoza vs. Parungao, 49 Phil. 
271; Perkins vs. Perkins, 57 Phil. 223; Yulo vs. Powell, 36 Phil. 743; 
Philippine Trust Co., vs. Santamaria, 53 Phil. 463).</p>
<p>In the instant case, there is no showing that a final judgment or order had 
been issued against petitioners, as to justify the issuance of a writ of 
execution against them. If at all, what appears on record is an order of the 
trial court dated June 22, 1957 stating that petitioner Martinez "sold ten (10) 
tons of copra belonging to these testate and intestate proceedings, after he was 
relieved as administrator, and without authority of this Court", and ordering 
him, therefore, to "file a new account of his administration within ten (10) 
days from receipt of notice" of the order, as well as "to deposit with the Clerk 
of Court the proceeds of the sale of the ten (10) tons of copra which he 
disposed of after he was dismissed by the Court as administrator".</p>
<p>But this can hardly be considered a final judgment or order which could serve 
as the basis of the order of execution in question. Note that it merely requires 
petitioner Martinez to render an account of his administration, and to deposit 
the proceeds of the copra sold by him in 1954 with the Clerk of Court, the 
non-compliance of which, could at most render him (Martinez) liable only for 
contempt of court under Section 3(<i>b</i>), Rule 64, of the Rules of court, 
under Section 3(<i>b</i>), Rule 64, of the Rules of Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> for refusal to obey its lawful order. And 
this order has not become final because petitioner Martinez' motion for its 
reconsideration explaining that the copra was sold before his removal without 
notice and its proceeds duly accounted for in his accounts submitted on May 10, 
1953 and, consequently, could not be deposited in court, has remained unacted 
upon up to the time of the issuance of the writ of execution. The order of 
execution has, therefore, no legal basis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>"(<i>b</i>) Disobedience of or resistance to a lawful writ, process, order, 
judgment, or command of a court, or injunction granted by a court or 
judge."</p></blockquote>
<p>But what is worse, the order of execution was issued, not against the 
ex-administrator, but directly against the petitioners-bondsmen who, for all 
that appears in the records, were never given any opportunity to be heard. 
(Evans vs. Workmen's Compensation Commission, 111 Phil., 1002).</p>
<p>Wherefore, the writ of certiorari prayed for by petitioners is granted. 
Respondent Judge's orders (of June 18 and 30, 1960) complained of, are set 
aside, and the injunction heretofore issued by this Court is made permanent, 
without prejudice to further proceedings in accordance with law. No costs. So 
ordered.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,
