VS. THE HONORABLE SAMUEL F. REYES AND LITTON MILLS, INC., RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class=BODY>The specific question raised in this <i>certiorari</i> and
prohibition proceeding, filed by petitioner Litton Mills Workers Union-NATU, is
whether or not respondent Judge Samuel F. Reyes of the Court of First Instance
of <span class=SpellE>Rizal</span>, had jurisdiction to act on a complaint for
damages with writ for preliminary injunction filed by private respondent Litton
Mills, Inc.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was alleged that on <st1:date
Year="1964" Day="2" Month="11">November 2, 1964</st1:date>, a strike was
declared by members of the union in the employ of private respondent by way of
protest against unfair labor practices, consisting of discrimination against
and the dismissal of all known officers and members thereof due to their union
membership and activities.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The very next day, respondent Judge, acting on a complaint for damages filed by
<span class=GramE>respondent</span> Corporation, issued <i><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>ex <span class=SpellE>parte</span></span></i><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'> </span>and without notice or hearing, a writ
of preliminary injunction prohibiting the striking employees from performing
various broad and vague acts in connection with the picketing then being
conducted by the union.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
It was then alleged that as the dispute involved unfair labor practices, the
jurisdiction over the matter including the issuance of an injunction, belonged
exclusively to the Court of Industrial Relations.<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn3' href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The conclusion would follow then that respondent Judge acted without or in
excess of his jurisdiction, and with grave abuse of discretion, in taking
cognizance of such complaint and in issuing the writ of preliminary injunction
dated November 3, 1964, one moreover issued <i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt'>ex <span class=SpellE>parte</span></span></i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt'> </span>without complying with the procedure and requirements laid down
in Section 9 of Republic Act No. 875.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn4'
href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class=BODY>The petition filed with this Court, unduly terse, could have been
improved by more specific allegations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The objection to the competence of respondent Judge to act was worded in
the most general terms.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Its tenor,
though, was plain.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It would brook no
judicial interference with the right to strike on an alleged unfair labor
practice and the picketing that did follow in its wake.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It stressed that the appropriate forum, the
only one at that, was the Court of Industrial Relations.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The obscurity lurking in the petition was
lessened by the inclusion as an annex of the complaint for damages filed by
private respondent Litton Mills, Inc., wherein both the National Association of
Trade Unions, commonly known as NATU and petitioner now, Litton Mills Workers
Union-NATU, were named as defendants.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The illegal act complained of, from which the cause of action was made
to rest, was the alleged harassment and coercion by members of the defendant
unions picketing the compound and premises of plaintiff corporation, now
private respondent, and hurling threats as well as committing acts of violence
against its employees and laborers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
is clear, therefore, that there was imputation of illegal picketing resulting
in alleged damages.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The existence of a
labor dispute could thus be discerned.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Nor could the allegation of an unfair labor practice be considered as
entirely bereft of foundation.</p>

<p class=BODY>Accordingly, respondents were required to answer.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is to be noted that a writ of preliminary
injunction was sought to restrain the enforcement of the challenged order.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was no need to do so as by the time the
resolution of this Court was issued, the preliminary injunction handed down by
respondent Judge had become <span class=SpellE><i>functus</i></span><i> officio</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Respondents through the <span class=SpellE>Seva</span>,
Albert <span class=SpellE>Vergara</span> and Gonzalo W. Gonzalez law firms
submitted a well-written and quite exhaustive answer.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They denied the existence of a labor dispute
or of any employee-employer relationship.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The emphasis, and it is understandable why, was that in the absence of
an unfair labor practice, the complaint being one for damages arising from acts
of force and violence, it was an ordinary judicial tribunal not the Court of
Industrial Relations that was the appropriate forum.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Implicit in such an approach is that the protection
to labor provision of the Constitution<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn5'
href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
was no justification for conduct tainted by illegality.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The then statutory recognition of the
concerted activity to strike was certainly thus limited.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nor was picketing constitutionally sanctioned
unless of the peaceful sort.</p>

<p class=BODY>From the background of the litigation as thus revealed, with the
likelihood that the picketing was not entirely peaceful, private respondent
firm was amply justified in seeking a remedy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It is not farfetched to assume likewise that the disruption of
industrial peace was traceable to management practices which in the eyes of
petitioner labor union amounted to an unfair labor practice.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Such being the case, which tribunal should
act on the matter?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is the decisive
question.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The answer is supplied by
applicable doctrines interpreting the provision of the Industrial Peace Act
granting exclusive power to the Court of Industrial Relations.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn6' href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Nothing is better settled then than that it was the Court of Industrial
Relations, not a court of first <span class=GramE>instance, that</span> was
vested with jurisdiction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As respondent
Judge failed to act in accordance with the controllin<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt'>g</span> statutory <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>provision,
this petition </span>must <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>be <span
class=SpellE>ganted</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=NUM>1. There is relevance to this excerpt from a recent decision, New
Frontier Supermarket Labor Union <i>vs</i>. <span class=SpellE>Ericta</span>,<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn7' href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
wherein it was made clear that from the enactment of the Industrial Peace Act
in 1953, there was no doubt as to the exclusive power of the Court of
Industrial Relations in unfair labor practice cases.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;The petition cited S.M.B. Box Factory Workers Union <i>vs</i>.
Judge <span class=SpellE>Victoriano</span>, a 1957 decision.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It could have referred to an earlier decision
promulgated the year before, Reyes <i>vs</i>. Tan.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was made clear in the opinion of the
Court, through the <span class=SpellE><i>ponente</i></span>, Justice J.B.L.
Reyes, that with an element of an unfair labor practice present, 'then the
application for injunction would have been exclusively cognizable by the Court
of Industrial Relations and beyond the jurisdiction of the respondent Court of
First Instance.' Subsequent to S.M.B. Box Factory Workers Union <i>vs</i>.
Judge <span class=SpellE>Victoriano</span>, came Consolidated Labor Association
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
<i>vs</i>. <span class=SpellE>Caluag</span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There, the then Justice, later Chief Justice, <span class=SpellE>Concepcion</span>,
speaking for the Court, categorically affirmed:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>'Pursuant to section 5(a) of Republic Act No. 875, the Court of
Industrial Relations &quot;shall have jurisdiction over the prevention of
unfair labor practices and is empowered to prevent any person from engaging in
any unfair labor practice.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This power
shall be <i>exclusive</i> and shall not be affected by any other means of
adjustment or prevention that has been or may be established by an agreement,
code, <span class=GramE>law</span> or otherwise.&quot; . . . Construing this
provision, in relation to section 9 of the same Act, regulating the issuance of
injunctions in labor disputes, we have repeatedly held that courts of first
instance may <i>not</i> enjoin the picketing staged in connection with such
disputes, and that the jurisdiction to entertain a petition to enjoin said
picketing and to issue the corresponding writ of injunction is vested <i>exclusively</i>
in the Court of Industrial Relations, if charges of unfair labor practice, in
relation to said labor disputes, are pending before the latter court prior to
the filing of said petition.' In that same year of 1958, this Court, again
speaking through <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Justice J.B.L. Reyes,
in Erlanger and <span class=SpellE>Galinger</span>, Inc. <i>vs</i>. Erlanger
and <span class=SpellE>Galinger</span> Employees Association, had occasion to
explain at length the rationale for such a norm:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>'The reason for such <i>exclusive</i>
jurisdiction is obvious.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since the
picketing and strikes may be mere incidents or consequences of the unfair labor
practice, it is but proper that the issuance of injunction be made by the court
having jurisdiction over the main case, in order that the writ be issued upon
cognizance of all relevant facts.' So it has been since then, the latest case
being Chan Bros., Inc. <i>vs</i>. <span class=SpellE>Federacion</span> <span
class=SpellE>Obrera</span> de la <span class=SpellE>Industria</span> <span
class=SpellE>Tabaquera</span>, promulgated barely three months ago.&quot;</span><a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'> As of the time of the issuance of the
challenged preliminary injunction by respondent Judge, there were six other
decisions rendered by this Court.</span><a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn9'

style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'> Respondent Judge apparently was not
sufficiently alert to the implication that the complaint for damages before him
was filed by management against two labor unions, one being composed of men
working in his establishment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He should
have been placed on guard, moreover, from the allegation that the grievance
complained of arose from picketing conducted in a context of violence.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He should </span>have at the very least then,
displayed a little more caution and could have refrained from issuing the
injunction <i>ex </i><span class=SpellE><i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt'>parte</span></i></span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></span>Ordinary prudence would seem to
require that the labor unions be heard.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Even assuming that there was urgency, he could have compelled the
parties to appear before him forthwith.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Had those steps been taken, he could have a better understanding of the
relevant circumstances and could have avoided trespassing on the jurisdiction
of the Court of Industrial Relations.</p>

<p class=NUM>2. There is pertinence to the observation that in controversies
between parties whose relationship is not fleeting or transient but continuing
as in the case of labor and management, the arbiter must ever be kept abreast
of developments for his decision to be based on the actualities of the
situation and thus impressed with solidity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It is difficult to say in this particular case that the parties had kept
this Court fully informed of subsequent events.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>While an oral argument was scheduled, there was instead a plea by the
litigants that they be heard on their respective memoranda.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was none forthcoming.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What is worse with the passage of time that
has elapsed, the thought may be indulged, and not unreasonably, that the fires
of acrimony had sufficiently cooled for a tolerable measure of industrial peace
to have been restored.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If such indeed be
the case, then the dismissal of the complaint with damages by the lower court
for lack of jurisdiction would terminate matters.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If it were not so, then the parties can
pursue their remedies in accordance with the new Labor Code, which abolished
the Court of Industrial Relations and provided for labor arbiters as well as
the National Labor Relations Commission in its place.<a style='mso-footnote-id:
