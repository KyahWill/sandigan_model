 11, 1964</st1:date>, respectively, of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte (<span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span>,
Branch II).</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are admitted by both parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 22, 1963, the heirs of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Reganon</span>
filed a complaint for recovery of ownership and possession of about one-hectare
portion of a parcel of land (Lot No. 1 or Lot No. 4952, situated at <span class="SpellE">Miasi</span>, <span class="SpellE">Polanco</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte, covered by O.T.C. No. 1447, with an
area of 7.9954 hectares), with damages, against <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
Imperial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant not having filed an answer within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period, the plaintiffs on <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1963</st1:date> filed a motion to declare the former
in default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court granted the
motion in its order dated <st1:date year="1963" day="10" month="4">April 10,
 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1963</st1:date>,
the plaintiffs presented their evidence <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>
before the Clerk of Court acting as Commissioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> on May 6, 1963, rendered a decision
declaring the plaintiffs lawful owners of the land in question and entitled to
it peaceful possession and enjoyment; ordering defendant immediately to vacate
the portion occupied by him and to restore the peaceful possession thereof to
plaintiffs; and sentencing defendant to pay plaintiffs the amount of P1,929.20
and the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1963</st1:date>,
the plaintiffs filed a motion for issuance of a writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was granted by the trial court in its
order of <st1:date year="1963" day="9" month="12">December 9, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Deputy Provincial Sheriff submitted on February 8, 1964 a
sheriff's return of proceedings reporting the garnishment and sale of a <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> and goat belonging to defendant for P153.00, and
the attachment and sale of defen­dant's parcel of land covered by Tax
Declaration No. 4694, situated in <span class="SpellE">Sicet</span>, <span class="SpellE">Polanco</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte, for
P500.00 - both sales having been made to the only bidder, plaintiffs' counsel
Atty. Vic T. <span class="SpellE">Lacaya</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1964</st1:date>,
the Philippine National Bank deposited in the Philippine National Bank-<span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> Branch the residuary estate of its former ward, <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> Imperial, in the sum of P10,303.80, pursuant to an
order of Branch I of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
del Norte in Sp. Proc. No. R-145.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1964</st1:date>,
the heirs of said <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> Imperial, one of whom is
defendant, executed a Deed of Extrajudicial Partition of the residuary estate,
wherein was apportioned P1,471.97 as defendant <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
Imperial's share.</p>

<p class="BODY">Informed of this development, the plaintiffs filed on June 5,
1964 an <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> motion for issuance of
an alias writ of execution and of an order directing the manager, or the
representative, of the Philippine National Bank-<span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span>
Branch, to hold the share of defendant and deliver the same to the provincial
sheriff of the province to be applied to the satisfaction of the balance of the
money judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was granted by the
trial court (Branch II) in its order dated <st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="6">June 9, 1964</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1964</st1:date>,
the Deputy Provincial Sheriff issued a sheriff's notification for levy
addressed to defen­dant, giving notice of the garnishments of the rights,
interests, shares and participation that defendant may have over the residuary
estate of the late <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> Imperial, consisting of
the money deposited in the Philippine National Bank-<span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span>
Branch.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant, through counsel, appearing for the first time before
the trial court, on <st1:date year="1964" day="24" month="6">June 24, 1964</st1:date>
filed a motion for reconsideration of the order dated <st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="6">June 9, 1964</st1:date>, and to quash the alias writ of
execution issued pursuant to it, to which plaintiffs filed their opposition on <st1:date year="1964" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="14" month="7">July
 14, 1964</st1:date>, the trial court denied defendant's aforesaid motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant's second motion for reconsideration likewise having
been denied by the trial court in its order of August 11, 1964, defendant
appealed to Us, raising the following issues:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(1)<span style="" times="" new="" roman="" ;="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Upon the death of a ward, is the money
accumulated in his guardianship proceedings and deposited in a bank, still
considered in <span class="SpellE"><u>custodia</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>legis</u></span>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(2)<span style="" times="" new="" roman="" ;="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Is the residuary estate of a <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
veteran, which consists in the aggregate accumulated sum from the monthly
allowances given him by the United States Veterans Administration (USVA) during
his lifetime, exempt from execu­tion?</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant-appellant argues that the property of an incompetent
under guardianship is in <span class="SpellE"><u>custodia</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>legis</u></span> and therefore can not be attached.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that in a former case<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
it was held that property under <span class="SpellE"><u>custodia</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>legis</u></span> can not be attached.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this was under the old Rules of
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The new Rules of Court<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
now specifically provides for the procedure to be followed in case what is
attached is in <span class="SpellE"><u>custodia</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>legis</u></span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The clear import of this new provision is that property under <span class="SpellE"><u>custodia</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>legis</u></span> is
now attachable, subject to the mode set forth in said rule.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the ward having died, the guardianship pro­ceedings no
longer subsist:</p>

<blockquote>"The death of the ward necessarily ter­minates the
guardianship, and thereupon all powers and duties of the guardian cease, ex­cept
the duty, which remains, to make a pro­per accounting and settlement in the
probate court."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As a matter of fact, the guardianship proceedings was ordered
conditionally closed by Branch I of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte in which it was pending, in its order
of February 8, 1964, where it stated -</p>

<blockquote>"In the meantime, the guardian Philippine National Bank is
hereby directed to deposit the residuary estate of said ward with its bank
agency in <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span>, this province, in the name of the
estate of the deceased ward <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> Imperial,
preparatory to the eventual distribution of the same to the heirs when the
latter shall be known, and <u>upon proof of deposit of said residuary estate</u>,
<u>the guardian Philippine National Bank shall forthwith be relieved from any
responsibility as such</u>, <u>and this proceedings shall be considered closed
and terminated</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">And the condition has long been
fulfilled, because on <st1:date year="1964" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1964</st1:date>
the Philippine National Bank Manila deposited the residuary estate of the ward
with the Philippine National Bank-<span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> Branch,
evidenced by a receipt attached to the records in Sp. Proc. No. R-145.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">When <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> Imperial died on <st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="9">September 13, 1962</st1:date>, the rights to his
succession - from the moment of his death - were transmitted to his heirs, on
of whom is his son and heir, defendant-appellant herein.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
This automatic transmission can not but proceed, with greater ease and
certainty than in this case where the parties agree that the re­siduary estate
is not burdened with any debt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For,</p>

<blockquote>"The rights to the succession of a per­son are transmitted
from the moment of death, and where, as in this case, the heir is of le­gal age
and the estate is not burdened with any debts, said heir immediately succeeds,
by force of law, to the dominion, ownership, and possession of the properties
of his <span class="SpellE">prodecessor</span> and consequently stands legally in
the shoes of the latter."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">That the interest of an heir in the
estate of a deceased person may be attached for purposes of execution, even if
the estate is in the process of settlement before the courts, is already a
settled matter in this jurisdiction.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is admitted that the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span>
Imperial, including herein defendant-appellant, have on <st1:date year="1964" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1964</st1:date> executed a Deed of Extrajudicial
Partition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This instru­ment suffices to
settle the entire estate of the decedent - provided all the requisites for its
validity are fulfilled<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
- even without the approval of the court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, the estate for all practical purposes has been settled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The heirs are at full liberty to withdraw the
residuary estate from the Philippine National Bank-<span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span>
Branch and divide it among themselves.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The only reason they have not done so is because of the alleged illegal
withdrawal from said estate of the amount of P1,080.00 by<span style="">&nbsp; </span>one Gloria Gomez by authority of Branch I of
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte,
which incident is now on appeal before the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This appeal, however, does not detract any
from the fact that the guardianship proceedings is closed and terminated and
the re­siduary estate no longer under <span class="SpellE"><u>custodia</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>legis</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, it is defendant-appellant’s position that the residuary
estate of <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> Imperial, a former <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
veteran, having been set aside from the monthly allowances given him by the
United States Veterans Administration (USVA) during his lifetime, is exempt
from execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Any pension, annuity, or gratuity granted by a Govern­ment to its
officers or employees in recognition of past services rendered, is primordially
aimed at tiding them over during their old age and/or disability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is therefore aright <span class="SpellE"><u>personalissima</u></span>,
purely personal because founded on necessity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It requires no argument to show that where the recipient dies, the
necessity motivating or underlying its grant necessarily ceases to be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even more so in this case where the law<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
providing for the exemption is calcu­lated to benefit U.S. veterans residing here,
and is therefore merely a manifestation of comity.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, as earlier stated, the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span>
Imperial, one of whom is appellant, have already executed a Deed of
Extrajudicial Partition - the end result of which is that the property is no
longer the property of the estate but of the individual heirs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it is settled that:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>When the heirs by mutual agreement have divided the estate
among themselves</u>, one of the heirs can not thereafter secure the
appointment of an administrator to take charge of and administer the estate or
a part thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The property is no
longer the property of the estate, but of the individual heirs, whether it
remains undivided or not</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>
