				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition, later amended, for <i>certiorari</i> to review the
decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G. R. No. L-30233, <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tinio</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span> <span class="SpellE">Cura</span>, et al., which modified the judgment of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>
in Civil Case No. 3231, <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> <span class="SpellE">Tinio</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span> <span class="SpellE">Cura</span>, et al.</p>

<p class="BODY">A careful review of the records reveal the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">The original petition herein was filed on <st1:date year="1963" day="17" month="9">September 17, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its resolution of <st1:date year="1963" day="26" month="9">September 26, 1963</st1:date>, the Court dismissed said
petition, for being factual and for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Copy of this resolution was received by petitioner Luis Camacho
on <st1:date year="1963" day="16" month="10">October 16, 1963</st1:date>, but
it does not appear when the other petitioners were served with it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On October 21, 1963, Camacho, personally and
assisted by Atty. Abraham R. <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>, filed a
motion for extension of fifteen (15) days from the expiration of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period within which to present a motion for <span style="">reconsideration, which period was to expire
October 31, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By resolution of </span><st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="10"><span style="">October
 25, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, the motion
for extension was granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the extended
period for petitioner Camacho to move for reconsideration was to expire </span><st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="11"><span style="">November
 15, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="11"><span style="">November 8, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>
filed his formal appearance "as additional counsel for petitioner Luis
Camacho."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the same date November 8, 1963, petitioners (no longer Camacho
alone), albeit thru Atty. <span class="SpellE">Llorente</span> (who was counsel
of Camacho as <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> in the court below) and
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>, filed a motion for leave to file an
amended petition for <i>certiorari</i>, claiming that they have realized that
an amended petition instead <span style="">of a motion
for reconsideration would be preferable in order that the real and new issues
may be presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By resolution of </span><st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="11"><span style="">November
 14, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, this
motion for leave was denied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="11"><span style="">November 15, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, petitioner filed his announced amended
petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1963</st1:date>,
the amended petition was dismissed for lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resolution of dismissal was served on
Attys. <span class="SpellE">Llorente</span> and <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>
on <st1:date year="1963" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1963</st1:date>,
petitioners, thru Attys. <span class="SpellE">Llorente</span> &amp; Associates
and Abraham R. <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>, moved for reconsideration
of the dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By resolution of <st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="12">December 18, 1963</st1:date>, the motion was
denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of this denial, Attys. <span class="SpellE">Llorente</span> &amp; Associates and <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>
were notified on <st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Without leave of court,
on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="12"><span style="">December 23, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, Attys. <span class="SpellE">Llorente</span> &amp; Associates and <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> filed a second motion for reconsideration on
behalf of petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that
by resolution of </span><st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="1"><span style="">January 8, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Court reconsidered its resolutions of
November 25 and </span><st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="12"><span style="">December 18, 1963</span></st1:date><span style=""> and gave due course to the amended petition
for <i>certiorari</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After mature deliberation, We have come to ineludible conclusion
that the Court has no more authority or jurisdiction over this case, except to
formally set aside the resolution of <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="1">January
 8, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can be no
question that on said date, the resolution of this Court dismissing the
original as well as the amended petitions herein had already become final and
unalterable.</p>

<p class="BODY">As can be seen above, the last day for the filing of a motion for
reconsideration of the resolution of the Court dismissing the original petition
was <st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1963</st1:date>,
taking into account the motion for extension filed by petitioner Camacho on <st1:date year="1963" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(The other petitioners <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cura</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ismaela</span> <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> did not ask for extension.) Instead of filing a
motion for re­consideration, petitioners, which would include <span class="SpellE">Cura</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>, filed, thru
Attys. <span class="SpellE">Llorente</span> &amp; Associates &amp; <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>, an amended petition for <i>certiorari</i> on <st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1963</st1:date>, notwithstanding
their motion for leave for such substitution was denied on <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, the fact that petitioners filed an amended petition instead
of a motion for reconsideration did not affect the running of the period for
the finality of the resolution of dismissal of <st1:date year="1963" day="26" month="9">September 26, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, an amended petition raising new issues not alleged in the
original petition and filed beyond the period for appeal to the Supreme Court
from the Court of Appeals is not allowed, hence the denial resolution
aforementioned of <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even if We considered the amended
petition as a motion for reconsideration and disregarding the fact that it
raises belatedly issues and questions not raised in the original petition, its
dismissal on November 25, 1963, had the effect of making the dismissal of
petitioners' appeal to this Court final after December 1, 1963, under the most
liberal interpretation of the rules existing at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Rules of 1940.) Note that counsel for
petitioners were notified of the resolution of November 25, 1963 on November
29, 1963, and since they were entitled to move the day after notice, and this
was November 30, 1963, a public holiday, hence their last day became December
1, 1963.</p>

<p class="BODY">Therefore, when petitioners filed on December 14, 1963 their
motion for reconsideration of the dismissal resolution of November 25, 1963,
which was served on their counsel on November 29, 1963, they assumed that
because they had filed an amended petition instead of a motion for reconsideration,
they acquired a new period of fifteen (15) days from denial thereof to move for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, that
assumption is incorrect.</p>

<p class="BODY">But even assuming they had a new period, their motion for
reconsideration (amended petition) was denied on <st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="12">December 18, 1963</st1:date> and copy of the denial resolution was
served on their counsel on <st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="12">December
 20, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since their motion
for reconsideration filed on <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="12">December
 14, 1963</st1:date> was filed on the last day, therefore, the denial
resolution of <st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="12">December 18, 1963</st1:date>
received by them on <st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1963</st1:date>,
became final at the latest <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="12">December
 22, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to
Section 1 of Rule 56 of the Rules of 1940, then in force, the latest a second
motion for reconsideration could be filed was "within two days from notice
of the order denying the first motion.”<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this case this notice of denial was served on <st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it being indisputable that petitioners'
second motion for reconsideration was filed only on <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="12">December 23, 1963</st1:date>, it was late.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, furthermore, it was filed without leave
of court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, after a re-study of the original as well as the
amended petition in the light of the decision of the Court of Appeals sought to
be reviewed, We are convinced that the main issues raised by petitioners necessarily
involve findings of fact of that Court which are not shown to be unsupported by
substantial evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court resolved to set aside the resolution
of <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1963</st1:date> and to
declare its orders of dismissal of <st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="11">November
 25, 1963</st1:date> (including the resolution of <st1:date year="1963" day="26" month="9">September 26, 1963</st1:date>) final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>
