purchase a lot belonging to said City then being allocated to
occupants-applicants pursuant to its Ordinance No. 13, Series of 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>G. R. No. L-24879, in turn, is an appeal from

<p class="BODY">In the particular lot herein in question, Lot No. 379­B-40,
containing 289 square meters, there were admittedly several occupants, namely,
appellants Isabel G. <span class="SpellE">Cabungcal</span>, married to Juan <span class="SpellE">Cabungcal</span>, and Socorro <span class="SpellE">Paez</span>,
married to <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> <span class="SpellE">Paez</span>,
and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Hablo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Apolonia</span>
Bolivar and <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Daisy <span class="SpellE">Gustilo</span>
actually having their respective houses thereon "at the time the City of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> (has) made known, in writing, (of) its desire to
acquire this lot from the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation." It is
undisputed that each of them occupied varying areas within said lot as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the <span class="SpellE">Cabungcals</span>
occupied 36 square meters, the <span class="SpellE">Paezes</span> 36, <span class="SpellE">Hablo</span> 33, Bolivar 14 and <span class="SpellE">Gustilo</span>
170.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Daisy <span class="SpellE">Gustilo</span>
fil­ed her application to purchase on <st1:date year="1958" day="3" month="6">June

 1958</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no showing as
to when the others filed their applications; anyway, their applications are not
involved here.</p>

<p class="BODY">Claiming that "he could award the lot without holding a
lottery because petitioners, in their letters to the City Council of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> (Exhibit A-4) and interview or conference with the
City Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> (Exhibit A-5), reiterated the
desire to buy only the parts of the lot, actually occupied by their houses and
did not ask for the holding of a lottery or raffle and that he was empowered by
sec. 6 of the ordinance to implement its provisions when the sale of the lot is
not covered by the provisions of the ordinance", on November 10, 1958, the
Mayor awarded the lot to <span class="SpellE">Gustilo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Cabungcal</span> et <span class="SpellE">als</span>. vs. Cordova etc. et <span class="SpellE">als</span>., G.
R. No. L-16934, 11 SCRA 584), reason for which, the <span class="SpellE">Cabungcals</span>
and the <span class="SpellE">Paezes</span> filed Civil Case No. 5186 to annul
said award and to compel the Mayor to adhere to and comply with the
ordinance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They won in the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental whose de­cision
was affirmed by this Court on <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="7">July 31,
 1964</st1:date> in the case just cited.</p>

<p class="BODY">In apparent obedience to the said decision of this Court, on <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="3">March 3, 1965</st1:date>, the Mayor notified the
parties, the <span class="SpellE">Cabungcals</span>, <span class="SpellE">Paezes</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Gustilo</span>, that to determine the sole <span class="SpellE">awardee</span> of the lot in question, a lottery would be held in
his office on <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On said date, however, <span class="SpellE">Gusti­lo</span>
presented her objection to the holding of the lottery on the ground that she
had already acquired the portion occu­pied by Bolivar of 14 square meters on
December 8, 1958 and that occupied by <span class="SpellE">Hablo</span> of 33
square meters on September 25, 1959 and that insofar as that occupied by the <span class="SpellE">Cabungcals</span> of 36 square meters, the same was delivered to
her by virtue of a writ of execution of a final judgment of <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
and a sub­sequent order of demolition dated January 20, 1965 of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and that consequently, being already the occupant of more than 2/3 of the lot
in dispute, under the ordinance, she should be deem­ed and considered the <span class="SpellE">awardee</span> thereof to the exclusion of all the other occupants
of the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Mayor found <span class="SpellE">Gustilo's</span> objection well taken, refused to conduct any
lottery and, accordingly, made a report to the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> of his
resolu­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Manifestation, pp. 43-45,

<p class="BODY">The first point raised by appellants in G. R. No. L-­24794, the <span class="SpellE">Cabungcals</span> and the <span class="SpellE">Paezes</span>, is
that of alleged <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>adjudicata</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is contended that the issue of whether or
not <span class="SpellE">Gustilo</span> is the occupant of more than 2/3 of the
lot in question was already resolved in the decision of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
in the present case as affirmed by this Court in G. R. No. L-16934.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is alleged that inasmuch as in the
separate answers of <span class="SpellE">Gustilo</span> and the Mayor, they
respect­ively alleged that <span class="SpellE">Gustilo</span> was entitled to
the award because she was actually occupying more than 200 square meters, that
is, more than 2/3 of the area of the lot in controversy, but failed to prove
said allegation, it follows that that issue was necessarily involved in said
proceeding and must be deemed resolved therein and may not, therefore, be re­opened
anymore, in the present proceeding which is only a post judgment proceeding of
execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, con­sidering
that the order challenged herein is supposed to be an implementation of the
invoked decision of this Court (in G. R. No. L-16934), the point of appellants
is that inasmuch as this case is already in the stage of execution, the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> had no authority to reopen any matter which had been litigated by
the parties before the decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' premise is not exactly true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the allegations referred to did appear
in the answers of <span class="SpellE">Gustilo</span> and the Mayor, for reasons
which are not extant in the record, the parties evidently chose not to battle
on this issue, for in the stipulation of facts submitted jointly by them and
which served as the basis of the decision in G. R. No. L-­16934, nothing of the
pretension about <span class="SpellE">Gustilo's</span> occupancy of more than 2/3
appears, and, on the contrary, the award made by the Mayor to <span class="SpellE">Gustilo</span> which was attached to the said stipulation of facts
and made part thereof, clearly stated that <span class="SpellE">Gustilo</span>
was occupying only 170 square meters.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Evidently, the parties adjusted the issue to the actual incontrovertible
facts, for these were to the effect that whereas, the stipu­lation of facts is
dated <st1:date year="1959" day="3" month="7">July 3, 1959</st1:date>, the
renunciation of <span class="SpellE">Hablo</span> took place only on <st1:date year="1959" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 14-15, <span class="SpellE">Ap­pellee</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gustilo's</span> Brief.) Clearly, therefore, the decision in
G. R. No. L-16934 cannot be deemed to have resolved the issue in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, as may be seen from the deci­sion of
this Court, and as earlier stated herein, the only contention of the Mayor
passed upon in that decision was his" claim that he could award the lot
without holding a lot­tery because petitioners (meaning appellants herein), in
their letters to the City Council of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> (Exhibit
A-4) and interview and conference with the City Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>
(Exhibit A-5), reiterated their desire to buy only the parts of the lot
actually occupied by their houses and did not ask for the holding of a lottery
or raffle; and that he was empowered by section 6 of the ordinance to implement
its provisions when the sale of the lot is not covered by the provisions of the
ordinance", ( 11 SCRA 584, 588) and nothing was said therein about the
issue of whether or not <span class="SpellE">Gustilo</span> was already occupying
more than 2/3 of said lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
appellants' first assignment of error in G. R. No. L-24794 is overruled.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rest of the assignment of errors revolves around appellants'
position that since <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Gustilo</span>
was admit­tedly occupying only 170 square meters or less than 2/3 of the lot
when she applied on <st1:date year="1958" day="3" month="6">June 3, 1958</st1:date>,
it is immaterial to the application of the above-quoted provisions of the
ordinance that she subsequently acquired the additional a­reas in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, appellants' point is
that, un­der the ordinance, it is the area being occupied by the parties
"at the time the City of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> (has) formally
made known, in writing, (of) its desire to acquire this lot from the Rehabilitation
Finance Corporation (RFC)" that should control.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not very clear to Us that such is the intent of the
ordinance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are more inclined to
believe that as it is evident that the ordinance contemplates that the lot
should be awarded to only one of the occupants, in the very nature of things,
it tends to favor the one occupying the biggest portion thereof and the 2/3
requirement is just a convenient and expeditious device of accomplishing said
purpose and of avoiding possible suspicions of arbitrariness and favoritism,
hence, a substantial compliance therewith would suffice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely, to demand the exact computation of
the measurement of the areas respectively occupied by each occupant up to the
last square inch would be absurd.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as
to the date of occupancy, We are not convinced that the wording of the
ordinance now before Us excludes the possible construction that the date of
reference is the date of the award, which is as consistent a construction as
any other with the primordial purpose of the same of making the award to the
occupant of the largest area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants
themselves admit that the phraseology of the ordinance is susceptible of-'this
interpretation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On pages 25-26 of their
brief, appellants point out:</p>

<blockquote>"We began this discussion by the hypothetical proposition that
to be exempted from the raffle, the applicant must possess 2/3 of the lot on
the date the application to buy is filed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is because of the absence of the phrase ‘on the date <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
made known its desire to acquire this RFC lot' in paragraph c) so that the said
paragraph c) may be interpreted in several ways.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could mean that the applicant, to be
exempted, must possess or occupy the 2/3 either:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(1) <span style=""> </span>on the day <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
made known its desire to acquire the RFC lot; or</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>on the day of the filing of the application to
buy; or</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>on<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the day of making of the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>award;
or</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>“(4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>on<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the day of the making of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>deed of
sale; or</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>“(5)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>on any date that possession or occupation of
the 2/3 or more of the lot actually takes place." [Underscoring supplied]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In any event, to consider the date of the award as the date of
reference is not an unreasonable construction of the ordinance, particularly
when it is considered that 2/3 of 289 square meters, the area of the whole lot,
is 192 2/3, and as early as December 8, 1958, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gustilo</span> was al­ready occupying 170 square meters, her
originally occupied area, plus 14 square meters (acquired from <span class="SpellE">Apolonia</span> Bolivar) or a total of 184 square meters, which is
only 8 2/3 square meters short of the required area, not to speak anymore of
the 33 additional square meters she acquired from <span class="SpellE">Hablo</span>
as early as September 25, 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when
it is considered further that as paragraph (a) of section 3 of the <span class="SpellE">orginance</span> is worded, it is important only that the
applicant should actually have a house on the lot, which <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gustilo</span> did have, she may be deemed as having
substantially fulfilled the requisites of the said ordinance.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the relief prayed for in the complaint below is basically
for a writ of mandamus, and We find that appel­lants' right is not clear, much
less indubitable, We hold that appellants' appeal in G. R. No. L-24794 cannot
be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">With this result the issues in G. R. No. L-24879 are now moot and
academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the action
therein is, at bottom, to nullify the award made to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gustilo</span> on <st1:date year="1958" day="10" month="11">November
 10, 1958</st1:date> which has already been set aside in G. R. No.
L-16934.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, there are therein
the issue also of the validity of the judgment in favor of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gustilo</span> in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
case filed by her against appel­lants, the <span class="SpellE">Cabungcals</span>,
based on her title T.C.T. 17115, acquired in consequence of the November 10,
1958 award, as well as the issue also of the validity of the writ of exe­cution
and the order of demolition issued pursuant to said judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already stated, in view of Our decision in
G. R. No. L-24794, under which, in effect, We hold that the award to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Gustilo</span> of the lot in
question would not be <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the Ordinance 13,
series of 1959, of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
it will serve no useful purpose to go into the merits of the issues in G. R.
No. L-24879.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not that We have not gone
over the records and the contentions of the parties therein; in fact, We have
done so, and, on the whole, We are satisfied there do not exist sufficient
grounds to disturb the actuations and judgment appealed from.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, the judgment of the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> dismissing the complaint in its Civil Case No. 7544 is
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Affirmed also is its appealed
order of <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1965</st1:date> in
its Civil Case No. 5186.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs in
