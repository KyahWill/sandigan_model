moved for the reconsideration of the foregoing decision in so far as it held 
that the deposit was not a valid consignation and in not holding that the 
plaintiffs were liable for the loss of the amount consigned in Court for the 
reason that judicial notice of the deposit was served upon and acknowledged by 
them. The plaintiffs objected to the motion for reconsideration on the ground 
that the notice and acknowledgment of the deposit, Annexes "A" and "B" did not 
form part of the records of the case on appeal and they could not be taken into 
consideration.

for new trial for the admission of Annexes "A" and "B" above-mentioned-and for

the sheriff from modifying or supplementing the judgment sought to be executed, 
alleging: (1) that the redemption prices of the two lots were P2,500.00 and 
P600.00, respectively, or P3,100.00 in all, and since they had deposited 
P4,100.00 there was an excess of P1,000.00 which should be applied to the unpaid 
rentals; and (2) that inasmuch as the redemption was effected in 1959 the yearly 
rental of 135 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span> of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> corresponding to the agricultural year 1958-59 should 
be excluded from the computation. The motion was denied by respondent court on

are</span> reiterated here in support of the petition. The first allegation is 
groundless. When the <span class="SpellE">Cabanos</span> spouses redeemed the 
first lot from the original vendees they paid not only P2<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> but also the price of 230 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span> of <span class="SpellE">palay</span>, at P4.00 a <span class="SpellE">cavan</span> or P920.00 representing the rents in arrears for two 
years. Added to the P600.00 they paid to <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Calo</span> for the other lot, the total amount disbursed by 
them was P4<span class="GramE">,020.00</span>, just P80.00 less than the sum of 
P4,100.00 deposited by the petitioners in court. This excess of P80.00 was 
properly applied to the rents still unpaid. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The second allegation of the 
petitioners is likewise without merit. From 1942 to 1947 the unpaid rents on the 
two lots amounted to 655 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span> of <span class="SpellE">palay</span>. Thereafter, until the redemption was effected on 
</span><st1:date month="10" day="30" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 30, <span class="GramE">1959</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> ,</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> or for a period of twelve (12) 
years, the rents amounted to 1,620 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span>. Contrary to 
the petitioners' claim the rent for the agricultural year 1958-1959 was properly 
included, since the redemption of the lands by them took place after the said 
agricultural year had ended in March 1959. All in all, the petitioners' 
liability for rents under the judgment summed up to 2,275 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span> of <span class="SpellE">palay</span>, equivalent to 
P9<span class="GramE">,100.00</span> at P4.00 a <span class="SpellE">cavan</span>. 
From this amount the <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond of P2<span class="GramE">,000</span>. 00, which had been paid to the respondents, should be 
deducted, thus leaving a balance of P7<span class="GramE">,100.00</span>, to which 
again the sum of P80.00 should be credited. This computation is the basis of the 
sheriff's letter of </span><st1:date month="3" day="9" year="1962"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 9, <span class="GramE">1962</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> ,</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> sent to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Calo</span>, Jr., demanding 
payment of P7,000.00 pursuant to the order of execution issued by respondent 
court. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The petitioners say that in said 
letter they are being made to pay the aforesaid amount jointly and severally, 
when there is nothing in the judgment sought to be executed which imports 
solidarity. This claim is without basis. The demand was logically for the whole 
judgment debt, and was addressed to <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Calo</span>, Jr. alone, not because he was <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable but because he was the lawyer of the other 
petitioners and all of them, according to the sheriff, were relying on his 
decision. As pointed out by the respondents, it is of no importance to them how 
the petitioners share in the obligation as long as it is satisfied in full, 
failing which the two lots in question may properly be levied upon and sold at 
public auction. This is precisely what was explained in the letter of the 
sheriff to which the petitioners take such vehement exception. The threatened 
levy on the land -which after all belonged to the original defendant, <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Calo</span>, Sr., - in order 
to satisfy the indebtedness contracted by him, does not render the liability of 
his successors-in-interest, the petitioners herein, joint and several. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The writ prayed for is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span>, 
with costs against the petitioners. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
