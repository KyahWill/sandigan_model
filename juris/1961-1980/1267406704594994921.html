				<BR><BR><div align=""><div class="Section1"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"></span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Policarpio</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> C. <span class="SpellE">Alisoso</span>, a physician by profession, filed a petition before 
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> praying that an 
order be issued striking out his name from the record of birth of one <span class="SpellE">Leonilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Lastimoso</span> appearing in the 
Office of the Local Civil Registrar of <span class="SpellE">Pinarnungajan</span>, 
<span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, to the end that he may not be associated with 
the paternity of said child.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The petition recites that on 
</span><st1:date month="1" day="28" year="1960"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 28, <span class="GramE">1960</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">,</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> a child by the name of <span class="SpellE">Leonilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Lastimoso</span> was reported to 
the Local Civil Registrar of <span class="SpellE">Pinamungajan</span>, 
</span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Cebu</span></span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> by one <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Lastimoso</span> as the child 
of petitioner and was entered as such in the registry of birth of said office. 
After having been informed of said false entry, petitioner immediately contacted 
<span class="SpellE">Tarcela</span> <span class="SpellE">Lastimoso</span>, mother of 
<span class="SpellE">Leonilo</span>, to ascertain if said entry was made with her 
knowledge and consent. <span class="SpellE">Tarcela</span>, in an affidavit, 
declared that she had not authorized anyone to register said child the office of 
the above civil registrar, nor did she personally register, nor caused to have 
said child registered in said office. Said <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span> Q. 
<span class="SpellE">Lastimoso</span> was <span class="GramE">not the midwife 
nor</span> the nurse who attended the delivery of <span class="SpellE">Tarcela</span> <span class="SpellE">Lastimoso</span>, nor did she 
have any authority to report to the local civil registrar the false statement 
abovementioned. Petitioner was never married to <span class="SpellE">Tarcela</span> <span class="SpellE">Lastimoso</span> as was made to 
appear in said entry, for the truth is that he is already married to one <span class="SpellE">Irenea</span> <span class="SpellE">Hermosisima</span> whom he married 
on March 25, 1951. The record of the parish church of <span class="SpellE">Pinamungajan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> also discloses 
that while the mother appearing therein of said child is <span class="SpellE">Tarcela</span> <span class="SpellE">Lastimoso</span> the father 
appears recorded as "no <span class="SpellE">conocido</span>” 
(unknown).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">A representative of the Solicitor 
General appeared for respondents who moved for the dismissal of the petition on 
the ground that it does not state a cause of action because the correction 
sought to be made does not partake of a clerical error as contemplated in 
Article 412 of the new Civil Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The court <i>a</i> <i>quo</i>, 
after hearing, granted the petition ordering the Local Civil Registrar of <span class="SpellE">Pinamungajan</span> to strike out from his record the name of 
petitioner as the alleged father of minor <span class="SpellE">Leonilo</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Lastimoso</span> and state in lieu thereof that his father is 
unknown. Seasonably, the government has appealed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Solicitor General maintains 
that the court a quo erred in entertaining the petition by ordering the Local 
Civil Registrar of <span class="SpellE">Pinamungajan</span> to strike out the name 
of petitioner from the birth record of minor <span class="SpellE">Leonilo</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Lastimoso</span> as his father and in lieu thereof state that 
his father is unknown for the reason that the correction sought to be made is 
not merely clerical but involves a change that affects the paternity and <span class="SpellE">filiation</span> of both petitioner and the child <span class="SpellE">Leonilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Lastimoso</span>. Specifically, 
he lay stress on some rulings laid down by this Court wherein it was stated that 
what is contemplated in Article 412 of the new Civil Code “are mere correction 
of mistakes that are clerical in nature and not those that which may affect the 
civil status or the nationality or the citizenship of the persons involved" for 
"if it refers to a substantial change which affects the status or citizenship of 
a party, the matter should be threshed out in a proper action depending upon the 
nature of the issue involved" (<span class="SpellE">Ty</span> Kong Tin vs. 
Republic, 94 Phil. 321). In short, Article 412 authorizes not more than 
"harmless and innocuous changes such as correction of a name that is clearly 
misspelled, occupation of parents, etc." (<span class="SpellE">Ansaldo</span> vs. 
Republic, 102 Phil. 1046).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">But considering the peculiar 
facts obtaining in this case which are not disputed, to the effect that 
petitioner is not the father of minor <span class="SpellE">Leonilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Lastimoso</span>, nor has he any amorous relation with his mother 
<span class="SpellE">Tarcela</span>, as admitted in her affidavit, and that the 
one who reported that false entry, one <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span> Q. <span class="SpellE">Lastimoso</span>, is a mere interloper or one bereft of any 
authority to make such entry, which are parallel to the facts obtaining in the 
case of <span class="SpellE">Roces</span> vs. The Local Civil Registrar, of Manila 
(102 Phil. 1050), the court <i>a quo</i> granted the petition on the strength of 
the ruling laid down in the case abovementioned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The pertinent portion of the 
<span class="SpellE">Roces</span> case which needs to be mentioned here is as 
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"On January 7, 1956, appellant 
Joaquin P. <span class="SpellE">Roces</span> filed, the Court of First Instance of 
Manila, a petition alleging that he is married to <span class="SpellE">Pacita</span> <span class="SpellE">Carvajal</span>; that on November 
1, 1955, he came to know of the existence of a birth certificate registered wit" 
the Local Civil Registrar of Manila, certified true copy of which is attached to 
said complaint, mentioning him as the father of Ricardo Joaquin V. <span class="SpellE">Roces</span>, an illegitimate child; that said birth certificate 
shows, on its face, that it had boon executed with neither the knowledge nor the 
consent of the petitioner; and that said information with regard to the alleged 
paternity of Ricardo Joaquin V. <span class="SpellE">Roces</span> is false, and 
contrary to the provisions of Act No. 3753 and Article 230 of the Civil Code of 
the Philippines.<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">* * * * * * * 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The issue in the case at bar is, 
however, entirely cliffy t in nature. The legal status of Ricardo Joaquin V. 
<span class="SpellE">Roces</span> is not in dispute. The pleadings and his birth 
certificate show that he was born outside wedlock. The only questions before 
<span class="GramE">Us</span> whether the statements in said birth certificates 
identifying the alleged father of said child are valid and whether the Local 
Civil Registrar %vas justified in making the corresponding entry in the records 
of his office.<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">* * * * * * 
*<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"It appearing on the face of the 
birth certificate of Ricardo Joaquin V. <span class="SpellE">Roces</span>, that 
the alleged father of this child has not signed the instrument, it is clear that 
the statements therein relative to the identity of the father of this said child 
were, and are an open violation of the law. Consequently, the local civil 
registrar— who is duty bound to comply with said law and is partly charged with 
its enforcement—had no authority to incorporate said unlawful statements in the 
corresponding entry made by him in the records of his office, and that the 
entry, insofar as the identity of the father of Ricardo Joaquin V. <span class="SpellE">Roces</span>, is null and void, and should be cancelled or 
corrected."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Since the facts obtaining in both 
cases are parallel and are undisputed and show that the entry made in the 
corresponding local registrar is false and as such it should be corrected or 
deleted, we find no justifiable reason n for adopting a different ruling insofar 
as this case is concerned. In this sense, we agree with the views expressed by 
the court <i>a quo</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; text-transform: uppercase; font-family: Verdana;">Wherefore</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the order appealed from is 
affirmed. No costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
