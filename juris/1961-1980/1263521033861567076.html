First <span style="">Instance </span>of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> entitled "<span class="SpellE">Laureana</span>
Velasquez et al., <span style="">Plaintiffs, </span>versus
<span class="SpellE">Filidoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Asignar</span>,
Defendant," said court rendered judgment as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW THEREOF, Judgment is hereby rendered, condemning the
defendant to pay the plaintiff, <span class="SpellE">Laureana</span> Velasquez, <span style="">the </span>sum of FOUR THOUSAND (P4,000.00)
PESOS as damages, and to pay the costs of this action.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The action to compel the defendant to recognize the plaintiff Maria
<span class="SpellE">Bihildes</span> Velasquez as his acknowledged natural child
is <span style="">hereby </span>dismissed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Plaintiffs </span>seasonably
perfected <span style="">an </span>appeal <span style="">from </span>the above judgment insofar as it
dismissed their action to compel the defendant to acknowledge the plaintiff
Maria <span class="SpellE">Bihildes</span> Velasquez as his natural child, and
did not order <span style="">said </span>defendant to
support <span style="">her and pay attorney's
fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Their action against <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span style="">was </span>for
acknowledgment, sup­port and damages.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The latter <span style="">filed </span>an
answer in which he denied the material averments made in the complaint and
alleged, by way of affirmative defenses, that the complaint did not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action against him, and that the action was
in­stituted solely to harass, dishonor and embarrass him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the issues thus joined, the case was tried and subsequently
decided as set forth above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We quote
here the pertinent portion of the body of the appealed decision:</p>

<blockquote>"After a careful analysis of the con­flicting evidence on
record, the following facts have been established by a clear preponderance of
it:</blockquote>

<blockquote>The plaintiff, <span class="SpellE">Laureana</span> Velasquez, and
the defendant, <span class="SpellE">Filidoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Asignar</span>,
are natives of barrio Po-ok, <span class="SpellE">Mandawe</span>, this
province.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are both single.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In February, 1959 he courted her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After pressing his suit, he was accepted by
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1960" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1960</st1:date> which was Valen­tine Day, he <span class="GramE">gave</span> her a Valentine Card.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> A.) The
inscription "Awing" on the said card is her nickname.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the following day, Feb­ruary 15, he gave
her his picture (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 2).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said picture was taken by him from his
former sweetheart, a certain Milagros.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was given to her as proof that he and Milagros were already
separated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the evening of <st1:date year="1960" day="24" month="2">February
 24, 1960</st1:date>, her parents went to see a movie, leaving her alone in
their home in Po-ok.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He visited her on
the evening while they were absent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Taking advan­tage of her being alone, he kissed her; and then, not
satisfied with kissing, he demanded of her proof of her love to him - meaning,
of course, the surrender of her virtue.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At first, she refused to yield, saying that they were not married yet;
and, if they should become husband and wife, he could have the intercourse at
any<span style="">time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he pressed her, saying that she had no
fear because, after all, he was going to marry her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of his repeated promises to marry her
and his insistence, she yielded her virtue to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="24" month="2"><span style="">February 24, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, she was deflowered by the defendant for the
first time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After repeated assurance,
she yielded her body to him for the second time on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="7" month="3"><span style="">March 7, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>After the coitus, she became apprehensive because her parents might
discover her rela­tions with, him, and because she would become pregnant and
she was naturally ashamed, not being married.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So, she decided to go to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told her parents and him about her
trip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant tried to dissuade
her from making her trip; but she disregarded his advice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She left <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>
for <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> on <st1:date year="1960" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1960</st1:date>, arriving there on March 13.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She served as a laundry woman there for a
living.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a week she observed that
she had no Menstrua­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She <span style="">was </span>apprehensive
and more convinced that she was pregnant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So, she wrote him on <st1:date year="1960" day="27" month="3">March 27,
 1960</st1:date>, informing him of her incipient pregnancy, and imploring him
to send her P30.00 to pay for her return trip to <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She wrote him another letter with the same
request.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">D, D-1, E, E-1).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>He never answered them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She looked for him, wanting to see him
personally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She wrote him a letter on <st1:date year="1960" day="10" month="5">May 10, 1960</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
<span class="GramE">F, F-1); then again, on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="22" month="5"><span class="GramE">May 22, 1960</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>,
G, G-1.)</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only through the
mediation of the common friends, Luis <span class="SpellE">Suico</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sanorio</span>, that she was able to meet the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She ap­pealed to him to save her from her
difficult situation and marry her; but he refused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would appear that he was disgusted with
her because she left <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place> for <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
in March, against his advice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On November 27, she gave birth to her daughter, Maria <span class="SpellE">Bihildes</span> Velasquez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">H, I.)</span>
She asked him to give support to her child but he refused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She then sought the help of the Chief of
Police of <span class="SpellE">Mandawe</span>, a certain <span class="SpellE">Pris­ciliano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lumapas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Before the said official the defendant acknowledged the child as his own
but refused to give her support – proposing, how­ever, to have the child placed
in the custody of his mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
plaintiff did not wish to give up the child.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When pressed to give sup­port, he not only refused to do so, but even
denied his paternity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then she sought
the help of a social welfare worker, a certain Mrs. Lydia <span class="SpellE">Yadao</span>,
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Yadao</span> visited the de­fendant in his office at
the White Light Electrical Supply, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
and she persuaded him to appear at the Social Welfare Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There he admitted his paternity but refused
to give support because of lack of means, - pro­posing again to have the child
placed under the custody of his mother.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But the plaintiff did not accept the proposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff was thus compelled to file this
action."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> did not appeal, the
findings of fact made by the trial court must be deemed to have become final as
far as he is concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of
fact, appellants are also bound by them because in their appeal they raise only
questions of law as follows:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">"I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">THAT THE </span><st1:street><st1:address><span class="GramE">LOWER COURT</span></st1:address></st1:street><span class="GramE">
ERRED IN DIS­MISSING THE ACTION TO COMPEL DEFENDANT <span style="">TO RECOGNIZE PLAINTIFF CHILD AS HIS NATU­RAL CHILD.</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">II<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THAT THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER COURT</st1:address></st1:street>
ERRED IN NOT ORDERING THE DEFENDANT TO PAY PLAINTIFF SUPPORT AND ATTORNEY'S
FEES."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is obvious from the appealed decision that the trial court
dismissed appellants' action upon the ground that the evidence of record does
not show that appellant minor had been "in continuous possession of the status
of a child of the alleged father by the direct acts of the latter or of his
supposed family." On this question the court said:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
the evidence on record is not sufficient to establish the enjoyment by the
plaintiff child of the continuous status as natural child of the
defendant."</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the case at bar, there is neither a will nor a court
record, or any public docu­ment or writing expressly recognizing the plaintiff
child as the daughter of the <span class="GramE">defendant.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the basis for recognition must
be possession of continuous status of an acknowledged natural child of the
defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the defendant
acknowledged his paternity before the Chief of Police and the Social Worker on
different occasions is not sufficient to confer upon the child the re­quired
status.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The acts of recognition are
intermittent - not continuous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are
of short duration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, he refused to
give her support and denied his paternity later."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellants contend, however, that the trial court erred because
the true basis of their action for acknowl­edgment is not appellant minor's
continuous possession of the status of natural child of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
but the fact that she had evidence to show that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
is her father, <span style="">thus </span>imposing upon the latter the obligation to recognize her as
his natural child in accordance with paragraph 4 of Article 283 of the New
Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The allegations </span>made
in <span style="">paragraphs 2 to 6 of the complaint
(Record on Appeal pp. 4-5) fully support appel­lants' contention.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In line with the theory upon which appellants' action was based,
they presented evidence to prove that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is the
father of Maria <span class="SpellE">Bihildes</span> Velasquez con­sisting of the
testimony of her mother and co-appellant, <span class="SpellE">Laureana</span>
Velasquez; that of the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Mandawe</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, and Mrs. Lydia <span class="SpellE">Yadao</span>, and
of the documents admitted in evidence as <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">A to I, inclusive.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Resolving the question of whether or not <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
is the father of the minor Maria <span class="SpellE">Bihildes</span>, the trial
court said:</p>

<blockquote>"As for the second issue, it is proven that the defendant is
the father <span style="">of the </span>plain­tiff,
Maria <span class="SpellE">Bihildes</span> Velasquez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admits having had sexual intercourse with
her, al­though he claims that he had access to her in December, 1959; and,
considering the fact that the child was born on <st1:date year="1960" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1960</st1:date>, he could not have been her
father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the question of the dates of
the coitus between the plaintiff and the defendant, the Court is inclined to
give more credit to the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court takes judicial notice of the fact that Filipino women are timid and would
not expose themselves to dishonor and shame, un­less it <span class="GramE">be</span>
true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span style="">the case at </span>bar, the <span style="">plaintiff
</span>testified clearly and without hes­itation that it was the defendant who
de­flowered her once in the later part of Feb­ruary, and second in <span style="">the </span>first week of March, 1960 - not in
<span style="">December of 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The defen­dant did not even insinuate,
much less prove that the plaintiff had any illicit relation with another
man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, her testi­<span style="">mony on this score is </span>to be
believed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It appears, therefore, that upon the evidence of record, the
trial court made a positive finding "that the defendant is the father of
the plaintiff Maria <span class="SpellE">Bihildes</span> Velasquez"; that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> "admits having had sexual inter­course"
with <span class="SpellE">Laureana</span> Velasquez, although he claimed that
this took place in December 1959 and that this being so the appellant minor,
who was born on November 27, 1960 could not have teen his daughter; that
notwithstanding <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> contention regarding the
date when he had sex­ual intercourse with appellant <span class="SpellE">Laureana</span>
Velasquez, the trial court gave "more credit" to the latter who
testified that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had deflowered her in the
month of February 1959, and that she had a second sexual intercourse with him
in the first week of March 1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
trial court further ad­ded <span style="">that </span>"the
defendant did not even insinuate, much less <span style="">prove, that the plaintiff (<span class="SpellE">Laureana</span>
Velasquez) had any illicit relation with another man."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In view of its positive finding to the effect that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is, in truth and in fact, the father of the
appellant minor, it seems clear that, pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article 283 of
the New Civil Code, the trial court should have sentenced <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
to acknowledge said minor as his natural daughter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The legal provision just men­tioned says very
clearly that when the child suing for acknowledgment as a natural child has in
her favor any evidence or proof that the defendant is her father, the latter is
"obliged to recognize" him or her "as his na­tural child."
In the instant case the minor child suing for acknowledgment submitted such
evidence or proof to the trial court, on the basis of which it made the posi­tive
finding that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is her father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span>
obligation to acknowledge her is, therefore, clear.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue raised in the second and last assignment of error
submitted in appellants' brief must also be re­solved in their favor, the same
being the necessary con­sequence of our view that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
is obliged to acknowl­edge appellant minor as his natural daughter.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed portion of the decision of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> is hereby reversed
and another is hereby rendered declaring that appellant minor Maria <span class="SpellE">Bihildes</span> Velasquez is <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
daughter and compelling the latter to acknowledge her as such.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">As a
consequence and on the basis of the evidence of re­cord regarding <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> earning capacity at the time of the trial, he is
likewise sentenced to pay said minor appellant the sum of P75.00 as monthly
support, to be paid within the first ten days of each and every month following
the finality of this decision, and to pay appellants the sum of P500.00 by way
of attorney's fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
