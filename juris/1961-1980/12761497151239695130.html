				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>Sometime in the month of August, 1956, eleven employees of the Department of 
Public Services, City of Manila, falling under the unclassified civil service, 
were administratively charged for violation of office regulations, which 
prohibited drivers and garbage collectors from gathering and selling empty tin 
cans, refuse and waste papers, etc. Respondent Arsenio H. Lacson, then mayor, 
found the petitioners herein guilty of the charge and required them to tender 
their resignations, within 72 hours after receipt of the decision. Not in 
conformity with the decision, petitioners brought the matter to the Office of 
the President, pursuant to Sec. 22 of Republic Act 409 of the Manila Charter. On 
August 5, 1956, due to the refusal of the petitioners to resign, they were 
ordered to stop working, pending the resolution of their appeal. </p>
<p>During the period of their stoppage of work, they were not paid their 
salaries. </p>
<p>Under date of November 29, 1957, the Office of the President, decided the 
appeal, stating: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In view of the foregoing facts, we arc constrained to maintain that the 
original decision declaring the respondents guilty of the charges herein imputed 
to them is beyond question.</p>
<p>"WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is AFFIRMED, with the modification 
that the suspension of over one year (from August 5, 1056 to date), already 
suffered by the respondents be considered sufficient punishment. To that effect, 
their immediate reinstatement in the service, with the exception of driver 
Margarito Pedrieta, is hereby ordered. Driver Pod riot a is excepted from this 
order for the reason that he had resigned from the service on August 5, 1955, 
after receiving notice of the Mayer's decision herein mentioned. However, his 
reinstatement should be, as it is hereby, left to the discretion of the Mayor," 
</p></blockquote>
<p>The petitioners herein were reinstated on January 15, 1958. Contending that 
the proper punishment for which petitioners were liable was only suspension, 
instead of dismissal, they claimed that applying Section 695 of the 
Administrative Code, such suspension could not last more than two (2) months; 
and that from August 5, 1956 to January 15, 1958, the date of their 
reinstatement a period of one (1) year, five (5) months and nine (9) days had 
elapsed, thus making their suspension in excess of one (1) year, three (3) 
months and nine (9); days, for which they should be entitled to their salaries. 
For the excess period, petitioners asked the then Mayor" Lacson for the payment 
of the corresponding amounts, not as back wages, but as salaries withheld. This 
matter was referred to the Office of the President, which denied the claim, for 
the reason that petitioners were not protected and embraced by said Section 695, 
and, hence, not entitled to the payment of their salaries which accrued during 
the period they had not worked. The petitioners Presented the instant case of 
<i>mandamus</i>, to compel respondents to pay their salaries for the period of 
one (1) year, three (3) months and nine (9) days, plus P1,000.00 by way of 
attorney's fees and the costs (Sp. Civil Case No. 39061). </p>
<p>The respondents City Hall officials, contended that for all intents and 
purposes, petitioners were all considered resigned or dismissed from the service 
a3 of August 6, 1956, as a disciplinary penalty; that petitioners were not 
merely suspended, so that the provisions of Sections 260 and 695 of the Revised 
Administrative Code, are not applicable to their case; that the Mayer, under the 
Manila Charter, has the power to impose the punishment in question, but the 
Office of the President, although agreeing on the finding of guilt of the 
petitioners, had considered their separation from the service for a period of 
one (1) year, five (5) months and nine (9) days, as sufficient punishment, in 
lieu of outright dismissal; and that since petitioners did not perform work 
during that period, they are not entitled to payment of salaries. The respondent 
Executive Secretary followed the trend of the defenses interposed by the City 
Hall officials, and contended that the petition for mandamus did not state any 
valid and sufficient cause of action against them. </p>
<p>After the filing of the answers, the petitioners moved for a judgment on the 
pleadings. Under date of June 11, 1959, the lower court rendered judgment on the 
pleadings, the pertinent portions of which read: </p>
<p>"From the petition of the plaintiff and the motion for judgment of the 
pleadings, it is presumed that said plaintiffs admitted the truth of the 
principal allegations of the answers together with legal imputations, to wit: 
</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<ol start="7" type="1"><ol start="7" type="1"><li>That Section 22 of the Revised Charter of the City of Manila (Rep. Act No. 
409, as amended), which particularly applies to said city, specifically vests 
with the respondent Mayor the power to remove, suspend, or otherwise discipline 
officers and employees of the city government not appointed by the President of 
the Philippines, and the exercise of said power by respondent Mayor is not 
subject to the provisions of Section 2C0 or Section 095 of the Revised 
Administrative Code, which govern the removal or suspension of all other 
subordinate officers and employees in (he government service; 
</li><li>That the President is fully empowered to impose upon petitioners, as 
punishment, their suspension from the service of "over one year (from August 6, 
1956 to date) without pay, for the constitutional authority vested in the 
President to exercise general supervision over all local governments and to take 
cure that the laws are faithfully executed is bread and pervasive (Planas 
<em>vs.</em> Gil, G. 11. No. 46440, prom, on January 18, 1939), and its exercise 
is not subject to or delimited by the provisions of either Section 260 or 
Section 695 of the Revised Administrative Code; 
</li><li>That an administrative proceeding like the petitioners' case, an appeal to a 
higher authority does not have the effect of vacating or suspending the effect 
of the disputed judgment (Medrana, et al. va. Domerez, et at., CA-G.R. No. 
417-R, June 17, 1950, Court of Appeals Decisions, Vol. I, 1942-1954, p. 128), so 
that the judgment of respondent Mayor, dismissing petitioners was not vacated or 
suspended by petitioners' appeal therefrom to the Office of the President, and 
their dismissal having been affirmed on appeal to the extent of the period that 
they were out of the service, petitioners can not, validly claim payment of 
salary for said period, * * * * ; 
</li><li>That petitioners arc laborers paid by the day of actual service, as shown by 
the certificate of respondent City Public Service Officer Emilio Ejercito hereto 
attached and made a part hereof as Annex "B" and as by respondent Mayor's 
judgment they were ordered to stop working on August 6, 1956, they were not 
entitled to payment of salary for the period that they were out of the service; 
</li></ol></ol>
<p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IN VIEW OF THE ADMISSION OF THE PETITIONERS of the foregoing material facts 
alleged in the answer, this Court hereby order judgment dismissing this case for 
lack of merit. With costs against the petitioners." </p></blockquote>
<p>After the denial of the motion for reconsideration, presented by the 
petitioners, the matter was elevated to this Court on three (3) counts, to wit: 
the lower court erred- </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) in dismissing the complaint on the ground that a movant in a motion for 
judgment on the pleading admits not only the material allegations, but also the 
conclusions of law contained in the answer of the adversary; </p>
<p>(2) in sustaining respondents' contention that the petitioners may be 
penalized with suspension v it limit pay for a period of one (1) year, five (5) 
months, and nine (9) days; </p>
<p>(3) in declaring that the petitioners herein are not protected by the 
provisions of Section 200 of the Revised Administrative Code, and therefore 
should not be paid their salaries withheld during their preventive suspension. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>There seems to be no serious dispute that the answers of the 
respondents-appellees contain allegations of fact, as well as conclusions of 
law. A party who prays for judgment on the pleadings, without offering proofs as 
to the truth of his own allegations, and without giving the opposing party an 
opportunity to introduce evidence, must be understood to admit the truth of all 
material and relevant allegations of the opposing party, and to rest his motion 
for judgment on these allegations, taken together with such of his own <i>as are 
admitted</i> in the pleadings. (Evangelista <em>vs.</em> de la Rosa, 76 Phil., 
115; Falcasantos <em>vs.</em> How Suy Ching, L-4229, May 29,1952; Fabella 
<em>vs.</em> Prov. Sheriff of Rizal, L-6090, November 27, 1953, cited in IV Rep. 
of the Phil. Digest, p. 309). Consequently, petitioners are deemed to have 
admitted the truth of the material and relevant allegations in respondents' 
answers and their legal implications. However, even if it were to be held that 
petitioners herein did not admit the conclusions of law contained in the 
answers, we still find in the records sufficient basis to affirm the decision, 
dismissing the case of petitioners. </p>
<p>In the mind of this Court, the respondent Mayor had the authority to dismiss 
the petitioners who had been found guilty of violation of office regulations. As 
far as the Mayor was then concerned, the punishment for such violation was 
dismissal. The fact that the Office of the President modified the decision from 
dismissal to a mere separation for one (1) year, five (5) months, and nine (9) 
days, did not bring the punishment within the purview of a preventive suspension 
which should be governed by Sec. 395 of the Revised Administrative Code. The 
fallacy of petitioners' argument springs from their assumption that the modified 
decision had converted the penalty to that of suspension. The modified decision 
connotes that although dismissal or resignation would be the proper penalty, the 
separation from work for the period until their reinstatement, would be deemed 
sufficient. Said decision did not, in the least, insinuate that suspension 
should have been the penalty. </p>
<p>It will be noted also that the modified decision did not exonerate the 
petitioners. And if we take into account the fact that they did not work during 
the period for which they are now claiming salaries, there can be no legal or 
equitable basis to order the payment of their salaries. The general proposition 
is that a public official is not entitled to any compensation if he has not 
rendered any service. As you work, so shall you earn. And even if we consider 
the punishment as suspension, before a public official or employee is entitled 
to payment of salaries withheld, it should be shown that the suspension was 
<i>unjustified </i>or <i>that the employee was innocent </i>of the charges 
proffered against him (F. B. Reyes <em>vs.</em> J. Hernandez, 71 Phil., 397), 
which is not the case in the instant proceedings. </p>
<p>The action at bar is one of mandamus. For mandamus to He, the legal right of 
the petitioner must be well defined, clear and certain, otherwise the petition 
for the issuance of such writ, will be denied (III Moran's Comments on the Rules 
of Court, 1963 Ed. 172). Petitioners have not shown that they are entitled to 
the salaries, as a matter of right. </p>
<p>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the decision dismissing the case is hereby 
affirmed. Costs taxed against Petitioners. </p>
