				<H3>RODOLFO GIRON, MIGUEL BALANCE, AND MAXIMA VDA. DE ANTISODA, PETITIONERS, VS. HON. HERMOGENES CALAUAG, HON. NICASIO YATCO, AND J. M. TUASON & CO., INC., REPRESENTED IN THIS INSTANCE BY GREGORIO ARANETA, INC., RESPONDENTS. <BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>This is an original action for certiorari. <o:p></o:p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioners Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Giron</span>, Miguel Balance and Maxima <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">da</span></span> <span class="SpellE">Antisoda</span> were the defendants in Civil Case Nos. <span class="GramE">Q-4560, Q-4413 and Q-4412, respectively, of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.</span> The plaintiff in said three (3) cases was respondent J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc., which sought to recover the possession of a small parcel of land<span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">—</span>
with an area ranging from 200 to 500 square meters—allegedly hold
illegally by each one of said petitioners herein, and forming part of
the Santa Mesa Heights Subdivision, located at <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 1267
(37686-Rizal), in the name of said respondent Company. Respondent Hon. <span class="SpellE">Hermogenes</span> <span class="SpellE">Caluag</span>
is the Judge who presides over Branch IV of said Court, to which said
Case No. Q-4560 had been assigned, whereas respondent Hon. <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span> is the Judge who presides over Branch V of said Court, to which said cases Nos. Q-4412 and Q-4413 were assigned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioners
allege that, after service of summons to them as defendants in said
three (3) cases and the filing of their respective answers therein,
respondent Judges delegated the reception of the evidence in said cases
to commissioners who, without securing an order of reference and
without taking the oath required by the rules <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
proceeded to receive said evidence, taking stenographic notes of the
proceedings, and then prepared the respective decision, which were
signed by said respondent Judges, without either a report of said
commissioners or notice of said report or a hearing thereon; that
respondent Judges had thereby violated the pertinent provisions of the
Rules of Court and, rendered the proceedings before them, including the
aforementioned decisions, null and void; and that, this
notwithstanding, and despite the opposition of petitioners and their
motions for reconsideration, respondent Judges have issued writs of
execution of said decisions and pretty soon will, upon motion, issue
orders of demolition of the houses and other constructions of said
petitioners in the lots respectively held by them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioners
pray, therefore, that the proceedings in the said three (3) cases,
including the aforesaid decisions and writs of execution be set aside,
and that, pending the determination of this case, a writ of preliminary
injunction issue against respondent Judges commanding them to desist
from further proceeding in said cases or from issuing demolition orders
therein. This Court, however, refused to issue said writ.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In
their answer, as twice amended, the respondents denied the allegations
of the petition with respect to the irregularities allegedly committed
by respondent Judges, and pleaded <span class="SpellE"><i style="">res</i></span><i style=""> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></i> as regards cases Nos. <span class="GramE">Q-4412 and Q-4413.</span> With respect to case <span class="GramE">No</span>.
Q-4560, respondents averred that the irregularities allegedly committed
therein cannot affect the validity of the decision rendered and the
writ of execution issued therein; that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Giron</span>
had acquiesced to the proceedings in that case; and that there was a
plain, adequate and speedy remedy against said alleged irregularities,
namely, to appeal from said decision, which petitioner <span class="SpellE">Giron</span> did not take.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It appears that, after the filing of the respective answers of petitioners <span class="SpellE">Antisoda</span> and Balance, as defendants in cases Nos. Q-4412 and Q-4413, the same were set for hearing on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="11" month="9"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 11, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, on which occasion respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>
referred the reception of evidence to a commissioner, before whom the
parties, thereafter, introduced their respective proof. On </span><st1:date year="1959" day="14" month="9"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 14, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span> rendered a decision for the plaintiff (herein respondent Company) and against the defendant (herein petitioner <span class="SpellE">Antisoda</span>) in case No. <span class="GramE">Q-4412.</span>
The next day, said respondent Judge rendered a similar decision for the
plaintiff (herein respondent Company) and against the defendant (herein
petitioner Balance) in case <span class="GramE">No</span>. <span class="GramE">Q-4413.</span> <span class="GramE">Copy of said two (2) decisions were</span> served upon <span class="SpellE">Antisoda</span> and Balance, respectively, on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="18" month="9"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 18, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. Thirty-one (31) days later, or on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="19" month="10"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 19, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, both filed their respective notices of appeal, appeal bonds and records on appeal. On </span><st1:date year="1959" day="24" month="10"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 24, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the court of first instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> issued an order requiring <span class="SpellE">Antisoda</span> and Balance to amend their aforesaid records on appeal within "10 days <span class="GramE">from</span>
today." This notwithstanding, the amended records on appeal were not
filed until after the expiration of said period, or on November 16,
1959. Accordingly, on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="21" month="11"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 21, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the court disapproved said records on appeal. A reconsideration of the orders to this effect was sought neither by <span class="SpellE">Antisoda</span>
nor by Balance. Hence, on motion of respondent Company, the
corresponding writs of execution were, thereafter, issued. These writs
having been subsequently returned unsatisfied, said Company moved for
the demolition of the houses of <span class="SpellE">Antisoda</span> and Balance on the lots respectively occupied by them. By an order of </span><st1:date year="1961" day="3" month="6"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 3, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, <span class="SpellE">Antisoda</span> was given, therefore, sixty (60) days from notice within which to remove his house. A similar order dated </span><st1:date year="1961" day="8" month="7"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 8, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, was issued in case No. <span class="GramE">Q-4413, as regards Balance.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date year="1961" day="28" month="6"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 28, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, <span class="SpellE">Antisoda</span> filed with the Court of Appeals a petition—which was docketed therein as CA-G. R. No. 293850R—for <span class="SpellE">certiorari</span> and mandamus, with preliminary injunction, against respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>, respondent Company and the Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, to restrain the execution of said demolition order of June 3, 1961 in case No. Q-4412, and compel Judge <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span> to approve <span class="SpellE">the</span> aforementioned (amended) record on appeal and to give due course to <span class="SpellE">Antisoda's</span> appeal, and for "such further relief as in equity proceeds," upon the ground that said respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>
had committed a grave abuse of discretion in disapproving the amended
record on appeal therein; that the Land Tenure Administration had, on
February 24, 1961, instituted proceedings for the expropriation of the <span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span> Estate, and, pursuant to Section 4 of Republic Act No. 2616, no <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
proceedings already commenced shall be continued after the initiation
of the aforementioned expropriation case; and that the reference of
said case No. <span class="GramE">Q-4412 to a commissioner for the
reception of evidence, and the reception thereof by the commissioner,
who had not taken an oath as such</span> <span class="GramE">and</span> the rendition of a decision by respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>, without a previous report of the commissioner, or notice of such report, or a hearing thereon, are <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of the Rules of Court. Soon thereafter, or on July 12, 1961, petitioner
Balance filed, with the same Court of Appeals, a similar
action—docketed as CA-G.R. No. 29489-R of said Court—against respondent
Judge <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>, the Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City and respondent Company, in connection with case No. <span class="GramE">Q-4413.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date year="1961" day="23" month="8"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 23, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">,
the Court of Appeals rendered a decision in said case No. CA-G.R. No.
29385-R. In connection with the alleged irregularities relative to the
reference to a commissioner, his failure to take an oath as such and to
submit a report, as well as the absence of notice thereof <span class="GramE">and</span> of a hearing thereon, the Court of Appeals held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"*
* * The foregoing contentions are best refuted by the admission in the
record on appeal and reiterated in the amended record on appeal of the
defendant that 'after due hearing wherein the parties entered into a
stipulation of facts and introduced oral and documentary evidence, a
decision was rendered by this Honorable Court * * *.' The foregoing
manifestly shows that the proceedings in the lower court were regular.
Nothing, apart from the bare allegations in the petition, shows that
the commissioner did not comply with the duties prescribed in the Rules
of Court and required of him to be done and performed, and in the
absence of a clear showing to the contrary, the presumption is 'That
official duty has been regularly performed.' <span class="GramE">(Sec. 69, (m), Rule 123, Rules of Court.)"</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Court of Appeals, likewise, found that no expropriation proceeding covering the lot occupied by <span class="SpellE">Antisoda</span> had been filed and that her amended record on Appeal had been filed beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period. Hence, the petition in said case CA-G.R. No. 29385-R was dismissed for lack of merit. Six (6) days later, or on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="29" month="8"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 29, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, said Court rendered its decision in CA-G.R. No. 29489-R, from which we quote:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"*
* * The contention that the reference of the case to a commissioner was
without the consent and over the objection of the defendant, is best
refuted by the admission of the defendant in the record on appeal and
reiterated in the amended record on appeal, where n it is stated that
'After due hearing wherein the parties introduced oral and documentary
evidence, a decision was rendered by this Honorable Court * * *.' The
foregoing manifestly shows that the proceedings in the lower court were
regular. Nothing, apart from the bare allegations in the petition,
shows that the commissioner did not comply with the duties prescribed
in the Rules of Court and required of him to be done and performed and
in the absence of a clear showing to the contrary the presumption is
"That official duty has been regularly performed' (Section 69, (m),
Rule 123, Rules of Court). Granting <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">ad <span class="SpellE">arguendo</span></span></em>
that no notice was given to the parties that the commissioner's report
had been submitted to the court, and the parties could interpose
objections to said report within 10 days, or that no hearing on the
report was had before the court, while the failure to do so may, in
some cases, constitute an error, yet, when said report was attached to
the record, and the court studied it in connection with the evidence
attached to the record and approved it, and the attention of the lower
court was not called to the supposed irregularity by a motion or
petition to that effect, the supposed irregularity having been assailed
only on July 12, 1961 in the instant petition, the contention loses its
merit and cannot be a valid ground for the reversal of the judgment
(Government of P. I. vs. Osorio, 50 Phil., 864)."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As
regards the alleged expropriation proceedings and the amended record on
appeal of Balance, the Court of Appeals reiterated its ruling in case
CA-G.R. No. 29385-R. <span class="GramE">Accordingly</span>, the petition in case CA-G.R. No. 29489-R, was, also, dismissed for lack of merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Inasmuch
as the parties, the subject matter and the cause of action in the case
at bar and in said cases CA-G. R. Nos. 29385-R and 29489-R are
identical, insofar as the alleged irregularities in cases Nos. Q-4412
and Q-4413 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> are concerned, it is clear that the cause of action of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Antisoda</span>
and Balance as petitioners herein, in relation to these two (2) cases
(Nos. Q-4412 and Q-4413), is barred by said decisions of the Court of
Appeals, which are final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> (<span class="SpellE">Pua</span> <i style="">vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Lapitan</span>, 107 Phil., 95; <span class="SpellE">Ganaden</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Ursua</span> <i style="">vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Pelayo</span>, 107 Phil., 622 Wenzel, et al. <i style="">vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> Consolidated Mining Co., et al., 108 Phil., 530; Dominguez, et al. <i style="">vs</i>.

  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">With respect to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Giron</span>, we note that on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="11" month="9"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 11, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, when case <span class="GramE">No</span>. Q-4560 was called for hearing, respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Caluag</span> issued an order reading:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"By
agreement of the parties, the clerk of court is hereby commissioned to
receive the evidence in the case who should submit the same to the
undersigned for the corresponding decision."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is conceded that both parties introduced their respective evidence therein. Subsequently, Judge <span class="SpellE">Caluag</span> rendered Judgment for the plaintiff (herein respondent Company) and against the defendant (herein petitioner <span class="SpellE">Giron</span>) therein. No appeal having been taken by the latter, said decision became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.
Hence, on motion of plaintiff therein (herein respondent Company), a
writ of execution was issued. The writ having been later returned
unsatisfied, a motion for demolition of the house and other
constructions of <span class="SpellE">Giron</span> on the lot involved in the case was filed. This motion was pending at the time of the institution of the present case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The
jurisdiction of the lower court over the parties and over the subject
matter of said case No. Q-4560 is not disputed. Hence, the decision
therein rendered by said court is valid. If any irregularities had been
committed therein, affecting his substantial rights, <span class="SpellE">Giron</span>
could have secured a plain, adequate and speedy remedy by seeking a
reconsideration of said decision and, had said reconsideration been
denied, by appeal. <span class="SpellE">Giron</span> did not do so. He
did not question the regularity of the proceedings leading to the
rendition of said decision until after the same had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.
Consequently, he cannot now avail himself of the writ of certiorari,
his present predicament being the effect of his deliberate inaction.

et al, L-15365, December 26, 1961.) As a matter of fact, the record
before us suggests that he had and has no meritorious defense on the
merits of the case. What is more, he does not even claim to have been
denied the opportunity to introduce any evidence in his favor, or that
his evidence has been misconstrued. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Viewed
from any angle, the petition in this case should therefore, be, as it
is hereby dismissed, with costs against petitioners herein. It is so
ordered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
