<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners – in
justifying the issuance of the writs prayed for – contend that the trial Court
committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction
in taking cognizance of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases,
rendering judgment thereon, and issuing the writ of execution dated June 29,
1978, and the orders of demolition dated Sept. 14, 1978 and May 14, 1979,
respectively, allegedly because the correct remedy of respondent HILLCREST,
plaintiff below, was an action for recovery of possession and/or ownership in
the Court of First Instance (<span class="SpellE">accion</span> <span class="SpellE">publiciana</span>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners' contention
is without merit and is obviously resorted to <u>solely</u> as a dilatory
maneuver, to prevent or defeat the execution of </span>the final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> decision of the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Taytay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">A.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The separate complaints
for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> filed against petitioners (defendants
below) alleged that private respondent is the owner of the lots in question – <u><span style="">its ownership being supported by the
corresponding Original Certificates of Title/Transfer Certificates of Title </span></u><u><span style="">as </span></u><u><span style="">against the mere claim of ownership of the controversial Estate of Don
Mariano San Pedro</span></u><span style="">; </span>that
petitioners forcibly entered the premises on different dates in 1977, through
holes in the fence which they made or over ladders which they constructed
against the fence; and that petitioners refused to vacate the premises despite
repeated demands, to demolish their improvements thereon and deliver the
premises to private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These allegations
conferred on the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Taytay</span>
jurisdiction over the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, private respondent, HILLCREST,
submitted overwhelming evidence – documentary and the testimonies of its
administrator, security guards and other – to establish <span style="">its </span>ownership and actual physical possession of the lots in
question.</p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, </span><u>petitioners did not appear at the
trial of these cases to prove their claims of ownership and actual occupation
of the subject premises for more than one year from the filing of the
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is worse, they did not
appeal from the adverse decision of the Municipal Court</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, they filed in the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> an action to annul and cancel private respondent's
Original and Transfer Certificates of Title in a desperate, <u>albeit</u>
futile, attempt to make it appear that the question of title and possession
over the lots in controversy is a genuine issue in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
cases and, to bolster their transparent pretence that the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Taytay</span> is bereft of jurisdiction to take cognizance of said
<span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Taytay</span>, however, was
not impressed by the move of petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was determined, as it should be, to enforce its final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We are also unimpressed by the dilatory tactics of petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had a chance to prove ownership of the
lots; they did not avail of that chance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When they received a copy of the adverse decision, they had a right to
appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>; but, again, they did not take
advantage of that recourse.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this stage, We cannot
lend support to the efforts of petitioners, through Counsel, by means of this
special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>, to annul the proceedings had in the
Court below, which were regular and valid, in every respect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We rule once again that the office of <i>certiorari</i>
is limited to the correction of defects of <u>jurisdiction</u> solely; it
cannot be used for any other purpose, – much less to defeat the right of the
prevailing party to the execution of a valid and final judgment.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Stated otherwise, the remedy of <i>certiorari</i> is available only when a
court in the exercise of its judicial functions, has acted without jurisdiction
or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion and there is no
remedy by appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Where a court had jurisdiction over the subject matter and over the person, its
decision of any question pertaining to the cause, however erroneous, cannot be
corrected by <i>certiorari</i>.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the present case,
petitioners failed </span>to avail of the adequate remedies in the ordinary
course of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They did not timely file
a motion for reconsideration or new trial under Rule 37 of the Revised Rules of
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They failed to file a <span class="SpellE">petiton</span> for relief from judgment under Rule 38.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did they appeal, in either case, from
the judgment and from the order denying new <span style="">trial or relief from the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, the questions raised by petitioners, thru counsel, such as
the issue of ownership and the issue of possession for "more than one (1)
year prior to the filing of the complaints for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
and even the correctness of the judgment of the Municipal Court, relate to
errors of law which should be taken up in an appeal and do not involve
jurisdictional errors which may properly </span><span style="">be </span><span style="">raised and corrected
by <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is settled
dogma that where appeal as an adequate remedy has been lost through
petitioner's fault </span><span style="">or </span><span style="">negligence, he will not be permitted to avail
</span><span style="">of </span><i><span style="">certiorari</span></i><span style=""> as a substitute for an appeal.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As petitioners, thru
counsel, miserably failed to show that respondent Judge acted in the premises
without jurisdiction or in excess thereof, or with grave abuse of discretion
that would render the challenged judgment null and void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span>
</span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">initio</span></u></span><span style="">, </span><span style="">the present petition must be dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">B.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A word to counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As an officer of the Court it was counsel's
duty to advise his clients, </span>petitioners herein, of the real merits of
their cause or the lack of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had he
done so, petitioners could have realized the futility of filing this petition,
and spared them the need to spend their hard-earned money by way of court fees
in the total amount of P4,287.50,<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
for a hopeless recourse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For as adverted
to above, the facts – (1) that respondent municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Taytay</span> had jurisdiction over the cases for forcible entry
and <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>; (2) that notice to counsel of record,
Atty. Vicente <span class="SpellE">Revelo</span>, was notice to petitioners, now
his clients, in the proceedings below; (3) that the proper remedies <span style="">of </span>his clients as defendants against
the adverse judgments below were either appeal and/or a motion for new trial
and/or petition for relief from judgment whichever was proper; <span style="">(4) that </span><i>certiorari</i> is a
special remedy which cannot be a substitute for any of the foregoing recourses;
(5) that the judgment of the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Taytay</span>
became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> in 1977, and, finally, (6)
that the filing of the action with the CFI, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, to
annul the Certificates of Title of respondent HILLCREST did not justify the
holding in abeyance of the proceedings on execution in the municipal court – are
legal propositions too plain to be missed by any practitioner concerned with
the prompt administration of justice and mindful of his client's welfare and
interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More importantly, it would
have spared this Court the trouble and efforts of resolving a manifestly
unmeritorious, if not sham, petition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Counsel by filing this petition did so in utter disregard of his duty to
his clients as well as his obligation to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">But on par with the duties of counsel to the courts and to his
clients is his responsibility to society as a whole – the social dimension of
the law profession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it is the duty
of counsel to promote and enhance instead of defeat and frustrate the
objectives and policies of the society in which he lives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An aspect of the social responsibility is
very clearly the lawyers' duty to promote the public policy with respect to
squatting, which are, firstly, to prevent the same and punish those guilty
thereof as legislation and Presidential Directives provide,<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
and where actually done, to relocate, even at substantial outlay of public
funds, squatter <span style="">families to settlements,
e.g., <span class="SpellE">Bahay</span> Pare, <span class="SpellE">Dasmariñas</span>,
etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, in recognition of the
public policy, thru Justice <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> Sanchez, in 1967
spoke in no uncertain terms against the evils of squatting.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Since the last global war, squatting on another's property in

</span>It was and is a blight.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Squatters' areas pose problems of health, sanitation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are breeding places for crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They constitute proof that respect for the

interest - without as much as leave, and even against the will, of the
owner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are emboldened seemingly
because of their belief that they could violate the law with impunity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">pugnaciousness</span>
of some of them has tied up the hands of legitimate owners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter are thus prevented from recovering
possession by peaceful means.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Government
lands have not been spared by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="">They know of course, that intrusion into
property, government or private, is wrong.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But, then, </span></u><u><span style="">the </span></u><u><span style="">mills of justice </span></u><u><span style="">grind </span></u><u><span style="">slow, </span></u><u><span style="">mainly
because </span></u><u><span style="">lawyers </span></u><u><span style="">who, by means, </span></u><u><span style="">fair or foul, are q</span>uite often </u><u><span style="">successful in procuring </span>delay of the d</u><u><span style="">ay of reckoning</span></u><span style="">..."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

action, therefore, on the part of counsel which will tend to encourage or give
