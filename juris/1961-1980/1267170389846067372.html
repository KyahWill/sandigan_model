				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><div class="Section1"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"></span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is an appeal by the 
Solicitor General's office from the decision of the Court of First Instance of 
Manila granting the application for Filipino citizenship of the petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> 
Ng.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On June 3, 1959, <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> Ng filed with the above-named court a petition for 
naturalization. Among others, he claimed that he was a resident of No. 2089 
<span class="SpellE">Invernes</span> St., Sta. Ana, Manila and that he had been 
residing therein for more than a year prior to the filing of the petition; that 
he was born in Manila of Chinese parents on October 26, 1938; that he was single 
and then employed at the Pioneer Tobacco Corporation as a supervisor with a 
monthly salary of P170.00; that he could speak and write English and <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>; that he had gone through the elementary and 
intermediate schools as well as the high school course (Technical and Commercial 
College of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>) and, at the time of the filing of 
the petition, was a third year Commerce student of the University of the East. 
The petitioner also declared that he believed in the Principles underlying the 
Philippine Constitution and that he has conducted himself in a proper and 
irreproachable manner during the entire period of his residence in the 
Philippines in his dealings with the authorities as well as with the community 
in which he lives. Finally, the petitioner claimed that he had mingled socially 
with the Filipinos and had evinced a sincere desire to learn and embrace the 
customs, traditions and ideals of the Filipinos.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">At the hearing, the petitioner 
and his character witnesses testified to the above allegations. Thereafter, the 
Government, thru the Solicitor General's office, opposed the petition on four 
grounds, to wit: 1) that the petitioner's character witnesses were <span class="SpellE">untrusworthy</span>; 2) that the said witnesses were in no position 
to vouch for his 'citizenship qualifications; 3) that petitioner's occupation or 
income was not lucrative within the <span class="GramE">meaning</span> of the 
Naturalization Law; and 4) that the petitioner was illegally using an 
alias.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In due time, 
the lower court granted the petition and ruled out the Government's opposition 
thereto as "unmeritorious".</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> Hence, the instant 
appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In this appeal, the Solicitor 
General interposes more or less the same grounds as above. He questions the 
reliability of the petitioner's character witnesses, the sufficiency of His 
income and, in addition, calls the attention of this Court to the fact that 
petitioner had failed to set out in the petition all his former places of 
residence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Without passing on the other 
objections of the Government, this Court believes that this appeal is 
meritorious as the records do show that petitioner does not have the lucrative 
occupation or income contemplated by law. By his own admission, petitioner's 
income is just a little over P2<span class="GramE">,040.00</span> annually. Of 
course, he claims that aside from his salary, he is also provided with some food 
by his employer. Be that as it may, however, although the evidence that he is 
also given food aside from his salary is inconclusive, <span class="GramE">We</span> still believe that the petitioner's income is grossly 
insufficient to justify the grant of citizenship to him. Considering that he 
resides in Manila where the standard of living is one of the highest in the 
whole country, there can be no question that his income is, far from being 
lucrative, not enough even for his basic needs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Already, this decision has been 
liberal to the petitioner because we have taken into account petitioner's own 
claim that his salary is P170.00 a month. For, according to his membership card 
at the Social Security System, his salary was only P150.00 a month. Had this 
been the income that we considered, then he would have been charged with a far 
lesser income than that which we consider insufficient 
already.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the case of Ngo Go <span class="SpellE">Liong</span> <span class="SpellE">Siu</span> <i>vs</i>. Republic, 
<span class="GramE">No.</span> L-18319, </span><st1:date month="5" day="31" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">May 31, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
<span class="GramE">We</span> denied the petitioner's application for citizenship 
because his proven monthly income was only P300.00. If this amount which is 
practically twice the income of the applicant in this case could be deemed 
sufficient, <span class="GramE">We</span> simply do not see how the application at 
bar can be justified.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In passing, it may also be stated 
that the herein petitioner does not seem to have declared in his petition all 
his places of residence prior to its filing. Nowhere in the said petition may 
his </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Baguio</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> residence be found, although he 
himself testified at the hearing of this case that <span class="GramE">lie</span> 
resided there for some five years. Moreover, one of the character witnesses 
admitted that he never met petitioner in <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> during 
his alleged five years' stay in said city. This failure is a violation of the 
law that cannot be overlooked since the disclosure of all previous residences of 
the petitioner affords the Government fuller and more reliable basis for 
determining his fitness or disqualification to become a Filipino citizen (Sec. 
7, Revised Naturalization Law; Ngo <span class="SpellE">Liong</span> vs. Republic, 
<i>supra.</i>)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">With our findings above, it is 
not necessary any more to discuss the other errors 
assigned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; text-transform: uppercase; font-family: Verdana;">Wherefore</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the decision appealed from is 
hereby reversed, with no pronouncement as to costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
