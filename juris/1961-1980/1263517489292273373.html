taken by the spouses Gregorio and <span class="SpellE">Epifania</span> <span class="SpellE">Resuena</span> from the decision of the Court of Agrarian
Relations in CAR Case No. 362 (<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>)
promulgated <st1:date year="1962" day="17" month="1"><span style="">January </span>17, 1962</st1:date> dismissing their petition for the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> Bas from
their landholding at <span class="SpellE">Pook</span>, <span class="SpellE">Talisay</span>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Cebu</span></span></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime before the filing of the instant case, the petitioners
sought <span style="">the </span>intervention of the
Agricultural Tenancy Commission to effect the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
of respondent Bas from their land known as Lot No. 10190 of the <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Minglanilla</span> on the ground that they and their
children would cultivate it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Having </span>failed to comply with the
service of the notice required by sub-section (a), Section 50, R. A. No. 1199,
as amended, said <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> proceeding was
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(p. 7,
Commissioner's report - Annex "A").</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="10" month="5">May 10, 1960</st1:date>
petitioners wrote a letter in <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> (<span class="SpellE">Cebuano</span>) dialect to their tenant, Bas, informing him of
their intention to cultivate personally their landholding after the lapse of
one year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said notice was served by a
policeman of the place, but as Bas refused to receive it, the same was sent by
registered mail and was received on <st1:date year="1960" day="10" month="6">June
 10, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On or about the
same date petitioners also filed <span style="">a </span>formal
notice with the Court of Agrarian Relations stating their intention to
cultivate personally their land and attaching <span style="">thereto a copy </span>of their letter addressed to Bas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite <span style="">the
</span>lapse of 1 year following service of the notice aforesaid and repeated
demands on Bas for him to return the possession of the landholding, the latter
refused to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence,
the present action for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> (Car Case No. 362 - <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> 1961).</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In his </span>answer,
respondent admitted the ownership, identity, location and area of the
landholding as well as <span style="">his </span>tenancy
relation with the petitioners since 1954, and as counterclaim prayed <span style="">for <span class="SpellE">reliquidation</span>
and </span>moral damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the presentation of petitioners' evidence on <st1:date year="1961" day="9" month="10">October 9, 1961</st1:date>, the respondent moved
for the dismissal of the case on the ground that the petitioners had failed to
show their capacity to personally work on the land and their <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u>
intention to <span style="">do so, but </span>the
motion was denied by the hearing commissioner who proceeded to receive
respondent's evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1962</st1:date>,
the <st1:street><st1:address>Agrarian Court</st1:address></st1:street> <span style="">rendered its decision dismissing petitioners'
case </span>due to their failure to establish their good faith in seeking the
cultivation of the landholding in question through their son <span class="SpellE">Aldrico</span>, and likewise dismissed respondent's counter-claim
for damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners' motion for
reconsideration having been denied they took the present appeal by <i style="">certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only issue to be <span style="">resolved
</span>is whether the petitioners <span style="">and
their </span>children may eject the respondent tenant and personally <span style="">cultivate </span>their landholding under the
following <span style="">provisions of </span>Section
50(a) of Republic Act No. 1199, as amended by <span style="">Republic </span>Act No. 2263:</p>

<blockquote>"Causes for the Dispossession of Tenant<span class="GramE">.-</span>
Any of the following, and no other, shall be sufficient cause for the
dispossession of a tenant from his holdings:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bona fide intention of the
landholder-owner or his relative within the first degree by consanguinity to
cultivate the land himself personally or through the employment of farm
machinery and implements:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided,
however, That should the landholder-owner or the aforesaid relative not
cultivate the land himself for at least three years or the landholder-owner and
<span style="">his </span>successor in interest should
fail to employ mechanical farm implements for a period of at least five years
after dispossession of the tenant, it shall be presumed that he acted in bad
faith and the tenant shall have the right to demand possession of the land and
damages for any loss incurred by him because of said dispossession:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, further, That the landholder-owner
or <span style="">the </span>aforesaid relative shall,
at least one year but not more than two years prior to the date of his petition
to dispossess the tenant under this subsection, file notice with the court and
shall inform the tenant in writing in a language or dialect known to the latter
of his intention to cultivate the land himself, either personally or through
the employment of mechanical implements:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Provided, That x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitionersâ€™ contention is that the Court of Agrarian Relations
erred in holding that they failed to establish good faith in seeking the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of their tenant so that they may personally
cultivate their landholding, claiming that the evidence presented below shows <span style="">that </span>they, together with their <span style="">two </span>sons, <span class="SpellE">Aldrico</span>
and Rogelio, are qualified to till the land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They also contend that the right to personal cultivation is not limited
to male-owners, but extends to female owners <span style="">(Feliciano </span>vs. <span style="">CAR, et

June 1958).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As answer to the foregoing contentions of petitioners <span class="GramE">We</span> quote the following portions of the appealed decision, <span style="">which </span>dispose of them clearly and
reasonably:</p>

<blockquote>"The principal question to be determined in this case <span style="">is, </span>therefore, whether or not
petitioners have <span style="">es</span>tablished
their <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> intention, i.e., their good faith, in wanting to
cultivate the land personally, by themselves or thru their children.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Petitioner Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Resuena</span> is an
employee of the <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span> Land Transportation Company,
with offices at <span class="SpellE">Tagbilaran</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bohol</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is not even intimated that <span style="">he
</span>will participate in any capacity in the proposed cultivation of the
landholding.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Epifania</span> <span class="SpellE">Resuena</span>, <span style="">Gregorio's
</span>wife, is a housewife, with residence at <span class="SpellE">Talisay</span>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her role in the proposed cultivation will
merely be supervisory in character.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Epifania</span> <span class="SpellE">Resuena</span> told the Court that her son <span class="SpellE">Aldrico</span>
will be the one who will principally cultivate <span style="">the </span>land personally, with the help of her other son Rogelio and
under her supervision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Son <span class="SpellE">Aldrico</span> of petitioners is 27 years of age, single, jobless,
and resides in their house in <span class="SpellE">Talisay</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He is out of school and is dependent upon his parents for support.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Petitioners' other son, Rogelio, is at present an assistant
property clerk of the <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span> Land Transportation
Company at <span class="SpellE">Tagbilaran</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span>,
with <span style="">which </span>firm he has been
connected for about a year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before that,
he worked as purchasing agent of the Mindanao Bus Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his present employment, Rogelio is laid off
5 days a month as forced leave, under a rotation system of the transportation
firm where he works.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rogelio's wife and
children live with his mother in the latter's house in <span class="SpellE">Talisay</span>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place> and he commutes -to that
place whenever he <span style="">is </span>off-duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rogelio proposes to help his brother <span class="SpellE">Aldrico</span> during his off-days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admits, however, that during his entire
lifetime of 34 years he has not yet performed any of the phases of labor, such
as plowing and harrowing the <span class="SpellE">riceland</span> and cleaning
and preparing it for planting (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>. p. 11, Hearing of
October 9, 1961).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is no evidence in the record showing that son <span class="SpellE">Aldrico</span> of petitioners, whom they propose to do the
personal cultivation of the land principally, has any past experience in farm
work or knows how to perform any of the phases of labor, such as plowing,
harrowing, etc., that an average farmer of <span style="">a </span><span class="SpellE">riceland</span> normally does.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither is there any evidence presented
showing that petitioners or their son <span class="SpellE">Aldrico</span> now own
or possess, or have under their control and disposition, any work animal and
farm implements, which are the indispensable equipments of a farmer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The landholding involved <span style="">in </span>this case <span style="">is </span>a
<span class="SpellE">riceland</span>, with a seedling capacity of <span style="">8 <span class="SpellE">gantas</span> of <span class="SpellE">palay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Palay</span> is planted therein 2 times a year, the first agricultural
season being from February to June, and the second, from August to
December.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The average produce </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">from 10 to 11 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span> during the first season
and 12 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span> during the second season.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It further appears that sometime in 1958, respondent demanded
from petitioners that the 50-50 sharing of crops theretofore prevailing between
them, be changed to 70-30 in his favor, to which petitioners agreed, and from
that time up to the present the sharing of crops has been 70-30 in the tenant's
favor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the same year 1958, it also appears that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Epifania</span> <span class="SpellE">Resuena</span> went to the
office of the Agricultural Tenancy Commission in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
to seek the intervention of said office in ejecting respondent from the
aforementioned landholding on the ground of personal cultivation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the ATC intervention proved ineffectual,
said petitioner filed a complaint for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
against respondent in this Court, but the case was dismissed for lack of notice
requirements.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Aside from the parcel of land involved in this case,
petitioners are the owners of 4 other parcels of land located in <span class="SpellE">Talisay</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>,
which are all worked under tenancy by other persons whose names do not appear
in the record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two of said parcels of
land are situated near the landholding in question, about 1 kilometer away from
petitioners' house, and the other 2 are situated a little bit farther, or more
than 2 kilometers from said house.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Petitioners have not advanced <span style="">any explanation, during the trial, why they have chosen </span>to
cultivate respondent's landholding, in preference to the 4 other landholdings
of their other <span style="">tenants.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon the facts and circumstances above set forth, the good
faith of petitioners in wanting their son <span class="SpellE">Aldrico</span> to
cultivate the landholding in question does not appear to have been
established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners' evidence is
devoid of any showing that <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Aldrico</span></span><span style=""> </span>has
ever done any farm work in his life or attempted to learn by actual practice
any of its rudiments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One does not
become a farmer by merely watching other farmers perform their work, any more
than one can become a pianist or violinist by merely attending a concert where
artists perform on said instruments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
top of this, <span style="">it is not even </span>shown
that <span class="SpellE">Aldrico</span> now possesses or has under his
disposition any work animal and farm implements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, <span class="SpellE">Aldrico's</span>
knowledge of farming is nil, and his equipment for farming has yet to be
acquired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We think no landholder in his
right mind would accept <span class="SpellE">Aldrico</span> to be his tenant now,
under the latter's present handicaps.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Moreover, if petitioners were actuated <span style="">by </span>laudable motives in wanting to have
their son <span class="SpellE">Aldrico</span> work in the land, they would have
prepared him for the job as far back <span style="">as
</span>1958, when they first tried to oust respondent from his landholding on
the ground of personal cultivation by themselves and their children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">And not only this.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>What justifiable reason do petitioners have
in selecting respondent's landholding in preference to that of their other 4
tenants for their experiment in their son <span class="SpellE">Aldrico's</span>
personal cultivation? They have advanced none, and probably there isn't
any.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There <span style="">is, </span>therefore, some substance to respondent's claim in his
testimony that the reason why petitioners want to eject him from <span style="">his </span>landholding, is that petitioners
resented <span style="">his having </span>demanded and
secured <span style="">a </span>change of their former
sharing arrangement of <span style="">50-50 </span>to <span style="">70-30 </span>in his favor <span style="">in </span><span style="">1958.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"For failure of petitioners to establish their good faith in seeking
the cultivation of the landholding in question through their son <span class="SpellE">Aldrico</span>, their petition for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
should be dismissed."</blockquote>
