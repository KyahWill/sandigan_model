				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span>, Julian <span class="SpellE">Bartido</span>, Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>,
Arnold <span class="SpellE">Viterbo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cornal</span> and Ponte <span class="SpellE">Abinuman</span> <span style="">were </span>prosecuted in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span> under separate <span class="SpellE">Infor­mations</span> for Murder (Criminal Case No. 4136), and
Frustrated Murder (Criminal Case No. 4138), which arose <span style="">out of one and the same </span>shooting incident near the wharf of <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>, <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>, at about 6:30
in the morning of May 21, 1962, resulting in the killing of <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tamares</span> and the near-fatal shooting of <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Espinosa.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon arraignment on <st1:date month="6" day="21" year="1962">June 21,
 1962</st1:date>, all the accused entered separate pleas of "not
guilty" to the two (2) <span class="SpellE">Informations</span>; but later,
on <st1:date month="8" day="7" year="1962">August 7, 1962</st1:date>, accused
Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span> withdrew his previous plea and,
thereafter, pleaded "guilty" to both charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was sentenced accordingly on the same date
in both cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other accused stood
trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the two cases arose out of the same inci­dent, a joint trial
was had for the reception of evidence for the prosecution; but a separate trial
for each of the accused insofar as their evidence was concerned, was allowed by
the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in view of the
impending transfer to the National Peni­tentiary of Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span>
who, as earlier explained, then stood convicted of both charges, his deposition
was taken, and later offered as part of the evidence for all the re<span style="">m</span>aining five accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the conclusion of the trial, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
rendered a single decision in both cases on <st1:date month="3" day="7" year="1963">March 7, 1963</st1:date>, acquitting accused Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>, <span style="">Ar­</span>nold
<span class="SpellE">Viterbo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cornal</span> upon grounds of reasonable doubt, but finding
accused Julian <span class="SpellE">Bartido</span> and Ponte <span class="SpellE">Abinuman</span>
guilty of the crimes charged in both cases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In Criminal Case <span style="">No. </span>4136
(For Murder), Ju­lian <span class="SpellE">Bartido</span> and Ponte <span class="SpellE">Abinuman</span> were each sentenced to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamares</span> in the sum of
P6,000.00, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay
the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Criminal Case No. 4138
(For Frustrated Murder), the same accused were each, like­wise, sentenced to an
indeterminate penalty of 8 years and 1 day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span>
<u>mayor</u>, as minimum, to 14 years, 8 months and 1 day of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>,
as maximum, with all the accessories of the law, and to pay the costs of the
proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Only accused Ponte <span class="SpellE">Abinuman</span> has
appealed from the decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">From our own examination of the evidence, it appears that bad
blood had <span style="">existed </span>for some time
bet­ween accused Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> and one of the
victims, <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Espinosa.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> has been
mayor of <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>, <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>,
since 1945 up to the date of the incident on the wharf of the town on May 21,
1962, which brought about these cases; but on December 23, 1961, shortly after
the national election, <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Espinosa made a public
announcement that <span style="">he </span>will <span style="">run for the </span>mayoralty of <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span> in the coming local <span style="">election of 1963, and at the same time, made an accusation that Mayor
Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> had pocketed the money given him
by the <span class="SpellE">Espinosas</span> during the Proceeding congressional
election in November 1961, intended for the campaign expenses of <span class="SpellE">Moises</span>’ elder brother, the incumbent Congressman, Emilio
Espinosa, Jr. From then on, <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> was not on
speaking terms with <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Espi­nosa.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their relationship became worse when at the
waterfront, on </span><st1:date month="1" day="6" year="1962"><span style="">January 6, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>
grabbed <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Espinosa by the shirt as the latter
was coming down a gangplank, drew his gun, and fired it twice at <span class="SpellE">Moises</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fortunately,
the gun did not explode, and soon cooler heads intervened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This precipitated the filing of an
administrative charge against the mayor by <span class="SpellE">Moises</span>
Espinosa. <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>, who was with accused <span class="SpellE">Viterbo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cornal</span> along with <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> Heath at the time, warned <span class="SpellE">Moises</span>
Espinosa that "next time he would not be as lucky".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The antagonism was aggravated when <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> Heath was shot dead barely two days after the
incident, for which <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Espinosa was charged with
murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Moises</span>
Espinosa felt that Mayor <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> was behind the
filing of that charge against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
developments prompted <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Espinosa to leave his
own house and live in the house of his father, former Congress­man Emilio
Espinosa, Sr., in the same municipality; and thereafter, always brought along
with him <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Tama­res</span>
as a sort of bodyguard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It was also shown that
accused Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span> had a strong motive to kill <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Espinosa.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although the latter claimed that they were childhood friends and, as a
matter of fact, were together in forming the <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>
Free Workers Union, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span> believed that <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Espinosa was responsible for his ouster </span><span style="">from </span><span style="">the union where, <span style="">as </span>representative, he derived <span style="">a </span>monthly income of about P200.00 representing 5% of
collections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that <span class="SpellE">Lagarde's</span> </span><span style="">suspicion was </span><span style="">not unfounded, for shortly before the union Members elected their
officers, <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Espinosa withdrew the bond he had
previously posted for <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span> who was then accused in
another case for murder, resulting in <span class="SpellE">Lagarde’s</span>
re-arrest and his subsequent inability to work for his re-election as officer
of the union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span> is the brother-in-law of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>,
the latter being married to <span class="SpellE">Lagarde's</span> elder sister;
and the enmity between <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> and Espinosa was no
sec­ret to <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accused Arnold <span class="SpellE">Viterbo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cornal</span> were policemen of the town of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Masbate</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">; while accused Julian <span class="SpellE">Bartido</span>
and Ponte <span class="SpellE">Abinuman</span> were the con­stant companions or
bodyguards of Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span> who, aside from these
cases, had already <span style="">a </span>string of
convic­tions of various other crimes ranging from light threats to homicide.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence further show that early in the morning of <st1:date month="5" day="21" year="1962"><span style="">May </span>21, 1962</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Espinosa, along with <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tamares</span>, left the house of his father on <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Zurbito</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street> at about <st1:time hour="18" minute="0">6:00 o'clock</st1:time> bound for the wharf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the jeep driven by <span class="SpellE">Moises</span>
Espinosa turned left on <st1:street><st1:address>Port Road</st1:address></st1:street>,
<span class="SpellE">Moises</span> saw Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span>
with other persons sitting at a store (<span class="SpellE">Kakoy's</span>
Place).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Farther </span>down that road leading to the pier area, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Moises</span></span><span style=""> allegedly </span>saw Mayor <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> with policemen <span class="SpellE">Cornal</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Viterbo</span> in the store owned by <span class="SpellE">Lagarde's</span>
mother <span style="">(mother-in-law </span>to Mayor <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>), as Espinosa and <span class="SpellE">Tamares</span>
proceeded to the wharf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They stopped
beside the <span class="SpellE">Escano</span> bodega facing the sea, after
turning left from the <st1:street><st1:address>Port Road</st1:address></st1:street>
to the "riprap".</p>

<p class="BODY">At about this time, according to Harry Cortes, he was taking
coffee at the store of <span class="SpellE">Lagarde's</span> mother when Mayor <span class="SpellE">Magallenes</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cornal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Viterbo</span> entered the said store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span> arrived
later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Mayor opened the door of the
police pick-up truck parked on the <span style="">side
</span>of the road near the house of <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span>, out of
which truck <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span> got a long-<span class="SpellE">barrelled</span>
gun for him<span style="">self, </span>and two short
ones which he gave to accused <span class="SpellE">Bar­<span style="">tido</span></span><span style=""> </span>and <span class="SpellE">Abinuman</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then they
all left towards the coi­ner of the <span class="SpellE">Escano</span> bodega,
and from that direction, the same witness declared, he heard about twenty gun
shots of different detonations fired in succession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After­wards, the said witness allegedly saw
Mayor <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Magallanes</span></span><span style="">, </span><span class="SpellE">Cornal</span> and
<span class="SpellE">Viterbo</span> run back to the pick-up which they boarded
and then drove fast along th<span style="">e </span><st1:street><st1:address>Port
  Road</st1:address></st1:street> to the upper portion of the town.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that when the successive burst of gunfire broke out, <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Espinosa was still in his parked jeep beside the <span class="SpellE">Ecano</span> bodega.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
seated be­hind the steering wheel of the vehicle with <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tamares</span> at his right.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No sooner did <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Espinosa realize that he <span style="">and his </span>companion were the objects of
the gun shots which came from behind them, for suddenly, he found himself and <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamares</span> wounded and bleed­ing
profusely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He immediately looked back by
<span style="">peering </span>at the left side of his
jeep and saw all the accused some 7 or 8 meters behind them, with their guns
pointed towards him and <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamares</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span> was
holding a grease gun, while the rest were pointing <span style="">their </span>short guns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Inspite</span> of his wounds, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Moises</span></span><span style=""> Espin<span style="">osa </span>was able </span>to
drive his jeep forward <span style="">in <span style="">a </span><span class="SpellE">zig-zag</span>
manner </span>to the corner of the road ahead, at the same time looking back at
his assailants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He turned left upon
reaching the corner, and with increased accelera­tion, headed for his father's
house about 150 meters away from the scene of the shooting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span style="">a
</span>minute or so, <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Espinosa reached the
house and shouted to his father, "Papa, Papa, I was shot by <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> and his companions."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The father was apparently shocked at the sight
of his wounded son and his companion, <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Ta­mares</span>, whose head was then slumped on the lap of <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Espinosa.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although the father, Emilio Espinosa, Sr., was a doctor by profession,
he failed or forgot to give the victims any emergency or first aid treatment; <span style="">all </span>he could do under the
circumstances was to order a re­lative, Jose <span class="SpellE">Zurbito</span>,
to drive the same jeep and take the wounded Noises Espinosa and <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamares</span> to the Provincial
Hospital of <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span> where they were given emergency
treatment at about 6:45 that same morning.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Marcial</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Tamares</span> was
found to have sustained ten (10) bullet wounds in different parts of his body,
all through and through, which snuffed out his life at about <st1:time hour="9" minute="30">9:30 a.m.</st1:time> of that day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Espinosa sustained two bullet wounds,
one piercing the left side of his back and com­ing out of his chest, while the
other went through his right arm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
airlifted to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> in the
afternoon of that day and taken to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Doctors</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
<span style="">where he </span>was successfully
treated.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that soon after the shooting at the wharf, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span> surrendered to the authorities and admitted and
confessed his sole authorship of the offenses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Julian <span class="SpellE">Bartido</span> also surrendered and pointed <span style="">to the </span>authorities the place where the
guns used were hidden.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other accused
were taken into custody later.</p>

<p class="BODY">Evidence for the defense tends to show that accused Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>, Arnold <span class="SpellE">Viterbo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cornal</span> were in their
respective houses when the shooting at the wharf took place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> sought
to prove that he <span style="">was </span>suffering
from arthritis at the time, a <span class="SpellE">rheuma</span> of the joints of
the feet, and that he did not leave the house in the morning of <st1:date month="5" day="21" year="1962">May 21, 1962</st1:date>, for then he could
hardly walk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A host of witnesses also
swore to the fact that <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>, <span class="SpellE">Viterbo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cornal</span> were not seen
in the pier area on that day, and that the police pick-up they supposedly rode
in on the <span style="">day </span>of the killing
was then out of order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a word, they
all denied any par­ticipation in the commission of the crimes charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused Julian <span class="SpellE">Bartido</span>
and Ponte <span class="SpellE">Abinuman</span> admitted that they were in the
pier <span style="">area </span>that morning, but <span class="SpellE">Abinuman</span> claimed that he had left the place when the
shooting took place, while <span class="SpellE">Bartido</span> declared that he
did not par­ticipate in the shooting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
admitted <span class="SpellE">tho</span> that <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span>
handed to him a 45-caliber pistol when they were <span style="">still </span>in the house of <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span>; and <span style="">that <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span>
returned </span>to the house and grabbed it back from him after emptying the
grease gun of its bullets, firing once again at the fleeing jeep of <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Espinosa with the said pistol.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing evidence, briefly stated, was the basis of the
decision of the lower court now under consideration; and as previously set
forth also, re­sulted in the acquittal of accused Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>,
Arnold <span class="SpellE">Viterbo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cornal</span>, and the conviction of accused Julian <span class="SpellE">Bartido</span> and Ponte <span class="SpellE">Abinuman</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Ponte <span class="SpellE">Abinuman</span> claims that
the trial court erred in finding him guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the
murder of <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamares</span>
(Criminal Case No. 4136) and of frustrated murder of <span class="SpellE">Moises</span>
Espinosa (Criminal Case No. 4138).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
contended that there <span style="">is </span>no clear
evidence of record that would tend to show that appellant had directly
participated in the commis­sion of the crime, or that be ever <span style="">conspired with </span>any of the accused to
commit the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have carefully
examined the evidence pertinent to the above-assigned errors which <span class="GramE">We</span> shall now <span style="">set </span>forth.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, the only <span class="SpellE">inculpatory</span> facts
establish­ed by the prosecution insofar as herein appellant is concerned, were
those testified to by one of the victims, <span class="SpellE">Moises</span>
Espinosa, and one Harry Cortes, an alleged by-stander near the scene of the
crimes charged in the morning of May 21, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On this point, <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Espinosa testified that
on his way to the pier, he saw Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span> with a
group of men in a store at the corner of <span class="SpellE">Zurbito</span>
Street and Port Road, some 45 meters from the <span class="SpellE">Escano</span>
bodega where he later parked his jeep with <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamares</span>; that at another place farther down the Port Road,
he saw Mayor <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> with ac­cused Arnold <span class="SpellE">Viterbo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> Carnal inside
the store owned by <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Lagarde'</span>s</span><span style=""> </span>mother (mother-in-law to Ma­yor <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>), about 15 meters from the scene of the
shooting; that <span style="">as
</span>he sat there in his jeep with <span class="SpellE">Mar­cial</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamares</span> beside him, just beside the <span class="SpellE">Escano</span>
<span style="">bodega, </span>he
kept the engine of his jeep running; that upon hear­ing the successive outburst
of gunfire behind his jeep, he readily realized that he and <span class="SpellE">Tamares</span>
were wounded and bleeding; that he immediately looked back by peer­ing at the left
side of his jeep and saw Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lagar­de</span> about 7
meters <span style="">away </span>holding
the grease-gun similar to Exhibit "F", with accused Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> on the right side of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Lagarde</span></span><span style=""> holding the pistol</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.<span style=""> G); </span>that <span class="SpellE">Viterbo</span>
was a little behind <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> with <span class="SpellE">Cornal</span> at his right, both holding short arms aimed at him;
that he also saw Ponte <span class="SpellE">Abinuman</span> some meters away from
<span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span>, with <span class="SpellE">Bartido</span> about
one meter away from Ponte, both also holding short guns aimed at hint; that at
about the same time, he moved his jeep slowly forward in a zigzag manner as he
looked back at his assail­ants; that he could not drive fast then because the
corner of the road was near and he wanted to turn left; that after turning left
at the corner, he drove faster towards the house of his father; that before
reaching the house, <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamares</span>
who was vomiting blood, slumped his head on his lap, but he continued driving;
that upon reaching the house, he shouted to his father, "Papa, Papa, <span class="SpellE">binadil</span> <span class="SpellE">aco</span> <span class="SpellE">ni</span>
<span class="SpellE">Magallenes</span> <span class="SpellE">cag</span> san <span class="SpellE"><span style="">iya</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">caoropod</span>"
( Papa, Papa, I was shot by <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> and his
companions) ; that in the emergency room of the <span class="SpellE">Mas­bate</span>
Provincial Hospital, his statement was taken by their family lawyer upon whose
question, "Who shot you?", he gave the answer, "<span class="SpellE">Liling</span>, Mayor, <span class="SpellE">Veterbo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cornal</span> and other policemen"; that <span style="">at </span>the time that statement (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. U) was taken at about 7:00 o'clock that same morning,
he was already weak and getting dizzy, that is why he wanted to cut short or
abbreviate the answers he gave at the time; that lining referred to in that
statement is Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span>; Mayor <span style="">is </span>Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>;
the two others are <span class="SpellE">Viterbo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cornal</span>,
while the "other policemen” spoken of in the statement are really Julian <span class="SpellE">Bartido</span> and Ponte <span class="SpellE">Abinuman</span>; and
that as to herein appel­lant, he could not have been mistaken, for he had known
him for about three(3) years already as a member of his union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admitted, however, that he knows that
appellant Ponte <span class="SpellE">Abinuman</span> is not a member of the
police de­partment of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Masbate</span></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Harry Cortes, on the other hand, declared that he was inside the <span style="">store </span>of Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lagarde's</span>
mother on Port Road at about 6:20 in the morning of May 21, 1962, tak­ing his
coffee; that he was already there when Mayor <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>,
Arnold <span class="SpellE">Viterbo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Qurino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cornal</span> (police­men) entered the store and occupied another
table in the <span style="">store; </span>that a short
while after, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span> also entered the said
store and whispered something to <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Maga­</span>llanes</span>, after which they got out of the place; that he
saw Mayor <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Magallanes</span></span><span style=""> </span>open the door of the police pick-up
which was parked on the side of the road about four(4) meters from the store;
that he saw Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span> get from inside the
vehicle <span style="">a </span>long-<span class="SpellE">barrelled</span> gun and then give other guns to Julian <span class="SpellE">Bartido</span> and Ponte <span class="SpellE">Abinuman</span>; that
thereafter, he saw the group proceed towards the <span class="SpellE">Escano</span>
bodega; that from the direction of the <span style="">said
</span>bodega, he later heard about twenty (20) gun shots of varied detonations
in succession; that he did not leave <span style="">the
place and watched, and he saw Mayor <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> with
policemen <span class="SpellE">Cornal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Viterbo</span>
run from the corner of the <span class="SpellE">Escano</span> bodega, back to the
pick-up, which they boarded and drove fast towards the upper portion of the
town along Port Road in the direction of the Post Office; that he left the
store only after the Mayor's group had gone; and that in the afternoon of May
22, 1962, the day following the shooting, his statement was taken down in
writing at the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(This statement was not presented in
evidence).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The witness admitted that he
is a member of the union headed by the victim, <span class="SpellE">Moises</span>
Espinosa.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For his defense,
appellant Ponte <span class="SpellE">Abinuman</span> testi­fied during the trial
that at about 6:00 a.m., May 21, 1962, he went to the pier area to move his
vowels under the Wharf; that he use to do so because there is no public toilet
in the vicinity where he lives; that on his way down the road, he saw at the
store on the cor­ner of <span class="SpellE">Zurbito</span> Street and Port Road
a group of men; that he recognized among those people there Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span>; that he did not join the group nor talk or con­verse
with any one there but proceeded to the wharf to answer the call of nature;
that on his way back to his house, he met the jeep of <span class="SpellE">Moises</span>
Espinosa, who was at the wheel, with <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamares</span> sitting at his right side; that <span class="SpellE">Tamares</span>
addressed him, "Ponte, where is <span class="SpellE">Leling</span>?";
that </span><span style="">he
</span><span style="">informed <span class="SpellE">Tamares</span>
that he saw Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span> (<span class="SpellE">Leling</span>)
with other persons at the store on corner <span class="SpellE">Zurbito</span>
Street and Port Road (<span class="SpellE">Kakoy's</span> Place); that when he
passed by the store of Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lagarde's</span> mother, he
saw <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span> there with his sister; that he was asked
by <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span>, "What did <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span>
ask you?"; that he informed <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span> that <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamares</span> inquired from him
where he (<span class="SpellE">Leling</span>) is; that after that he pro­ceeded
towards his house, but on the way, <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> requested him to help carry up her house a table
which he and <span class="SpellE">Celedonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Desuyo</span>
lifted up the new apart­ment; that when they were already inside the house,
that was the time he heard successive shots, which he did not mind because he
did not know then whether they were gunshots or firecrackers; that at about
6:45 that same morning, he was fetched from his place by a cer­tain <span class="SpellE">Poldo</span> who informed him that the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span> and the PC wanted to see him at the wharf; that
upon reaching the wharf, he was informed that they called for him because a boy
had said that one of those who fired at <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> </span><span style="">Espinosa </span><span style="">and <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamares</span> has a mustache, and since he has a mustache, it
would be better for him to stay in the meantime at the PC barracks to avoid
being suspected; that he consented and was taken to the PC Compound at about
7:00 o'clock </span><span style="">that same morning;
and that from that time up to about 4:00 o</span>'<span style="">clock in the afternoon of the following day when he </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">transferred to the Provincial Jail, nobody ever questioned or
investigated him about the shooting incident, but he </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">never released after that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Antonio <span class="SpellE">Aum</span> confirmed the fact that he
saw Ponte <span class="SpellE">Abinuman</span> in the house of <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> in the morning of <st1:date month="5" day="21" year="1962">May 21, 1962</st1:date>; that he happened to be
in the vicinity because he had gone out that morning on a bike for re­creation
and to go shopping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Asked by the court
why he would go shopping so early in the morning, <span class="SpellE">Aum</span>
ex­plained that shopping and going out for fresh air are just the same to him.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that during the taking of the deposi­tion of Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span>, the latter declared that he saw <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Espinosa and <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamares</span> that morning of May 21, 1962, <span style="">as </span>they passed by him at the corner
of <span class="SpellE">Zurbito</span> Street and Port Road; that as soon as they
were gone after turning left at the corner of the <span class="SpellE">Es­cano</span>
bodega, he went to the house of his mother; that at that precise time, Ponte <span class="SpellE">Abinuman</span> passed by and told him not to go out because <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Espinosa and <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamares</span> were looking for him; that he felt grateful to
Ponte because he gave him that warning; that he saw Ponte <span class="SpellE">Abinuman</span>
went up the road to his house after giving him the warning; and that Ponte <span class="SpellE">Abinuman</span> was not present when he shot at <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Espinosa and <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamares</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears further that <span style="">as
</span>soon as all the ac­cused in this case were picked up and confined in
jail, the PC at <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Masbate</span></st1:place>
requested the NBI Office in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> <span style="">to send a representative to </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Masbate</span></span></st1:place><span style=""> to examine the suspects in the Provincial
Jail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date month="5" day="23" year="1962"><span style="">May 23, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, a che­</span><span style="">mist from the NBI Office in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> arrived in </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Masbate</span></span></st1:place><span style=""> and a paraffin test was conducted of the
suspects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hands of Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span>, Julian <span class="SpellE">Bartido</span> and Ponte
<span class="SpellE">Abi­numan</span> were examined, and from the results of the
exa­mination it was proven that Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span> and
Julian <span class="SpellE">Bartido</span> were positive of gunpowder or nitrates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ponte <span class="SpellE">Abinuman<span style="">'</span><span style="">s</span></span> </span><span style="">hands, however, were found </span><span style="">negative of pow­der burns, while accused
Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>, Arnold <span class="SpellE">Viterbo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cornal</span> were not
given the paraffin tests notwithstanding the fact that at the time they were
all confined in </span><span style="">the same jail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After </span><span style="">a careful examination of the evidence </span><span style="">above set forth and the conclusions reached
by the lower court on the </span><span style="">basis </span><span style="">thereof, We are more</span><span style=""> inclined to </span><span style="">sustain the claim of herein appellant that <span style="">the trial </span>court fell into error in convicting him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, the court below did not give much
credence to the testimonies of accused Ponte <span class="SpellE">Abinuman</span>
and Antonio <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Aum</span></span><span style="">, </span>but it would seem that it gave no
weight also to the testimonies of prosecution <span style="">witnesses <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Espinosa </span>and Harry Cortes,
for notwithstanding the statements in Court of Espinosa and Cortes to the
effect that they saw all the accused together near the scene of the shooting,
accused Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>, Arnold <span class="SpellE">Viterbo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cornal</span> were acquitted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The matter of assigning values to declarations <span style="">at </span>the witness stand is best and most competently performed or car­ried
out by a trial judge who, unlike<span style="">
appellate magistrates, can weigh </span>such testimony in the light of the <span class="SpellE">declarant's</span> demeanor, conduct and attitude at the trial;
and as far as credibility and veracity of <span style="">witnesses </span>are concerned, the conclusions of lower courts command,
great weight and respect, for <span style="">their
proximate contact </span>with those who take to the witness stand places them
in a more competent <span style="">position to discrimi­nate
</span>between the true and the false (See, People vs. <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span>,
L-25403, March 15, 1968, <span style="">and cases
therein cited); </span>And We find no compelling <span style="">reasons, after examining the declarations of the principal witnesses, </span>both
for the prosecution and for herein appellant, to</span> question the relative
weight the trial court <span style="">assigned on
their testimonies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it is quite
illogical that on the </span>strength of the same testimonies which <span style="">appear </span>to have been discredited by the
court insofar <span style="">as </span>some of herein
appellant's co-accused in the same <span style="">case
is </span>concerned, would be given much weight in pinning <span style="">lia­</span>bility as against said appellant
(See People vs. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, et al., L-13789, June 30,
1960; and <span style="">People vs. </span>Chaw Yaw
Shun @ George Chua, et <span style="">al., L-1</span>9590,
April 25, 1968).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, such fact
alone, <span style="">even if in­dulged in by the
trial court, cannot be the basis of acquittal, if </span>apart from the
testimonies of <span style="">witnesses </span>discredited
by the court there are <span style="">other <span class="SpellE">inculpatory</span> facts </span>testified to by other credible <span style="">witnesses upon </span>which a verdict of
conviction may be reached.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the
situation is not such in this <span style="">case
either where, </span>independent of the testimonies of prosecution <span style="">witness­es <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> </span>Espinosa
and Harry Cortes, nothing appears in the record upon which we may deduce that
Ponte <span class="SpellE">Abi­numan</span> <span style="">directly participated in </span>the commission <span style="">of the crimes charged in these cases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lower court had referred </span>to herein appellant as an
"informer", <span style="">intim</span>ating
that Ponte <span class="SpellE">Abinuman</span> had conspired with the other
accused Julian <span class="SpellE">Bartido</span> and the confessed gun­man, Manuel
<span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span>, in the commission of <span style="">said crimes; but this conclusion is not even supported by the evidence,
because if we were to give any credence at all to the testimony of Ponte <span class="SpellE">Abinuman</span>, the situation would be worse, for according to
him, all that be did was to relay the information to Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span>
that early morning of May 21, 1962, that <span class="SpellE">Moises</span>
Espinosa and <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamares</span>
were looking for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this is
confirmed by the declaration of Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span> that
herein appellant had warned him not to go out that morning because <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Es­pinosa and <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamares</span> were looking for him; and that after giving the
said warning, Ponte <span class="SpellE">Abinuman</span> pro­ceeded up the port
road to his house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such fact alone does
not show that herein appellant had conspired with <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span>
in the commission of the crimes charged, even if it were true that upon receipt
of such information, <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span> decided to kill <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Espinosa and <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamares</span> under the fear that if he did not get them first,
they will kill him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the observation
of the court below, that the testimony of Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span>,
com­ing as it does from a co-accused with a string of con­victions of various
other offenses, deserves scant consideration; and perhaps it may be said that
the testi­monies of herein appellant and Antonio <span class="SpellE">Aum</span>
are also not very reliable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the
weakness of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">defense alone can­not be the basis of conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The guilt of the accused must be proved
beyond reasonable doubt, and this, the prosecution failed to establish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that the name of herein appellant
was mentioned for the first time by the surviving victim, <span class="SpellE">Moises</span>
Espinosa, only when he testified in court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When he came home immediately after the shooting, <span class="SpellE">Moises</span>
appears to have reported to his fa­ther that they were shot by "<span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> and his companions”.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his statement taken during his confinement
at the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Masbate</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placename><span style="">Provincial</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">Hospital</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> where he was taken a few minutes thereafter,
Espinosa declared that his assailants were "<span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>, <span class="SpellE">Viterbo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cornal</span> and <u>other policemen</u>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He explained later in court that he failed to
mention the names of Julian <span class="SpellE">Bartido</span> and Ponte <span class="SpellE">Abinuman</span> (herein appellant) on that occasion because then
he was already feeling weak and dizzy as a result of the serious wounds he
sustained; and that when he mentioned <u>other policemen</u>, he was really
referring to Julian <span class="SpellE">Bartido</span> and Ponte <span class="SpellE">Abinuman</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
we cannot overlook the fact that such failure on his part to make mention of
the name of herein appellant at the time would create doubt in a reasonable
mind as to the truth of his reference to <span class="SpellE">Bartido</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abinuman</span> as the persons he </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">referring to by saying "other
policemen", in the light of his admission in court that he knew accused
Julian <span class="SpellE">Bartido</span> and herein appellant very well long
before the shooting; and that he was aware of the fact that they were not
policemen at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Added to this is
the circumstance that Ponte <span class="SpellE">Abinuman</span> appears to have
been taken into the cus­tody of the authorities shortly after, at 6:45 a.m. of
the same day, of the shooting, and remained in confine­ment thereafter, and
wonderfully enough, his hands were found negative of gunpowder when he was
examined by the NBI with <span class="SpellE">Lagarde</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bartido</span> who, on the other hand, proved to be positive of
gun powder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such circumstances, coupled
with the fact, already mentioned, that the trial court appears to have doubted
the veracity of the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Espinosa
and Harry Cortes to the effect that herein appellant was one of the men seen at
the scene of the crime </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">said
witnesses, give support to the inevitable conclusion that the guilt of herein
appel­lant was not proved beyond per adventure of doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the decisions in this case, as
to him, should be reversed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
