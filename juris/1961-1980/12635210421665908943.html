Court of Industrial Relations <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> dated November 9, 1964; and
L-32725, an original action of certiorari filed by the Mayfair Theatre, Inc.,
questioning the order of said court dated June 11, 1969 and its resolution <u>en</u>

instituted by the aforesaid employees on September 18, 1959, charging said
company and/or Henry Yang<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
with arbitrary dismissal due to union activities <span style="">and/or affiliation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The National
Federation of Labor Unions (NAFLU) originally joined as complainant in the
court below, but was subsequently dropped upon its own motion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On June 29, 1962, the trial
judge, Hon. <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> </span>I. Martinez, rendered a
decision holding that the dismissal of two of the complainants, namely, <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> <span class="SpellE">Ofilada</span> and <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Damulo</span>, was justified;
but finding the employer guilty of unfair labor practice in dismissing the
other two - Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Astorga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
Castillo - and ordering that they be reinstated, without back wages for <span class="SpellE">Astorga</span> but with back wages for Castillo from the date of
his dis­missal (September 2, 1959) up to his actual reinstatement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both parties moved for partial reconsideration of the decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="9">September 2, 1962</st1:date>,
while the motions for reconsideration were pending before the court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>,
NAFLU moved to withdraw as complainant in the case, alleging that the same had
been filed without its knowledge or authorization and that the complainant
employees had never been bona fide members of the union.</p>

<p class="BODY">The employer, in turn, filed an amended petition For Partial
Relief From Judgment on October 5, 1962, alleging two grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) that in view of the manifesta­tion of
NAFLU that the complainant workers had never been members of the union, their
dismissal from employment, contrary to the finding of the trial judge, <span style="">could not have </span>been for union
activities; and (b) that <span class="SpellE">Astorga</span>, Castillo and <span class="SpellE">Ofilada</span> had each been found guilty of the offense of
threats and sentenced to imprisonment for 15 days by the City Court of Manila
in Criminal Case No. F-047844, and that in another case for slight physical
injuries, Criminal Case No, F-047845, <span class="SpellE">Astorga</span> had
likewise been found guilty and sentenced by the same court to imprisonment for
25 days.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On July 22, 1964 the
lower court issued an </span>order granting the motion of NAFLU to withdraw as
com­plainant but denied the employer's Petition For Partial Relief From
Judgment on the grounds that the complainant workers did sign affiliation
papers with NAFLU in February 1959, although they resigned a few days later;
that they again affiliated in August of the same year, and were even told by
the president of NAFLU to solicit more members; and that <span class="SpellE">NAFLU's</span>
motion to withdraw as complainant was motivated, merely by personal differences
between the union president and the complainants' counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same order, however, the court
deferred the reinstatement of <span class="SpellE">Astorga</span> and Castillo
until the final termination of the criminal cases, which were then on appeal,
inasmuch as the same might affect their right to such reinstatement.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="11"><span style="">November
 9, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, the lower
court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> affirmed the decision of </span><st1:date year="1962" day="29" month="6"><span style="">June 29,
 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, but likewise
held reinstatement of <span class="SpellE">Astorga</span> and Castillo in

appearing, as found in the Order dated July 22, 1964, which has become final
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, that said complainants had been
convicted of cri­minal offenses, which are presently pending appeal and which
may affect their rights to reinstatement, said reinstate­ment should therefore
be held in abeyance until after the final determination of said criminal
charges. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

penned the resolution of <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>, which was fully
concurred in by Judge <span class="SpellE">Ans­berto</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>. Judge <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Tabigne</span> concurred and dissented, maintaining that the
dismissal of all four complainants was justified; Judge <span class="SpellE">Amando</span>
C. <span class="SpellE">Bugayong</span> also concurred in part, but dissented
with respect to the deferment of the reinstatement of <span class="SpellE">Astorga</span>
and Castillo; and Judge Vicente A. Rafael voted for the immediate reinstatement
of all four complainants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The aforesaid
resolution is the subject of review in case No. L-26124, wherein the
corresponding petition was filed by the four complainants, after extensions
granted by this Court, only on <st1:date year="1966" day="22" month="6">June
 22, 1966</st1:date>, they having received a copy of the said resolution on <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="5"><span style="">May </span>23, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1968</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Astorga</span> and Castillo filed a motion in the court
below for immediate reinstatement and computation of back wages, alleging that
the criminal case for threats against them had been finally dismissed by the
Court of First Instance of Manila in an order dated <st1:date year="1968" day="8" month="6">June 8, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The employer opposed the motion on the ground, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that although the case for threats had been
dismissed, <span class="SpellE">Astorga</span>, the only defendant in the slight
physical injuries case, had been found guilty on appeal and sentenced to
imprisonment for 15 days by the Court of First Instance of Manila on <st1:date year="1964" day="11" month="2">February 11, 1964</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1969</st1:date>
the court nevertheless directed "the reinstatement of <span class="SpellE">Astorga</span>
and Castillo to their former positions in the Mayfair Theatre, Inc., without
loss of seniority rights and other privileges." The court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
affirmed this order on <st1:date year="1970" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1970</st1:date>
and directed the Corporate Auditing Examiner of the court to compute the
recoverable back wages due to <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> Castillo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the foregoing order and resolution
Mayfair Theatre, Inc., came to this Court on certiorari (No. L-32725).</p>

<blockquote><u>L-26124<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In L-26124 the petitioners maintain:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) that the dismissal of <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ofilada</span> and Santiago <span class="SpellE">Damulo</span>
was contrary to law, discriminatory, and an abuse of dis­cretion on the part of
the lower court; (b) that the denial of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> to
Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Astorga</span> was discriminatory and contrary to
precedents; and (c) that the suspension of the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of the order to reinstate him and <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> Castillo
pending the termination of the criminal charges against them has no basis in
law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The facts concerning the
dismissal of each of </span>the four petitioners were considered by the lower
court and narrated in its decision separately.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In their brief these petitioners challenge the veracity of said facts in
a most perfunctory manner, and cite no evidence in the record to show
otherwise.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case of <span class="SpellE">Ofilada</span>, while he did affiliate with the union on August
19, 1959 and was dismissed on </span>the following August 24, the court found
that his dismissal had nothing to do with any union activities on his part but
was due to various infractions of company rules and regulations he had
committed, such as allowing his friends and relatives to enter the theater free
of charge, sleep­ing during working hours and leaving his ticket-booth open,
contrary to a standing instruction that it be closed at all times as a precaution
against hold-ups and other untoward incidents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Ofilada</span> was a ticket-seller and knew of that
instruction, issued precisely because a hold-up had just been attempted in
another theater; and yet <span class="SpellE">Ofilada</span>, while on duty,
would admit visitors and friends inside a room near the ticket-booth and carry
on conversation with them through its open doorway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree that these violations were serious
enough to warrant his dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With respect to <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Damulo</span>, who was </span>employed
as lobby boy, the lower court found that, like <span class="SpellE">Ofilada</span>,
he affiliated with the union on <st1:date year="1959" day="19" month="8">August
 19, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August 24 he
was transferred by the floor manager of the theater from the day shift to the
night shift, and at the same time was assigned from the Esquire Theater to the
Savoy Theater.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked respondent Henry
Yang that the change be recalled, but his request was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evi­dently he disliked the new assignment,
since he did not report for work beginning August 25.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After three days he was dismissed on August
28.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was nothing unusual or
discriminatory, according to the lower court, in <span class="SpellE">Damulo's</span>
change of assignment, because rotation of em­ployees from one shift to another
was a standard practice with respondent, adopted precisely to avoid any
discrimination among them; and <span class="SpellE">Damulo</span> had already
been in the morning shift for quite a time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We agree that for his insubordination <span style="">and </span>abandonment of work his dismissal was justified.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the cases of Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Astorga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> Castillo, their dismissal was viewed by the lower
court in a different light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Astorga</span> affiliated with the union on <st1:date year="1959" day="19" month="8">August 19, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was transferred from the Mayfair Theater to the Savoy Theater on
August 25; and on August 27 he was dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reason for his dismissal, according to the respondents, <span style="">was </span>abandonment of work for three
days - from August 25 to 27, inclusive.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Analyzing the conflicting evidence on this point, however, the lower
court found that <span class="SpellE">Astorga</span> complied with his new
assignment and actually worked at the Savoy Theater the first two days, but
became ill with fever after he was caught in the rain while changing the
posters outside the movie-house in the afternoon of August 26, upon
instructions of the floor manager, who was duly informed of such illness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Astorga</span> did commit,
however, certain irregularities, although the evidence has not established
their causal relation to his dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus he had an unexplained absence on <st1:date year="1959" day="23" month="8">August 23, 1959</st1:date>, although after that he was allowed to
work again and indeed was even transferred to another theater; and on one
occasion he took a film out to be shown at <span class="SpellE">Ofilada's</span>
house in <span class="SpellE">Muntinglupa</span> - an act not mentioned in the
letter discharging him and brought up only thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was for such irregularities that the lower
court denied him back wages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not
find such denial to be unjustified under the circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> Castillo was one of the movie
projectionists when he was dismissed on <st1:date year="1959" day="2" month="9">September
 2, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like the other
petitioners he was transferred to the Savoy Theater on <st1:date year="1959" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The evidence in his case is even more conflicting than in that of <span class="SpellE">Astorga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
testimony is that he became a member of the union as early as February 25,
1959; that the next day he was called by his uncle, Tomas <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>,
floor manager of the Mayfair Theater, who questioned him<span style=""> </span>about a meeting of the union supposedly held at its office, but
which, Castillo answered, was still to be held in the evening of that day; that
he was taken by <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> to the office of Henry Yang,
where he was inves­tigated in connection with his membership in the union; that
he admitted being a member after <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> gave him a
beating; that <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> asked him to resign from the
union and<span style=""> did not allow him to work for
one day, as </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">result of which the union filed charges
against the respondents (Case No. 1994-ULP), but the case was dismissed by the
court; and that thereafter he was allowed to work again, and on August 19, 1959
rejoined the union.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents' version is entirely different. Castillo,
according to them, was not dismissed for his union activities but because he
was caught sleeping several times while on duty, and punching the time record
of another employee, for which he even wrote his uncle a letter of apology on
August 28, 1959.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span>need not go
into an analysis of the factual findings made by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is
</span>enough that there is substantial evidences to support them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question of credibility is addressed
mainly to the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">trier</span></span><span style=""> of the facts, and unless there is clear and
manifest error, amounting to an abuse of discretion, the findings should not be
disturbed on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the trial
court found that <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> Castillo had been dismissed
by reason of his union activities, the order of reinstatement with back wages
was not without justi­fication.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><u>L-32725<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Mayfair Theatre, Inc., petitioner in this second case,
questions the order of the trial court dated June 11, 1969, affirmed by the
court <u>en</u> <u><span style="">banc</span></u><span style=""> </span>on October 8, 1970, directing the
reinstatement of <span class="SpellE">Astorga</span> and Castillo to their former
positions, and the com­putation of the latter's back wages.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first contention of petitioner <span style="">is </span>that the court exceeded its
jurisdiction in ordering reinstate­ment in view (1) of the order of July 22,
1964, which had become "final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,"
holding such reinstate­ment in abeyance until the criminal cases against <span class="SpellE">Astorga</span> and Castillo were terminated, and (2) of the fact
that these two respondents were finally found guilty in said cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first ground is untenable on its face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The very nature of the order of <st1:date year="1964" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1964</st1:date> shows that the basic
decision of <st1:date year="1962" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1962</st1:date>,
in which the right to reinstatement of <span class="SpellE">Astorga</span> and
Castillo was adjudged, was neither set aside nor amended, but that such
reinstatement was merely suspended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
alleged finality of the order of <st1:date year="1964" day="22" month="7">July
 22, 1964</st1:date> did not affect the jurisdiction of the court to enforce
its decision after the termination of the criminal cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">The real issue is whether, considering that the reinstatement of
the two respondents as adjudged in the decision had been suspended precisely by
virtue of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of criminal charges against
them, the trial court was justified in ordering them reinstated after they were
finally found guilty of such charges.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the first place, the
premise of the argument </span>is not entirely correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the criminal case for threats, while both
respondents were convicted in the City Court of Manila, the case was appealed
to the Court of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
latter returned it to the court of origin in 1963 upon motion of the
prosecuting Fiscal on the ground that the appeal should have been taken to the
Court of Appeals directly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears
that the City Court sat on the case for five years, only to send it back in
1968 to the Court of First Instance which thereupon dis­missed the case in the
interest of justice, considering the light character of the offense and the
long delay already suffered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the
circumstances it cannot be said that the accused had been found guilty by final
judgment in the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the case for slight physical injuries, it should
be noted that like the one for slight threats, it arose from an incident which
had nothing to do with the dismissal of the respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That in­cident took place on <st1:date year="1962" day="7" month="5">May 7, 1962</st1:date>, almost three years later,
when <span class="SpellE">Astorga</span>, together with his co-employees and
co-peti­tioners in case No. L-26124, passed at the lobby of the Mayfair Theater
after attending a birthday party of their, lawyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Coming upon a certain <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Esquila</span>, a theater employee, <span class="SpellE">Astorga</span>
gave him two fist blows in the stomach, causing one contusion which, however,
required no medical attendance.</p>

<p class="BODY">Obviously that incident, which happened years after <span class="SpellE">Astorga</span> was dismissed from employment, could not materially
affect the question of whether or not it was justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And while the respondent court, in its order
of July 22, 1964, deferred his reinstatement because the outcome of the
criminal charges against him <u>might</u> affect his right thereto, it is
equally obvious that after <span class="SpellE">Astorga</span> was finally found
guilty on appeal and sentenced to imprisonment for fifteen days, the said <span style="">court did not take that fact as </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">sufficient ground to deny such reinstatement
altogether.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not see that a
reversible error was committed in this regard, especial­ly considering that <span class="SpellE">Astorga</span> was denied back wages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The last point raised by petitioner <span style="">is </span>that the order of <st1:date year="1969" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1969</st1:date>, affirmed by the
resolution of the respondent court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> dated <st1:date year="1970" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1970</st1:date>, con­stitutes an
interference with the jurisdiction of this Court in L-26124.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The point has no merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is under review in L-26124 is the order
holding the judgment for reinstatement in abeyance until the criminal cases
were terminated, and there is no inconsistency between the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of this review and the issuance of the afore­said order and resolution of
reinstatement, which are challenged by the petitioner, Mayfair Theater, Inc.,
in the other petition, L-32725.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS</b>, the petitions in
these two cases are dismissed; the orders and resolutions in question are
affirmed, with the modification that (a) with respect to <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
Castillo, his <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> should be from the date of
his dismissal on September 2, 1959 up to the time he is actually reinstated,
but excluding the time comprised between July 22, 1964, when his reinstatement
was suspended, and June 11, 1969, when it was again ordered, and deducting
whatever earnings Castillo may have received from other sources during the
entire period that he is entitled to back w<span style="">ages; and </span>(b) with respect to Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Astorga</span>,
he should be paid back-wages from June 11, 1969 until he is reinstated, but de­ducting
likewise whatever earnings he may have received during that period from other
