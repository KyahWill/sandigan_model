				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">From a decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> in a special civil action for certiorari and pro­hibition
with preliminary injunction, this appeal was taken.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1928" day="28" month="10">October 28, 1928</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Calixto</span> <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> filed with
the Bureau of Lands a sales application for a parcel of land in <span class="SpellE">Mabolo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ampayon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Agusan</span></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said application (SA No. 11116-E-2193)
described the land, then not yet surveyed, by stating identifiable natural
boundaries, and approximated its area at 77 hectares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Bureau of Lands approved the application
on <st1:date year="1931" day="8" month="10">October <span style="">8, </span>1931</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1932 <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> appointed <span class="SpellE">Doroteo</span> <span class="SpellE">Lavadia</span> overseer of the
land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1942 Lope <span class="SpellE">Desiata</span>
requested and was al­lowed by <span class="SpellE">Lavadia</span> to stay in a
portion of the land.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In 1947 <span class="SpellE">Lavadia</span> was replaced as overseer </span>by <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Amparo</span></span><span style=""> L. Santos who asked <span class="SpellE">Desiata</span>
to vacate the land occupied by him since 1942.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In March 1947 <span class="SpellE">Desiata</span>, after payment to
him of <span style="">P100 </span>for his improvements
thereon, vacated the portion of land occupied by him; but he transferred to
another site con­taining 14 hectares and asserted a claim over the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 14 and 21, 1947, a provisional survey of the land
applied for by <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> was conducted by a Public Land
Inspector who found that only 10 hectares were un<span style="">der actual cultivation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, he recommended that sales patent be issued after final
survey.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1947" day="15" month="5"><span style="">May 15,
 1947</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> filed a formal protest, alleging illegal entry of <span class="SpellE">Desiata</span> on the land applied for </span>by him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1947" day="21" month="5"><span style="">May 21,
 1947</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Desiata</span> filed with the Bureau of Lands a homestead
application over the 14-hectare area he has occupied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Said claims resulted in
the docketing of B.L. Con­flict No. 52, entitled "H.A. Unnumbered, <span class="SpellE">Desiata</span>, <span class="GramE">appli­cant</span>-contestant vs.
SA No. 11116 (E-2193) <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>, appli­cant-respondent."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1947" day="23" month="9"><span style="">September
 23, 1947</span></st1:date><span style="">, a survey
was made of the land applied for by <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The surveyor, using the same natu­ral
boundaries as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, found the area to be
90.9447 hectares, or 14 hectares <u>more</u> than the </span>77 <span style="">hec­tares stated in the application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Said
</span><span style="">excess was the portion occupied
by <span class="SpellE">Desiata</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On May 16, 1949, the District
Land Officer rendered a decision giving due course to the sales application of <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> and </span><span style="">dismissing </span><span style="">the homestead application of <span class="SpellE">Desia­ta</span> on the
ground that the latter's application covered </span>land which is part of the
area included in <span class="SpellE">Duque's</span> application and that his
occupancy thereof was merely tolera­ted by <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1949" day="28" month="7"><span style="">July </span><span style="">28, </span><span style="">1949</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
Director of Lands issued an order wherein he sustained the findings of the
District Land Officer, but, in addition, held that <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>
failed </span>to protest the encroachment within six months as required by
paragraph <span style="">5, </span>Land Administrative
Order No. <span style="">6,
</span>Bureau of Lands, thereby losing his right over the disputed area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus a survey was ordered to exclude said
area and to <span style="">li­mit </span>the sales
application to 77 hectares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Director
of Lands furthermore noted that per the ocular inspection, <span style="">20 </span>or more hectares were still under
forest while the rest were mostly second growth forest, with about 10 hec­tares
under cultivation by <span class="SpellE">Manobo</span> tenants numbering three
families.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1949" day="24" month="12"><span style="">December
 24, 1949</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> moved </span><span style="">for
</span><span style="">a reconsidera­tion </span><span style="">of the foregoing order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting on said motion, the Director of Lands
on </span><st1:date year="1951" day="23" month="8"><span style="">August 23, 1951</span></st1:date><span style="">
suspended his order of </span><st1:date year="1949" day="28" month="7"><span style="">July 28, 1949</span></st1:date><span style=""> and remanded the case for further inves­tigation
</span><span style="">because the records disclosed
that <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> had </span><span style="">timely filed in May 1947 a protest against <span class="SpellE">Desiata's</span>
al­leged encroachment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1953" day="28" month="11"><span style="">November
 28, </span>1953</st1:date>, <span style="">the
Director of Lands, after reinvestigation and rehearing, rendered a decision
giving ­due course to <span class="SpellE">Duque's</span> application and
dismissing that of </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Desiata</span></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this decision, <span class="SpellE">Desiata</span>
on </span><st1:date year="1954" day="31" month="5"><span style="">May 31, 1954</span></st1:date><span style="">
appealed to the Secretary of Agriculture.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In his decision of <st1:date year="1954" day="15" month="11">November
 15, 1954</st1:date>, the Secreta­<span style="">ry </span>of
Agriculture (through the Undersecretary) found <span class="SpellE">De­siata's</span>
assigned errors without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But based
on the finding of the Director of Lands that 20 hectares of the land applied
for by <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> were still under forest and that the
rest were under second growth forest, except 10 hectares which were actually
cultivated, he ordered the amendment of <span class="SpellE">Duque's</span>
petition to exclude the area occu­pied and applied for by <span class="SpellE">Desiata</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1954" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1954</st1:date>
<span class="SpellE">Duque's</span> counsel received a co­py of the Secretary's
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Duque</span>
himself received a copy in January, 1955.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 24, 1955, <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>, through
another coun­sel, filed in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>
a suit to annul the decision of the Secretary of Agricul­ture (Civil Case No.
391).</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 22, 1959, during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of
Civil Case No. 391, <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> addressed a letter-petition
to the Presi­dent of the Philippines praying for the setting aside of the
decision of the Secretary of Agriculture and the re­instatement of the decision
of the Director of Lands of November 28, 1953, based on the alleged grounds
that there was lack of notice to him of the ocular inspection to determine the
prerequisites of cultivation; that the appeal of <span class="SpellE">Desiata</span>
did not raise cultivation requisite as an issue; and that he was denied due
process.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 16, 1959, <span class="SpellE">Desiata</span> moved to
dismiss <span class="SpellE">Duque's</span> appeal to the President.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 19, 1960, a decision was rendered by the Executive
Secretary (for the President) revoking the de­cision of the Secretary of
Agriculture and reaffirming that of the Director of Lands of November 28, 1953
which gave due course to <span class="SpellE">Duque's</span> application and
dismissed <span class="SpellE">De­siata's</span> homestead application.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On August 31, 1960, <span class="SpellE">Desiata</span> moved for a reconside­ration of the Executive
Secretary's decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was denied on
September 30, 1960.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On November 23, 1960, <span class="SpellE">Desiata</span> filed in
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> the present suit for certiorari, prohibition and
preliminary injunction against the Executive Secretary.</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing, the lower court on June 29, 1963 rendered judgment
holding that the Executive Secretary committed grave abuse of discretion in
entertaining the appeal from the decision of the Secretary of Agricul­ture
which had already long become final, and that there­fore his decision was null
and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents appealed to <span class="GramE">Us</span> to raise
questions of law having to do with the finality or non-finality and the
validity or invalidity of the decision of the Secretary of Agriculture dated
November 15, 1954.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the point of finality, Section 12 of Adminis­trative Order
No. 6 (Bureau of Lands) provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 12.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="">Finality </span></u><u><span style="">of decisions promul­gated by Secretary</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- </span>The
decision of the Se­cretary of Agriculture and Commerce (now Na­tural Resources)
or the Undersecretary of an appealed case shall become final, unless other­wise
specifically stated therein, after the lapse of thirty (30) days from the date
of its receipt by the interested parties."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="SpellE">Duque's</span> counsel
received a copy of the questioned deci­sion on <st1:date year="1954" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1954</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, based on the afore-quoted Section 12 of Administrative Order
No. 6, said de­cision became final on <st1:date year="1954" day="26" month="12">December
 26, 1954</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> al­legedly received said decision <span style="">in </span>the
middle of January 1955 is of no moment because it is settled principle in this
jurisdiction that receipt of processes by counsel is receipt by the party
himself.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
In fact, counsel's fail­ure to inform his client of an adverse judgment is not
even a ground for setting aside a judgment valid and re­gular on its face;<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
neither is it necessarily a ground for granting relief against the result of
neglect.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The decision having become final, the Executive Se­cretary had no
more power to review it when <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> filed his
letter-petition on <st1:date year="1959" day="22" month="5">May 22, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither can it be seriously contended that
the President has power to al­ter Administrative Order No. 6 <u><span style="">retroactively</span></u><span style=""> </span>by setting it aside to be able to
review a decision <u><span style="">already final</span></u><span style=""> </span>and to revoke rights already vested
therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>, however, argues that
Administra­tive Order No. 6 itself recognizes certain exceptions wherein
decisions of the Secretary of Agriculture do not become final <span class="GramE">even</span> after 30 days, particularly citing Sec­tion 14
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this proviso is unavailing
to him because he does not contend that in his case there ob­tains any of the
recognized exceptions to finality lis­ted <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>,
to wit: mistake, inadvertence, default or excusable negligence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant, under the issue of validity, raises the question of
due process in order to impugn the decision of the Secretary of
Agriculture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is alleged that he did
not receive any notice of the ocular inspection that resulted in the report,
basis of the decision, that he had cultivated only 10 hectares of the land
applied for by him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Section </span>30 <span style="">of Act No. </span>2874, <span style="">as amended, which was the law in force when
the application of <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> was ap­proved in </span>1931,
<span style="">provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. <span style="">30.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- </span>Before
any patent is issued, the purchaser must show actual occupancy, cul­tivation,
and improvement of at least one-fourth of the land applied for until the date
on which final payment is made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(As amended by Sec. 5 of Act No. <span style="">3517)."</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clear that the afore-quoted law required ap­plicant for
sales patent to show actual occupancy and cul­tivation of at least 1/4 of the
land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Duque</span>
failed to prove that he had complied with this requirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So even disregarding the adverse report of
the ocular ins­pector, the absence of evidence upon this point operates against
sales patent applicant <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, besides, the allegation of alleged lack
of notice to <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> is suppor­ted by his self-serving
statement merely, which is insuf­ficient to rebut the presumption of regularity
of the of­ficial report and action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant further claims that if at all the notice was sent, the
purpose of the inspection was to determine the exact boundaries of the property
- not to find the extent of his actual cultivation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason for the ins­pection of the land is
obviously to ascertain compliance with <u>all</u> requisites of the law,
including cultivation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This i<span style="">s-</span>the import of Section 25 of Land
Circular No. 16 which provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 35.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u><span style="">Purpose</span></u><span style="">.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- </span>The
final investiga­tion is for the purpose of ascertaining whether the applicant
has complied with the require­ments of the law and regulations promulgated <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>, preparatory to the issuance of pa­tent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is necessary in homestead, sales and
free patent applications."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Director of Lands, having determined that the land <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> applied for has an area of 90.9447 hectares, rightly
ordered the exclusion of the excess so as to con­form substantially to the
requisite that one-fourth of the land <span class="GramE">be</span> under actual
cultivation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For as the court <u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>quo</u> aptly said, the rationale of the award is benefi­cial
use, and since <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> apparently could not cultivate a
larger area, he was properly awarded a lesser one.</p>

<p class="BODY">Summarizing, therefore, the foregoing, <span class="GramE">We</span>
find that the decision of the Secretary of Agriculture dated <st1:date year="1954" day="15" month="11">Novem­ber 15, 1954</st1:date> had become final
and beyond review by respondent Executive Secretary at the time the same was re­ferred
to him; and that said decision is in accord with law and is not defective for
lack of due process.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is hereby af­firmed,
with costs against appellant <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>.</p>
