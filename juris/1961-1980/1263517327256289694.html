Martinez, then assistant superintendent of banks, who submitted a report to the
Governor of the Central Bank enumerating therein a series of violations and
irregularities committed by <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on the reports of Messrs. Bate and Martinez, the Governor

analyze further the report and give the officials of the Central Bank charged
in said report as having committed the irregularities pointed therein, a chance

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1959" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1959</st1:date>,
the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank wrote a letter to the President of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> calling his attention to several or repeated

them; otherwise a more drastic action would be taken.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 29 of the same year <span class="SpellE">Nacianceno</span>

committed by <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> and recommending that its
management be placed in more capable hands; that examiners of the Department of
Rural Banks be detailed as <span class="SpellE">Lucena's</span> advisers, and
that the matter of illegal practices be referred to the Department of Rural
Banks for appropriate legal action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Other examiners were sent subsequently, their reports always
corroborating the findings of former examiners on them illegal practices of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 6, 1960 <span class="SpellE">Sixto</span> de la Costa and
Atty. Jose W. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>, Chairman of the Board of
Directors of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> and counsel, respectively, wrote
a letter to the Monetary Board requesting that action be taken to check and
counter­act attempts made by the NBI to discredit <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>
by press releases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reply thereto, the
Governor of the Central Bank informed <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> that the
Central Bank was not the source of said publications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On May 23, 1960, the Board of Directors of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> wrote the Central Bank requesting that "before
deliberating on any reports that may have been or may be submitted as a result
of the many investi­gations and examinations, the <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>
Rural Bank, Inc. be furnished with copies thereof and permitted to submit its
replies thereto, as well as given an opportunity to address the Monetary Board,
through its Chairman of the Board, its President and/or its Counsel", and
"that no publicity what­soever shall be given to the investigations
heretofore conducted or examinations that may hereinafter be conducted of the <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> Rural Bank; and, that, for any violation of these
instructions, the heads of the said departments and office shall be held
responsible".</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="17" month="10">October 17, 1960</st1:date>,
the Department of Rural Banks of the Central Bank sent a team of examiners to
conduct an examination of the accounts and operations of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On November 25 of the same year, <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> complained to the Monetary Board about certain acts
of the examiners and asked for an opportunity to appear before it in the
presence of the head of the examiners and proper officials of the Department of
Rural Banks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For various reasons,
however, the aforesaid team of examiners discontinued their examination of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> and returned to their post in Manila-on <st1:date year="1960" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1960</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 21, 1961, following a conference with the Director of
the Department of Rural Banks and the Governor of the Central Bank, counsel for
<span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> wrote a letter to the Monetary Board informing
the latter that an understand­ing had been reached by them concerning the
examination of the loan portfolio and the financial condition of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="18" month="3">March 18, 1961</st1:date>, the examination was
resumed in accordance with the said "understanding" until May 16 when
three exam­iners were allegedly manhandled by the guards of the Pre­sident-Manager
of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>, which led to the filing of criminal cases
for grave coercion and serious oral defa­mation against the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In turn, said examiners were charged with
slander by deed and slight physical injuries.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to a memorandum of Director <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>,
the Monetary Board, on June 2, 1961, adopted Resolution 887, requesting
"the management to invite the representatives of the Rural Bank of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>, Inc. to appear before the Monetary Board in
connection with the report of the Di­rector, Department of Rural Banks, on certain
practices of the said rural bank which would result in probable losses to its
depositors".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a letter dated <st1:date year="1961" day="3" month="6">June 3, 1961</st1:date>, addressed to Mr. <span class="SpellE">Sixto</span> de la Costa, Chairman of the Board of Directors, the

to appear at a hearing before it at <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 p.m.</st1:time>
on <st1:date year="1961" day="9" month="6">June 9, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same date counsel for <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> wrote the Governor accepting the invi­tation but
requested that it be furnished at least three days before the scheduled hearing
on June 9, 1961 "with full particulars of the alleged unsafe banking
practices, gross violations of the law, and serious irregularities, in the
grant of loans including the existence of fictitious and padded loans' which
are referred to in your letter".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
compliance with this request, the Governor, on <st1:date year="1961" day="6" month="6">June 6, 1961</st1:date>, sent him the following bill of particulars,
with attached schedules, regarding the preliminary findings in the examination
of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>:</p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In</span> the books of the
Rural Bank are loans which have been totally denied by the borrowers (Schedule

the amounts have been denied by borrowers (Schedule B).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Real estate securities were grossly <span class="SpellE">misdescribed</span> in the credit reports and in the mortgage
documents to justify many loans granted by the Rural Bank.</blockquote>

corporations who are not eligible as borrowers of a rural bank under Section 5
of Republic Act No. 720, as amended.</blockquote>

available reserve against deposit liabilities.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the same date, <span class="SpellE">Lucena's</span> counsel
wrote the Governor for additional data in connection with certain items among
the bill of particulars to which the latter obliged in a letter dated <st1:date year="1961" day="7" month="6">June 7, 1961</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the meeting held on <st1:date year="1961" day="9" month="6">June
 9, 1961</st1:date>, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> and its counsel appeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result of said proceedings, the Monetary

in the preliminary report dated June 8, 1961 of the aforementioned Director
relative to the exami­nation of the bank conducted on March 18, 1961.</p>

<p class="BODY">In compliance with the aforesaid resolution, representa­tives of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> met with Director <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>
on June 10, 1961, but nothing was accomplished because Director <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> terminated the meeting due to counsel for <span class="SpellE">Lucena's</span> remark that it was not a fair hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two days later, Director <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>
submitted his report on the conference with the representa­tives of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> expressing the view that the latter had been
resorting to delaying tactics to be able to gather false statements to
counteract signed statements gathered by the,' examiners, and recommending that
"immediate action be taken on the recommendations contained in our
Memorandum of June 6, 1961 in regards to our preliminary findings in the
discontinued examination of the Rural Bank of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>,
Inc.".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="12" month="6">June 12, 1961</st1:date>, the Governor submitted a
memorandum to the Monetary Board on the chronic reserve deficiencies of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> and recommending that the Bank's lending operations
be immediately suspended for persistent violation of the law, and the taking of
appropriate legal actions against its officers responsible for said violations.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="13" month="6">June 13, 1961</st1:date>,
the Monetary Board held a meeting at which the Chairman of the Board of
Directors of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> and its counsel appeared on its
behalf, the former having had the opportunity to state fully the side of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result
thereof, the Monetary Board adopted the questioned resolution No. 928, of which
<span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> was officially notified on <st1:date year="1961" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before the latter date, or more specifi­cally
on June 16, 1961, <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> had addressed another letter
to the Monetary Board requesting that certain steps be taken to prevent a
further run on the bank and praying that "the Bank be given a due hearing
before any action be taken against the Bank".</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> received a letter from the Governor of the Central
Bank asking him to convene a stockholders' meeting on <st1:date year="1961" day="20" month="6">Tuesday, June 20, 1961</st1:date>, at <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 a.m.</st1:time> to discuss important matters relating to the
affairs of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pursuant thereto, a stockholders' meeting was called to be held at <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
instead of at <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> and the Governor was notified of
the place of said meeting on <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="6">June 17,
 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The aforesaid meet­ing
was held as scheduled with all the members of the Board of Directors of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> present.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same date of the meeting on June 20, 1961, how­ever, a
team consisting of personnel from the Department of Rural Banks and other
departments of the Central Bank, as well as from the Department of Justice,
National Bureau of Investigation, and Philippine Constabulary, went to <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> to deliver the letter dated June 16, 1961 quoting
Resolution No. 928 mentioned heretofore, and immediately proceeded to implement
the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following day, <st1:date year="1961" day="21" month="6">June
 21, 1961</st1:date>, the Manila Times carried the following headline story on <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"BANK
TOLD TO SUSPEND OPERATION", and in the afternoon of the same day the
"Daily Mirror" published the following headline on its front
page:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"CHARGES TO FOLLOW CLOSURE OF
BANK".</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 22, 1961, <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>, through its
hoard of Di­rectors, filed the present complaint for injunction with damages
against the Central Bank of the Philippines, the Secretary of Finance, the
Monetary Board of the Central Bank and its Governor, and the Director of the
Department of Rural Banks of the Central Bank of the Philippines to desist them
from carrying out Resolution No. 928 of the Monetary Board of the Central Bank;
from causing any publication concerning the affairs of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>,
and to con­demn the defendants to pay damages.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> claims that Resolution 928 of
the Monetary Board is illegal because (1) it was passed without the due hearing
required by Section 10 of Republic Act No. 720, as amended; (2) defendants, in
adopting said reso­lution, have exceeded their authority of supervision granted
them under the aforementioned section and (3) be­cause in serving upon <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> the original of the letter dated June 16, 1961,
defendants were unnecessarily assisted by personnel from the Philippine
Constabulary and the Na­tional Bureau of Investigation, a fact which has caused
scandal and prejudice to <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> and led to the
newspaper publications mentioned heretofore and which has instilled an
unfounded fear in its depositors and clients, destroying their confidence in
her.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants' answer to the complaint, on the other hand, alleged
that they are empowered, under Republic Acts 265, 337 and 720, as amended, to
promulgate the resolution in question; that the Director of the Department of
Rural Banks of the Central Bank is duly vested by law with the duty of
supervising the establishment, operation and manage­ment of rural banks created
in accordance with the Rural Banks Act, as amended, and, finally, that the
present action was premature as defendants have not exhausted all adminis­trative
remedies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their amended answer further
alleged "that Rural Bank is in such condition of insolvency, or that its
continuance in business would involve probable loss to depositors and
creditors, as would require the Monetary Board to adopt the measures in said
Resolution No. 928 even without hearing since under Section 29 of Republic Act
265 defendants-appellants are authorized to forbid the Rural Bank to do
business, to take charge of its assets (not to take over management) and to
cause its reorganization and place it in a condition to enable it to continue
in business with safety to creditors and depo­sitors" (pp. 35-36, Amended

<p class="BODY">After due trial, the lower court rendered the appealed judgment,
from which, as stated heretofore, both parties appealed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In spite of the numerous errors which <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>
and the Central Bank claim were committed by the trial court, there is really
but one issue decisive of their appeals, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the validity of Resolution No. 928 of the
Monetary Board which, in the opinion of the trial judge, amounted to a <u>directive
to take over the management of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span></u>, with­out
the latter having been given due hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rural banking in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is governed by Section 10 of Republic Act 720, as amended, which reads as
follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 10.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power to supervise the operation of any
Rural Bank by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank as herein indicated, shall
consist in placing limits to the maximum credit allowed any individual
borrowers; in prescribing the interest rate; in determining the loan period and
loan procedures; in indi­cating the manner in which technical assistance shall
be extended to Rural Banks; in imposing a uniform accounting system and manner
of keep­ing the accounts and records of the Rural Banks; in undertaking regular
credit examination of the Rural Banks; in instituting periodic surveys of loans
and lending procedures, audits, test check of cash and other transactions of
the Rural Banks, in conducting training courses for personnel of Rural Banks;
and, in general, in supervising the business operation of the Rural Banks.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The director of the Department of Central Bank designated by the
Monetary Board to su­pervise the Rural Banks shall have the power to enforce
the law, orders, instructions, rules and regulations promulgated by the
Monetary Board applicable to Rural Banks; to require Ru­ral Banks, their
directors, officers and agents to conduct and manage the affairs of the Rural
Bank in a lawful and orderly manner; and, upon proof that the Rural Bank or its
Board of Di­rectors or officers are conducting and managing the affairs of the
bank in a manner contrary to law, orders, instructions, rules and regulations
promulgated by the Monetary Board or in a manner substantially prejudicial to
the interests of the government, depositors, or creditors, to take over the
management of such bank when specifically au­thorized to do so by the Monetary
Board after due hearing until a new board of directors and offi­cers are
elected and qualified without prejudice to the prosecution of the persons

relative to the true condition of any Rural Bank or to any loan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(As Amended by Republic Act No. 2670, Section
2.)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Besides granting supervisory power to the Mone­tary Board over
rural banks and enumerating the dif­ferent matters over which such supervisory
power may be exercised, the above-quoted legal provision like­wise grants the
Monetary Board authority (a) to desig­nate a Director for the Department of the
Central Bank that will supervise rural banks.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This officer actually known as Director of the Department of Rural Banks
has, in turn, authority:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) to enforce
the law, orders, instructions, rules and regulations promulgated by the Monetary
Board applicable to rural banks; (2) to require rural banks, the Directors,
officers and agents to conduct and manage the affairs of the rural bank in a
lawful and orderly manner, and upon proof that any particular rural bank or its
board of directors or officers is or are conducting and managing the affairs of
said bank in a manner contrary to law, orders, instructions, rules and
regulations promulgated by the Monetary Board, or in a manner substantially
prejudicial to the interest of the government, depositors or creditors, "<u>to
take over the management of such bank</u> when specifically authorized to do so
by the Monetary Board after due hearing etc".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This provision defining the authority and
providing for the duties of the Director of the Department of Rural Banks finds
partial implementation in the provisions of Section 79 of the Rules and
Regulations governing rural banks (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
19-Stipulation), which provides, inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>, that
said Director may forbid any rural bank from carrying on any transaction which
it deems unlawful or prejudicial to the interest of the government, or of the
depositors or creditors of the bank, or contrary to the policies and objectives
of the Rural Banks Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 27 of Republic Act 720, on the other hand, makes as part

any of its own provisions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Resolution No. 928 of the Monetary Board is of the following
tenor:</p>

<blockquote>"928. Report of
the Department of Rural' Banks on the examination of the Rural Bank of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>, Inc.; report of the Director, Department of Rural
Banks, on the hearing regarding the said report scheduled by the Monetary Board
and held at the Department of Rural Banks on June 10, 1961.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Acting Governor presented the following to the Board:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A preliminary report of the Director,
Department of Rural Banks, dated June 6, 1961, on the examination of the Rural
Bank of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>, Inc. as of March 18, 1961; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A report of the Director, Department of Rural
Banks, dated <st1:date year="1961" day="12" month="6">June 12, 1961</st1:date>
on the hearing scheduled by the Monetary Board to be held at the Department of
Rural Banks on <st1:date year="1961" day="10" month="6">June 10, 1961</st1:date>
with regard to the said preliminary report.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(After the Board heard the report of the
Director, Department of Rural Banks, on what transpired during the aforesaid
scheduled hearing on June 10, 1961, and after the Board had agreed on the steps
to be taken in connection with the find­ings of the Central Bank examiners on
the operation of the Rural Bank of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>, Inc.,
Judge <span class="SpellE">Sixto</span> de la Costa and Atty. Roberto <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> were ushered into the Conference Room).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At the outset, the Acting Governor informed the representatives
of the Rural Bank of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>, Inc. of the decision of
the Monetary Board (a) to request the Board of Directors of the Rural Bank of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>, Inc. to convene immediately a stockholders' meeting
for the purpose of electing a new Board of Directors ac­ceptable to the Central
Bank; (b) to with­draw or limit certain functions of the Rural Bank, such as
acceptance of deposits from new depositors, granting of new loans, issuance of
drafts, and making of disburse­ments; and (c) to assign Central Bank examiners
to oversee the operations of the Rural Bank.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He pointed out, however, that the Central Bank has not yet taken over
the management of the Rural Bank.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Judge de la Costa stated that the Rural Bank of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>, Inc. had not been given a fair hearing; that it had
not been afforded a chance to disprove the charges, if any, against the bank
because it had not been informed of the nature of the charges.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Director, Department of Rural Banks, said, however, that
the Rural Bank of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>, Inc. had been given due and
fair hearing as required by law, as he had explained in his aforesaid report
dated <st1:date year="1961" day="12" month="6">June 12, 1961</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Officer-in-Charge, Office of the Legal Counsel, informed
the Board that the procedure as planned was to show to the representatives of
the <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> Rural Bank, Inc. the report of the
Director of the Department of Rural Banks and copies of the evidence, excluding
that portion of the report which contains the analysis of the Rural Bank's
financial statement and the recommendations intended only for the Monetary
Board, and then the representa­tion of the <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>
Rural Bank, Inc. were in turn to present their evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These would have been the preliminary steps
be­fore some remedial measures could be ar­rived at.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"According to the aforementioned Officer­ in-Charge, Atty.
Jose W. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> arrived at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00 a.m.</st1:time> so that nothing substantial could have been
accomplished at the conference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
appeared to be unwilling to talk about his evidence over the conference table
as shown by the fact that he had not brought any pa­pers with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Confronted with the report and the evidence,
he asked for a copy of the com­plete report of the Department of Rural Banks
but the Director thereof refused to furnish him the full report, as the
aforementioned portion thereof are not necessary in the eva­luation of the
examiners' findings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this juncture,
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> made the statement that he did not
consider the conference as a due hearing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So the Director of the said Depart­ment stopped the conference.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Officer-in-Charge also stated that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> had been properly apprised of the charges or
findings regarding fictitious loans, padded loans, low and non-existent
collaterals and deficient reserve; that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>
had been furnished with the pertinent schedules, that in an administrative
proceed­ing, it is enough that the complaint recites the substance of the
charges; and that in the presentation of evidence, too much technicali­ties
should be avoided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Director of the
Department of Rural Banks considered the above-mentioned financial analysis and
recommenda­tions as highly confidential and intended only for the Monetary
Board and that their disclosure to the management of the <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>
Rural Bank Inc. at the moment would be premature.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"President <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span> likewise,
stated that there was no dispute with respect to the reserve deficiencies of
the Rural Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection he
said, the Central Bank examiners did not make any charge; they merely reported
a finding as gathered from the books of the Rural Bank itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, there was no alternative on the part of
the Central Bank but to stop the Rural Bank from granting new loans to protect
the interest of its depositors.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Judge de la Costa stated that the Rural Bank of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>, Inc. had been examined consecutively during the
last three years, and every time an examination thereof was conducted a run on
the bank always followed thereby resulting in deficiencies in its reserves.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With the aid of a graph showing the re­lationship of the
receipt of deposits and the net cash position of the bank to the loans granted
by the bank, the Director, Department of Rural Banks, disproved Judge de la
Costa's foregoing allegation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According
to the said Director, while the deposits of the bank re­mained more or less
steady, loan investments went so high that its net cash assets took a nose
dive.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Judge de la Costa and Atty. Roberto <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>
left the Conference Room after making their representations to the Board.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Monetary Board, after due hearing, in which the <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> Rural Bank, Inc. was given ample opportunity to be
heard, has found, as sufficiently established by the evidence pre­sented, that
the officers, directors and em­ployees of the <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>
Rural Bank, Inc. commit­ted the following acts:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) granting fictitious loans out of the funds of the rural bank; (2)
granting loans inflated in the books of the rural bank; (3) grant­ing loans
secured by real estate prop­erties which are either non-existent or whose
values have been over-inflated; (4) granting loans to individuals and
corporations that are not eligible and not qualified as borrowers of a rural
bank under Sec. 5 of Republic Act No. 720, as amended; (5) permitting the Rural
Bank to be chronically deficient in its avail­able reserve against deposit
liabilities; (6) authorizing the sale of domestic drafts without sufficient
covering funds with the depository bank; and (7) failure to record in the books
of the Rural Bank substantial expenditures incurred by the bank.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The foregoing acts committed by the officers, directors and
employees of the Rural Bank of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>, Inc. being
substan­tially prejudicial to the interest of the Government, depositors or
creditors, it appearing that the continuance in business of the said Rural Bank
under such circumstances would involve probable loss to its creditors or
depositors; and it having been shown further that notwithstanding warnings and
directives of the Director, Department of Rural Banks, the aforesaid officers,
di­rectors and employees of the <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> Rural Bank,
Inc. persisted in such unsafe and unsound banking practices which are in
violation of the laws, instructions, orders, rules and regulations promulgated
by the Mo­netary Board, the Board pursuant to Section 106 of Republic Act 720,
as amended, and Section 10 of Republic Act 265, after due deliberation and by
unanimous vote, decided as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As stated heretofore, the appeals before <span class="GramE">Us</span>
depend entirely upon the question of whether or not the above re­solution is
valid - because it was issued in the exercise of the supervisory jurisdiction
of the Central Bank – or it is void -because it amounts to "taking over
the management" of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>, without giving it a
previous opportunity to be heard.</p>

<p class="BODY">The supervisory jurisdiction of the Central Bank over <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> and all rural banks is admitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither may it be successfully denied that,
to exercise said juris­diction, the Central Bank need not give a previous
hearing to the rural bank that will be affected by whatever action it may
decide to take in connection with the latter's business or operation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, to require such a previous hearing is
not only impractical but would tend to defeat the very purpose of the law when
it invested the Central Bank with such authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, it is clear from the very wording of the law
and implementing Central Bank regula­tions that before the Central Bank may
"take over" the management of any rural bank the latter must be
heard.</p>

<p class="BODY">It only remains now to determine whether the di­rectives
contained in the questioned resolution amount to the Central Bank "taking
over" the management of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>, or are measures
"supervisory" in character.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first directive enjoins the Board of Directors of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> to convene, within five (5) days from receipt of the
questioned resolution, a stockholders meeting for the purpose of re-organizing
the Bank and electing members of a new Board of Directors acceptable to the
Central Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By this directive the
Central Bank did not call nor hold a stockholders' meeting; much less did it
elect the members of the Board of Directors of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It simply enjoined the latter to hold a stock­holders'
meeting, and proceed to elect the members of a new Board, subject only to the
condition that they should be acceptable to the Central Bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection <span class="GramE">We</span> can not lose sight
of the fact that the Government has a considerable monetary investment in <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its interest
in the proper manage­ment of the latter's affairs is therefore dictated by self
interest as well as by public policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, the law imposes upon the Monetary Board the duty to protect that
investment of the Government by seeing to it that <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>
is at all times managed by men of character and integrity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The provisions of Section 1, Article IV of
the By-Laws of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
12-Stipulation, p. 54, Folder of Exhibits) themselves are to the effect that
the quali­fications of the members of the Board of Directors shall be subject
to the approval of the Central Bank. Upon the other hand, under Section 9 of
Republic Act 337, the Mo­netary Board may withhold or refuse to issue the certi­ficate
of authority mentioned therein - which is a pre­requisite for the registration
of the Articles of In­corporation, or any amendment thereof, of <u>any</u> <u>bank</u>
- unless said Monetary Board is satisfied, upon the evidence submit­ted to it,
with the integrity and responsibility of its organizers and administrators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being no reason why this provision
should not apply to rural banks as well, the conclusion becomes inescapable
that the Monetary Board may also withhold the issuance of said certificate of
authority upon the ground aforesaid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
it may legally do this, why may it not have authority to require a re­organization
of the Board of Directors of any bank-or rural bank if, as in the present case,
it had found after proper investigation, that the incumbent members had mis­managed
the affairs of the bank?</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the second directive, representatives of the Central Bank
are authorized to be present at the stockholders' meeting but only for the
purpose of (a) informing them of the findings of the Monetary Board in connection
with the opera­tions of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>, and (b) of the
instructions of said Board relative to the re-organization of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As is
obvious this was dictated by the necessity of acquainting the stockholders with
the reasons that prompted the Central Bank to order the re-organization of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>, with the end in view that such information may
serve them as guide in the election of the new members of the Board of
Directors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Singly or jointly with the
other directives, this one gives <span class="GramE">Us</span> no reason to say
that the Central Bank had "taken over" the management of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering
the acts of mismanagement and irregularities discovered by the examiners of the
Central Bank in the conduct of the business operations of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>,
it was imperative that the same be brought to the attention of the latter's
stockholders before they proceeded to elect those who would compose the
membership of the new Board.</p>

<p class="BODY">The third directive enjoins <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> not
to grant new loans or renewals nor to accept new depositors; to service only
the deposit accounts of existing depositors; not to issue drafts without prior
approval of the Central Bank examiners who would oversee its operations; and
finally, not to make new disbursements without prior approval of said
examiners.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the circumstances of the case, it was to be assumed that all
these limitations upon the scope of the operations of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>
were intended to be temporary in nature.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were security measures urgently demanded by the irregularities
discovered by the Central Bank examiners mentioned at the beginning of this
opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were intended to protect
not only the funds already deposited with <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> but
also prospective depositors who might have had no knowledge or information
regarding the manner in which the funds of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> had
been adminis­tered previously.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As these
measures - We repeat - were intended to be enforced only during the period of
re­organization and until the Central Bank was satisfied that the new members
of the Board of Directors of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> were conducting
its affairs in accordance with law and in the interest of all concerned, We are
satisfied that they fall well within the broad supervisory powers of the
Central Bank over <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> and other rural banks.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fourth directive is a warning that should <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>
fail or refuse to comply with the first and third directives, or if it took any
step calculated to prevent their implementation, the Central Bank would then
exercise its right under the law to "take over" its management.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather than constitute evidence of "taking
over", this particular directive goes a long way to show just the
opposite.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the fifth directive authorizes the management to secure
the assistance of the Philippine Constabulary, the National Bureau of
Investigation and other govern­mental agencies, should circumstances so
warrant, in the investigation of the affairs of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is sanctioned by Section 20 of Republic
Act 720, as amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it clearly
provides for something that would be re­sorted to only in case of absolute
necessity, and there being no showing that the Central Bank had actually asked
for the assistance of the agencies' mentioned heretofore and that the latter,
by directive of the Central Bank, had interfered directly with the management
and operations of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>, there is no ground to hold
that by this last directive the Central Bank had "taken over" the
management of said Bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">We summarize our views as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>from the very provisions of the questioned
resolution, it appears that the intention of the Central Bank was to provide
for temporary measures to prevent the commission of further irregularities in
the business operations of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>; to provide for the
placing of its management in the hands of men of integrity and competence; to
provide for authority for its examiners to oversee the operations of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>, and finally, to serve a warning upon the latter
that should it refuse to comply with the directives contained in the questioned
resolution, the Central Bank would then have no other recourse but to do its
duty under the law - to "take over" the management and operations of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> - for the protection of the interest of the
Government and of the stockholders.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, <span class="GramE">We</span> are of the opinion and
so hold, that the questioned resolution falls within the scope of the supervisory
authority that the Central Bank has over <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> and
other hanks of a similar nature.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having arrived at the above conclusion, <span class="GramE">We</span>
deem it unnecessary to discuss the other questions raised by both parties in
their respective briefs.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision is reversed and set
aside, and the basic petition filed in this case is dismissed, with costs.</p>
