suit aimed at <span style="">establishing </span>a <span style="">children-to-father illegitimate relationship
between petitioners </span>and the principal respond­ent Francisco Tan, and to
compel the latter to support petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">The background facts follow:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1955" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1955</st1:date>,
petitioners, thru their mother <span class="SpellE">Celestina</span> <span class="SpellE">Daldo</span> <span style="">as </span>guardian
<u>ad <span class="SpellE">litem</span></u>, sued respondent Tan in the Court of
First Instance of Manila for acknowledgment and support (Civil Case 26909).</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 26, 1956, <span class="SpellE">Celestina</span> <span class="SpellE">Daldo</span> - after petitioners had already presented oral and
documentary evidence and were about to rest their case - moved to dismiss the
foregoing civil case upon the ground that <span style="">the
</span><span style="">parties had come to an amicable
settlement, and prayed that the same </span><span style="">be dismissed </span><span style="">with
prejudice and without recourse of appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day, March 26, 1956, <span class="SpellE">Celestina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Daldo</span> subscribed <span style="">before </span>the clerk of the Court of First Instance of Manila to an
affidavit categorically stating that respondent Francisco Tan, defendant in <span style="">Ci­</span>v<span style="">il </span>Case 26909, "is not the father of my said minor children
named <span style="">C</span><span style="">armelita </span><span style="">and <span style="">Rodolfo [herein petitioners] </span>but
another person </span><span style="">whose name </span><span style="">I cannot divulge''; and that she prepared
said affidavit precisely </span><span style="">'to </span><span style="">record what is true and to correct what <span style="">misinterpretation </span>may arise </span><span style="">in the </span><span style="">future".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1956" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1956</st1:date>,
the Court of First Instance of Manila issued the following order:</p>

<blockquote>"As prayed for by plaintiffs in their motion filed today for
the dismissal of their complaint, on the ground that the parties have already
come to an amicable settlement, with the conformity of counsel for defendant,
the Court hereby orders this case dismissed with prejudice and without
pronouncement <span style="">as
</span>to costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1957" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1957</st1:date>
- one year and eight months after Civil Case <span style="">26909 </span><span style="">was dismissed - </span><span style="">petitioners, this
time </span>thru their maternal grandfather <span class="SpellE">Servillano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Daldo</span> as guardian <u>ad <span class="SpellE">litem</span></u>,
commenced the pre­sent action before the Juvenile &amp; Domestic Relations
Court [Civil Case 00855] for <span style="">acknowledgment </span>and support, involving the <span style="">same </span>parties, causes of action and subject matter.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 10, 1960, then Judge Juan P. Enriquez (Judge of the
Court of First Instance of Manila detailed to preside over the Juvenile &amp;
Domestic Relations Court in the absence of the presiding judge thereof who <span style="">was </span>on leave) rendered judgment
declaring that "the present case <span style="">is
</span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">res</span></u></span><u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></span></u><span style=""> </span>by reason of the dismissal with
prejudice of Civil Case 26909 of the Court of First Instance of Manila; and
that, even on the merits, plaintiffs [the present petitioners] have not made
out their case with sufficient evidence,” and dismissed the complaint, without
costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1960</st1:date>,
petitioners herein, plaintiffs below, moved to reconsider.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1961</st1:date>,
then Judge <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> <span class="SpellE">Almeda</span>
Lopez reconsidered the decision <span style="">of Judge Enriquez of </span><st1:date year="1960" day="10" month="9"><span style="">September 10, </span>1960</st1:date>, and rendered judgment, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:</p>

<blockquote>"In view of the foregoing considerations, this Court
reconsiders its decision of September 10, 1960, and declares the minors
Carmelita and Rodolfo Tan to be the illegitimate children of the defendant
Francisco Tan alias Tan Uh <span class="SpellE">Bak</span> and Tang <span class="SpellE">Seng</span> Ka; and hereby orders the defendant to support said
minors in the amount of P200,00 a month, said amount to be paid within the
first five (5) days of each month directly to Carmelita Tan, for herself and
for her younger brother Rodolfo; and, to help them defray their matriculation
expenses, to pay semi-annually, on June and November of each year, an additional
sum of P300; to reimburse <span class="SpellE">Servillano</span> <span class="SpellE">Daldo</span> his expenses in supporting plaintiff minors during
the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of this case in the amount of P2,000, or
at the rate of P50 a month from November 25, 1957; to pay plaintiff minors'
attorney's fees of P500; and to pay the costs of this proceedings.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Francisco Tan appealed to the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1964</st1:date>,
the Court of Appeals in turn reversed the last-named judgment of Judge <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> <span class="SpellE">Almeda</span> Lopez, and
dismissed the complaint with costs against <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
in both instances.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners now come to this Court <u>in forma <span class="SpellE">pauperis</span></u> on appeal by way of certiorari.</p>

<blockquote>1. Threshold question is the admissibility of Exhibits H and <span class="GramE">I</span>, testimony of petitioners' witnesses in the former
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners balk at the <span style="">ruling denying admissibility.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The controlling statute is Section 37, Rule 123 of the 1940 Rules
of Court, now Section 41, Rule 130, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 41.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Testimony at a former
trial</u>.</span> - The testi­mony of a witness deceased or out of the
Philippines, or unable to testify, given in a former case between the same
parties, relating to the same matter, the adverse party having had an
opportunity to cross-examine him, may be given in evidence."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Concededly, the witnesses at the former trial were subpoenaed by
the Juvenile &amp; Domestic Relations Court a number of times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These witnesses did not appear to testify.</p>

<p class="BODY">But are their testimonies in the former trial within the coverage
of the <span style="">rule of admissibility set </span>forth
in Section 41, Rule 130?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These witnesses
are not dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are not outside of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Can they be categorized as witnesses of the
class <u>unable to testify</u>?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court of Appeals, construing this term, held that "subsequent failure or
refusal to appear thereat [second trial] or hostility since testifying at the
first trial does not amount to inability to testify, but such inability
proceeding from a grave cause, almost amounting to death, as when the witness
is old and has lost the power of speech.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">(Griffith <span style="">vs. <span class="SpellE">Sauls</span>, 77 </span></span><st1:state><st1:place><span class="GramE"><span style="">Tex</span></span></st1:place></st1:state><span class="GramE"><span style=""> 630, 14 <span style="">S. W. </span>230, 231; section 37 of Rule
123, Rules of Court)."</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Here, the witnesses in question were available.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only, they re­fused to testify.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No other reason that prevented them from <span class="GramE">testifying,</span> is cited.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Certainly, they do not come within the legal purview of those <u>unable
to testify</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, in the situation here presented, petitioners are not at
all bereft of remedy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They could have
urged the court to have said witnesses arrested, punished for contempt.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, these remedies are in the statute
books to help litigants in the prosecution of their cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners failed to avail of these
remedies, went ahead and submitted their case.</p>

<p class="BODY">We note petitioners' argument that to follow strictly the law of
admissibility of testimony in former <span class="GramE">trials,</span> is to
permit party litigants to buy witnesses to dissuade them from testifying
again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing extant in the record will
<span style="">as much as intimate </span>that
respondent was responsible for the non-appearance of these witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The danger of tampering with witnesses is a
problem that attends trials in many a time and in a number of imaginable
situations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, petitioners' argument
works both ways.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, witnesses at
the former trial can be bought not to testify at the second trial, in just the
same way that they could have been bought to give their original
testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Solution of this problem <span class="GramE">lies</span> elsewhere - not in the non-enforcement of Section 41,
Rule 130 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<blockquote>2. The procedural problem out of the way, we go direct to the
merits.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners tried to prove that <span class="SpellE">Celestina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Daldo</span> and respondent Francisco Tan <u>lived together</u>
as husband and wife for more than eight years commencing from 1936 to
1944.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners Carmelita Tan and
Rodolfo Tan are allegedly the fruits of such cohabitation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent stoutly denies this claim, <span style="">avers </span>that he <span style="">is </span>very much a married man with seve­ral children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Celestina</span> <span class="SpellE">Daldo</span>, by her own admission, had been a nursemaid (<span class="SpellE"><u>yaya</u></span>) in respondent's residence but for a short
period of not less than one year in 1939.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Carmelita was born on <st1:date year="1942" day="8" month="5">May 8,
 1942</st1:date> and Rodolfo, on <st1:date year="1944" day="11" month="9">September
 11, 1944</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The validity of
the testimony of petitioners' witnesses in the present case was considerably
downgraded by the affidavit of <span class="SpellE">Celestina</span> <span class="SpellE">Daldo</span>, heretofore adverted to, attached to the record of <span style="">the </span>former Case 26909.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that affidavit, <span class="SpellE">Celestina</span>
deposed that petitioners were not fathered by Francisco Tan, but, in <span class="SpellE">Celestina's</span> own words, by "another person whose name I
cannot divulge." Striking <span style="">is </span>the
fact that this affidavit <span style="">was </span>executed
after petitioners in the former case had finished with their oral and
documentary evidence and were about to submit their case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By then, their counsel had a grasp of the
situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners and their
guardian <u>ad <span class="SpellE">litem</span></u> could have known whether
they had reasonably made out a case against respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Correctly then did the Court of Appeals rule out the probative
value of petitioners' evidence and found for respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this <span style="">point
</span>the Court of Appeals said:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>we now come to
the resolution of the second point:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>i.e., whether or not the plaintiffs have sufficient­ly proved their
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have gone over and examined
thoroughly the arguments and evidence of the parties, and we find that the
evidence for the plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> fall short of
the requirement of clear, strong and convincing evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such evidence is necessary whether to prove
legitimate or illegitimate paternity and <span class="SpellE">filiation</span>,
considering the seriousness of the relationship and its far-reaching <span style="">consequences.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As aptly <span class="GramE">expressed</span> in the case of Serrano v.
Aragon, (22 Phil. 10),<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Public policy, indeed public necessity, demands that before an
illegitimate child <span class="GramE">be</span> admitted into a legitimate
family, every requisite of the law be completely and fully <span style="">complied with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one should ever be permitted upon doubtful
evidence to take from legitimate children the property which they and their
parents have, by industry, fidelity, and frugality, acquired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>We agree with the findings of the trial court in its original
decision correctly appreciating the evidence of the plaintiffs as
unsatisfactory and insufficient, in view of the following considerations:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1) That Exhibits B and I, former testimonies of witnesses in Civil
Case No. 26909, are inadmissible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>2) That the baptismal certificates, <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
<span class="GramE">A and</span> C are not admissible proofs of <span class="SpellE">filiation</span> (<span class="SpellE">Malonda</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Malonda</span>, 81 Phil., 149; 45 Off. <span class="SpellE">Gaz</span>.

350; <span class="SpellE">Madridejo</span> vs. Leon, 55 Phil. 1).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The birth certificate Exhibit B is likewise
inadmissible against the defendant because it failed to comply with Section 5
of Act 3753.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged illegitimate
father did not <span style="">sign </span>under oath
the said birth certificate (<span class="SpellE">Roces</span> <span style="">vs. </span>Local Civil Registrar of Manila, 102
Phil., 1050; <span class="SpellE">Crisolo</span> <span style="">vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Macadaeg</span>, G.R. L-7017, <span class="GramE">prom</span>. April 29, 1954).</blockquote>

<blockquote>It should be noted that said baptismal certificates are also
useless to prove the dates of birth of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>-minors,
considering that the period of cohabitation or <span style="">any intimate </span>relations at all between their mother and the
appellant has been denied and that same has not been satisfactorily
proved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated in another way, the date
of birth as appearing in the birth certificate would be material only if it
coincides with the period of cohabitation as admitted or sufficiently
proved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To reason other<span style="">wise would be to put the cart before the
horse, so to speak.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>3. The oral evidence for the plaintiffs, consisting principally of
the testimonies of the grandfather and of the mother of the minors, <span class="GramE">are</span> unsatisfactory, being inconsistent and contradictory on
material points, and unbelievable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
loose character of the mother of the <span class="GramE"><span style="">minors</span></span><span style=""> who admittedly
had lived and begotten children with several men of different nationalities,
cannot also be overlooked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Weighed
against each other, the <span style="">evidence for
the plaintiffs <span class="GramE">do</span> not tip the scales in their favor </span></span><span style="">as against </span><span style="">the defendant-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not convinced, by preponderance of
evidence, that appellant is the father of the minor <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Section 2, Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, formerly Section 2, <span style="">Rule </span>46 of the 1940 Rules, employs the
commanding language that “[o]<span class="SpellE">nly</span> questions of law may
be raised" in an appeal by certiorari <span style="">from </span>a judgment of the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That judgment, jurisprudence teaches, is
conclusive <span style="">as </span>to the
facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not to alter said <span style="">facts - </span>they bind us, or to review the
