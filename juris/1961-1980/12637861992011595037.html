<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The General Headquarters 
Efficiency and Separation Board of the Armed Forces of the Philippines 
(GHESB-AFP, for short) appeals from the decision of the Court of First Instance 
of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City declaring it without jurisdiction to 
conduct an investigation upon <span class="SpellE">Constante</span> V. <span class="SpellE">Alzate</span>, a major in the army.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="10" day="16" year="1958"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 16, 
1958</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
<span class="SpellE">Constante</span> V. <span class="SpellE">Alzate</span> filed 
with the lower court a petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction 
praying that the GHESB-AFP be prohibited from conducting an investigation upon 
him for the purpose of separating him from military service. The desired writ of 
preliminary injunction was granted the following day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Responding to the petition, the 
GIIESB-AFP filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that: (1) the petition 
states no cause of action; (2) petitioner has not exhausted all administrative 
remedies before coming to court; and (3) the court has no jurisdiction over the 
subject matter of the suit. This motion, however, was denied upon opposition 
from the petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Answer was thus filed and upon 
the joining of the issues, the parties submitted to court the following 
stipulation of facts: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"1. That petitioner is a reserve 
officer in the Armed Forces of the Philippines with a rank of Major, and was 
still on active duty with at least ten (10) years of active accumulated 
commissioned service (Annex 'A') at the time of the approval of Republic Act No. 
1382 on June 18, 1955 (Annex 'B') and consequently, covered by the provisions of 
said Act;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"2. That this Republic Act No. 
1382 (Annex 'B') was House Bill No. 1817 of the Congress of the Philippines 
(Annex 'C’ and 'C-l'), and that said Act was already interpreted by the 
Secretary of Justice in his Opinion No. 127 dated April 20, 1956 (Annex 'D') 
;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"3. That petitioner has never 
been tried or convicted of any crime or offense by any court martial of the 
Armed Forces of the Philippines, and the respondent is not a court martial 
created under the military law but a mere administrative body organized by 
virtue of Executive Order No. 302 (Annex 'E') and Circular No. 7 (Annex 
‘F').<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"4. That Executive Order No. 302 
(Annex 'E'), issued by the President of the Philippines on May 5, 1958, and 
Circular No. 7 (Annex 'F') issued by the General Headquarters of the Armed 
Forces of the Philippines on August 29, 1958, empower and authorize the 
respondent to investigate cases properly referred to it involving both regular 
officers and reserve officers serving an extended tour of active duty for six 
months or more for the purpose of determining their fitness and suitability to 
remain in the service, or to be removed, discharged and separated from active 
service, and the words 'six Months or more' include reserve officers covered by 
the provisions of Republic Act No. 1382;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"5. That on September 20, 1956, 
the respondent notified the petitioner to appear before it on' October 9, 1958 a 
9:00 a.m. in the G-2 Conference Room GHQ, Camp Murphy, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City (Annex 'G') which date was later transferred to 
October 23, 1958 at the same time and place, for the purpose of conducting an 
investigation of the alleged cases of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> against 
said petitioner and of finding out the suitability of separating, removing or 
discharging him from active service or not, as directed by the Chief of Staff, 
and pursuant to the provisions of Circular No. 7, GHQ, AFP, dated August 29, 
1958 (Annex 'F');<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"6. That although the notice 
dated September 26, 1958 (Annex ‘G’) states that the subject matter of the 
hearing which was set October 9, 1958 was 'for the purpose of conducting an 
investigation on the alleged cases of <span class="SpellE">Estafa</span> against 
you', the specification of charges dated October 1, 1958 (Annex 'H') does not 
contain any case of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> but alleged civil 
obligations against the petitioner. That a promissory note for the amount of 
P11,400.00 was allegedly issued by petitioner in favor of one <span class="SpellE">Rustico</span> Z. Zapata, but the alleged cases of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> referred to in the notice (Annex 'G') have long been 
dismissed by the Court (Annexes 'I', 'I-1' and '1-2' and 
J);<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"7. That on October 8, 1958, the 
respondent made another specification of charges (Annex ‘K'), eliminating <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the following: (a) complaint of Mrs. Mauro D. 
Velasco for an alleged land sold by the petitioner to her for the same was 
dropped by complainant, Mrs. Velasco (Annex 'L'), and (b) the alleged violation 
of 96th and 19th AW as indicated in D/F from G-1, addressed to TAG dated July 
19, 1955, for the charge regarding the same had long been dismissed on August 1, 
1956 as recommended by the Judge Advocate General Office (Annexes ‘M’, ‘M-1' and 
'M-2');<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"8. That up to the present time, 
no action whatsoever has been filed in court with respect to the alleged civil 
obligations of the petitioner as mentioned in the specification dated October 8, 
1956 (Annex 'K');<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"9. That the respondent has not 
conducted the investigation mentioned in the notice of September 26, 11)58 
(Annex ‘G') due to the preliminary injunction issued ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> by this Honorable Court against said respondent on 
</span><st1:date month="10" day="17" year="1958"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 17, 
1958</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"10. That a Motion to Dismiss the 
petition in the instant case presented by the respondent on October 27, 1958 
which re-enforced by a Supplemental Motion to Dismiss dated November 12, 1958, 
but after due hearing and submission of extensive memoranda by both parties, 
this Court denied the same in its order dated March 31, 
1959;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"11. That the petitioner and 
respondent admit the authenticity" the following 
documents:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">* * (Annexes 'A' to 
M-2')"<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The case was submitted after each 
of the parties had filed memorandum in support of their respective 
positions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="12" day="9" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 9, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
lower court granted the petition that it enjoined the respondent from proceeding 
with the questioned investigation, holding that the latter has no authority to 
do so for the purpose of separating the petitioner from the 
service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In this appeal, <span class="GramE">We</span> are called upon to interpret section 1, Republic Act No. 
1382, which took effect on </span><st1:date month="6" day="18" year="1955"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 18, 
1955</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, to 
wit: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Reserve officers with at least 
ten years of active accumulated commissioned service who are still on active 
duty at the time of the approval of this Act shall not be reverted into inactive 
status except for cause after proper court-martial proceedings or upon their own 
request. Provided, <span class="GramE">That</span> for purposes of computing the 
length of service, six months or more of active service shall be considered one 
year.”<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The question is whether or not 
the prohibition contained in the <span class="SpellE">abovequoted</span> provision 
covers the investigation which was supposed to be conducted upon <span class="SpellE">Alzate</span>, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Apparently, what Republic Act 
1382 prohibits is the "reversion to inactive status" of the officer mentioned 
therein, except by virtue of a court martial. The law does not use the words 
"separate," "discharge," "remove" or "dismiss". Just whether or not "reversion 
to inactive status" embraces, or is synonymous with removal, separation or 
discharge is the crux of the problem.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This Court has already made a 
distinction between these terms in the case of Paz vs. <span class="SpellE">Alcaraz</span>, et al., 99 Phil., 130; 52 Off. <span class="SpellE">Gaz</span>., p. 3039, pertinent portion of the decision of which is 
quoted thus: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"* * appellant's reversion to 
inactive status in the reserve force 13 not, as he claims a dismissal from the 
service. Although he "had ceased to be in the active service of the Philippine 
Navy, appellant nevertheless remains an officer of the Army reserve force. 
Officers in the naval reserve may be transferred from active to inactive service 
as the army authorities may see fit (<span class="SpellE">cf</span> 6 C.J.S. 17, 
and citing <span class="SpellE">Denby</span> vs. Berry, 44 <span class="SpellE">S.Ct</span>. 74, 263 U.S. 29, 68 L. Ed. 148), and appellant can not 
rightly complain that he had been dismissed or discharged without due process 
because <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">mere transfer from active to 
inactive service in the army is neither dismissal nor 
discharge</span></em>."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Following the above distinction, 
the law in question would not prohibit the investigation in question which 
purpose would be to determine the suitability of petitioner to remain or be 
separated from the service by reason of certain charges against 
him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is to be noted that under 
Article 117 of Commonwealth Act No. 408 (otherwise known as the Articles of 
War), the President may drop from the rolls any officer in the army, whether in 
the regular or reserve force, who has been absent from duty without leave or who 
has been absent in confinement in a prison or penitentiary for 3 months after 
final conviction by a court of competent jurisdiction. Likewise, under section 8 
of Republic Act No. 340, the Chief Executive may also separate from the service, 
thru the recommendation of Classification or Efficiency Boards, any officer by 
reason of physical disability on the part of the latter, We note also that under 
Executive Order No. 302, series of 1958, officers of the army, by reason of 
their incompetence, inefficiency, etc. may also be administratively discharged 
or separated by the President upon the recommendation of Efficiency and 
Separation Boards. If the prohibition contained in Republic Act No. 1381 is to 
be construed as to include not only reversion to inactive status" but also 
separation, dismissal or discharge, then said Republic Act would render 
inapplicable to reserve officers those aforementioned laws and regulations that 
give the Chief Executive the power to discipline army officers by separation. 
Greater protection and security of tenure would, in effect, be given to those 
officers in the reserve force with more than 10 years of service than those in 
the regular force with equal or longer years of service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">A study of the explanatory note 
to House Bill No. 1817 of the Third Congress (which became Republic Act 1382) 
will show that while it was the benign purpose of the Legislature to reward 
deserving officers, the spirit of the law is never to place said officers in a 
higher category then regular officers. The explanatory note, as signed by 
Congressman <span class="SpellE">Pajarillo</span> who introduced the bill, reads: 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"This bill seeks to reward hard 
earned, loyal efficient and faithful service, of reserve officers to the country 
in time of war and in time of peace, and to afford security to them after having 
rendered twelve years of service in the Armed Forces of the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"We cannot now ignore our 
obligations to these officers who have spent the best years of their lives in 
the service of the Armed Forces of the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. By the length of their service, 
they have acquired the necessary experience, discipline and loyalty to the 
organization and the government. If reserve officers who have rendered two or 
more years of service in the Army have been made regular officers by operation 
of law, after serving in Korea for a period of from six to eight months, there 
is no justification why reserve officers who have undergone greater hardships in 
<span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> and in the other fronts during the last World 
War, and who, since that time have served the Army up to this date, should not 
be rewarded by affording them the opportunity to become regular members of the 
organization they have so faithfully served, or protecting them from the 
uncertainty of their continuance in the service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Civil Service employees who have 
rendered ten years service in the government are rewarded with automatic civil 
service eligibility. With more reason that these reserve officers who have 
served twelve years in the Army and whose efficiency, integrity and loyalty 
cannot be questioned, should in equal measure, be rewarded with automatic 
integration or security of tenure in their service. For the foregoing reasons, 
this bill deserves approval."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is very clear from the above 
explanation that it was not the intention of the legislature to grant greater 
security of tenure to reserve officers mentioned in Republic Act 1382 than to 
those officers in the regular service. As a Matter of fact, the most that they 
wanted was to grant those officers automatic integration in the regular force, 
but even this proposal met with disapproval in the halls of Congress (See Vol. 
I, No. 72, Congressional Record, page 2779), so much so that the term "automatic 
integration" was removed from the original version of the 
bill.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Furthermore, court martial 
proceedings, which according to the petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, may be the only process to remove the officers 
mentioned in the law in question, is confined to such cases only falling under 
specific provisions of the Articles of War (Com. Act 408). It does not embrace 
those grounds of removal provided under section 8 of Republic Act 340, Article 
.117, Com. Act 408, and presidential orders or regulations (Ex. Order No. 302, 
s. 1958). Indeed, to sustain the view that reserve officers protected by 
Republic Act 1382 may only be removed thru court martial would limit the 
presidential power of removal to those causes specified in the Articles of 
War.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It will not be amiss to state 
here that although, in the stipulation of facts, mention is made of the 
dismissal of criminal charges of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> against the 
petitioner-<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">appellee</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> it is clear from the annexes that these charges were 
dismissed merely on the failure to establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. 
In one of the decisions, however, (<span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case 308, 
CFI, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>), the court has found the said 
petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to have really misrepresented 
himself, "evidence on this point being conclusive and unassailable." This 
indicates somehow a questionable character on the part of the 
petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Premises considered, the decision 
of the lower court enjoining the respondent-appellant herein from proceeding in 
its investigation of petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is hereby 
reversed. <span class="GramE">Without pronouncement as to 
costs.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
