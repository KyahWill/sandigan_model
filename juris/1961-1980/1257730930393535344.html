				<BR><STRONG>MAKALINTAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is a petition for review by certiorari of the decision of the Court of Industrial Relations.</p>
<p>Respondents Braulio Malpas, Felipe Superable, Jose de la Rosa and
Andres Macamay were the complainants below against petitioner Columbian
Rope Company of the Philippines (Tacloban Branch), alleging that they
were employees of the latter who were dismissed by reason of their
membership in the Tacloban Association of Laborers and Employees (CIR
Case No. 16-ULP-Cebu). Superable was dismissed on September 17,1954;
Malpas on November 17, 1954; de la Rosa on December 1, 1954; and
Macamay on February 8, 1955. After trial and pending decision of the
court, the Company filed an "urgent petition" for permission to close
down its Tacloban branch effective October 15, 1955, on the ground of
continuing losses in its local business. Acting on the petition, the
court on September 29, 1955 issued an order stating that "there being
no provision in Republic Act No. 875 or in any other act to the effect
that an employer could not close his or its business without first
securing authority from this Court if there is a pending certification
or unfair practice case involving said business, the granting of such
authority is unnecessary," but that "should the Tacloban branch of
respondent Company be actually closed as planned, such closing should
be without prejudice to the results of the two pending cases (Cases
16-ULP-Cebu and 28MC-Cebu) involving said Company and the Tacloban
Association of Laborers and Employees." On September 22, 1958 the
Industrial Relations Court rendered its decision declaring that the
dismissal of the complainants was violative of Section 4 (a),
subsections 1, 2 and 4 of Republic Act 875 and requiring the company
"to cease and desist from committing unfair labor practice; to pay back
wages to the complainants from the time of their dismissal until they
are made whole; and to maintain the terms and conditions of employment
at the time of their dismissal and not to disturb their seniority."</p>
<p>A motion for reconsideration was denied by the court <em>en banc</em>, with a separate concurring and dissenting opinion by judge Emiliano C. Tabigne.</p>
<p>In the instant petition, petitioner does not question the Industrial
Relations Court's finding of unfair labor practice and the right of the
complaining employees to back wages from the dates of their respective
dismissals up to the time petitioner closed its Tacloban branch,
allegedly on September 30, 1955. The sole issue now presented is: May
an employer, found guilty of unfair labor practice in dismissing four
employees, be ordered to reinstate them after the closure of its branch
office where they were employed, and to pay the dismissed employees
back wages from the date of such closure until they are actually
reinstated?</p>
<p>On this question this Court's ruling in Durable Shoe Factory <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>
Court of Industrial Relations, L-7783 May 31, 1956, is in point:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Under ground (4), petitioner complains in the first
place against the award of back wages beyond December 6, 1962, when,
according to petitioner, it closed operations. As to this complaint, we
think it only fair to rule that the back wages should not extend beyond
the date of closure of business where such closure was due to
legitimate business reasons and not merely to an attempt to defeat the
order of reinstatement."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apropos of a similar question of reinstatement under circumstances
analogous to those claimed by petitioner, it is stated in Erlanger
&amp; Galinger, Inc. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Court of Industrial Relations, L-15118,
December 29, 1960:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The unfavorable conditions in the company's
business and the consequent reduction of its collectible accounts, as
held by the lower court, may not justify reinstatement, but they
certainly are not sufficient grounds to deny back wages to respondent
Flores who was illegally dismissed on account of union activities."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even in the absence of any finding that an employer has been guilty
of unfair labor practice a business recession may affect the right of
an employee to reinstatement. So in Philippine American Drug Co. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>
Court of Industrial Relations, involving the dismissal of an employee
because of business losses suffered by the employer, it was held:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Unquestionably, petitioner had suffered a business
recession which rendered unjustified Cuadra's reinstatement in March
1957—a remedy to which he would ordinarily have been entitled. So he
was merely given a <em>priority right</em> to be employed should petitioner subsequently employ additional personnel." (L-15162, April 18, 1962).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same view is held in American Jurisprudence:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Nor may an employer be compelled by an order of
reinstatement to give employment to a greater number of persons than
the economic operation of his business requires. Thus, if between the
time of the occurrence of the wrongful discharge and the proposed order
of reinstatement, the employer's commercial or financial circumstances
* * * have changed, the Board, despite the employer's unfair labor
practices, cannot compel the employer to reinstate such a number of
employees as may exceed his needs under the altered conditions. While
the Board, under such circumstances, may not be empowered to order
present reinstatement, it does have the right to order that such
employees be given precedence in future hiring." Rothenberg on Labor
Relations, p. 574.</p>
  <p>"Implicit in the reinstatement provision
of the Board's order was a condition of the continued operation by the
offending employer of the refinery to the employment of which the
illegally discharged employees were to be restored. Such operation
might have continued under the old business form or under a disguise
intended to evade this provision. If there was merely a change in name
or in apparent control there is no reason to grant the petitioner
relief from the Board's order of reinstatement; instead there is added
ground for compelling obedience. Whether there was a bona fide
discontinuance and a true change of ownership—which would terminate the
duty of reinstatement created by the Board's order—or merely a
disguised continuance of the old employer, does not clearly appear, and
accordingly is a question of fact properly to be resolved by the Board
on direct resort to it, or by the court if contempt proceedings are
instituted." Southport Petroleum Company <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> National Labor-Relations
Board, 315 U.S. 100-109; 86 L. ed. 719.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Respondents contend that even if it be true that the Tacloban Branch
of petitioning Company has been closed for the reason alleged by it,
they could still be reinstated in its other branches. There is indeed
authority for the proposition that in such case the employer must offer
the discharged employees substantially equivalent employment,<em> if available:</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"A provision of a Board order requiring that
employees directed to be reinstated for whom no work is presently
available be put on one preferential list covering all company plants
in Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania, thus making reinstatement possible
at other than the plant where the employee formerly worked, was held to
be within the power of the Board, and, so far as appears, not an abuse
of discretion." Bufford on the Wagrter Act, p. 848.</p>
  <p>"A
reinstatement order may issue although that branch of the employer's
business in which the employee was engaged has been abandoned or his
former position has been abolished, where the employer can offer his
substantially equivalent employment." 56 C.J.S. 388, Citing Williams
Motor Co. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> National Labor Relations Board, 128 F. 2d 960.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reinstatement under this circumstance does not necessarily have to be immediate:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"There was no positive requirement to re-employ
these men immediately. The requirements as to employment were
alternative and conditioned upon the actual situation. If there were
substantially equivalent positions or any other available positions for
which they are qualified, an offer of immediate reinstatement therein
was required. If there were no such positions available, they were to
be placed on a preferential list and to be first offered employment 'in
any position for which they are qualified as such employment becomes
available' and, if the body and fender shop be reopened, they were to
be offered immediate employment therein. There was no requirement to
discharge employed men to make places for these three; no requirement
to employ them unless such services were needed; and no requirement to
reopen the body and fender shop in order to furnish them employment. No
compulsory change in petitioner's business was contemplated. Petitioner
was permitted to conduct its business as it wished with the one
requirement that these men should be offered such employment as they
were qualified to undertake whenever there was need—immediate or in the
future—of such service by petitioner. In short, the effect of the order
is to restore these men to their previous status as nearly as this
could be done without in any way 'dislocating' petitioner's business or
its method of conducting such business." Williams Motor Co. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>
National Labor Relations Board, <em>supra.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The views so far expounded assume that the employer has legitimately
closed its business. In the present case the lower court has made no
finding on this point. No evidence one way or another was presented at
the trial.</p>
<p>All that appears is that petitioner asked for permission to close
its Tacloban branch, and that its allegation of actual closure on
September 30, 1955, contained in the memorandum submitted in support of
its motion for reconsideration in the court below, has not been
categorically denied by respondents in their written opposition to the
motion.</p>
<p>In the Durable Shoe Factory case, <em>supra</em>, where a similar
question was raised, namely, whether the employer's business closed on
December 6, 1952, the lower court's decision not containing any express
finding thereon, this Court, in order to "avoid any injustice that may
be committed through any assumption that petitioner continued
operations even after December 6, 1952," ruled that the Industrial
Relations Court should require evidence on that particular question of
fact and therefore remanded the case for that purpose.</p>
<p>The decision of respondent Court is set aside and the case is
remanded for further proceedings-specifically to receive evidence on,
and decide the questions of (1) whether or not the Tacloban branch of
petitioning Company was closed on September 30,1955 or on any other
date there after; (2) whether such closure was for a justifiable cause,
as alleged by said company, or was resorted to in order to circumvent
any decision requiring reinstatement which the said court might render,
as alleged by respondent employees and (3) if the closure was true and
justified, whether or not, on the basis of the evidence, to order the
reinstatement of said employees in the Company's other branches or to
put them on a preferential list for that purpose, on the basis of the
exigencies of its business. Without costs.</p>
