				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Segundo Santos was, <span style="">for </span>a
number of years, employed as Labor Conciliator I (Regional Office No. 4) of the
Department of Labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His monthly pay was
P259 per month, or P3108 per annum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1960" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1960</st1:date>, he was extended an
appointment (promotion) as Labor Conciliation II (Regional Office No. 3, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>),
with compensation per annum of P3493 vice Juan Mendoza, Jr., resigned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This appointment, effective September 1,
1960, was approved by the Commissioner of Civil Service on May 14, 1962, and
released to the Department of Labor on May 25, 1962.</p>

<p class="BODY">In June of 1962, respondent Secretary of Labor appointed Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Tiongco</span>, one of the respondents, to the same position of
Labor Conciliator II.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's demand for the revocation of respondent <span class="SpellE">Tiongco's</span> appointment and payment to him (Santos) of salary
differentials was rejected by respondent Secretary of Labor.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From the foregoing events
stemmed the present petition for mandamus </span>filed <span style="">on August 20, 1962 - <u>three da</u></span><u>ys </u><u><span style="">before Santos actually retired</span></u><span style=""> from the service which was on </span><u>August
</u><u><span style="">23, 1962</span></u><span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The petition prays, <u>inter</u> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, <span style="">that
respo</span><span style="">ndents b</span>e <span style="">commanded to nullify the appointment of <span class="SpellE">Tiongco</span>, and to uphold as legal and existing pe­titioner's
appointment, as Labor Conciliator II, from September 1, 1</span>960; <span style="">and that the salary differentials aforesaid
be paid petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents
seasonably answered the petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Before the case could be tried on the merits, that is, on
February 14, 1963, Santos died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion
to substitute the "Estate of Segundo Santos, deceased," represented
by Rodolfo Santos, one of the heirs, <span style="">was
filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This triggered a move on
respondents' part to seek dismissal </span>of <span style="">the case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The court, on April 10, 1963, dismissed the petition without
costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this appeal on purely
questions of law.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. The threshold question is this:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>May the Estate of Segundo Santos, deceased, be substituted in place of
petitioner herein?</p>

<p class="BODY">Public office is a public trust.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
It is personal to the incumbent thereof or appointee thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this sense, it is not property which
passes to his heirs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of the heirs
may replace him in that position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
in this context that we say that the Estate of the deceased Segundo Santos may
not press Santos' claim that he be allowed to continue holding office <span style="">as </span>Labor Conciliator II.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Actio</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>personalis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">moritur</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><u>cum</u> <u>persona</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">But jurisdiction of the court had attached before the death of
Santos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That jurisdiction continues
until the termination of the suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
true that what is left is a money claim for salary differentials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But death will not dislodge jurisdiction on
that money claim - it subsists.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Resolution of this question <u><span style="">depends</span></u><span style=""> </span>upon the right of Segundo Santos to
the position of Labor Conciliator II.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We rule that the Estate
of the deceased Segundo Santos may </span>be <span style="">substituted for him in the present proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do so now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2. We go to the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Stripped of unnecessary
details, the facts are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August </span>24,
1960, <span style="">petitioner, a second grade
eligible, was appointed Labor </span>Con­ciliator <span style="">II at an annual compensation of P3493 effective September 1, 1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As far as salary </span>is <span style="">concerned, no law, rule or regulation has
been violated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, an annual pay of
P3493 is well within </span>the range provided for second grade civil service <span class="SpellE">eligibles</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents challenge the legality of petitioner's appointment <span style="">as </span>Labor Conciliator II.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They <span style="">say
that</span> such appointment is within the prohibition set forth in the
memorandum circular of the Civil Service Commission dated February 16, 1961,
thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Employees should not be
assigned or promoted to positions the initial rate of the salary allocation of
which exceed the maximum allowable for their eligibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent likewise aver that it was because
of this circular, that the appointment of petitioner as Labor Conciliator II
was recalled on <st1:date year="1961" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The circular was not violated.</p>

<p class="BODY">And the withdrawal of petitioner’s appointment is not a proven
fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the record clearly disclose
is that the <u><span style="">original</span></u><span style=""> <u>appointment</u> </span>of petitioner <span style="">as </span>Labor Conciliator II was not taken
out of the Civil Service Commission; it was approved by the Commissioner of
Civil Service <span style="">on </span>May 14, 1962
and released to the Secretary of Labor on May 25, 1962.</p>

<p class="BODY">More important now is that the defense of recall has been
abandoned by respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was
ready <span style="">for </span>trial below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They did not go to trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, they thought it advantageous to them
- upon petitioner’s death – to submit their case on their motion to dismiss
based solely on legal grounds, namely, that the death of petitioner
extinguished the controversy, and that the remaining claim for damages is
ancillary to mandamus and is also abated by death.</p>

<p class="BODY">The money claim here involved, however, descended to Santos'
heirs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, as we have earlier in this
opinion stated, his Estate may prosecute that claim to its conclusion.</p>

<p class="BODY">It will not <span style="">be in </span>harmony
with our sense of justice to return this <span style="">case
</span>to the court below – at this stage - just to allow respondents to prove
their defense of recall of petitioner's appointment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents had <span style="">a choice:
</span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>To go to trial on the merits upon
the <span style="">issues </span>raised in their
answer or, seek to overthrow petitioner's case on legal issues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They did elect the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They cannot be permitted once again to return
to the lower court for a trial on the <span style="">merits.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Suitors should not normally be allowed to
gamble with court proceedings in the hope of obtaining beneficial results.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is unfair that this case should, on
respondents' choice, be made to bounce from the lower court to this Court, and
back to the lower court and perhaps only to be appealed once again to an
appellate court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ensuing delay,
increased cost of litigation, and trouble and anxiety and harassment to be
caused to the adverse party, the wastage of the courts' time - these are
reasons potent enough to support this view.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At all events,
petitioner's right to salary differentials and the duty to pay him are both
clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Civil Service approval completed
petitioner's appointment,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">clinched the case for him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">3. The rest is a question of mathematical computation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pe­titioner's pay as Labor Conciliator I was
at the rate of P259 per month or P3108 per annum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His increased compensation as Labor
Conciliator II from <st1:date year="1960" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1960</st1:date>,
to <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="8">August 23, 1962</st1:date>, the
date of his retirement, is at the rate of P3493 per annum, specified in his
promotional appointment, and reiterated in the 5th <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>
of the Commissioner of Civil Service to the Secretary of Labor dated <st1:date year="1962" day="22" month="5">May 22, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is entitled only to the pay set forth in
his appointment, and no more - absent a legal adjustment thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no such adjust­ment here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's salary differentials during the
period covered amounts to P761.68.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
this should be paid to his Estate.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the view we take of
this case, we vote to reverse the order of the Court of </span>First <span style="">Instance of Manila dated </span><st1:date year="1963" day="10" month="4"><span style="">April
 10, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, and to
direct </span>the Secretary of Labor and the corresponding Cashier to pay the
Estate of the deceased petitioner Segundo Santos the sum of P761.68</p>
