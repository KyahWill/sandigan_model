				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Plaintiff-appellant sued in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo
to recover from defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> P16,212.00 as
deficiency income tax for the year 1951, including a sur­charge of 50%.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
denied liability, alleging that the proceeds of the sale of 3,000 <span class="SpellE">piculs</span> of sugar on which the tax was being principally
levied had been declared as income by his son-in-law, Raul <span class="SpellE">Poblador</span>,
to whom the said sugar belonged and who had paid the corresponding tax
thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from that defense,
prescription was likewise pleaded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
the plea of prescription alone the Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> dismissed the
complaint, and plaintiff appealed directly to Us.</p>

<p class="BODY">The last day for filing the return for the tax year 1951 was <st1:date year="1952" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1952</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The assessment for the deficiency was
released by the Bureau of Internal Revenue on <st1:date year="1957" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was received by defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, who re­quested
through counsel, by letter dated May 10, 1957, that a reinvestigation be made
so that he could show that he had no delinquency at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Regional Director (of the Bureau of
Internal Revenue) for Iloilo then wrote back, requesting counsel to specify
under oath the grounds of his client's protest, to pay one-half of the amount
assessed and put up a bond for the balance, pursuant to a circular of the
Bureau in order that a reinvestigation could be granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No further communication, however, was
received from de­fendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, and so a civil
action for collection was instituted in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo
on <st1:date year="1958" day="21" month="7">July 21, 1958</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the issue of prescription appellant cites Sections 331 and 332
of the Internal Revenue Code, which provide:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 331.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Period of
limitation upon assessment and collection. - Except as provided in the
succeeding section, internal revenue taxes shall be assessed within five years
after the return was filed, and no pro­ceeding in court without assessment for
the collection of such taxes shall be begun after the expiration of such
period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the purposes of this section
a return filed before the last day prescribed by law for the filing thereof
shall be considered as filed on such last day:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pro­vided, That this limitation shall not apply to cases already
investiga­ted prior to the approval of this Code."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SEC. 332.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exceptions
as to period of limitation of assessment and collection of taxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> (c) Where the assessment of any internal revenue tax has
been made within the period of limitation above prescribed such tax may be
collected by <span class="SpellE">distraint</span> or levy or by a pro­ceeding in
court, but only if begun (1) within five years after the assessment of the tax,
or (2) prior to the expiration of any period for collection agreed upon in
writing by the Collector of Internal Revenue and the taxpayer before the
expiration of such five-year period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made
before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that under section 331 internal revenue taxes
shall be assessed within five (5) years after the last day prescribed by law
for the filing of the return, and if there is no assessment a proceeding in
court for collection must be commenced within the same period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under section 332(c), where an assessment is
made the court proceeding must be filed within five (5) years thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, as long as there is a timely
assessment the Government has an additional five years within which to bring an
action for collection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case,
appellant points out, the assessment notice was issued on <st1:date year="1957" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1957</st1:date>, or before the lapse of five
years from <st1:date year="1952" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1952</st1:date>;
and the action was filed only a little over one year there­after, or within the
prescriptive period.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> contends -
and his con­tention was upheld by the trial court - that insofar as income
taxes are concerned the applicable provision was sec­tion 51(d) of the Internal
Revenue Code, (prior to its amendment by R.A. No. 2343 on June 20, 1959),<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
which fixed a period of three (3) years after the return became due, or had
been made, for the Collector to make a return of his own upon information obtained
by him and issue the corresponding as­sessment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such assessment, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> admits, is only for
purposes of summary collection by <span class="SpellE">distraint</span> and levy,
but he maintains that if such remedy is not resorted to then judicial
collection may be resorted to, but only within five years from the date the
taxpayer filed his return or in the absence thereof from the last day he was
supposed to do so, which in this case was March 1, 1952; and since the
complaint was filed only on July 21, 1958 the five-year period had already
expired.</p>

<p class="BODY">The interpretation advanced by defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
can­not be upheld.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 51(d)
referred merely to the sum­mary remedy of <span class="SpellE">distraint</span>
and levy, which should be effected within three (3) years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A warrant of <span class="SpellE">distraint</span>
and levy issued beyond that period was void.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
It did not prescribe any limitation as to judicial action for collection, which
must be governed by section 331 and 332 by <span class="SpellE">suppletory</span>
ap­plication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus it was held in the
cases of Collector vs. <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span> Land Transportation Co.
and <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span> Land Transportation Co. vs. Collector, G.R.
Nos. L-13099 and L-13462, <st1:date year="1960" day="29" month="4">April 29,
 1960</st1:date>, where this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering this void in the law applicable
to income tax, and bearing in mind that Section 331 which provides for the
limitation upon assessment and collection by judicial action comes under Title
IX, Chapter II, which refers to 'CIVIL REMEDIES FOR COLLECTION OF TAXES', it
may be concluded that the provisions of said Sec. 331 are general in character
which may be con­sidered <span class="SpellE">suppletory</span> with regard to
matters not covered by the title covering income tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, Title II of the Code is a
special pro­vision which governs exclusively all matters pertaining to income
tax, whereas Title IX, Chapter II, is a general provision which governs all
internal revenue taxes in general which cannot apply insofar as it may conflict
with the provisions of Title II as to which the latter shall prevail, but that
in the absence of any provision in said Title II relative to the period and method
of collection of the tax the provisions of Title XI, Chapter II, may be deemed
to be <span class="SpellE">suppletory</span> in character."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">And in Republic vs. <span class="SpellE">Gamboa</span>, G.R. No.
L-16504, <st1:date year="1961" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1961</st1:date>,
this Court, speaking through then Associate Justice, now Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, said:</p>

<blockquote>"Hence, in Collector of Internal Revenue vs. A. P. Reyes, G.R.
No. L-8685 (January 31, 1957), we declared that the 3-year period prescribed in
the above-quoted section 51(d) constitutes 'a limitation to the right of the
Government to enforce the collection of income taxes <u>by the summary
proceedings of <span class="SpellE">distraint</span></u> and levy, though<u> it
could proceed to recover the taxes due by the institution of the corresponding
action</u>.' In fact, we have repeatedly held:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span> that taxes may be collected either by <span class="SpellE">dis­traint</span>, <u>or</u> by <u>judicial</u> <u>action.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The period of three years prescribed in said
section 51(d) refers to the as­sessment for the purpose of 'immediate'
collection of the tax due, that is to say, <u>by summary proceedings or <span class="SpellE">distraint</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
aforementioned provision does <u>not</u> bar assessment as a step preliminary
to collection by <u>judicial</u> <u>action</u>' (Alhambra Cigar &amp;
Cigarettes Manufacturing Co. vs. Collector of Internal Revenue; Collector of
Internal Revenue v. Alhambra Cigar &amp; Cigarettes Manufacturing Co., G.R.
Nos. L-12026 &amp; 12131, <st1:date year="1959" day="29" month="5">May 29, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>See also Collector of Internal Revenue vs. <span class="SpellE">Haygood</span>, 65 Phil. 520; <span class="SpellE">Pasudeco</span>

1958) - after assessment 'within five years after the return was filed' (as
provided in said section 331) - which action, in the event of a false return,
such as that filed by defendants herein, may be filed 'at any time within ten
(10) years after the discovery of the falsity', which, in the case at bar, took
place on January 29, 1956.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deficiency
income tax assessment above mentioned and the complaint herein were made and
filed within said periods of five (5) and ten (10) years, respectively."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We therefore hold that the action here was filed within the
statutory prescriptive period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his
answer to appellant's third assignment of error <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
con­tends that irrespective of the question of prescription the action cannot
prosper because appellant failed to substan­tiate its claim for the deficiency
income tax by competent evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
should be pointed out, however, that when <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
received the assessment notice issued by the Col­lector of Internal Revenue on
February 25, 1957, all he did was to send a letter through counsel on May 10,
1957 requesting a reinvestigation, to which he received a reply dated June 14,
1957, wherein he was asked to submit under oath specific grounds of his
client's protest, to pay one-half of the amount and put up a bond for the
rest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing more was heard from <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> thereafter until the present action for collection
was filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> failed to dispute the assessment effectively, and
the same therefore be­came final and properly collectible by means of an
ordinary action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
complied with the conditions required of him by the Bureau of Internal Revenue
in its letter of June 14, 1957, or had he even challenged the validity of those
conditions, the assessment would have been a disputed one which the Collector
of Internal Revenue would have had to decide, and from his decision the recourse
would have been to the Court of Tax Appeals according to Section 7 (1) of
Republic Act No. 1125.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it was, <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> failure to dispute the assessment in the manner
prescribed by law has barred his right to do so in the present case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span> position as may be gathered
from his brief, insofar as the merits of the case are concerned, seems to be
that the entire amount being collected here is the deficiency tax, plus
surcharge, on 3,000 <span class="SpellE">piculs</span> of sugar produced from a
certain hacienda "Concordia," which was ac­tually worked under a
verbal contract of lease to appellant's son-in-law, Raul <span class="SpellE">Poblador</span>,
and that the latter had already paid the corresponding tax on the said produce
for the year 1951.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The truth, however,
is that the assessment issued by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue was based
largely on other items.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Following is the
breakdown shown on Exhibit B:</p>

<blockquote>In other words, the defense of payment of
the tax, allegedly made by Raul <span class="SpellE">Poblador</span> on the 3,000
<span class="SpellE">piculs</span> of sugar, is neither very material nor
decisive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question is whether or not
the assessment was correct, and the same should have been taken to the Court of
Tax Appeals by petition for review if <span class="SpellE">ap­pellee</span> had
wished to dispute it.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In any event, the defense of payment, assuming that it presents a
<span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> question in this case, has no evidence to
sustain it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither Manuel <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span> nor Raul <span class="SpellE">Poblador</span> testified
at the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged verbal
contract of lease of the hacienda "Concordia" in favor of the latter
was merely testified to by counsel; and while it is true that <span class="SpellE">Poblador</span> did file an income tax return for 1951 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 5), which contains an entry referring to receipts from
the sale of crops, there is nothing therein to show that these were the very
crops produced from the hacienda aforesaid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is more, aside from the testimony of counsel for <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> - which is of course hearsay - there is no evidence
to support the allegation in his brief that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
had no other sugar cane farm than the hacienda "Concordia".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is significant that in the assess­ment for
deficiency tax issued by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B) reference is made to the fact that 3,000 <span class="SpellE">piculs</span> of sugar had been the subject of the income tax
return filed by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> himself, although valued at
only P37,500 - the additional undeclared value of the same sugar on which the
deficiency tax was being assessed being only P4,620.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fact - unexplained as it is by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> - does not sit well with his defense that the said
sugar had already been declared and the tax thereon paid by another person
altogether.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Wherefore</b> the judgment appealed from is reversed and
defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is ordered to pay to
plaintiff-appellant the amount of P16,212.00 as deficiency income tax for the
year 1951, plus surcharges and interests accrued thereon in accordance with
law, and costs.</p>
