<p class="BODY">Herein respondent filed, on September 19, 1961, with the Public
Service Commission an application, pray­ing for the grant of a certificate of
public convenience to operate, under PUB denomination, ten buses between <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span> (<span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>) and Piers
(Manila), via <span class="SpellE">Novaliches</span> Road, A. <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
Road, <span class="SpellE">Blumentritt</span> Street, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
Avenue, <span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span> Bridge, <span class="SpellE">Aduana</span>

Road, and <span class="SpellE">No­valiches</span> Road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The application was opposed by De <span class="SpellE">Dios</span> Transportation Co. Inc., <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>
Transportation Co. Inc., PDP Transit Inc., Villa <span class="SpellE">Rey</span>
Transit, Inc., and by herein petitioner-appellant <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span>
F. <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> who was the operator of the transportation
service known as "<span class="SpellE">Halili</span> Transit."
Petitioner, in his oppo­sition alleged, substantially, that he was an operator
of a bus service on the line applied for, enumerating at the same time the
other lines he operated which were traversed by the route mentioned in
respondent's application; that his service, as well as that of other bus
operators on the route, was more than adequate to meet the demands of the
traveling public; that the grant of the application would merely result in
waste­ful and ruinous competition, and that the respondent was not financially
capable of operating and maintaining the service proposed by him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After several hearings in
which the parties pre­sented their evidence, oral and documentary, the Public
Service Commission rendered a decision, on February 13, 1963, granting a
certificate of public convenience to respondent <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span>
Cruz to operate ten buses under PUB denomination on the line <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span> (<span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>)--Piers
(Manila) passing through the routes applied for.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The decision states, among others, as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"After <span style="">a </span>careful
study of the evidence presented by the contesting parties, we find the
following facts established; that applicant is applying for a service from <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span> to Piers and vice-versa; that not one of the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> herein operate a ser­vice up to Piers--most of
them go up to <span class="SpellE">Divisoria</span> and the rest up to <span class="SpellE">Folgueras</span>; that there are commuters starting from <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span> up to Piers; that applicant has the experience
in the operation of a PUB service and that applicant has the means with which
to operate and maintain the service herein applied <span style="">for.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"From the facts in evidence, this Com­mission is of the belief
that the weight of evidence tips in favor of the applicant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It appearing, therefore, that applicant is a Filipino
citizen, that he is financially capable to operate and maintain the service
herein applied for, and that public con­venience and necessity will be promoted
by the approval of this application, and furthermore, that the oppositions of
the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> herein are without merit, the same are
overruled and the instant applica­tion APPROVED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is the above-mentioned decision of the Public Service
Commission that is now sought to be reviewed by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that:</p>

Commission erred </span><span style="">in failing </span>to

petitioner-appellant is entitled."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In support of his first two contentions petitioner argues that
the 500 passengers found by the Commission as commuting daily from <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span> to Manila could easily be accommodated in the
buses of existing operators; that the existing operators were authorized to
operate 31 buses which made around 100 round trips a day; that since a bus
could accommodate about 50 passengers, the existing authorized services could
easily accommodate not only the 500 but even 5000 passengers a day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Peti­tioner also asserted that the Commission
failed to con­sider that 200 of the 500 commuters worked in the Re­public Cement
Factory located at <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span> and so there were
really only 300 commuters daily traveling on the <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span>--Manila
line.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner further claimed that
the new terminal proposed in the application was not based on actual need,
because there were no import­ing firms, or business establishments, or
manufacturing concerns, in <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span>, whose
employees had to make trips to the piers at the south harbor in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the question of public necessity,
petitioner pointed out that the evidence presented by the respondent consisted
only of the testimony of two witnesses who did not make any formal or
systematic study of the movement and frequency of public utility buses, so that
their testimonies were based only on casual observations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, as petitioner pointed out,
the <span class="SpellE">opposi­tors</span> presented five witnesses, two of whom
made meticu­lous, systematic and daily observations on the line applied
for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner urged that according to
Exhibits "1", "1-A" to "1-R", consisting of
different pages of entries in a checkbook et the various PSC checkpoints in the
proposed line, buses passing the checkpoints were carrying only from 1 to 5
passengers -- which fact proved that the existing operators more than
adequately served the needs of the public.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner likewise asserted that public necessity did not
require the operation of the ten buses applied for by the respondent because of
the fact that on Decem­ber 20, 1961, the Public Service Commission granted to
herein petitioner, in Case No. 61-5807, authority to operate only 10 buses on
the line <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span>--Manila, even if he had applied
for 20 buses; and that out of the many applications to operate buses from
Paradise Farms (<span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>) to Manila, only 10 buses
were authorized.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first two contentions of petitioner raise ques­tions of
fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has repeatedly held
that where the Public Service Commission has reached a find­ing, after weighing
the conflicting evidence, that public necessity and convenience warrant the
operation of ad­ditional public utility service, the finding must not <span style="">be </span>disturbed as long as there is
evidence reasonably supporting such finding.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reviewing the decision of <span style="">the </span>Commission, this Court is not even
required to examine the proof <u>de</u> <u>novo</u> and determine for itself
whether or not the preponderance of evidence really justifies the
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only function of this
Court is to deter­mine whether or not there is evidence before the Com­mission
upon which its decision might reasonably be based.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Commission stated in its decision that "after <span style="">a </span>careful study of the evidence
presented by the con­testing parties x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the Commission is of the belief that the weight of
evidence tips in favor of the application."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is evidence on record that there are
numerous students, professionals, merchants, and em­ployees in both government
and private concerns, that commute daily between <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span>
and Manila and the inter­mediate points along the line;<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
that along the same line have emerged numerous centers of population,
residential subdivisions and housing projects, industrial projects like the
Republic Cement Factory, <span class="SpellE">Angat</span> River Dam and Hydro­electric
Power Project, and hollow blocks manufacturing establishments;<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
that commuters experienced difficulties in getting accommodated on buses
traveling between <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span> and Manila; that the
Villa <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> Transit used to make two trips from <span class="SpellE">Angat</span> to Manila via <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span>,
the La <span class="SpellE">Mallorca</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambusco</span>
also two trips from <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span> to Manila via Sta.
Maria, and the <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> Transit likewise two trips from
<span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span> to Manila via the <span class="SpellE">Novaliches</span>
Road; that said trips were fully loaded at <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span>
such that many commuters from <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span> had to take
jeeps which brought them only up to Sta. Maria and <span class="SpellE">Bocaue</span>
and there waited for other means of transportation to bring them to Manila;<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
and that commuters from Manila to <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span> also had
to resort to broken trips for lack of direct trips.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are persuaded that the evidence in the
record sup­port the decision appealed from.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner claims that the Public Service Com­mission did not
consider the checker's reports (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 1, 1-A, to
1-R), on the face of which it appears that there was no overcrowding in the
buses checked at the various checkpoints.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Commission, however, states in its decision that it had arrived at
its finding "after a careful study of the evidence presented by the
contesting parties," -- and necessarily the evidence thus studied included
the checker's reports.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But assuming, <span class="SpellE"><u>gratia</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>argum</u><u><span style="">enti</span></u></span><span style="">,</span> that said reports were not considered the fail­ure of the
Commission to consider the reports would not constitute a reversible error,
because we find that the reports refer to trips of buses from Manila to <span class="SpellE">Ipo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sapang</span> <span class="SpellE">Palay</span>,
San Jose and back, and from upland to lowland and back, and none of the buses
checked had trips along <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span>-Manila or <span style="">Manila-<span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span>
line.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The relative weight of
these checker's reports as evidence must have been considered by the Commission
before making its de­cision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we have
stated, the finding of fact of the Public Service Commission is conclusive on
this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in a case, this Court
said:</p>

<blockquote>"It appearing that the main issues raised by petitioner merely
affect questions of fact which by their very nature involve an evaluation of
the relative weight of the evidence of both parties, or the credibility of
witnesses who testified before the <span style="">Commission,
</span>following the law and jurisprudence applicable to the matter in this
jurisdiction, said questions are now conclusive upon this Court, and cannot be
looked into, it appearing <span style="">that there </span>is
<span style="">sufficient evidence </span>to support
its <span style="">findings."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The claim of petitioner,
that he was rendering adequate service on the line in question </span>as <span style="">would preclude the necessity of another
operator, is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first
place, as shown in the record, petitioner does not have a direct line from <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span> </span><u>to the Piers</u> - <span style="">the line that is applied for by
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the second place, there
is evidence to the effect that <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> was authorized 48 trips between <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Folgueras</span>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> but it was making two trips only.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> This circumstance indicated that there </span>was
<span style="">shortage of transportation units or
facilities, and that the line was not adequately </span><span style="">serviced by</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in a case
concerning the non-operation of authorized units, this Court said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Apart from the existence of com­petent evidence in support of
these findings, certain undisputed facts there­in contained reveal that the
assignment of error under consideration is manifest­ly untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We refer to the circum<span style="">stance that, of the 75 buses that the <span class="SpellE">Raytranco</span>
is authorized to operate in all its lines, its right with respect to 30 has
been leased, 14 to <span class="SpellE">Rizman</span> and 16 to Laguna-­<span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> Bus Company.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, though still entitled to operate 45 units in its remain­ing
lines, the <span class="SpellE">Raytranco</span> has registered only 17 buses,
aside from the circumstance that such buses are not in continuous opera­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These facts lead to the conclusion that there
must be a shortage of transporta­tion facilities in the lines aforementioned
and that the <span class="SpellE">Raytranco</span> is unable to meet fully the
demands of public convenience therein."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner claims, in his
third contention, that the Public Service Commission failed to give him the
protection that he is entitled to, being an old and established public service
operator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a general principle public
utility operators must be protected from ruinous competition, such that before
permitting a new </span>operator to serve in a territory already served by another
operator, the latter should first be given <span style="">op­portunity </span>to improve his equipment and service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This principle, however, is subject to
justifiable exceptions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The primary
consideration in the grant of a certificate of public convenience must always
be public convenience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, this Court
said:</p>

<blockquote>"While it is the duty of the govern­ment as far as possible to
protect public utility operators against unfair and un­justified competition,
it is nevertheless obvious that public convenience must have the first
consideration.…"<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The public convenience </span>is
<span style="">properly served </span>if pas­sengers
who take buses at points in one part of a line are able to proceed beyond those
points without having to change buses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On this point this Court <span style="">said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It is the convenience of the public that must be taken into
account, other things being equal, and that convenience would be effectuated by
passengers who take buses at points in one part of a <span style="">line being </span>able to proceed beyond those points without having to
change buses and to wait the arrival of buses of a compe­titive operator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We can perceive how under such conditions one
public utility could gain business at the expense of a rival."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, public convenience would be properly served
if commuters from <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span> going to Piers in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
could go to their destination with­out the need of changing buses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly the Public Service Commission has
power to grant a certificate of public convenience to a new operator, and the
old operator cannot with reason complain that it had not <span style="">been given </span>opportunity to improve its
equipment and service, if it is shown that the old operator has not placed in
the service all the units of equipment that it had been authorized to operate,
and also when the old operator has violated, or has not complied with,
important conditions in its certificate.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, it has been shown that
