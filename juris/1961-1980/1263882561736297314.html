<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1968</st1:date>,
respondent Castor Tobias bought on installment one (1) Dodge truck from <span class="SpellE">Leelin</span> Motors, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To answer for his obligation he executed a promissory note in favor of
the latter, for the sum of P29,070.28 payable in thirty-six (36) equal
installments with interest at the rate of 12% per annum payable in the amounts
and dates indicated in said promissory note.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
To secure payment of the <span style="">promissory
note, respondent Tobias executed in favor of <span class="SpellE">Leelin</span>

Motors, Inc. indorsed the promissory note and assigned the chattel mortgage to
petitioner Industrial Finance Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a consequence respondent Tobias paid six (6) installments on the
promissory note directly to the petitioner Industrial Finance Corporation the
last of which was made on <st1:date year="1970" day="19" month="2">February 19,

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Upon learning that the truck met an

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the
lower court dismissing the complaint of petitioner Industrial Finance
Corporation but modifying the same by ordering respondent Tobias to pay the
cost of repairs of the damaged truck in the amount of P5,396.78 plus interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main thrust of the petitioner's argument is that the
respondent Court of Appeals erred in affirming the dismissal of the complaint
of the petitioner in the lower court by not considering his right as an unpaid
vendor of the truck in question under Art. 1484 of the New Civil Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner claims that under Art. 1484 of the New Civil Code, an unpaid vendor
may choose any of the remedies provided therein and that as an unpaid vendor,
it has chosen to exact fulfillment of the obligation for fai<span style="">lure of the vendee to pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Tobias, however, claims that
petitioner is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> to insist on its claim on the
balance of the promissory note when it demanded the return or surrender of the
truck in its letter of May 14, 1970, to which demand, respondent acceded in his
letter dated May 27, 1970.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The claim of respondent cannot be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Art. 1484 is clear that "should the
vendee or purchaser of a personal property be in default in the payment of two
or more of the agreed installments, the vendor or seller has the option to
either exact fulfillment by the purchaser of the obligation, or to cancel the
sale, or to foreclose the mortgage on the purchased personal property, if one
was constituted.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Since the case involves the sale of personal property on installments Art. 1484
of the Civil Code should apply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
remedies provided for in Art. 1484 are considered alternative, not cumulative<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
such that the exercise of one would bar the exercise by the others.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Here, petitioner has not cancelled the sale, nor has it exercised the remedy of
foreclosure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Foreclosure, judicial or
extrajudicial, presupposes something more than a mere demand to surrender
possession of the object of the mortgage.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Since the petitioner has not availed itself of the remedy of <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> the sale of the truck in question or of
foreclosing the chattel mortgage on said truck, petitioner is still free to
avail of the remedy of exacting fulfillment of the obligation of respondent
Tobias, the vendee of the truck in question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">In <span class="SpellE">Radiowealth</span>
Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Lavin</span>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the facts of which are similar to the
present case, the issue was "whether the plaintiff is precluded to press
for collection of an account secured by a chattel mortgage, after it shall have
informed the defendants of its intention to foreclose said mortgage, and the
voluntary acceptance of such step (foreclosure) by defendant mortgagor,"
the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the plaintiff mortgagee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said the Court:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The contract being a sale of machinery payable in
installments, the applicable provision of law is Article 1484 of the Civil
Code, which gives the <span style="">vendor the option
to exercise any one of the alternative remedies therein mentioned:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>exact fulfillment of the obligation, cancel
the sale, or foreclose the chattel mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But the vendor-mortgagor in the present case desisted, on its own
initiative, from consummating the auction sale, without gaining any advantage
or benefit, and without causing any disadvantage or harm to the
vendees-mortgagees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The least that could
be said is that such desistance of the plaintiff from proceeding with auction
sale was a timely disavowal that cancelled and rendered useless its previous
choice to foreclose; its acts, being extrajudicial, brought no trouble upon any
court, and were harmless to the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For this reason, the plaintiff can not be considered as having "exercised"
(the Code uses the word "exercise") the remedy of foreclosure because
of its incomplete implementation, and, therefore, the plaintiff is not barred
from suing on unpaid account.”</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In effect this ruling answers the issue
of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> raised by respondent Tobias.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, to hold the petitioner raised in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>, it must be shown that when it gave the res­pondent
the choice of either paying the balance of the purchase price or of
surrendering the truck, it had already knowledge of the accident and the
consequent damage to the truck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
present case petitioner claims it had no knowledge of the accident<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
when it gave the respondent the choice of either paying the balance of the
promissory note or of surrendering the truck.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is hard to believe that petitioner would make such offer to
respondent either to pay the balance on the promissory note or to surrender the
truck in question if it knew that the truck has had an accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The more plausible thing it would have asked
the respondent is to ask for the balance on the promissory note.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides the allegation of petitioner that it
had no knowledge of the accident is a negative allegation and needs no evidence
to support it, not being an essential part of the statement of the right on
which the cause of action is founded.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
It is therefore the respondent Tobias who has the burden <span style="">of disproving the claim of petitioner that he
has no knowledge of the accident when it made the offer to respondent either to
pay the balance on the promissory note or to surrender the truck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent failed in this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is claimed by respondent Tobias that he has surrendered the
truck to petitioner in his letter dated <st1:date year="1970" day="27" month="5">May
 27, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the alleged
surrender was ineffectual as far as the petitioner is concerned because petitioner
could not take possession of the truck in question as it was in the custody of <span class="SpellE">Leelin</span> Motors, Inc. which had a mechanic's lien over
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even respondent Tobias cannot expect
petitioner to accept the term of surrender because aside from the fact that the
truck being surrendered met an accident petitioner was not satisfied with the
repair of the finished portion of the truck in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner therefore was justified in
refusing to accept such surrender and in bringing suit to recover the balance
of the purchase <span style="">p</span>rice.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, the judgment of the respondent
Court of Appeals and of the lower court are hereby set aside and a new one
rendered ordering respondent Tobias to pay petitioner the balance of the
purchase price of the truck in question in the amount of P27,210.77 plus legal
rate of interest from the time of the filing of the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against the respondent.</p>
