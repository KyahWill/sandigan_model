<p class="BODY">The record shows that when this defendant was apprehended after
the discovery of the dead body of Gloria <span class="SpellE">Bulasa</span>, upon
being investigated by the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Kawayan</span>,
he readily admitted having killed Gloria <span class="SpellE">Bulasa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His admission <span style="">was </span>reduced to writing in the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span>
dialect understood by him, and signed by him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, a more lengthy investigation was conducted by the Chief of
Police, and again the defendant admitted having killed Gloria <span class="SpellE">Bulasa</span> and narrated in detail how he killed Gloria <span class="SpellE">Bulasa</span> and what he did with the body of Gloria <span class="SpellE">Bulasa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
defendant was taken to the place where the crime was committed and he even
reenacted what he did with the deceased Gloria <span class="SpellE">Bulasa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statements made by the defendant in this
detailed examination by the Chief of Police, including his statements during
the reenactment of the crime, were reduced to writing, and were subscribed and
sworn to by him before the municipal Judge of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Kawayan</span></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statements made by the
defendant in his written admissions" were corroborated in important
details by <span class="SpellE">Meliton</span> <span class="SpellE">Bulasa</span>,
father of the victim, and by <span class="SpellE">Anatalio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bulasa</span>, an uncle of the victim, who both signed sworn statements
before the municipal judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A </span><u><span style="">post</span></u><span style=""> <u>mortem</u> </span><span style="">examination
of the body of the deceased Gloria <span class="SpellE">Bulasa</span> was made by
Dr. Jose J. <span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span>, the municipal health officer of <span class="SpellE">Kawayan</span>, and the injuries found by the medical officer on
the body of the deceased indicated the brutal acts committed by </span>the <span style="">defendant on his victim, as narrated by the
defendant him­self in his sworn statements.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The corresponding criminal complaint was filed by the Chief of
Police of <span class="SpellE">Kawayan</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>,
before the munici­pal court of the said municipality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the prelimi­nary investigation of the
case, the defendant pleaded guilty to the charge of murder when he was
arraigned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He not only admitted his
guilt, but he narrated before the municipal judge the circumstances attending
the killing of Gloria <span class="SpellE">Bulasa</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="24" month="10">October 24, 1966</st1:date>
the defendant was arraigned before the Court of First Instance or <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court appointed Atty. Delia <span class="SpellE">Tantuico</span>
counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> for the
defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Tantuico</span>
conferred with the defendant, and after the conference the counsel manifest­ed
before the court that the defendant was ready for arraignment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The information was read to the defendant in
the local dialect, called the <span class="SpellE">Waray-Waray</span> dialect,
which is understood by <span style="">the </span>defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the reading or the information the
defendant voluntarily pleaded guilty to the charge or murder alleged in the
information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the trial court
rendered the decision which is now before this Court on review.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have carefully examined the record of this case, and <span class="GramE">We</span> fully agree with the findings and observations or the
trial court in its decision, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"From the records and varied written admissions of the
accused, Diego <span class="SpellE">Balondo</span>, that on <st1:date year="1966" day="29" month="9">Sept. 29, 1966</st1:date>, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 o'clock</st1:time>, A.M., he was in his farm in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Balacson</span>, <span class="SpellE">Kawayan</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype><span class="SpellE">Subprovince</span></st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Biliran</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Leyte</span></span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That he stayed in his farm for about three
hours clearing his <span class="SpellE">camote</span> plantation; that at about
9:00 o'clock in that same day, he went home to take his breakfast; that at
about 1:00 o'clock, he saw Gloria <span class="SpellE">Bolasa</span> going to the
direction of the <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> grooves of the <span class="SpellE">Ayono</span> <span class="SpellE">Asilo</span>, behind <span style="">the </span><span class="SpellE">Aglipayan</span>
church; that upon seeing her, he followed behind surreptitiously; that upon
seeing her cutting the banana leaves he told her, 'why, you are here again to
cut the banana leaves?', that the late Gloria <span class="SpellE">Bolasa</span>
answered, 'it is none of your business for its the property of the government';
that he got furious and immediately grabbed her by his left hand strangled her
by the neck hand pushed her violently to the ground face downward; that he
firmly held her left arm and neck, rode on her back and pinned her down with
his knees <span style="">and teen </span>continuously
lifting her head and smashed her face against the mud; that he choked and
buried her face in the mud for about an hour until she died.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"And that when she was already dead, he lifted her from the
mud and laid her flat on her back, and then he held her by the feet, dragged
her to a place from where he killed her, at a distance or about thirty <span class="SpellE">brazas</span>; that he covered the body wit <span class="SpellE">nipa</span>
leaves to keep her from the sunlight; that the deceased was carrying a knife
for cutting the banana leaves, and she was a niece of the accused from a second
degree cousin; that he sliced and took the flesh from the thighs, legs and
shoulder by the use of the knife or Gloria <span class="SpellE">Bolasa</span> because
his bolo <span style="">was
</span>dull, after which he throw the knife away; that he cut away also the
feet; that he intended to slice all the flesh of the cadaver but he was caught
by the darkness of the night; that he put the sliced flesh with a piece of
rattan, tied it and brought it to his farm; that upon reaching his farm, he
started to build a fire and bar­becued the sliced pieces or human flesh (roasted
it) and he ate the barbecued pieces of human flesh and used it as a viand for
the roasted banana fruits; that the taste of the human flesh was bitter and
poignant like a gall bladder; that he killed Gloria <span class="SpellE">Bolasa</span>
first to taste the human flesh if its good; that after doing all those
atrocious acts, he went home at about 7:00 o'clock in that evening."</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In passing judgment to the accused, Diego <span class="SpellE">Balondo</span>,
the Court has this lamentable observation with this peculiar case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The spectacle of knowing a human being killed and slaughtered
in this island, <span class="SpellE">subprovince</span> at <span class="SpellE">Biliran</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, for unknown motivation is not a news at all in
this jurisdiction because such incident are too common and numerous for the
court to recall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when one, like in
this case, choked a maiden to death just 16 years old for the simple reason
that she was getting leaves from the banana plants of the accused to wrap a
local cookies, the said accused-after killing her, sliced the flesh of the
legs, shoulder and the thigh, cooked those human flesh; devoured them like an
ancient cannibal; the accused, Diego <span class="SpellE">Balondo</span> went
bizarrely beyond the extreme or a carnivorous wild beast."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Justo</span> R. Albert, <span style="">in
his </span>brief for the defendant, urges that the trial court should have
subjected <span style="">the </span>defendant to some
psychiatric test to determine his sanity before rendering judgment, and prays
this Court "that the judgment of the lower court be set aside and this
case be remanded for trial with admonition to <span style="">the </span>lower court to order <span style="">the
</span>submis<span style="">sion of the accused to a
psychiatric test to determine </span>his sanity." We do not <span style="">find merit in the plea of counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
find </span>in the record sufficient justification <span style="">for </span>the conclusion that the defendant was not <span style="">insane at </span>the time of the commission <span style="">of </span>the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The
defendant had made </span>several statements, which were <span style="">reduced to writing and duly signed by
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find that the facts and
circumstances narrated by the defendant in those different statements tally in
important details.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant
voluntarily admitted his guilt before the municipal court </span>during the preliminary
investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He likewise voluntarily
pleaded guilty when arraigned before the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that the defendant is <span style="">charged </span>of having killed <span style="">Gloria <span class="SpellE">Bulasa</span> way
back on September 29, 1966 - or more than three years ago - it is not possible
now to ascertain the </span>mental condition of the defendant as of the time
when <span style="">he committed </span>the <span style="">crime or which he is charged.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The trial court has
correctly found that in killing the deceased Gloria <span class="SpellE">Bulasa</span>,
the defendant had taken ad­vantage </span>of <span style="">his superior strength.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
attendant cir</span>cumstance <span style="">qualifies
the crime committed as murder, defined </span>in Article 248 of the Revised
Penal Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with <span style="">the trial
court that the </span>commission of the crime by the defendant was attended by
the aggravating <span style="">circumstances of (1)
disregard of the respect due the offended party on account of her sex, and (2)
that the wrong done in the commission of the crime was deliberately augmented
by causing other wrong not necessary for its commission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The trial court, however,
</span>erred when it <span style="">declared that two
other aggravating circumstances attended </span>the commis<span style="">sion of the crime; namely, that means was
employed or circumstance brought about which add ignominy to the natural
effects of </span>the <span style="">act, and that the
victim was the niece of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>We
find <span style="">nothing in the record which shows
that before the deceased Gloria <span class="SpellE">Bulasa</span> died </span><span style="">she </span><span style="">was subjected to such indignities as would
cause her shame or moral suffering.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under Article 15 of </span>the <span style="">Revised
Penal Code, the alternative circumstance </span>of <span style="">relationship shall be taken into consideration only when the offended
party is the spouse, ascendant, descendant, legitimate, natural or adopted
brother or sister, or relative by affinity in the same degree of </span>the <span style="">offended (U.S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Insierto</span>,
15 Phil. 358).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">One mitigating <span style="">circumstance
can be considered in favor of the defendant, namely, the circumstance </span>of
his <span style="">having made a voluntary plea of
guilt in court before the presentation of evidence by the </span>prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We, therefore, find that
the defendant had committed the crime of murder, with two aggravating
circumstances that should be counted against him, and one mitigating circumstance
in his favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, for lack of </span>the
<span style="">required number of votes by the members
of the Court, for the imposition or the maximum penalty of death, the Court has
resolved to modify that portion of the </span>judgment of the trial court which
imposes the <span style="">penalty </span>of <span style="">death, by imposing on the defendant the
penalty of <u>reclusion</u> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the lower court is
modified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant is sentenced to <u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, </span>to indemnify the
heirs of <span style="">the </span>deceased Gloria <span class="SpellE">Bulasa</span> in the sum <span style="">or
P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, and to pay the costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
