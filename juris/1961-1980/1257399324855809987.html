				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. MAMERTO S. MIRANDA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Mamerto S. Miranda was charged before the Court of First Instance of Quezon 
City with the crime of <i>Estafa</i> thru Falsification of Commercial Documents, 
under the provisions of article 315, in relation to article 172 of the Revised 
Penal Code. After trial, the court rendered judgment, the dispositive portion of 
which reads:
<blockquote>
<p>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the Court finds that the evidence presented by the 
prosecution fails to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt; 
it failed to show that the accused had taken advantage of his position and 
abused the confidence reposed on him by the complaining witnesses; and it also 
failed to show that the complaining spouses were made to sign all the papers and 
documents pertaining to the loan by inducement and representation exercised on 
their persons by the accused. However, the Court also finds that while the 
complaining witness Mariano Mojica, at least, was fully aware of the second loan 
of P2,000.00, the said amount was not received by the spouses but was retained 
by the accused under an arrangement made by him and Mojica. Therefore the Court 
<i>acquits</i> the accused from the charge contained in the information upon a 
reasonable doubt but finds him civilly liable for the proceeds of the loan of 
P2,000.00 contracted by the complaining spouses from the Rural Bank of 
Novaliches, together with all expenses incident thereto, and he is hereby 
ordered <i>to pay</i> the said amount for the purpose of discharging the said 
obligation with the Rural Bank of Novaliches. The bond for the provisional 
liberty of the accused is hereby cancelled; with 
costs-de-oficio."</p></blockquote>
<p>Accused Miranda appealed from the above decision, assailing that portion 
ordering him to pay the sum of P2,000.00. There are no questions of fact 
involved.</p>
<p>In his brief, appellant contends that the civil liability which is included 
in the criminal action as provided for in Section 1, Rule 107 of the Rules, is 
that arising from and as a consequence of the criminal act. Since the court had 
acquitted the appellant, on the principal ground that the money had been 
received or retained by accused-appellant pursuant to an arrangement between the 
latter and the offended party Mojica, in order to conceal the transaction from 
the other offended party, Mrs. Mojica, it was improper and unwarranted to impose 
civil liability in the same criminal action. The position of the appellant is 
sustained by the Solicitor General who, in his brief, recommended that the 
portion of the decision ordering the appellant to pay or making him liable for 
the sum of P2,000.00, be set aside.</p>
<p>The issue involved in this case has been passed upon by Us in several cases. 
Thus, in the identical case of People vs. Pantig, 97 Phil, 749; We said—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The appellant argues that the civil liability which is included in the 
criminal action is that arising from and as a consequence of the criminal act, 
and that since the defendant-appellant was acquitted in the criminal case, no 
civil liability arising from the criminal charge could be imposed upon him.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>The trial court found as a fact that the sum of P1,200.00, ordered to be paid 
in the judgment of acquittal, was received by the defendant-appellant as loan. 
This finding is inconsistent with the existence of the criminal act charged in 
the information. The liability of the defendant for the return of the amount so 
received arises from a civil contract, not from a criminal act, and may not be 
enforced in the criminal cases." (People vs. Pantig, 97 Phil., 748.) (See also 
MRRCO vs. Baltazar, 93 Phil., 7151; 490 Offi. Gaz. 3874; Pueblo vs. Abellera, 69 
Phil. 623; People vs. Mañago, 69 Phil 496).</p></blockquote>
<p>In the present case, instead of a loan, the appellant retained the money 
because of an arrangement with Mrs. Mojica, heretofore mentioned.</p>
<p>Verily, the findings of the trial court on the matter of civil liability is 
inconsistent with the non-existence of the criminal act charged in the 
information (People vs. Pantig, <i>supra</i>).</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, that portion of the decision appealed from, which 
orders the defendant-appellant Mamerto S. Miranda to pay the sum of P2,000.00 to 
the com-appealed from, which orders the defendant-appellant Ma-fended parties 
the right to institute the corresponding civil action for the recovery of the 
said amount. No costs.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, 
Dizon, Regala,</i> and <i>Makalintal, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
