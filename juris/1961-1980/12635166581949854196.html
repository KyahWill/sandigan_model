				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A point of jurisdiction as to the power of <span style="">a </span>court of first instance sitting as <span style="">a </span>cadastral court to issue <span style="">a </span>writ of possession was raised and
an issue of due process invoked in this petition for the review of <span style="">a </span>decision of the Court of Appeals
dismissing <span style="">a </span>special civil
action for <i style="">mandamus</i> and <i style="">certiorari</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As will hereafter be <span style="">made </span>apparent, neither is sufficiently persuasive to call for <span style="">a </span>reversal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principal question raised in the Court of Appeals according
to the decision sought to be reviewed <span style="">"is
</span>whether, as claimed by the petitioners, 'the respondent Court has acted
without or in excess of its jurisdiction in trying the oft-stated cadastral
case for re-opening and review, on account of its special and limited
jurisdiction, because of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of Civil Case
No.211-G before it, between the same parties and over the same land, where the
issue of ownership <span style="">and </span>possession
is involved.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The question was disposed of in the Court of Appeals decision
thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Upon careful consideration,
we arrived at the conclusion that said question should be answered in the
negative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch <span style="">as </span>it was the respondent Court,
sitting as Cadastral Court, that handed down the decision sought to be reviewed
in the Petition for Review above-mentioned, it is unÂ­questionable that said
Court did not act without or in excess of its jurisdiction when it entertained
said petition for review based upon the ground that <span style="">said </span>Court did not have legal authority to award and adjudicate
privately owned lands already covered by Torrens Title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are satisfied, under the facts hereinabove
mentioned, that the respondent Court was right in reconsidering and setting
aside its said decision and declaring null and void the decrees <span style="">as </span>well as the certificates of title
issued in accordance therewith, it appearing that although given <span style="">a </span>chance to do so, the herein
petitioners had not presented evidence to show, or had not succeeded in
showing, that Certificate of Title No. 75 issued in favor of Andres <span class="SpellE">Villasin</span> of <span class="SpellE">Parafina</span> on September
15, 1914 <span style="">did </span>not include Lot
No. 5387.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view hereof, it would
appear that the appeal sought to be taken by the herein petitioners from the
aforementioned orders of the Cadastral Court, even granting that the steps
towards that end were taken within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period, would not serve any benefit."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners thus disputed the right of respondents to the
aforementioned lot, but without success.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They ought to have taken the proper steps to appeal; they failed to do
so within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They would then rely on the special civil
action for <i style="">mandamus</i> and <i style="">certiorari</i> <span style="">as a </span>substitute measure, having lost the right to appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals saw through their scheme
and dismissed their petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">More specifically, insofar as the issue of the writ of possession
is concerned, the version in the brief of petitioners follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"After the appeal was dismissed, the
private respondents moved for the issuance of <span style="">a </span>Writ of Possession to place them in possession of the land in
controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">said </span>Motion was heard on <st1:date year="1961" day="27" month="3">27
 March 1961</st1:date> and was, with undue haste, granted on the same day, but
a copy thereof was received by the undersigned only on <st1:date year="1961" day="28" month="3">28 March 1961</st1:date>, or the following day after it had
been heard and granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After their
Motion to reconsider the Order of <st1:date year="1961" day="27" month="3">27
 March 1961</st1:date>, granting the issuance of a Writ of Possession, was
denied in the Order of <st1:date year="1961" day="27" month="9">27 September
 1961</st1:date>, the Trial Court issued such Writ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Actually, the herein petitioners, however,
still remain in possession of the land.)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, the Petition for <i style="">Certiorari</i>
and <i style="">Mandamus</i>, which was dismissed by
the principal respondent."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is in the light of the above facts thus presented that they
would raise the aforementioned jurisdictional and due process questions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their contention, <span style="">as </span>set forth in their lone assignment of error is that the Court
of Appeals erred in not declaring null and void the aforesaid orders with
particular emphasis on the writ of possession thereafter issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their effort to lend substance to the
above allegation, petitioners stressed the alleged lack of jurisdiction of the
court of first instance acting as <span style="">a </span>cadastral
court to issue a writ of possession and the alleged denial of procedural due
process.</p>

<p class="BODY">As already indicated, their plea is futile and unavailing,
running counter as it does to controlling decisions of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court of first instance sitting <span style="">as a </span>cadastral court was empowered to
issue <span style="">a </span>writ of
possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor was there a failure to
accord petitioners procedural due process.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Abellera</span>
v. De Guzman,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
we left no doubt about the power of the cadastral court to issue a writ of
possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"After hearing, the cadastral court may
declare the plaintiff the owner of the lots and entitled to their possession and
may issue a writ directing the sheriff to put him in possession thereof, but it
cannot award damages to the plaintiff." As a matter of fact, the <span class="SpellE">Abellera</span> doctrine has its roots in our opinion rendered 22
years earlier in 1928 in Director of Lands v. Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The language used by Justice Laurel in Cordero v. Court of First Instance of
Laguna,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">a </span>1939 decision, would, if
carefully analyzed, likewise yield an affirmative answer to the question of
whether or not a cadastral court may issue a writ of possession.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a recent decision, less than three years ago, where the party
adversely affected did not even bother to assail the legality of an order of a
writ of possession coming from a cadastral court, we pointed out, in an opinion
through Justice J. B. L. Reyes, how broad and extensive is the scope of such an
authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Neither de respondents dispute the
propriety and validity of the order of the cadastral court, granting the writ
of possession in favor of petitioners as well as its enforcement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances, we hold that the
order, dated <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="3">March 20, 1962</st1:date>,
of the cadastral court, granting petitioners' motion to compel respondents to
remove their respective houses from the disputed lot, is valid and enforceable
against respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of
Marcelo v. <span class="SpellE">Mencias</span>, etc., et al., L-15609, April 29,
1960, 58 O.G. 3349, this Court had already upheld the jurisdiction or authority
of the court of first instance, sitting as a land registration court, to order,
as <span style="">a </span>consequence of the writ of
possession issued by it, the demolition of improvements introduced by the
successor-in-interest of <span style="">a </span>defeated
<span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> in the land registration case."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The confidence with which therefore petitioners asserted such lack of
jurisdiction in a cadastral court to issue <span style="">a </span>writ of possession is clearly unjustified.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The due process question
is just <span style="">as easily </span>disposed
of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners, in their brief would
argue thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The herein petitioners
had no chance to object to the private respondents' Motion for Writ of
Possession because, as hereinbefore discussed, they received a copy thereof
only on 28 March 1961, or on the following <span style="">day </span>that it was heard and granted by the Court on 27 March
1961."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In an earlier page of their brief, they did admit that they had a
motion to reconsider such order of <st1:date year="1961" day="27" month="3">March
 27, 1961</st1:date> which was denied in an order of September 27 of the same
year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only then, as admitted by them
likewise, did the lower court issue such a writ of possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where then is the denial of due process?</p>

<p class="BODY">Our ruling in <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> Laguna <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> Bus Co. v. <span class="SpellE">Cadiao</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
would dispel any doubt that the answer to the above due process question must
be in the negative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"While it is true then that the order of
November 2, 1967 was issued <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>,
it is equally true that Whatever objections could have been raised by petitioner
were in fact set forth in its petition to set aside and to reconsider and were
inquired into in a hearing held on January 24, 1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As far back as 1935, it has already been a
settled doctrine that a plea of denial of procedural due process does not lie where
a defect consisting of an absence of notice of hearing was thereafter cured by
the alleged aggrieved party having had the opportunity to be heard on a motion
for reconsideration. 'What the law prohibits is not the absence of <u>previous</u>
notice, but the absolute absence thereof and lack of opporÂ­tunity to be heard.'
There <span style="">is </span>then no occasion to
impute deprivation of property without due process where the adverse party was
heard on a motion for reconsideration constituting as it does 'sufficient
opportunityâ for him to inform the Tribunal concerned of his side of the
controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was stated in a recent
decision, what 'due process contemplates is freedom from arbitrariness and what
it requires is fairness or justice, the substance rather than the form being
paramount,' the conclusion being that the hearing on a motion for reconsideration
meets the strict requirement of due process."</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The third point raised by
petitioners to the effect that a writ of possession cannot affect parties who
enter the land after the issuance of a decree of registration is equally devoid
of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a factual matter, the
determination of which was properly within the cognizance of the Court of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should there have been
raised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, petitioners <span style="">did </span>not do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The invocation of this particular issue at
this stage cannot be characterized as other than <span style="">a </span>last-ditch attempt of petitioners to impute an aspect of
vulnerability to the decision <span style="">now </span>on
appeal, when in reality there is none.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals of <st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="8">August 28, 1964</st1:date>, dismissing the
