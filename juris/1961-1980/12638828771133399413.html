conducting a preliminary investigation of the unfair labor practice charge filed

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners, in asserting

implementation of these substantive rights.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>No one disputes any substantive right under Republic Act 3844 or

(Underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A careful consideration of the foregoing pleadings shows that
while at first blush petitioners' counsel seem to assert that the CAR has no
jurisdiction to try unfair labor practice cases involving agrarian workers--as
asserted in paragraph 10 quoted above--petitioners in reality do not dispute
the autho­rity and/or jurisdiction of respondent Judge to try and decide the
merits of the unfair labor practice charge or complaint involving private
respondents who are agricultural workers--as clarified in pars. 6 and (a) also
above quoted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For while petitioners,
thru counsel assert that this "... case for unfair labor practice is <u>outside
the jurisdiction of respondent Judge</u>..." citing Section 155 of
Republic Act No. 3844 or the Agricultural Land Reform Code and Republic Act No.
1267, The Charter of the Court of Agrarian Relations, it is obvious that what
they question is "... the manner of enforcing these rights ..."
because "...The Land Reform Code (Republic Act 3844) Republic Act 1267
creating and establishing the jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations,
nor the Revised Rules of Court does not vest the Court of Agrarian Relations
with the power to conduct preliminary investigation much less grant the
Honorable Investigator Reynold S. Fajardo, the power to sign complaints for and
in behalf of the real party in interest...".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The real question presented to Us, therefore,
in respect to the unfair labor practice cause is--(1) Did respondent Judge, in
designating an investigator, Atty. Reynold S. Fajardo, to look into the merits
of the unfair labor practice charge filed by private respondents, and in giving
due course to the unfair labor practice complaint signed and filed by the said
Court investigator, act without and/or in excess of his jurisdiction?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners, additionally, also contend
that--(2) the Court of Agrarian Relations does not have jurisdiction to take
cognizance of claims for moral and exemplary damages and for differential
pay--as alleged in paragraphs 11, 12, and 13 and (b), (c) and (d) also quoted
above.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now to resolve the first
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can be no issue with
respect to the jurisdiction of respondent Judge over the unfair labor practice
case filed by private respondents as agricultural workers at the time the
complaint for unfair labor practice was filed on <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1965</st1:date> in the Court below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it is a settled doctrine that cases
involving agricultural workers, including unfair labor practice cases, were
within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the CAR upon the approval of
Republic Act 1267 on <st1:date year="1955" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1955</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This has been the consistent holding of this
Court in at least three cases, the latest of which was decided on <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<blockquote><u>"Jurisdiction</u>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Unfair
labor practice</u>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Jurisdiction of
Court of Agrarian Relations if agricultural laborers are involved.</u>-
Laborers whose principal work in an hacienda consists in the planting and
harvesting of sugar canes and other chores incidental to ordinary farming op­erations,
are agricultural laborers, and any unfair labor practice case involving them
comes within the jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations, not the Court
of Industrial Relations."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Section 8 of Republic Act 2263, which
amended Section 27 of Republic Act 1199, otherwise known as Agricultural
Tenancy Act of the Philippines, made this jurisdictional competence of CAR over
unfair labor practice cases clearer with the provision that-?</p>

<blockquote>"(5)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The landholder shall not discourage,
directly or indirectly, the formation, mainte­nance or growth of a union or
organization of tenants in his landholding, but he shall not initiate,
dominate, assist or interfere in the formation or administration of any such
union or organization."<u><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Finally, Republic Act 3844, the
Agricultural Land Reform Code of 1963, under the regime of which the cause of
action of private respondents herein accrued, expressly and specifically vests
in the CAR the jurisdiction to hear and decide unfair labor practice (ULP)
cases.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the procedural aspect of unfair labor practice cases before
the CAR, which is our main concern here, this Court in Matillano vs. De <st1:country-region><st1:place>Leon</st1:place></st1:country-region><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>

said:</p>

<blockquote>"The procedure applicable to cases involving agricultural
laborers prior to the creation of the Court of Agrarian Relations was the Rules
of the Court of Industrial Relations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the Court of Agrarian Relations was created on <st1:date year="1955" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1955</st1:date>, until the effectivity
of the Agricultural Land Reform Code on <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="8">August
 8, 1963</st1:date>, the procedure for said cases was that provided for in the
Rules of the Court of Agrarian Relations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This, as stated, was the procedure applicable when the present suit was
filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And finally, on <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1963</st1:date>, to the present, the
procedure governing agricultural la­borer's cases is the Rules of Court by
virtue of Section 155 of the Agricultural Land Reform Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neith<span style="">e</span>r
the Rules of the Court of Agrarian Relations nor the Rules of Court require the
preliminary in­vestigations in question."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In both the foregoing cases, petitioners
therein questioned the action of the CAR in giving due course to the ULP charge
filed by private respondents in said cases, without the benefit of preliminary
investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the issue
was whether or not a preliminary investigation of the unfair labor practice
charge was a condition precedent for the CAR to acquire <span style="">jurisdiction over an unfair labor practice suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this Court held in the negative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While there is merit in petitioners' contention that preliminary
investigation of unfair labor charge before the CAR is not required, this case
presents a different situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the
preliminary investigation was already <u>fait</u> <u>accompli</u> when
petitioners questioned, through a motion to dismiss, the procedure adopted by
respondent Judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge by causing the conduct of a preliminary
investigation, although the same was not required, and in giving due course to
the complaint filed by the investigator on behalf of the private respondents,
indeed committed a breach of pro­cedure.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This, however, did not affect his jurisdiction to try and decide the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For respondent Court had
jurisdiction over the subject matter of the suit and it acquired jurisdiction
over the persons of petitioners with the service of summons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The error committed was procedural, i.e., in
the mere exercise <span style="">of jurisdiction, not
one involving lack or excess of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus--<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Admittedly, respondent court had jurisdiction over the case,
the impugned orders were issued in the exercise of such jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the court has jurisdiction of the subject
matter and of the person, orders or decisions upon all questions per­taining to
the cause are orders or decisions within its jurisdiction and, however
irregular or erroneous they may be, they cannot be corrected by <i>certiorari</i>
(Gala vs. Cui and Rodriguez, 25 Phil. 522).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Judicial errors or mistakes of law, are proper subjects of appeal
(Macasieb Sison vs. CFI of Pangasinan, 34 Phil. 404; Galang vs. Endencia, 73
Phil. 399."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the Court of Agrarian Relations, under the provisions of
Sec. 155, Republic Act 3844 were allowed to deviate from usual norms of
procedure as long as such ex­cursions did not impair substantial rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We here recall the statement of petitioners
in their Motion for Reconsider<span style="">ation</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> quoted earlier, where they in effect
conceded that their "substantial rights under Republic Act 3844 or
existing laws prior thereto" have not been affected by the allegedly
erroneous procedure followed by respondent Judge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the preliminary investigation which respondent Judge
caused to be conducted was not a useless proceeding; it has a desirable
objective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it has been said that
its purpose in unfair labor practice cases is "...not only for the
protection of the respondent but also for the benefit of the CIR itself so that
the respondent may not be required to defend itself against frivolous and
unfounded charges, and the valuable time of the CIR dissipated and
unnecessarily spent in hearing charges without basis."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">From the point of view of substantive rights and proce­dural <span style="">due </span>process, therefore, no prejudice
has been suffered by petitioners.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now with respect to the
second question on the juris­diction of the Court of Agrarian Relations to
award moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees in the concept of
damages, <span style="">suffice it to state that said
Courts are vested with such authority not only because the Courts of Agrarian
Relations have all the powers and prerogatives inherent in or belonging to the
Courts of First Instance;</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> but also, procedurally, to require private
respondents to split their causes of action and seek redress in different
Courts would be to encourage multiplicity of suits which is abhorred in the
interest of orderly administration of justice.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the last contention of petitioners that respondent Court
"cannot entertain matters where differential pay is alleged in the
complaint for unfair labor practice" Sec. 154, par. (2), in relation to
Secs. 42 and 47 of Republic Act No. 3844 clearly vest in the Courts of Agrarian
Relations the jurisdiction to try and decide cases involving violations of
minimum wage fixed by law, or regulations issued by the<span style=""> Department of Labor, for agricultural workers.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, on the need for further proceedings and the proper forum
for the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have thus arrived at
the con­clusion that this Petition is without merit and, therefore, further
proceedings will be necessary in CAR Case No. L-229 Neg. Occ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in the meantime that this Petition was
pending before this Court, Pres. Decree 442, otherwise known as Labor Code of
