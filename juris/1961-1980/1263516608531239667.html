one claimed error:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the penalty imposed
is incorrect.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The criminal complaint was
for homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The charge was lodged with
<span style="">t</span>he Municipal Court of Flora, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Mountain</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the preliminary investigation in that
court, the accused was <span style="">arraigned, </span>pleaded
"not guilty" to the charge.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case was thereafter elevated to the Court of First I<span style="">nstance </span>of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>
for trial on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, a formal
indictment <span style="">for </span>homicide was
filed by the prosecuting attorney.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
arraignment, the accused - this time - pleaded guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before sentence, he <span style="">pre­sented </span>evidence to prove the mitigating circumstances of
incomplete self-defense and voluntary surrender, aside from the plea of guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">Came the trial judge's decision of <st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="9">September 27, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He ignored the appellant's plea of guilty as a mitigating circumstance
"in view of his former plea of not guilty before the municipal <span style="">court </span>of Flora, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Mt.</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype></st1:place>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not take into account incomplete
self-defense as a privileged mitigating circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He <span style="">merely
</span>accorded defendant the benefits of provocation together with voluntary
surrender, as ordinary mitigating circumstances lie thus <span style="">sentence </span>defendant for the crime of
homicide defined and penalized under Article <span style="">249 </span>of the Revised Penal Code to an indeterminate penalty of two
<span style="">(2) </span><span style="">years, </span>four (4) months and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">prision</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>correc­cional</u></span>
</span>as minimum, to eight (8) years of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">prision</span></u></span><span style=""> <u>mayor</u> </span>as <span style="">maximum, </span>with the accessories of the
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further directed defendant to
indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P6,000.00 without subsidiary
imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay <span style="">costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused argues that
his plea of guilty should be con­sidered in his favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span style="">this
</span>he receives an assist from the <span style="">Solicitor
General.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is to <span style="">be conceded </span>right
at the outset that if an accused, charged with an offense <u><span style="">cognizable</span></u><span style=""> </span>by the municipal court, pleads not guilty therein, and on
appeal to the court of first instance, changes his plea to that of guilty upon <span class="SpellE">rearraignment</span>, he should <span style="">not </span>be entitled to the mitigating circumstance of confession of
guilt.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The philosophy behind this rule is obvious.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For, the spontaneous willingness of the accused to admit the commission
of the <span style="">offense charged, which </span>is
rewarded by the mitigating circumstance, <span style="">is
</span>absent.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, if the rule were otherwise, <span style="">an
accused, who naturally nourishes the hope of acquittal, </span>could <span style="">deliberately plead not guilty in the </span>municipal
court, and upon conviction and on appeal to the court of first instance, plead
guilty just so he can avail himself of the benefit of a mitigating
circumstance.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
This cannot be countenanced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused
should not be allowed to speculate.</p>

<p class="BODY">One feature of this case, however, takes it out of the reach of
the principle earlier adverted to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
municipal court before which the accused pleaded not guilty was only conducting
a prelim­inary investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had no
jurisdiction over the crime of homicide; it could not have rendered judgment on
the plea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must elevate the case to
the court of first instance - the court of competent jurisdiction - even if the
plea be that of guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For purposes of
applying the mitigating circumstance of confession of guilt, the plea of not
guilty upon arraignment at preliminary investigation in the municipal court is
no plea at all.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, we cannot just sweep away defendant's right
to a preliminary investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a
statutory grant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be
withheld.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To do so would be to transgress
constitutional due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant
herein was thus entitled to know if probable cause existed to require elevation
of his case to the court of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because, absent a probable cause, the case against him must be
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His plea of not guilty before
the municipal court therefore may not be taken against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus it is, that the proper forum where a plea in mitigation may
be presented is the court which has jurisdiction to take cognizance of the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Homicide, we repeat, is the
charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court having original jurisdiction
is the court of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Defendant, accord­ingly, properly entered his plea of guilty therein -
with right to claim it <span style="">as a </span>mitigating
circumstance.</p>

<p class="BODY">By statute [Article 13(7), Revised Penal Code], a circumstance
which mitigates penal liability is that the accused "had voluntarily
confessed his guilt before the court <u><span style="">prior</span></u><span style=""> </span>to the presentation of the evidence
for the prosecution".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise,
such voluntary confession should be ruled out in fixing the sentence.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Here, the plea of guilty <span style="">was
made </span>upon arraignment, certainly before trial <span style="">was </span>conducted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
mitigating circumstance of voluntary confession of guilt before the court of
first instance should be counted <span style="">in his </span>favor.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other argument defendant presses upon us
is that the trial court should have appreciated the privileged mitigating
circum­stance of incomplete self-defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The concept of justice thus espoused finds full support in the
trial court's decision itself, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:</p>

<blockquote>"The accused testified that <span style="">he saw the deceased </span><span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Duldulao</span> chasing his son.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Not contented with that and not being able <span style="">to </span>catch the latter the said victim <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Duldulao</span> threw his wooden
club at the son of the accused, but the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> son
was not hit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused approached <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Duldulao</span> and asked him
why he was chasing the son and why he threw the club.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Upon being asked, the deceased <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dul­dulao</span> instead of answering the accused Mariano <span class="SpellE">Oandasan</span>, clubbed the accused Mariano <span class="SpellE">Oandasan</span>,
hitting him on the left shoulder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
accused Mariano <span class="SpellE">Oandasan</span> stepped backward and remem­bering
that he had a sharp-pointed knife, he drew it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again the deceased struck the accused on the head with the club, so the
accused stabbed <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Duldulao</span>
on the front.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased sustained two
wounds, one at the <span class="SpellE">epigastric</span> region and the other on
the right hand".<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Once again, the Solicitor General joins the accused in ascribing
error to the trial court when it declared that the facts just recited merely
show provocation by the deceased, a mitigating circumstance under Article
13(4), Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They <span style="">say </span>that those facts also clearly
demonstrate an act of unlawful aggression by the deceased as well <span style="">as </span>lack of sufficient provocation on
the part of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These two
circumstances, they submit, carve out a good case of incomplete self-defense.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Their submission induces approbation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is borne out by the facts found
below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused saw the deceased <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Duldulao</span> chasing the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
the accused approached <span class="SpellE">Duldulao</span> and asked him why he
(<span class="SpellE">Duldulao</span>) was doing so, <span class="SpellE">Duldulao</span>
hit the accused with a wooden club on the left shoulder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused drew a sharp-pointed knife he had
with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, the deceased clubbed the
accused on the head, which prompted the latter to stab <span class="SpellE">Duldulao</span>
on the front.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we see it, the only
element absent to exempt the accused totally from criminal liability under
Article 11(1), Revised Penal Code, is "[r]<span class="SpellE">easonable</span>
necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel" the unlawful
aggression.</p>

<p class="BODY">The privileged mitigating circumstance of incomplete self-defense
<span style="">is </span>here present.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We now come to assess the
penalty that should be imposed.</p>

<p class="BODY">By the facts, the accused deserves the benefit of Article 69 of
the Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
provides:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">"A </span>penalty lower by one or two degrees than that prescribed
by law shall be imposed if the deed is not wholly excusable by reason of the
lack of some of the conditions required to justify the same or to exempt from
criminal liability in the several cases mentioned in articles 11 and 12, pro­vided
that the majority of such conditions be present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The courts shall impose the penalty in the
period which may be deemed proper, in view of the number and nature of the
conditions of exemption present or lacking".</p>

<p class="BODY">And then, in view of the plea of guilty and voluntary surrender
and the absence of any aggravating circumstance, the accused is also entitled,
as Article 64(5) of the same code commands, to a "penalty <span style="">next lower </span>to
that prescribed by law, in the period that it [the court] may deem applicable,
according to the number and nature of such circumstances".</p>

<p class="BODY">From all this, the defendant prays, and the Solicitor General
recommends, a two-degree reduction of penalty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is well-taken.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the past, this Court has found occasion in a number of <span style="">instances </span>to
lower the penalty by one degree<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
or two degrees<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
because of incomplete self-defense (with the concurrence of unlawful <span style="">aggression and </span>lack
of sufficient provocation, and absent a reasonable <span style="">necessity of </span>the means employed), but
without having to compute into the penalty other privileged mitigating
circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY">What about incomplete self-defense coupled with a privileged <span style="">mitigating </span>circumstance,
as in this case?</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In
</span><u>People</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Lucero</u>, 49 Phil. 160, 162, incomplete
self-defense was accompanied by <span style="">provocation, a circumstance analogous to </span><span class="SpellE"><u>arrebato</u></span><u> y <span class="SpellE">obcecacion</span></u>
and youthfulness of the accused (19 years of age at the time of the
trial).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court reduced the penalty
for homicide by two degrees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>People</u>
<u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Jaurigue</u></span>, 76 Phil. 174, 182-183,
was a <span style="">case of incomplete defense of
honor attended by four generic mitigating circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The penalty for homicide was likewise </span>lowered
by two degrees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>People</u> <u>vs</u>.
<span class="SpellE"><u>Maula</u></span> (unreported), L-7191, <st1:date year="1954" day="18" month="10">October 18, 1954</st1:date>, this Court
appreciated incomplete self-defense, concurred in by minority of the accused <span style="">as </span>a
privileged mitigating circumstance and by voluntary surrender.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The penalty of the accused for homicide was
also brought down by two degrees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The standard set down in the cases just discussed gives us <span style="">the </span>proper
course to pursue:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A two-degree reduction
of penalty-one degree, by Article 69, and another degree, by Article
64(5).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the most reasonable and
just for the accused Mariano <span class="SpellE">Oandasan</span>.</p>

<p class="NUM">4. The crime of homicide is penalized by Article 249 of the
Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The penalty therein
prescribed is <u>reclusion temporal</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Two degrees lower is <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u>
correctional</u>, the penalty imposable by law in the period that the courts
may deem applicable, <span style="">"</span>according
to the number and nature" of the mitigating circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the mitigating circumstances attendant,
we feel that <span class="SpellE">Oandasan's</span> penalty should be fixed
within the medium period at two (2) years, <span style="">four (4) months, and one (1) day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Calling the Indeterminate
Sentence </span>Law into operation - <span style="">whose
</span>applicability <span style="">is </span>based "upon the penalty actually imposed in accordance
with law and not upon that which may be imposed in the discretion of the
court,"<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
- the minimum of the penalty then should be <u>within the range</u> of the
penalty next lower in degree,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
i.e., <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span><u> mayor</u>, which we fix at
four (4) months.</p>

<p class="NUM">5. We cannot close this decision without putting in a good word
for defendant's lawyer, Atty. Antonio Ma. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appointed counsel <u><span style="">de</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
</span>below, he volunteered to prosecute defendant's appeal by seeking a new
appointment as such counsel on the appellate level.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Conscientious
</span>and diligent in championing defendant's rights below and on appeal, his
actuations present an exemplary case of devotion to duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are those of a worthy member of the Bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the record as it stands, the lower court judgment rendered
against the accused Mariano <span class="SpellE">Oandasan</span> is hereby
modified; and he is <span style="">hereby sentenced to
an indeterminate penalty of four (4) months </span><span style="">of </span><span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span><u>

four (4) months and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span> as maximum, with the accessories of the
