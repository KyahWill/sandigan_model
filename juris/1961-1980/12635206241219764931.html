				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">On April 11, 1960, Loreto
Lee <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>, hereinafter </span>referred to only as <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>, filed a petition for natural­ization with the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the required publication and hearing in
connection therewith, said court rendered a decision denying the petition on
March 5, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ong's</span>
m<span style="">o</span><span style="">tion </span><span style="">for reconsideration filed subsequently having been denied, he interposed
the present appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence shows that <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>, a Chinese
citizen, was born on December 10, 1923 in <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> City, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, Philippines; an
Alien Certificate of Registration <span style="">and a
Native Born Certificate of Residence was issued to him by the Bureau of
Immigration; since his birth he had not gone abroad and had continuously
resided </span>in <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> City except for a brief period
during the <span style="">Japanese occupation when he
and members of his family </span>evacuated to the hinterland; he has two
brothers and three sisters, and his mother is still alive.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Ong</span> presented evidence to show that he
was the Assistant Manager and Paymaster of the <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span>
Hard­ware owned by his brother, <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span>, with a
monthly salary of P200.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For reasons
stated hereinafter, we do not consider this evidence <span style="">as </span>convincing.</p>

<p class="BODY">His evidence further shows that he had filed his Income Tax
Returns with net income ranging from P1,885.84 to P4,148.60 from the years 1952
to 1960; that he owns a building on a piece of land owned by a Chinese Com­mercial
Company, having paid the real estate taxes due thereon; that he is able to
speak and write English and the local dialect and is a believer in the
principles underlying the Philippine Constitution; that he is not opposed to
organized government, nor is he defending or teaching the necessity or
propriety of violence, personal assault or assassination for the success and
predominance of men's ideas; that he is not <span style="">a </span>polygamist nor does he believe in the practice of polygamy;
that he is free <span style="">from any incurable
diseases and, in general, has conducted himself in an irreproachable manner in
relation to the government <span class="GramE">and</span> the community in which
he lives.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In support of his appeal,
</span><span style="">he </span><span style="">claims that the trial court committed the
following errors:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"I.</blockquote>

<blockquote>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE
TWO CLAIMS FOR EXEMPTION <span style="">IN

</span><span style="">YEAR </span><span style="">1955 </span><span style="">(EXHIBIT S-3) THAT HIS TWO SISTERS, ANASTACIA AND SALVACION WERE HIS

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The briefs submitted </span>by
both parties contain an extensive discussion of their respective points of view
in relation to the assignments of error bearing on the question of whether or
not <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> had falsely and illegally misrepresented
facts in his Income Tax Returns for the <span style="">years
</span><span style="">1954-1955, </span><span style="">and </span>1958-1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">We
believe, however, that to decide this appeal it is not really necessary to
resolve said issue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful consideration of the pertinent parts of the
record, we have come to the conclusion that <span class="SpellE">Ong's</span>
evidence on his alleged employment as Assistant Manager and Paymaster of the <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> Hard­ware, which <span style="">is </span><span style="">a </span>business owned and controlled by his brother <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span>, is not convincing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This particular kind of evidence is
frequently resorted to by persons applying for letters of citizenship because
it seems to be an easy way of proving alleged lucrative employ­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason, unless the evidence
presented to prove it as a fact is entirely free <span style="">from </span>doubt, we are not inclined to give it full credence.</p>

<p class="BODY">But even on the assumption that <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> was
really employed by his brother in the latter's business, it seems clear that
his income <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> does not constitute what,
according to the standard set by this Court, is an income derived from a
lucrative employment, because his own evidence shows that he was receiving no
more than P200.00 as a monthly salary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the basis of this amount, we cannot accept <span class="SpellE">Ong's</span>
claim that he was employed in a gainful or lucrative occupation even in the
light of the standard of living prevailing in the year 1960 when he filed his
petition for naturalization.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another circumstance that makes <span class="SpellE">Ong's</span>
case doubtful is his contention that he had a net income ranging from P1<span class="GramE">,885.84</span> to P4,148.60 from the year 1952 to the year 1960, in
spite of the fact that he was only earning P200.00 monthly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, there is no evidence of
record showing that, aside from this monthly salary, he had other sources of
income.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision being in accord­ance with
the facts and the law, the same is hereby affirmed, with costs.</p>
