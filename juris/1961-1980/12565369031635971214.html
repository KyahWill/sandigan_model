				<H3>ANASTACIO G. DUÑGO, PETITIONER, VS. ADRIANO LOPENA, ROSA RAMOS AND HON. ANDRES REYES, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REGALA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On September 10, 1959, herein petitioner Anastacio G. Duñgo and one Rodrigo 
S. Gonzales purchased 3 parcels of land from the respondents Adriano Lopena and 
Rosa Ramos for the total price of P269,804.00. Of this amount, P28,000.00 was 
given as down payment with the agreement that the balance of P241,804.00 would 
be paid in 6 monthly installments.
<p>To secure the payment of the balance Anastacio G. Duñgo and Rodrigo S. 
Gonzales, the vendees, on September 11, 1958, executed over the same 3 parcels 
of land a Deed of Real Estate Mortgage in favor of the respondents Adriano 
Lopena and Rosa Ramos. This deed was duly registered with the Office of the 
Register of Deeds of Rizal; with the condition that failure of the vendees to 
pay any of the installments on their maturity dates shall automatically cause 
the entire unpaid balance to become due and demandable.</p>
<p>The vendees defaulted on the first installment. It resulted then that on 
November 7, 1959, the vendors, herein respondents Adriano Lopena and Rosa Ramos, 
filed a complaint for the foreclosure of the aforementioned real estate mortgage 
with the Court of First Instance of Rizal, the Hon. Judge Andres Reyes, 
presiding. This complaint was answered by the herein petitioner and the other 
vendee, Rodrigo S. Gonzales, on December 7, 1959.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there were 2 other civil cases filed in the same lower court 
against the same defendants Anastacio Duñgo and Rodrigo S. Gonzales. The 
plaintiff in one was a certain Dionisio Lopena, and in the other case, the 
complainants were Bernardo Lopena and Maria de la Cruz. Both complaints involved 
the same cause of action as that of the herein respondents Adriano Lopena and 
Rosa Ramos. As a matter of fact, all three cases arose but of one transaction. 
In view of the identical nature of the above three cases, they were consolidated 
by the lower court into just one proceeding.</p>
<p>It must be made clear, however, that this present decision refers solely to 
the interests and claim of Adriano A Lopena against Anastacio Duñgo alone.</p>
<p>Before the cases could be tried, a compromise agreement dated January 15, 
1960 was submitted to the lower court for approval. It was signed by the herein 
respondents Adriano Lopena and Rosa Ramos on one hand, and, Rodrigo S. Gonzales, 
on the other. It was not signed by the herein petitioner. However, Rodrigo S. 
Gonzales represented that his signature was for both himself and the herein 
petitioner. Moreover, Anastacio Duñgo's counsel of record, Atty. Manuel O. Chan, 
the same lawyer who signed and submitted for him the answer to the complaint, 
was present at the preparation of the compromise agreement and this counsel 
affixed his signature thereto.</p>
<p>The text of this agreement is hereunder quoted:</p>
<p align="center">COMPROMISE AGREEMENT</p>
<blockquote>
<p>COME NOW the parties in the above entitled cases and unto this Hon. Court 
respectfully set forth:</p>
<p>That, the plaintiffs, have agreed to give the defendants up to June 30, 1960 
to pay the mortgage indebtedness in each of the said cases;</p>
<p>That, should the defendants fail to pay the said mortgage indebtedness, 
judgments of foreclosure shall thereafter be entered against the said 
defendants;</p>
<p>That, the defendants hereby waive the period of redemption provided by law 
after entry of judgments;</p>
<p>That, in the event of sale of the properties involved in these three cases, 
the defendants agree that the said properties shall be sold at one time at 
public auction, that is, one piece of property cannot be sold without the 
others."</p></blockquote>
<p>This compromise agreement was approved by the lower court on the same day it 
was submitted, January 15, 1960.</p>
<p>Subsequently, on May 3, 1960, a so called Tri-Party Agreement was drawn. The 
signatories to it were Anastacio Duñgo (herein petitioner) and Rodrigo S. 
Gonzales as debtors, Adriano Lopena and Rosa Ramos (herein respondents) as 
creditors, and, one Emma R. Santos as payor. The stipulations of the Tri-Party 
Agreement were as follows:</p>

<p>When Anastacio Duñgo (herein petitioner) and Rodrigo S. Gonzales failed to 
pay the balance of their indebtedness on June 30, 1960, herein respondents 
Lopena and Ramos filed on July 5, 1960, a Motion for the Sale of Mortgaged 
Property. Although this last motion was filed <i>ex parte</i>, Anastacio Duñgo 
and Rodrigo S. Gonzales were notified of it by the lower court. Neither of them, 
however, despite the notice, filed any opposition thereto. As a result, the 
lower court granted the above motion on July 19, 1960, and ordered the sale of 
the mortgaged property.</p>
<p>On August 25, 1960, the 3 parcels of land above-mentioned were sold hy the 
Sheriff at a public auction whereat herein petitioners, together with the 
plaintiffs of the other two cases, won as the highest bidders. The said 
sheriff's sale was later confirmed by the lower court on August 30, 1960. In 
this connection, it should also be made of record that before confirming the 
sale, the lower court gave due notice of the motion for the confirmation to the 
herein petitioner who filed no opposition therefor.</p>
<p>On August 31, 1960, Anastacio Duñgo filed a motion to set aside all the 
proceedings on the ground that the compromise agreement dated January 15, 1960 
was void <i>ab initio</i> with respect to him because he did not sign the same. 
Consequently, he argued, all subsequent proceedings under and by virtue of the 
compromise agreement, including foreclosure sale of August 25, 1960, were void 
and null as regards him. This motion to set aside, however, was denied by the 
lower court in its order of December 14, 1960.</p>
<p>Upon denial of the said motion to set aside, Anastacio Duñgo filed a Notice 
of Appeal from the order of August 31, 1960 approving the foreclosure sale of 
August 25, 1960, as well as the order of December 14, 1960, denying his motion 
to set aside. The approval of the record on appeal, however, was opposed by the 
herein respondent spouses, who claimed that the judgment was not appealable 
having been rendered by virtue of the compromise agreement. The opposition was 
contained in a motion to dismiss the appeal. Anastacio Duñgo filed a reply to 
the above motion. Soon thereafter, the lower court dismissed the appeal.</p>
<p>Two issues were raised to this Court for review, to wit:</p>
<p>(1) Was the compromise agreement of January 15, 1960, the Order of the same 
date approving the same, and, all the proceedings subsequent thereto, valid or 
void insofar as the petitioner herein is concerned?</p>
<p>(2) Did the lower court abuse its discretion when it dismissed the appeal of 
the herein petitioner?</p>
<p>Petitioner Anastacio Duñgo insists that the Compromise Agreement was void 
<i>ab initio</i> and could have no effect whatsoever against him because he did 
not sign the same. Purthermore, as it was void, all the proceedings subsequent 
to its execution, including the Order approving it were similarly void and could 
not result to anything adverse to his interest.</p>
<p>The argument was not well taken. It is true that a compromise is, in itself, 
a contract. It is as such that the Civil Code speaks of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ART. 2028. A compromise is a contract whereby the parties by making 
reciprocal concessions, avoid a litigation or put an end to one already 
commenced.</p></blockquote>
<p>Moreover, under Art. 1878 of the Civil Code, a third person cannot bind 
another to a compromise agreement unless he, the third person, has obtained a 
special power of attorney for that purpose from the party intended to be 
bound.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ART. 1878. Special powers of attorney are necessary in the following 
cases:</p></blockquote>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(3) To compromise, to submit questions to arbitration, to renounce the right 
to appeal from a judgment, to waive objection to the venue of an action or to 
abandon a prescription already acquired;"</p></blockquote>
<p>However, although the Civil Code expressly requires a special power of 
attorney in order that one may compromise an interest of another, it is neither 
accurate nor correct to conclude that its absence renders the compromise 
agreement void. In such a case, the compromise is contract. It must be governed 
by the rules and the law merely unenforceable. This results from its nature as a 
on contracts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ART. 1403. The following contracts are unenforceable <i>unless they are 
ratified</i>:</p>
<p>(1) Those entered into in the name of another person by one who has been 
given no authority or legal representation, or who has acted beyond his 
powers."</p></blockquote>
<p>Logically, then, the next inquiry in this case should be whether the herein 
petitioner, Anastacio Duñgo, had or had not ratified the compromise agreement. 
If he had, then the compromise agreement was legally enforced against him; 
otherwise, he should be sustained in his contention that it never bound him, nor 
ever could it be made to bind him.</p>
<p>The ratification of the compromise agreement was conclusively established by 
the tri-party agreement of May 3, 1960. It is to be noted that the compromise 
agreement was submitted to and approved by the lower court on January 15, 1960. 
Now, the Tri-Party Agreement referred itself to that order when it stipulated 
thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"WHEREAS, the PAYOR, hereby submits and binds herself to the force and effect 
of the Order dated January 15, 1960, of the Court of First Instance, of Pasig, 
Rizal, Branch IV, which order is hereby made an integral part of this agreement 
as Annex "A".</p></blockquote>
<p>Having so consented to making that court order approving the compromise 
agreement an integral part of the Tri-Party Agreement, how can the petitioner 
herein now repudiate the compromise agreement and claim he has not authorized 
it?</p>
<p>When it appears that the client, on becoming aware of the compromise and the 
judgment thereon, fails to repudiate promptly the action of his attorney, he 
will not afterwards be heard to contest its validity (Rivero vs. Rivero, 59 
Phil. 15).</p>
<p>Besides, this Court has not overlooked the fact that while indeed Anastacio 
Duñgo was not a signatory to the compromise agreement, the principal provision 
of the said instrument was for his benefit. Originally, Anastacio Duñgo's 
obligation matured and became demandable on October 10, 1959. However, the 
compromise agreement extended the date of maturity to June 30, 1960. More than 
anything, therefore, the compromise agreement operated to benefit the herein 
petitioner because it afforded him more time and opportunity to fulfill his 
monetary obligations under the contract. If only for this reason, this Court 
believes that the herein petitioner should not be heard to repudiate the said 
agreement.</p>
<p>Lastly, the compromise agreement stated "that, should the defendants fail to 
pay the said mortgage indebtedness, judgment of forecloure shall thereafter be 
entered against the said defendants;" Beyond doubt, this was ratified by the 
Tri-Party Agreement when it covenanted that—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If the PAYOR defaults or fails to pay anyone of the installments in the 
manner stated above, the PAYOR and the DEBTOR hereby permit the CREDITOR to 
execute the order of sale referred to above (the Judgment of Foreclosure), and 
they (PAYOR and DEBTOR) hereby waive any and all objections or oppositions to 
the propriety of the public auction sale and to the confirmation of the sale to 
be made by the Court."</p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioner Duñgo finally argued that even assuming that the compromise 
agreement was valid, it nevertheless could not be enforced against him because 
it has been novated by the Tri-Party Agreement which brought in a third party, 
namely, Emma R. Santos, who assumed the mortgaged obligation of the herein 
petitioner.</p>
<p>This Court cannot accept the argument. Novation by presumption has never been 
favored. To be sustained, it need be established that the old and new contracts 
are incompatible in all points, or that the will to novate appears by express 
agreement of the parties or in acts of similar import. (Martinez vs. Cavives, 25 
Phil. 581; Tiu Sinco vs. Havana, 45 Phil. 707; Asia Banking Corporation vs. 
Lacson Co., 48 Phil., 482; Pascual vs. Lacsamana, 100 PhiL, 381; 53 Off. Gaz. 
2467).</p>
<p>An obligation to pay a sum of money is not novated in a new instrument 
wherein the old is ratified, by changing only the term of payment and adding 
other obligations not incompatible with the old one (Inchausti vs. Yulo, 34 
Phil. 978; Pablo vs. Sapuiigan 71 Phil. 145) or wherein the old contract is 
merely supplemented by the new one (Ramos vs. Gibbon, 67 Phil., 371).</p>
<p>Herein petitioner claims that when a third party, Emma R. Santos, came in and 
assumed the mortgaged obligation novation resulted thereby inasmuch as a new 
debtor was substituted in place of the original one. In this kind of novation, 
however, it is not enough that the juridical relation of the parties to the 
original contract is extended to a third person; it is necessary that the old 
debtor be released from the obligation, and the third person or new debtor takes 
his place in the new relation. Without such release, there is no novation; the 
third person who has assumed the obligation of the debtor merely becomes a 
co-debtor or surety. If there is no agreement as to solidarity, the first and 
the new debtors are considered obligated jointly. (IV Tolentino, Civil Code, p. 
360, citing Manresa). There was no such release of the original debtor in the 
Tri-Party Agreement.</p>
<p>It is a very common thing in business affairs for a stranger to a contract to 
assume its obligations; and, while this may have the effect of adding to the 
number of persons liable, it does not necessarily imply the extinguishment of 
the liability of the first debtor (Rios vs. Jacinto, etc. 49 Phil. 7; Garcia vs. 
Khu Yek Chiong, 65 Phil. 466). The mere fact that the creditor receives a 
guaranty or accepts payments from a third person who has agreed to assume the 
obligation, when there is no agreement that the first debtor shall be released 
from responsibility, does not constitute a novation, and the creditor can still 
enforce the obligation against the original debtor (Straight vs. Haskell, 49 
Phil. 614; Pacific Commercial Co. vs. Sotto, 34 Phil. 237; Estate of Mota vs. 
Serra, 47 Phil. 464).</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, We hold that the Tri-Party Agreement was an 
instrument intended to render effective the compromise agreement. It merely 
complimented and ratified the same. That a third person was involved in it is 
inconsequential. Nowhere in the new agreement may the release of the herein 
petitioner be even inferred.</p>
<p>Having held that the compromise agreement was valid and enforceable against 
the herein petitioner, it follows that the lower court committed no abuse of 
discretion when it dismissed the appeal of the herein petitioner.</p>
<p>WHEREFORE, the petition for certiorari and mandamus filed by the herein 
petitioner is hereby dismissed. The order of the lower court dismissing the 
appeal is hereby affirmed, with costs.</p> <i>Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera,</i> and <i>Makalintal, 
JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
