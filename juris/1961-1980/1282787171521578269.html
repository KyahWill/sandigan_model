				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><div style="text-align: center;">SUMMARY<br></div><br>Chinaman Koa Gui was denied Filipino citizenship by naturalization, on finding that he lacked lucrative income and had been using <i>alias</i> names.&nbsp; On appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">RULING<br></div><br>Petitioner's total annual income of about P5,980.00 in 1956, with a wife and three children to support, is not lucrative within the meaning of Sec. 2, Com.&nbsp; Act 473.<br><br>Petitioner's adoption of the name Robert Dee Koa Gui in his marriage contract with Marcelina Tan disqualifies him from becoming a citizen. It may be true that the Catholic Church required him to have a Christian name, but in addition to his Christian name Koa Gui, he used and signed not only his Christian name Robert but also another Chinese name Dee. The use of this additional Chinese name is likely to befuddle his identity as a contracting party to the marriage and cannot be justified by the fact that it is not used on other occasions, for marriage in this country is a sacred institution that requires full and accurate disclosure of identities of&nbsp; the contracting&nbsp; parties.<br><br>Moreover, the Supreme Court noted that petitioner failed to state in his petition his former residence at 602 Benavides, Manila, in violation of the requirement of Sec. 7, Com.&nbsp; Act 473.</div>
