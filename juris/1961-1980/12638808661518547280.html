the morning of <st1:date year="1957" day="20" month="2">February 20, 1957</st1:date>,
the lifeless body of Juanita <span class="SpellE">Lingad</span> was discovered
near a bamboo grove beside a creek in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maite</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tenejero</span>, <span class="SpellE">Balanga</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Bataan</span></span></st1:place>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Immediately thereafter, a combined group of policemen, PC soldiers, the
municipal judge of <span class="SpellE">Balanga</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place>, Judge Vicente <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span>,

Arriving thereat, the group found the dead woman with her skirt raised up

After examining the body of the deceased, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Magat</span>

<p class="BODY">Around <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00 o'clock</st1:time> in
the afternoon of that same day, the police authorities of <span class="SpellE">Balanga</span>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place> noted the presence of
Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span> and Jose Omega, particularly the fact
that the former was wearing rubber shoes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Suspecting that they might have something to do with the crime, they
were picked up for investigation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span> denied that he had been in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maite</span> in the early morning
of <st1:date year="1957" day="19" month="2">February 19, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The police then asked him to remove his
rubber shoes, which he did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span> and Jose Omega were taken to the
scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A comparison of the
rubber soles of Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Ilaya's</span> rubber shoes with
the shoe prints found<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
around the dead woman's body showed that they tallied.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, Lt. (now Captain) Luis Sacramento of the PC took over
the investigation of the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
In the course of the investigation, Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span>
pointed to Jose Omega as the author of the crime,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>

wherein he narrated how Jose Omega allegedly raped and killed the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, Jose Omega was charged in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> with the complex crime of rape with <span style="">murder, </span>docketed therein as Criminal
Case No. 5083.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Upon arraignment, the accused pleaded not guilty to the charge.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
After due trial, the court <u>a quo</u> convicted the accused of two sepa­rate
and distinct crimes of rape and murder, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
<span style="">portion of which reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused JOSE OMEGA, guilty
beyond peradventure of doubt of two separate and distinct crimes of rape, as
defined and penalized under Art. <span class="GramE">335 of the Revised Penal
Code, and of murder, as defined and penalized under Art.</span> 248 of the same
Code, and accordingly renders judgment as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"For the crime of rape, there being no mitigating nor
aggravating circumstances, and applying the benefits of the Indeterminate
Sentence Law, the Court hereby sentences said accused to suffer an imprisonment
of eight (8) years and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE">prision</span> mayor
as MINIMUM to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of
reclusion temporal as MAXIMUM:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"For the crime of murder, the Court hereby sentences the accused
to suffer an imprisonment of reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>; to
indemnify the heirs of the deceased Juanita <span class="SpellE">Lingad</span> in
the amount of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>; and to p<span style="">ay the costs </span>in both instances.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Considering that the accused has to serve more than one
penalty imposed in these two cases of rape and murder, the rules prescribed in
Art. 70 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by Commonwealth Act No. 217, on
successive service of sentence must be observed, and pursuant thereto the order
of their respective severity shall be followed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The accused should not serve a penalty of imprisonment <span style="">for more than </span>threefold of the <span style="">length of </span>time <span style="">corresponding </span>to <span style="">the
severest of the penalties imposed </span>upon him in both of the two cases, and
the maximum period of the penalty to be served by him shall in no case exceed
forty years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The penalty of reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span> is computed for 30 years."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Dissatisfied with the
above judgment, the accused appealed to the Court of Appeals,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> but the said appellate court certified </span>the

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The case for the
prosecution is built mainly on the testimony of Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span>,
allegedly the only eyewitness to the crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He testified that at about 6:00 o'clock in the morning </span>of <span style="">February 19, 1957, while he and his <span class="SpellE">compadre</span> Jose O</span>mega were<span style=""> conversing on the street in front of his house at barrio <span class="SpellE">Tenejero</span>, <span class="SpellE">Balanga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>, they </span>saw <span style="">Juanita <span class="SpellE">Lingad</span> going down from her house with
a rope in her hand, and thereafter, walking towards the corral.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, Jose Omega invited him to go to
the field to gather whatever foodstuff </span>they <span style="">could get therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they saw
Juanita <span class="SpellE">Lingad</span> in the field, Jose Omega told </span>him,
<span style="">"She is <span class="SpellE">Juaning</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Birahan</span> </span><span class="SpellE">natin</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">siya</span></span><span style="">." He then inquired </span>of <span style="">Jose Omega what he meant </span>by <span style="">"<span class="SpellE">birahan</span>",
and </span>the <span style="">latter replied, ''<span class="SpellE">Ako’ng</span> <span class="SpellE">bahala</span> (I will be
responsible)."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">When they caught up with Juanita <span class="SpellE">Lingad</span>,
Jose Omega asked her where she was going.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The latter answered that she was looking for her <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jose Omega then pointed to the direction
where the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> could be found which Juanita <span class="SpellE">Lingad</span> followed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Shortly thereafter, Juanita <span class="SpellE">Lingad</span> returned
and upon reaching the place where Jose Omega was standing, the latter held and
embraced her, prompting her to shout and cry:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"<span class="SpellE">Tiyo</span> Jose, <span class="SpellE">Tiyo</span>
Jose, you are my uncle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why are you
doing this to me?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I will report you to <span class="SpellE">Tiya</span> <span class="SpellE">Auring</span>." Thereupon,
Jose Omega pinned her to the ground, tied a rope around her neck, tore her
panty and raped her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Juanita <span class="SpellE">Lingad</span> was complaining of pain, Jose Omega picked up a
stone and struck her on the forehead.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Believing that the girl was already dead, Jose Omega invited him
to go home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On their way, they passed by
Jose <span class="SpellE">Minta</span> picking up <span class="SpellE">camote</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He (Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span>)
saw also Pedro <span class="SpellE">Sedano</span> cutting bamboos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Somewhere along the way, Jose Omega told him,
"Padre, on this thing I have done nobody knows except you," and he
replied, "Padre, as far as I am concerned, you have nothing to
worry." Then Jose Omega warned him, "You <span class="GramE">be</span>
careful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">If this thing
that I have done leaks out, I will kill you.”</span> Then he assured his <span class="SpellE">compadre</span>, "<span class="SpellE">Compadre</span>, you do
not have to worry about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it is on
my part, you cannot be sold down the river."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon their arrival at barrio <span class="SpellE">Tenejero</span>,
they went directly to the store of <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> and took a glass each of "halo-halo".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter they went to the next store, and
after taking again a glass each of "halo-halo", they went home.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
On the following day, <st1:date year="1957" day="20" month="2">February 20,
 1957</st1:date>, he and Jose Omega were arrested by the police.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the appellant interposed an alibi,
corroborated by Mariano <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claims that at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="19">7:30 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning of <st1:date year="1957" day="19" month="2">February 19, 1957</st1:date>, he and his <span class="SpellE">compadre</span>
Mariano <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span> went to the house of <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> Santos at <span class="SpellE">Balanga</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place>, to look for work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, they were not able to talk to him
because the latter was in <span class="SpellE">Morong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After lingering for about an hour in the town
plaza, they went to the market place where Mariano <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span>
met his acquaintances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Thereafter, at about </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="10"><span style="">10:00 </span>o'clock</st1:time>
<span style="">they walked home towards <span class="SpellE">Tenejero</span>, arriving thereat at </span>about <st1:time minute="30" hour="10">10:30 o’clock</st1:time> in the morning of that day.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellant now mainly
assails the trial court in giving weight and credence </span>t<span style="">o the testimony of prosecution witness
Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span>, and in disbelieving his alibi, thus,
putting in </span><span style="">issue </span><span style="">the question of credibility.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Ordinarily, this Court
will not interfere with the trial </span>court's <span style="">findings and conclusions on the credibility of witnesses, in deference
to the rule that the latter tribunal, having had the opportunity </span>to <span style="">observe the demeanor and conduct of the
witnesses while testifying, is in a better position to properly gauge their
credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This rule, however, is
inapplicable to the present case, because while it was the late Judge <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span> T. <span class="SpellE">Dollete</span> who heard the
testimony of Guillermo <span class="SpellE">llaya</span> it was Judge Tito V. <span class="SpellE">Tizon</span> who subsequently penned </span>the <span style="">decision, when he took over the case and
terminated the </span>proceedings.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">The reason for the rule does not exist
in this case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span> is supposedly the </span>only <span style="">eyewitnes</span>s<span style=""> to the
crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason, <span class="GramE">We</span> examined the entire </span>record, <span style="">and after a careful and thoughtful review, We
find </span><span class="SpellE">OurseIves</span> <span style="">unprepared to give weight and credence to his testimony.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To begin with, his
testimony is highly incredib</span>l<span style="">e
and improbable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As correctly </span>o<span style="">bserved by the trial court, </span>Guillermo <span class="SpellE">llaya</span> is the uncle of <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span>
Mata,<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
husband of the deceased, yet he merely stood like a mannequin watching the
appellant rape and kill the wife of his nephew.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He never attempted to prevent nor convince the appellant from committing
the crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, it is highly unbelievable that the appellant would rape and kill the
deceased in the presence of Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span>, uncle of
the deceased by affinity.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the natural reaction of one who witnesses a crime is to
reveal it to the authorities, unless, of course, he is the author thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
If Guillermo <span class="SpellE">llaya</span> had really seen the appellant
commit the crimes in question, he could have informed the authorities
immediately thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he did
not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His claim that he was afraid<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
is too flimsy to be believed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he
was picked up by the police for investigation together with the appellant,<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
it would have been very easy for him to inform, or at least, whisper to the
police that the culprit was the appellant so that the latter could safely be
held in prison and thus prevented from taking vengeance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second alleged threat of the appellant to
kill Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span> was made on <st1:date year="1957" day="29" month="10">October 29, 1957</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
that is, eight (8) months after the commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On these two occasions, the threats were
allegedly uttered, but aside from the spoken words, there was no act or
circumstance whatsoever to believe that <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span> could
be intimidated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, when Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span> was
investigated by Lt. Luis Sacramento of the PC, he disclaimed any knowledge of
the identity of the perpetrator of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was only when Lt. Sacramento had bluffed Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span> by telling him that the appellant had already
squealed against him that he denounced the appellant as the culprit.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
This circumstance engenders doubt and suspicion as to the motive of Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span> in implicating the appellant, considering that he was
arrested by the police and the PC as the principal suspect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, his denunciation of the appellant
came as a mere afterthought, and sprang from his desire to save his own skin
rather than from a sincere desire to tell the truth.</p>

<p class="BODY">On top of that, why would the deceased say to the appellant,
"<span class="SpellE">Tiyo</span> Jose, <span class="SpellE">Tiyo</span> Jose,
<u><span style="">you are my uncle</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Why
are you doing this to me?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I will report
you to <span class="SpellE">Tiya</span> <span class="SpellE">Auring</span>",
when the appellant is not her uncle but rather Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span>?</p>

<p class="BODY">Aside from the foregoing, there are facts and circumstances
extant in the record which tend to show that the crimes at bar could have been
committed by someone else other than the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, as correctly observed by the Solicitor
General,<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
the presence of Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span> at the scene of the
crime cannot be doubted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The shoe prints
found around the dead woman's body tallied with the rubber shoes worn by Guillermo
<span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> Mendoza saw Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span>
going to <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maite</span> at
about 6:00 o'clock in the morning of February 19, 1957 passing the trail taken
earlier by the deceased Juanita <span class="SpellE">Lingad</span> in going
thereto.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Sedaño</span>, likewise, saw his nephew Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span> at <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Maite</span></span><span style=""> at </span>about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning of the same day, holding the

Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> Mendoza and Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Sedaño</span> again saw Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span>
at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 o'clock</st1:time> that <span style="">morning soaked in perspiration, his khaki
pants were wet up </span>to the knee, and his rubber shoes were also wet.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
These facts which are not disputed cast a reasonable doubt on the <span style="">question as to whether or not the herein
appellant committed the crimes in question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It should be recalled that Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span>
testified that he and the appellant Jose Omega went together to <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maite</span> at about </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="18"><span style="">6:00 o'clock</span></st1:time><span style=""> in the morning of </span><st1:date year="1957" day="19" month="2"><span style="">February
 19, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is rather <span class="GramE">strange,</span>
however, that <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> Mendoza and Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Sedaño</span> did not see the appellant Jose Omega but only
Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the light of the
foregoing, it is clearly discernible that the evidence for the prosecution is
weak, unsatisfactory and inconclusive to justify a finding of guilt as against
the </span>appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Although alibi is known
to be the weakest of all defenses for it is easy to concoct and difficult to
disprove, nevertheless, where the evidence for the prosecution is weak and
betrays lack of concreteness on the question of whether or not the accused
committed the crime charged, </span>the defense of alibi assumes importance.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, in the case of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Fraga</span>, et al.,<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court held that:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> an
accused cannot be convicted on the basis of evidence which, independently of
his alibi, is weak, uncorroborated, and in­conclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule that alibi must be satisfactorily
proven was never intended to change the burden of proof in criminal cases;
otherwise, we will see the absurdity of an accused being put in a more
difficult position where the prosecution's evidence is vague and weak than
where <span style="">it </span>is strong."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In other words, the prosecution has the
burden of proof in establishing the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable
doubt and the weakness of the defense does not relieve it of this
responsibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused does not
have to prove his innocence because that is presumed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, the prosecution's
evidence falls short of that <u>quantum</u> of evidence which will justify
conviction of the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His guilt
has not been proven beyond reasonable doubt, and, therefore, he is entitled to
an acquittal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apparently, this case - as correctly observed by the court <u>a
quo</u> - was filed by the prosecution and the PC investigators without
conducting a thorough and discreet investigation to determine the real culprit
or culprits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case should, therefore,
be brought to the attention of the <span style="">National
Bureau of Investigation for it to conduct a new </span>investigation and to
bring to trial those responsible for the heinous crimes at <span style="">bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In
this connection, it may not be inappropriate to restate what this Court has
said in the case of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Roa</span>, et al.<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the
duty of both police and prosecution agencies to ascertain what did in fact
transpire and to bring to trial the person or persons against whom evidence
exists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Necessarily, the discretion
vested in a provincial fiscal is ample.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On him rests in the first instance the determination of who should be
indicted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Where the
crime is rather serious, as in this case, haste is to be deplored.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should the finger of suspicion point to one
or more possible culprits, the most meticulous efforts should be exerted to
assure that a miscarriage of justice does not thereafter occur.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">Nor</span> is the burden solely on the
prosecuting arm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court must be
equally alert to <span class="GramE">the</span> possibility that the fiscal could
be in error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is imperative then that
the utmost caution be exercised lest a guilty party may escape his just
deserts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the event that another
individual would thereafter be accused, the same degree of care in the analysis
of the proof submitted is of the essence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The primordial consideration is that the mandate of the Constitution be
obeyed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The person at the dock is presumed
to be innocent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His guilt must be shown
by competent and credible evidence that removes every vestige of reasonable
doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moral certainty is of the
essence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not enough that there be
diligence on the part of the trial court as well as acquaintance with applicable
decisions from this Tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is
indispensable is a painstaking analysis of the proof submitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A ready acceptance of the testimony for the
prosecution is far from advisable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Always, the thought uppermost should be the ascertainment of truth in
ways allowed by <span style="">the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>A desirable end cannot be achieved by
less than full compliance with the requisites of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So should it be."</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">ANTONIO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are
significant circumstances which place in serious doubt the credibility of
Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, the trial court found that:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span> has been estranged from his
wife for a period of two (2) years prior to the date of the incident; (2) in
the early morning of the date of the incident, <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span>
was seen by <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> Mendoza going towards the field,
following the same route taken earlier by Juanita <span class="SpellE">Lingad</span>;
<span style="">(3) </span>not long thereafter, at
about 7:00 a.m., <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span> was seen by his uncle,
Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Sedaño</span>, at the <span class="SpellE">camote</span>
plantation of Jaime <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span> at <span class="SpellE">Maite</span>,
holding and pulling the hands of Juanita <span class="SpellE">Lingad</span>; (4)
later that morning, <span class="SpellE">Sedaño</span> saw <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span>
wearing wet rubber shoes and khaki pants which were wet up to the knee; <span style="">(5) </span>that same morning, <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span> was seen by <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span>
Mendoza, the former still wearing his wet shoes <span style="">and pants, </span>apparently <span style="">soaked
with perspiration; (6) </span>the body of the deceased was found at <span style="">about 10:00 o'clock </span>that same morning
near a <span style="">creek </span>and near the body
were <span style="">prints of rubber </span>shoes
which tallied with the prints of the rubber shoes worn by Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span>; and <span style="">(7) </span>there
was undue <span style="">delay or vacillation in
implicating </span>appellant Jose Omega.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span> had the motive, intent and opportunity
to commit the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These <span style="">circumstances </span>sufficiently indicate <span style="">that </span><span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span>
had strong motives to falsely <span style="">implicate
</span>appellant Jose Omega in the commission of the crime, <span style="">which renders the </span>truthfulness of his
testimony doubtful.</p>

<p class="BODY">There can be no question that the value of testimony is estimated
by <span style="">the degree </span>of persuasion that
it produces in the mind of the court who is called upon to determine its
effect, and to render a verdict accordingly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The rule in all criminal cases is that the court must be <span style="">persuaded of the </span>truth of the charge
made <span style="">against the </span>accused beyond <span style="">reasonable doubt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the basis of the
foregoing facts, I am not </span>satisfied that the guilt of the <span style="">accused has been </span>established beyond
reasonable doubt.</p>
