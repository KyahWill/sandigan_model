				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>
appellant <span class="SpellE">Openiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pajenado</span>
was charged with murder (Criminal <span style="">Case </span>No.
3492, now G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-27680) and with illegal possession of <span style="">a firearm </span>(Criminal
Case No. 3558, now G. R. No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-27681).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon arraignment he pleaded not guilty <span style="">in both </span>cases,
and after a joint trial thereof he was convicted and <span class="GramE">sentenced</span>
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Wherefore,<span style=""> in</span> view of the foregoing con<span style="">siderations,
the Court finds the accused <span class="SpellE">Openiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pajenado</span> alias <span class="SpellE">Peming</span>, guilty
beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder and he is hereby condemned to
suffer the penalty of Reclusion <span class="SpellE">Perpetua</span>, to
indemnify the heirs </span><span style="">of Carlos <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span> in the amount of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
and to pay the </span><span style="">cost of suit.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The same accused <span class="SpellE">Openiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pajenado</span> is likewise guilty beyond reasonable doubt of
illegal possession of firearm and is hereby sentenced to <span class="GramE">suffer
imprisonment</span> of not less than One (1) year <span style="">nor </span>more than Five (5) years end to pay the cost of suit."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The facts established conclusively by the evidence are the
following:</p>

<p class="BODY">At about 12:00 <span style="">o'clock
noon on </span>December <span style="">31, </span>1965
while prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Epifanio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabe</span> was walking along one of the streets of barrio <span class="SpellE">Dapdap</span>, municipality of Las <span class="SpellE">Navas</span>,
North <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, and arrived in front of the house of one
Pablo <span class="SpellE">Jazmines</span>, he saw appellant holding the now
deceased Carlos <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span> by the neck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the two were apparently wrestling with
each other, <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> <span class="SpellE">Pajenado</span>,
appellant's cousin, intervened and <span style="">the </span>two
<span class="SpellE">Pajenados</span> were able <span style="">to throw </span><span class="SpellE">Tapong</span> to the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> <span class="SpellE">Pajenado</span> held <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span> by the
shoulder and pinned him down to the ground, while appellant held him by one
leg.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As they thus held Carlos <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span> help­less, appellant drew his gun and fired at
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pajenado</span> stood up and run away, while appellant
remained at the scene of the crime <span style="">with
</span>his drawn gun until <span style="">a </span>policeman,
another <span class="SpellE">Pajenado</span> (Ernesto), arrived and took the
firearm from him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Carlos <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span>, mortally wounded, was thereafter carried home by
his father and other relatives.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another prosecution witness, <span class="SpellE">Pelagia</span> <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span>, testified that <span style="">at noon on the </span>day in question, while she was at the window of
the house of her elder brother, Angel, along <span style="">the street </span>where the incident took place, she saw appellant
standing on the street; that when Carlos <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span>
appeared, appellant immediately met him and held him by the neck; that
thereafter <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> <span class="SpellE">Pajenado</span>
intervened and with his help appellant was able to fell Carlos to the ground.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not denied that Carlos <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span>
died as a result of the gun-shot wound inflicted upon him on that
occasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Testifying on the nature
thereof, Dr. An<span style="">gel </span>Tan, municipal
health officer of Las <span class="SpellE">Navas</span>, said that he conducted a
post mortem examination of the cadaver on <st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1966</st1:date> and <span style="">found
that the deceased sustained three gun-shot wounds which, in his opinion, were
caused by a single shot from a .45 caliber pistol.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The wounds are described by him </span>in his
autopsy report, Exhibits A, A-1 and A-2 as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Gun shot wound with entrance at the <span class="SpellE">postero</span>-medial
portion of the distal third of the thigh making an exit at its upper <span class="SpellE">promixmal</span> third in the <span class="SpellE">antero</span>-lateral
mar­gin, making another entrance at the right <span class="SpellE">hypogastric</span>
region, penetrating the abdo­minal cavity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Perforating the intestines, penetrating the left dome
of the diaphragm to enter the left thoracic cavity."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Tan also testified that considering the <span style="">presence </span>of powder burns in the body
of the deceased, he <span style="">must have </span>been
shot at a distance of less than one meter, <span style="">and that </span>the cause of his death was shock due to external and <span style="">in</span>ternal hemorrhage.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues raised in the assignments of error made in appellant's
brief call for the resolution <span style="">of:
firstly, </span>the question of whether appellant should be <span style="">convicted only </span>of homicide instead of
murder, and whether, upon the evidence of record, he should also be found
guilty of the crime of illegal possession of a firearm.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General agrees with appellant's view that the
latter should be convicted merely of homicide committed with one aggravating
circumstance not offset by any mitigating circumstance, because the qualifying
circumstances of evident premeditation and treachery alleged in the infor­mation
have not been proved.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We disagree.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Pelagia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tapong</span> clearly shows that, for sometime before the
incident, appellant had been waiting for Carlos <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span>
to appear, and that as soon as the latter showed up and arrived in front of the
house of Pablo <span class="SpellE">Jazmines</span>, appellant met him and held
him by the neck; that thereafter his cousin <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span>
helped him throw their victim to the ground.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This, <span class="GramE">We</span> believe, is sufficient evidence of
premeditation.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree, however, that treachery was not proved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the aggravating
circumstance of abuse of superior strength, admitted by appellant's counsel (p.
<span style="">8, </span>appellant's brief), must be
considered in the imposition of the corresponding penalty.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the question of
whether or </span><span style="">not appellant should </span><span style="">also </span>be
convicted of the crime of illegal possession <span style="">of a firearm, </span><span class="GramE"><span style="">We</span></span><span style=""> </span>agree
with both appellant's counsel and <span style="">the </span><span style="">Solicitor
</span>General that the appealed <span style="">decision
should be reversed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It </span>is true that
People vs. <span class="SpellE">Lubo</span>, 101 Phil. 179 <span style="">and </span>People
vs. Ramos, <span style="">8 </span>SCRA 758 could be
invoked to <span style="">support </span>the view that
it is incumbent upon a person<span style=""> charged
with illegal possession of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">firearm to prove the issuance to him of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">license to possess the firearm, but We are of the considered opinion
that under the provisions of Section 2, Rule 131 of the Rules of Court which
provide that in criminal cases the burden of proof as to the offense charged
lies on the prosecution and that a negative fact alleged by the prosecution
must be proven if "it is an essential ingredient of the offense
charged", the burden of proof was with the pro­secution in this case to
prove that the firearm used by appellant in committing the offense charged was
not properly licensed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It can not be denied that the lack or absence of a license is an
essential ingredient of the offense of illegal possession of a firearm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The information filed against appellant in
Criminal Case No. 3558 of the lower court (now G.R. No. 27681) specifically
alleged that he had no "license or permit to possess" the .45 caliber
pistol mentioned therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus it seems
clear that it was the prosecution's duty <span style="">not
merely </span>to allege that negative fact but to prove it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This view is supported by similar adjudicated
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In U.S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Tria</span>,
17 Phil. 303, the accused was charged with having criminally inscribed himself
as a voter knowing that he had none of the qualifications required to be <span style="">a </span>voter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was there held that the negative fact of
lack of qualification to be a voter was an essential element of the crime
charged <span style="">and </span>should be proved by
the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In another case (People
vs. <span class="SpellE">Quebral</span>, 68 Phil. 564) where the accused was
charged with illegal practice of medicine because he had diagnosed, treated and
prescribed for certain diseases suffered by certain patients from whom he
received monetary compensation, without having previously obtained the proper
certificate of registration from the Board of Medical Examiners, as provided in
Section 770 of the Administrative Code, this Court held that if the subject of
the negative averment like, for instance, the act of voting without the
qualifications provided by law is an essential ingredient of the offense
charged, <span style="">the pro­</span>secution has
the burden of proving the same, although <span style="">in </span>view of the difficulty of proving a negative allegati<span style="">on, </span>the prosecution, under such
circumstance, need only establish a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> case from the
best evidence obtainable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case
before Us, both appellant and the Solicitor General agree that there was not
even <span style="">a </span>prima facie case upon
which to hold appellant <span style="">guilty of </span>the
illegal possession of a firearm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Former
Chief Justice Moran upholds this view as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The mere fact that the adverse party has the control of the
better means of proof of the fact alleged, should not relieve the party making
the averment of the burden of proving it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is so, because a party who alleges a fact must be assumed to have
acquired some knowledge thereof, otherwise he could not have alleged it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A familiar instance of this is the case of a
person prosecuted for doing an act or carrying on a business, such as, the sale
of liquor without a license.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How could
the prosecution aver the want of a license if it had acquired no knowledge of
that fact?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, although proof
of the existence or non-existence of such license can, with more facility, be
adduced by the defendant, it <span style="">is, </span>nevertheless,
incumbent upon the party alleging the want of the license to prove the
allegation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Naturally, as the subject
matter of the averment is one which lies peculiarly within the control or
knowledge of the accused <i>prima facie</i> evidence thereof on the part of the
prosecution shall suffice to cast the onus upon him." <span class="GramE">(6
Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, 1963 edition, p. <span style="">8.)</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant is found
guilty of murder, with the aggravating circumstance of use of superior
strength, without any mitigating circumstance to offset the same, but for lack
of the required number of votes to impose the corresponding penalty in its
maximum degree, <span class="GramE"><span style="">We</span></span><span style=""> </span>only affirm the penalty of <i>reclusion</i>
<span class="SpellE"><i>perpetua</i></span> imposed upon him by the trial
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">However, the indemnity appellant must pay the heirs </span>of Carlos <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span> is increased to P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appealed decision
is reversed and set aside in so far as it finds appellant guilty of illegal
possession <span style="">of a firearm, with the
result that he is hereby </span><span style="">acquitted </span><span style="">of said charge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Modified as above indicated, the appealed <span style="">decision </span>is affirmed in all other respects, with costs.</p>
