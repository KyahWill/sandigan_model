Court of Olongapo by Zenaida Soriano against Urbano Reyes, said court, <span class="GramE">on</span> <st1:date year="1968" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1968</st1:date>
rendered judg­ment as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"It is therefore the judgment of this Court that defendant,
from September, 1965 has been un­lawfully withholding possession of the
property in question and he is hereby ordered to vacate the premises in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant is also hereby
ordered to pay to the plaintiff the total amount of THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED
(P3,100.00) Pesos, representing the unpaid rentals for the use and occupancy <span style="">of </span>the property in question <u><span style="">at P100.00, </span></u><u><span style="">from September 1965 to the present with
interest </span>at </u><u><span style="">12% per annum
until fully paid</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It is further ordered <u>that
defendant pay to the plaintiff the amount </u><u><span style="">of ONE THOUSAND (P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>) PESOS </span>as
moral </u><u><span style="">and exemplary damages</span></u><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It appears that when the defendant <u>was placed in the
possession</u><u><span style=""> of prem</span></u><u><span style="">ises in question</span></u><span style=""> by virtue of the <u>lease aforementioned</u>,
he introduced improvements on the existing structures converting the same into
an automotive repair shop and garage and later used a part of the build</span><span style="">ing, after a few <span class="GramE">renovation</span>,
as his place </span><span style="">of residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>As it </u></span><u><span style="">appears that he did </span></u><u><span style="">so</span></u><u><span style="">,</span></u><u><span style=""> in good faith,
he may remove so much thereof as may be</span></u><u><span style=""> </span></u><u><span style="">removed </span></u><u><span style="">without </span></u><u><span style="">damage to the premises in question</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">The plaintiff, at her option, may retain such improvements by <u>refunding
to the defendant the amount of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span></u> which
this court deems to be the reasonable value of defendant's improvements.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"This decision is rendered without pro­nouncement as to <span style="">costs." </span>(<span class="GramE">underscoring</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On appeal in the Court of
First Instance of Zambales, where the case was docketed as Civil Case No.
361-0, </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">plaintiff filed a motion for the immediate
execution of the judgment of the City Court of Olongapo by reason of the
failure of the defendant to file the required supersedeas bond and </span><span style="">to deposit the monthly </span><span style="">rentals that fell due after the rendition of
the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1968" day="31" month="7"><span style="">July 31,
 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">, said court
granted the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His motion for a
reconsideration of said order of July 31, </span>1968 <span style="">having been denied, Urbano Reyes filed an action for certiorari and
prohibition in the Court of Appeals (C.A-G.R No. 42026-R) to nullify said order
and to prevent the execution of the judgment of the City Court of Olongapo,
claiming </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">the Court of First Instance of Zambales
gravely abused its discretion and exceeded its </span>ju­<span style="">risdiction in </span><span style="">ordering the execution thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1969" day="26" month="7"><span style="">July 26,
 1969</span></st1:date><span style=""> the Court of
Appeals rendered </span><span style="">judgment </span><span style="">upholding the validity of the order of </span><st1:date year="1968" day="31" month="7"><span style="">July 31,
 1968</span></st1:date><span style=""> issued by the
Court of First Instance of Zambales except in so far as it ordered payment by
the petitioner to respondent Ze­naida Soriano of moral and exemplary damages in
the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This decision was modified by the Court of Appeals </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">its resolution of </span><st1:date year="1969" day="25" month="9"><span style="">September 25, 1969</span></st1:date><span style="">, the dispositive part of which reads as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the decision of this Court dated <st1:date year="1969" day="26" month="7">July 26, 1969</st1:date>, upholding the validity
of the order of the respondent court dated <st1:date year="1968" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1968</st1:date>, directing the execution of <span style="">the judgment dated </span><st1:date year="1968" day="30" month="4"><span style="">April
 30, 1968</span></st1:date><span style=""> of the City
Court of Olongapo in Civil Case No. 567 is hereby reiterated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, insofar as it includes execution for
the payment of moral damages in the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
and another P1,000.00 as reimbursement to petitioners for the total value of
the improvement introduced by the deceased Urbano Reyes, the decision is hereby
modified so as to eliminate these two items.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"As to the question of reimbursement of the value of the
improvements introduced by the deceased petitioner, to be made by res­pondent
Zenaida Soriano in favor of the substi­tuted petitioners, the same shall be
disposed of by the respondent court conformably to law upon deciding the appealed
case on its merits."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Having failed to secure reconsideration of the reso­lution of the
Court of Appeals last mentioned, petitioners, on October 17, 1969, filed
"a petition for review on certiorari by way of an appeal" of the
resolutions of the Court of Appeals in C.A-G.R No. 42026-R of September 25,
1969 and of August 25 of the same year, claiming that, <span style="">not </span>having authority to modify and amend the judgment rendered
by the City Court of Olongapo mentioned heretofore, in the action for
certiorari and prohibition before it, the Court of Appeals committed a grave
abuse of discretion or ex­ceeded its jurisdiction in issuing the resolutions
appealed from.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon consideration of the allegations made in the basic petition,
this Court, on <st1:date year="1969" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1969</st1:date>,
found the same to be without merit and, as a consequence, "resolved to
deny it".</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 12, 1969 petitioners filed a motion for
reconsideration claiming, in substance, that upon the facts alleged in their
petition, it was clear that the Court of Appeals, in the action for certiorari
and prohibition before it (C.A-G.R No. 42026-R), had no authority to consider
the merits of the detainer case initiated in the City Court of Olongapo, much
less to amend the decision rendered by said <span style="">court which was </span>still <span style="">on
appeal in </span><span style="">the Court of First </span><span style="">Instance of Zambales, and that, therefore,
the reso­lutions sought to be annulled were void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon this premise they prayed that their
appeal be given due course.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is to be observed that
the dispositive portion of the resolution of September 25, 1969 quoted above
refers to two different items, namely:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the </span>P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> <span style="">awarded by the City Court of Olongapo as moral and exemplary damages,
and the </span>P1,000.00 <span style="">awarded as re­imbursement
to petitioners for the total value of the improvements introduced by the
deceased Urbano Reyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Court of Appeals, in its decision promulgated on
July 26, 1969, declared the award of moral and exemplary damages null and void
and, conse­quently, ruled that 'this amount should not be included in the writ
of execution", for the simple reason that the City Court of Olongapo had
exceeded its jurisdiction in awarding such damages which do not fall within the
meaning and purview of those mentioned in Section 6, <span style="">Rule 70 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This ruling - </span>reaffirmed in the same court's resolution of
September 25, 1969 - is correct, and, as the case before it was an action for
certiorari and prohibition seeking to annul the order of July 31, 1968 issued
by the Court of First Instance of Zambales <span style="">ordering </span>the execution pending appeal of the decision rendered
by the City Court of Olongapo in Civil Case No. 567 (for unlawful detainer), it
seems clear that <span style="">the Court of Appeals
acted within its jurisdiction in declaring void the aforementioned portion of the
decision </span>of the latter court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the </span>other
hand, the resolution of the respondent Court of Appeals of September 25, 1969
clearly provides that the item of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as
reimbursement "shall be dis­posed of by the respondent court conformably
to law upon deciding the appealed case on its merits", and, as a result,
declared that the item aforesaid should also be eli­<span style="">minated from the </span><span style="">execution
</span><span style="">of judgment ordered by the Court
</span>of First Instance of <span style="">Zambales.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With this </span><span class="GramE"><span style="">We</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">also agree.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, <span style="">the motion for reconsideration filed by petitioners is hereby denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
