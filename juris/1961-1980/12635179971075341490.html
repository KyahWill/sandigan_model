<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1916" day="26" month="7">July 26, 1916</st1:date>,
upon a homestead patent, Original Certificate of Title No. R-827 was issued in
the name of Carolina <span class="SpellE">Aggasid</span> covering a parcel of
land in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Cuccub</span>, Solano, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1925" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1925</st1:date>,
Carolina <span class="SpellE">Agga­sid</span> sold one-half <u><span style="">pro</span></u><span style="">-<span class="SpellE"><u>indiviso</u></span></span> portion of the land
to Tomas Marcos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That sale was recorded
at the back of Carolina <span class="SpellE">Aggasid's</span> O.C.T. No. R-827.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the cadastral proceedings, that land was broken into two:
Lot No. 984 and Lot No. 985.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Carolina <span class="SpellE">Aggasid</span> claimed <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
984.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court, on <st1:date year="1932" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1932</st1:date>, ordered the registration of said lot

of Original Certificate of Title No. R-827.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1952" day="23" month="5">May 23, 1952</st1:date>,
Victoria <span class="SpellE">Paculla</span>, sole heir of Carolina <span class="SpellE">Aggasid</span>, in an 'Affidavit of Extrajudicial Settlement',

the said portion she adjudicated to herself.<span style="">&nbsp;

the spouses Alberto <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> and Rosita <span class="SpellE">Rolluda</span> sold the same portion of land to Teresa <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, married to <span class="SpellE">Ubaldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 985 was listed in a cadastral case
different from that which covered <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 984.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No claim thereto was filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it was declared public land.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"One Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Agsunod</span> obtained a
homestead patent thereto - Lot 985 - and was issued Original Certificate of

<p class="2Q">'SO ORDERED.'</p>

<p class="2Q">"Defendants appealed."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the basis of these
facts, the Court of Appeals rendered the following judgment:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Lot No. 985 was part of a homestead previously placed under
the operation of the <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the sub­sequent adjudication of
said lot in the cadastral proceedings is null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Title No. 420 and Title No. <span style="">3788 </span>issued in lieu thereof,
accordingly, must be cancel­led; defendants acquired nothing thereby.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Normally, an appellate court does not give relief to <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of
course, this is understood as against the appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reason <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> is
that a party who does not appeal must be deemed, for legal pur­poses, to have
remained satisfied with the decision below.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"But the situation here involved stands upon a different
plane.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appellees</span>
them­selves have asked this Court in their brief that, for purposes of
rectifying an obvious error in the decision, the 1/2 share of Lot 985 be
adjudicated - <u>not</u> to the spouses Alberto <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>
and Rosita <span class="SpellE">Rolluda</span>, as was done below - but to the
other plaintiffs Teresa <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ubaldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>, the real owners
entitled to the possession thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Peace of mind amongst them must have com­pelled <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
to do so.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Not that <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> are without
reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The recorded evidence, the deed
of sale, Exhibit C, as to which <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> are agreed,
establishes the fact that the other half <sup>_</sup> i.e., the western half <sup>_</sup>
of Lot 985 (after deducting the half sold to Marcos) had al­ready been sold by
plaintiffs spouses Alberto <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> and Rosita <span class="SpellE">Rolluda</span> to their co-plaintiffs Teresa <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Ubaldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Accordingly, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part
of the decision is hereby amended by (1) declaring that plaintiffs <span class="SpellE">Ubaldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> and Teresa <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> are the owners with right to possess the one-half
(1/2) portion of Lot No. 985 of the <span class="SpellE">Bayombong</span>
Cadastre aforesaid, and (2) ordering defendants Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Acedo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Esmeña</span> <span class="SpellE">Ambros</span> to
surrender to said plaintiff and the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> the
possession of the <span style="">entire Lot No. 985.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Modified as just indicated, the judg­ment appealed from is
hereby affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against
appellants."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration of this decision was filed on the
following grounds:</p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the decision is not
only not supported by the facts and evidence of record, but also that it is
contrary to such facts and evidence; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the decision is not
only not in consonance with, but also con­trary to, law and jurisprudence on
the matter, particularly, the protection of the rights of an innocent purchaser
for value, which is the case of the defend­ants-appellants."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">but
said motion was denied, hence this appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners claim that:</p>

<blockquote>“I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals
erred in not finding that notwithstanding her free patent certificate of title,
Exhibit A, Carolina <span class="SpellE">Aggasid</span> could not be deemed as to
have been the owner of that portion embraced in said free patent certificate of
title, which, during the cadastral survey, was designated as Lot No. 985,
because she has never claimed, nor pos­sessed, nor occupied, the same, either
by herself or through her predecessors in interest, since July 4, 1907, or
prior thereto, or even at anytime there­after;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“II.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals
erred in not finding that Carolina <span class="SpellE">Aggasid</span>, by her
inaction and neglect for a period of 23 years, was guilty of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>“III.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals
erred in not finding that the petitioners herein, Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Acedo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Esmeña</span> <span class="SpellE">Ambros</span>, are
innocent purchasers for value and in good faith, and their rights as such
should be protected."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">None of these assigned errors can be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is a clear case of a second <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place>
title hav­ing been issued covering a land already previously regis­tered, being
part of a duly registered bigger land. It is undisputed that Transfer
Certificate of Title No. 3788 in the name of herein petitioners was derived
from Origi­nal Certificate of Title No. 420 in the name of their pre­decessor-in-interest
Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Agsunod</span> who, in turn, ac­quired her title by
virtue of a homestead patent obtained by her on January 28, 1932, and it is
admitted that at that time, the land covered by said patent had already been
registered, as part of a bigger registered parcel, as early as July 26, 1916 in
the name of Carolina <span class="SpellE">Aggasid</span> from whom private
respondents herein have either succes­sively or separately secured their
respective interests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that
Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Agsunod</span> was able to obtain her homestead
patent in 1932 because the land in question was declared public in a cadastral
proceeding in which the holder of the first title did not file any opposition
does not improve in any manner the position of petition­ers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With or without such opposition, the
cadastral court had absolutely no jurisdiction to declare as pub­lic <span class="SpellE">Aggasid's</span> land which had been previously registered already
under the Torrens System.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not
only a de­finitely settled question in this Court,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
it is indeed good<span style=""> </span>law; it is a
direct consequence of the indefeasibi­lity of a <span class="SpellE">torrens</span>
title.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners contend that the earlier title of Ca­rolina <span class="SpellE">Aggasid</span> was void inasmuch as she had no right to <span style="">any </span>homestead patent, it having been
proven at the trial, <span style="">and the trial
court </span>so <span style="">held, that neither <span class="SpellE">Aggasid</span> nor anyone on </span>her behalf has possessed the
land in dispute since earlier than 1907.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To begin with, the decision of the Court of Appeals now before Us
contains no such finding and <span style="">We </span>are without authority to base Our <span style="">decision hereof directly on </span>findings of fact of the trial court
this case having been appealed on issues of fact and law to the said appellate
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even assuming, however, that what
petitioners claim is true, that is, that nei­ther <span class="SpellE">Aggasid</span>
nor any of her successors-in-interest had ever possessed the land here in
dispute, the very case cited by them that of <span class="SpellE">Zarate</span>
v. Director of Lands, 34 Phil. 418, is clear authority for Us to overrule their
contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As quoted in their brief, <span style="">We </span>held
therein that "if, within the (that) period of one year from that date, the
adverse claimant does not seek to con­test on the ground of fraud the right of
the patentee, he is forever barred from questioning the rights of the patentee,
as the title issued by virtue of the patent duly registered shall then have
acquired all the charac­teristics that determine the finality and
indefeasibility of a Torrens title". Incidentally, this doctrine cannot
apply to private respondents in so far as the homestead patent of <span class="SpellE">Agsunod</span> <span style="">is </span>concerned for the simple reason that said patent is null and
void, the land covered by it having been previously registered already as
private land in the name of <span class="SpellE">Aggasid</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither is petitioners' pose that they are purcha­sers in good
faith tenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true they bought
the land in reliance of Original Certificate of Title No. 420 of Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Agsunod</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may also
be true they part­ed with valuable consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sad fact, however, is that the said
Torrens title of <span class="SpellE">Agsunod</span> is null and void and such
nullity, it is settled, affects even <u>bona fide</u> purchasers for
value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Saleeby</span>, 31 Phil. 590, this Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"We have laid the rule that where two certificates of title
are issued to different persons covering the same land in whole or in part, the
earlier in date must prevail as bet­ween original parties and in case of
successive registrations where more than one certificate is issued over the
land, the person holding under the prior certificate is entitled to the land as
against the person who rely on the second certificate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purchaser from the owner of the lat­ter
certificate and his successors, should resort to his vendor for red­ress,
rather than molest the holder of the first certificate and his suc­cessors, who
should be permitted to rest secure in their title."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">This doctrine has been followed in
subsequent cases<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and We see no reason at all for Us to change it now.</p>

<p class="BODY">As they did in their answer in the trial court, as well as in
their brief in the Court of Appeals, petition­ers are raising here again the
issue of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We note, however, that <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of the fact
that the Court of Appeals did not pass on the said issue, in their motion for
reconsideration in that court, petitioners seemingly abandoned the same, since
no mention of it was made there­in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
already stated earlier, the only points pressed upon in said motion were: (1)
that the earlier title and even the homestead patent of <span class="SpellE">Aggasid</span>
were void for lack of the requisite actual possession of the land in ques­tion;
and (2) that petitioners are <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> purchasers for value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, We do not feel We can rule on the
said issue in this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, We do not believe that the precedent in the cited
case of Lucas v. <span class="SpellE">Gamponia</span>, 100 Phil. 277, nor the
later case of Miguel v. <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span>, 26 SCRA 234,
wherein Mr. Justice J.B.L. Reyes reiterated and further elucidated on the
doctrine in <span class="SpellE">Gamponia</span>, may be applied to private
respondents in the present case. There is one vital point of difference between
the situation of the private respondents here, on the one hand, and the defend­ants
in the two mentioned cases, on the other.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In those cases, the defendants, either by themselves or their
predecessors-in-interest, had acquired the lands therein disputed from the
original title holders, and although such acquisitions were found to be defective
and legally unenforceable, the said title holders allowed the said defendants
to take possession of and continue possess­ing the said lands and otherwise
perform other acts of dominion in regard thereto, without questioning their
right to do so for unusually extended periods of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in the <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span>
case, <span class="SpellE">Bacaquio</span>, the original own­er of the land in
controversy sold the same to <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Agyapao</span>, father and <span class="SpellE">successional</span>
predecessor-in-interest of plaintiffs, but said sale which took place in 1928
was technically invalid for lack of approval by the Governor-General which
under the law then in force was indispensable for such transactions of non-<span class="SpellE">christians</span>. <span class="SpellE">Inspite</span> of said
invalidity, however, the vendee was al­lowed by the vendor to take possession
of and enjoy the property from 1928 to 1943 and even the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Bacaquio</span>, the plaintiffs, did not disturb the buyer nor his
successors-in-interest, the defendants, nor was the own­ership of said
defendants or their predecessor-in?<span style="">interest
ever questioned before 1962, or for a period of practically thirty-five
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these facts, this Court
held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Since the 1928 sale is technically invalid, <span class="SpellE">Bacaquio</span> remained, in law, the owner of the land until his
death in 1943, when his title passed on, by the law on succession, to his
heirs, the plaintiffs-appellants.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Notwithstanding the errors afore­mentioned in the appealed
decision, we are of the opinion that the judgment in favor of defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Floren­do</span> <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> must be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For <u>despite the invalidity of his sale to <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Agyapao</span>, father of defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
the vendor <span class="SpellE">Bacaquio</span> suffered the latter to enter,
possess and enjoy the land in question without protest, from 1928 to 1943, when
the seller died; and the appellants, in turn, while suc­ceeding the deceased,
also remained in­active, without taking an</u><u><span style="">y</span> </u><u><span style="">step to </span>vindicate
the lot from 1944 to 1962, </u>when <u>the present suit was</u> <u>commenced in
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even granting appellants' pro­position
that no prescription lies against their father's recorded title, their
passivity and inaction for more </u><u><span style="">th</span></u><u><span style="">an 34 years (1928-19</span></u><u><span style="">62) justifies</span></u><u><span style=""> </span></u><u><span style="">the defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> in setting up the
equitable defense of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> in his own behalf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result, the action of
plaintiffs-appellants must be consider­ed barred and the court </span></u><u><span style="">below correctly </span></u><u><span style="">so held.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Courts can not look with fa­vor at parties who, by their silence, delay

<p class="BODY">Similarly, in the case of <span class="SpellE">Gamponia</span>, the
original landowner Domingo Mejia, shortly after the issuance of the Free Patent
No. 3699 to his land on <st1:date year="1916" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1916</st1:date>,
sold the same to one <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> <span class="SpellE">Ciscar</span>
- in violation of Section 35 of the Public Land Act - on <st1:date year="1916" day="24" month="3">March 24, 1916</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Inspite</span> of the sale, the corresponding
certificate of title was issued in tae name of Domingo Mejia when the patent
referred to was registered with the Office of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span> on <st1:date year="1916" day="26" month="7">July 26, 1916</st1:date>. Notwithstanding the
invalidity of the sale, how-ever, Domingo Mejia allowed <span class="SpellE">Ciscar</span>
to take immediate possession and enjoyment of the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pedro Mejia, the brother of Domingo Mejia,
who after the latter's death, succeeded him<span style="">, </span>also did nothing to recover the land during all the time that
it was possessed and en­joyed by the original purchaser <span class="SpellE">Ciscar</span>,
as well as said vendee's successors-in-interest, <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>
Sanchez and lat­er Andres <span class="SpellE">Gamponia</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only after the above named possessors
of the property had continuously and success­ively enjoyed it for a period of
more than 37 years teat Pedro Mejia's daughter Concordia Mejia de Lucas tried
to recover possession and ownership of the land sold by Domingo Mejia relying
on the strength of the certificate of <span style="">title
</span>still in the name of Domingo Mejia.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In these circumstances, this Court ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"Upon a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances,
we are constrained to find, however, that while no legal defense to the action
lies, an equitable one lies in favor of the defendant and that is, the
equitable defense of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold that the defense of prescrip­tion or
adverse possession in dero­gation of the title of the regis­tered owner Domingo
Mejia does not lie, but that of the equitable de­fense of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.
Otherwise stated, we hold that while defendant may not be considered as having
acquired title by virtue of his and his pre­decessors' long continued
possession <span style="">for </span>37 years, <span style="">the </span>original owner's <span style="">right </span>to recover back the possession
of the property and the title there­to from the defendant has, by the long
period of 37 years and <span style="">by </span>pa­tentee's
inaction and neglect, been converted into a stale demand."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, in the case at bar, <span style="">it </span>does not appear that either <span class="SpellE">Aggasid</span>,
the original owner of <span style="">the </span>disputed
land or any of her successors-in-interest <span style="">has </span>ever conveyed to or otherwise disposed
of in favor of <span class="SpellE">Agsunod</span> or her successors-in-interest,
the herein peti­tioners, any part of the land herein involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the record of <span style="">this </span>case, the only transfer of said land that appears <span style="">is </span>that of <span class="SpellE">Aggasid</span> to Tomas Marcos, the predeces­sor-in-interest of <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>-respondents, involving one-half thereof pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly,
therefore, the theory of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> being urged by
petitioners is not based on any positive act of <span style="">the </span>respondents or their predeces­sors which could have induced
the former to believe that they would no longer claim ownership of the land in
issue as against petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere
failure of private re­spondents to file oppositions in the cadastral proceed­ings
is not inconsistent with their indefeasible rights under their registered
title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, in the cases of <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gamponia</span> wherein
this Court sanc­tioned the defense of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> even as
against the holder of a Torrens title, present always was one element, not
found in the case at bar, namely, that of "conduct on the part of
defendant or of one under whom <span style="">he </span>claims,
giving rise to the situation of which complaint is made and for which <span style="">the </span>complainant seeks <span style="">a </span>remedy."
This con­duct consisted not only of inactivity or silence, which are negative
in character, in the face of adverse posses­sion and other assertions of
ownership by the other par­ty but of the positive act of transferring title to
said other party, albeit in an illegal manner, and then doing nothing for more
than thirty years to disengage them­selves from such illegal transfer, thereby
making <span style="">the </span>transferees believe
that such illegality was being im­pliedly, if not actually, waived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if such waiver may be, in law,
ineffective by itself alone, to create any right in favor of the vendee, if the
failure of the title holder to act <span class="SpellE">contrarywise</span> for
such a long time is added to it, a situation is created which in equity rend­ers
any further attempt of the holder of the title to vindicate his rights under it
too stale to be judicially cognizable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, it may be said that in order to de­feat a <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place>
title, the <span class="SpellE">laches</span> must be such as to be somehow in
the nature of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">pais</span></u></span><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">All the foregoing notwithstanding, <span style="">We </span>do not con­sider it in order to
just affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals as is, without any
explanation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">We </span>note that in its <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion, said court not only de­clared the respondents <span class="SpellE">Ubaldo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> and Teresa <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
owners of one-half portion of <span style="">Lot </span>No.
985 of the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bayom­bong</span></span><span style=""> Cadastre but also ordered petitioners </span>to
surrender to <span style="">said respondents and the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>-respondents, </span>presumably the
successors-in-interests of Tomas Marcos, the possession of the entire Lot No.
985.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These dispositions seem to be
inconsistent with said court's own findings which in effect mean that what
remained as her one-half share of the land originally covered by Origi­nal
Certificate of Title No. R-827, after she sold the other half, pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span>, to Tomas Marcos in 1925, was Lot No. 984 which
she precisely claimed in the cadas­tral proceedings and of which she was again
declared owner by the cadastral court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, what would appear to have been sold to Tomas Marcos was
Lot 985 and, therefore, the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>-respondents
would also appear to be entitled to the whole of Lot 985, thus leaving to
plaintiffs-respondents <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
the whole of Lot 984 instead of one-half of each of the said two lots going to
the plaintiffs-respondents and the other one-half of each of them to the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>-respondents, as decided, in effect, by the
Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">To straighten out this apparent confusion, We have found it
necessary to go beyond the decision, to the re­cord on appeal and the briefs of
the parties filed with the appellate court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the decision of the trial court, an indication of the cause of the
confusion appears in the following discussion:</p>

<blockquote>"The plaintiffs claim as stated above that the parcel of land

bought from Victoria <span class="SpellE">Pacula</span> by means of <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. B and/or 5, they have sold the same to their

<blockquote>So what has been a vague identity of the
land subjected to the lien or <span class="SpellE"><u>gravamen</u></span> in
favor of Tomas Marcos as recorded, has been made clear, specific, and definite
in the decision of the Cadastral Court (Exhibit 1 and/or 6-Intervenors) as to
be Lot No. 984 and no other else.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As in the case of the plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
Alberto <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> and Rosita <span class="SpellE">Rolluda</span>,
there is no evidence of record of any claim of owner­ship or otherwise, either
by purchase or by any other means, of the <span class="SpellE">intervenors-appellees</span>

to Lot No. 984 as found and declared by the Cadastral Court (Exhi­bit 1 and/or
6-Intervenors). Consequently, the herein <span class="SpellE">intervenors-appellees</span>
do not have any interest, ownership or otherwise, to and over the eastern
one-half portion of Lot No. 985.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As has been correctly found by the trial court, 'neither the
plaintiffs <span class="SpellE">Ubaldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>
and Teresa <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, nor their predecessors-­in-interest
Alberto <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> and Rosita <span class="SpellE">Rolluda</span>,
nor Victoria <span class="SpellE">Pacula</span> and Carolina <span class="SpellE">Aggasid</span>
had ever possessed Lot No. 985, and that said Lot No. 985 had always been in
the possession of Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Agsunod</span> and later on of
the defendants Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Acedo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Esmeña</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ambros</span> up to the present' (Decision, Records, p. 29;
38-39).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the evi­dence
of records shows that Carolina <span class="SpellE">Aggasid</span>, and later on,
her daughter Victoria <span class="SpellE">Pacula</span>, then later on the
vendees, the plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> Alberto <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> and Rosita <span class="SpellE">Rolluda</span>,
and then lastly, the plaintiffs Teresa <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ubaldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>, have been in
possession successively of the western one-half portion of Lot No. 984; and
that similarly, Tomas Marcos, and later on his successors-in-interest the
herein <span class="SpellE">intervenors-appellees</span> have been in possession
successively of the eastern one-half portion of Lot No. 984<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span>only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the overt act of possession is a positive
way of assert­ing or exercising the right of ownership, then, we respectfully
submit, that Carolina <span class="SpellE">Aggasid</span>, and later on, Victoria

Marcos, then later, the <span class="SpellE">intervenors-appellees</span>
asserted and/or exercised their right of ownership of the eastern one-half
portion of Lot No. 984 only.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As we have shown above that the plain­tiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> Alberto <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> and
Ro­sita <span class="SpellE">Rolluda</span>, and the <span class="SpellE">intervenors-appellees</span>,
have no interest, ownership or otherwise, to and over Lot No. 985, the trial
court, therefore, has flagrantly committed the se­cond error assigned."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The net result <span style="">is that
whereas, the trial </span>court and the Court of Appeals, the latter impliedly,
both found that what was actually sold by <span class="SpellE">Aggasid</span> to
Tomas Marcos was one-half of Lot 984 and one-half of Lot 985, what was claimed
by <span class="SpellE">Aggasid</span> in the cadastral proceedings and actually
adju­dicated to her by the cadastral court was Lot 984, <span style="">said </span>adjudication being made subject, as stated in the above
quotation from petitioners' brief '<span class="SpellE">desde</span> <span class="SpellE">luego</span> al <span class="SpellE">gravamen</span> a favor de
Tomas Marcos, <span class="SpellE">tal</span> <span class="SpellE">como</span> <span class="SpellE">aparece</span> al <span class="SpellE">respaldo</span> de <span class="SpellE">dicho</span> <span class="SpellE">titulo</span> <span class="SpellE">debidamente</span>
<span class="SpellE">inscrito</span> en el <span class="SpellE">Registro</span> de
la <span class="SpellE">Propiedad</span> de <span class="SpellE">esta</span> <span class="SpellE">Provincia</span>" and Lot No. 985 was declared by the same
cadastral court to be land of the public domain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the cadastral court found
that what <span class="SpellE">Aggasid</span> sold to Tomas Marcos was only a
portion, if one-half, of Lot No. 984.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the findings of the trial court as to the parts of the lands
here in question actually posses­sed respectively by the petitioners and
respondents, would seem to support such conclusion.</p>

<p class="BODY">All these are, however, out of the question here. <span style="">We </span>have no
authority to modify the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals; much less may
we refer for any hold­ing on any argument or statement of fact of petitioners
in their brief filed with said court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
have brought out these matters only to explain and clarify the apparent
confusion arising from what appear to be inconsistent por­tions of the decision
of the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, in
their brief, filed with this Court, petitioners ex­pressly admit that in the
cadastral survey, the land co­vered by the free patent certificate of title <span style="">No. </span>R-827 "was broken ... into
two lots, namely Lot 984 and Lot 985".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With this admission, it <span style="">is </span>of
no consequence to pe­titioners how the lands herein involved are divided bet­ween
respondents-plaintiffs and respondents-<span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>,
there being no controversy as between them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As far <span style="">as
</span>petitioners are concerned, since We are holding that the original patent
title of <span class="SpellE">Aggasid</span> must prevail over the later patent
and title issued in favor of <span class="SpellE">Agsunod</span>, they have no
interest nor right of any kind on said lands; they must surrender possession,
the possession of Lot 985, as directed by the Court of Appeals, the one-half
western portion thereof to plaintiffs-respondents and the other eastern half to
the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>-respondents. How these respondents
will subsequently adjust the partition of the whole land previously covered by
Original Certificate of Title No. R-827 to reconcile with <span class="SpellE">Aggasid's</span>
claim over Lot 984 <span style="">in </span>the
cadastral court, thus implying that the portion she had sold to Tomas Marcos
was Lot 985, <span style="">is a </span>problem
exclusively for <span style="">respondents to settle
among them­selves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>As the record
before Us stands, We cannot make any specific pronouncements on the matter.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, We have no alterna­tive but
to affirm, <span style="">as </span>We do affirm, the
decision of the Court of Appeals <span style="">as is,
</span>with costs against petitioners.</p>
