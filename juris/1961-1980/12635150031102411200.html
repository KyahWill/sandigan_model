</span><st1:date year="1963" day="3" month="10"><span style="">October 3, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">
dismissed <span class="SpellE">BayIon</span>, president of the </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style="">, </span>from <span style="">his job as a foundry worker.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This dismissal caused the </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style=""> </span><span style="">to declare a strike on October 5 and to
picket the factory and offices of the Company.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <span style="">October 7 the Company
filed a petition for injunction </span>with the <span style="">respondent CPI against <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span> and the Union,
claiming </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">the strike was declared "without
previous notice," in viola­tion </span>of <span style="">the collective bargaining agreement; that the strikers have blocked and
are blocking all ingress and egress of the Company's </span>personnel,
equipment, supply, materials and other properties needed in its business
operations, resulting in the interruption <span style="">of
</span>work and business; that the strikers have resorted, and conti­nue to
resort, to threats of bodily injury not only to its employees who have <span style="">refused to join or participate in the strike,
but also </span>to <span style="">the members of their
families; that these threats and violence have prevented and discouraged the
employees and laborers from the normal performance of their duties; and that
the </span>Company stands <span style="">to suffer
substantial and irreparable injury to its rights and pro­perties by reason of
the strike and the picketing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On October 8 the
respondent CFI ordered the Union and <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span> "to
desist from blocking, obstructing and in any manner interfering with the
ingress and egress of employees, vehicles, materials, supplies, equipment, and
the general public to and from petitioner's offices, premises and factories at
304 </span>Jose <span class="SpellE">Ri­zal</span> <span style="">Street, <span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>;
to desist from illegal acts </span>of co­<span style="">ercing

petitioner, the latter's customers and the general pu­blic; </span>and to
desist from intimidating, coercing and otherwise <span style="">dis­</span>couraging petitioner's employees and laborers who desire to <span style="">re­turn to </span>work from doing so, until
further orders from the Court."</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 8 <span style="">also, the </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style=""> and <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span> filed
with the </span><span style="">CIR an </span>unfair
labor practice complaint against the Company and <span style="">its </span>general manager, charging them with dismissing <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span> from his employment "without just cause and
proper investigation" and <span style="">by
reason </span>of his union activities from 1958 to 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of this charge, a formal
complaint (case 3932-ULP) was filed against the Company and its general manager
The complainants prayed that the respondents therein be declared guilty of
unfair labor practice, and ordered to reinstate <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span>
to his former po­sition, with back wages from the time of his dismissal and all
the rights and privileges appertaining thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On October 14 the Company
in turn filed with the CIR an unfair labor practice charge against the </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style="">, its president </span><span class="SpellE">Celestino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Baylon</span>, and some 23 of its members, imputing to them <span style="">collective and individual violations of the
collective bargaining agreement. According to the formal complaint filed
against the Union, et al. (case 3941-ULP), a grievance conference was scheduled
for October 3, 1963; that at the appointed time and place, the representatives
and counsel of the Company were present but the representatives of the Union
did not appear; that without filing a notice of strike, the Union and its
president and members declared a strike on October 5 and thereafter picketed
the offices </span>and factory of the Company.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The CIR was asked (1) to declare all the respondents therein guilty of
unfair labor practice; (2) to order them to cease and desist from committing
such unfair labor practice, to bargain in good faith and to comply strictly
with the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement; and (3) to <span style="">declare </span>the strike illegal and the
individual participants therein as having lost their <span style="">s</span>tatus, rights and privileges as employees of the company.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On October 18 the Company
filed with the CFI a motion to admit an amended petition for injunction, naming
as additional respondent the FTU</span><span style="">P,
</span><span style="">as "mother and parent
union" of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">Union, stating that <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span>
is being sued in his capacity as president of the Union and as an officer of
FTUP, and alleging that <span class="SpellE">Baylon's</span> services were
terminated due to his frequent and repeated absen­ces from work, namely, 7 days
in April, 14 in May, 16 in June, and 17 in July, all in 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition to the allegations in its ori­ginal
petition, the company further alleged<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"That petitioner's business operations cons<span style="">ist </span>of the manufacture of, among other
things, sewing machines, water pumps, water heaters, pressure tanks<span style=""> </span>another appliances and equipment, from
which petitioner makes <span style="">gross </span>sales
amount­ing to P10, 000.00 per day, more or less; and by reason of the unlawful
acts of respondents herein described, petitioner has consequently been de­prived
of,<span style=""> as it is </span>continues to be
deprived, of the right and opportunity to make such sales, from October 5,
1963, and profit or net income from which petitioner shall in due time prove
and es­tablish;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That the bad faith and malice of respondents in abruptly
declaring and in abetting and instigating the walk-out or strike by
petitioner's employees, without notice and in gross, <span class="SpellE">wilful</span>,
mali­cious violation of the provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement,
as above-alleged, entitle petitioner to a recovery for special damages under
the New Civil Code; while special damages petitio­ner believes may be fixed at
P50,000;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That respondents, representing as they do to a great extent,
the labor or working force in general, have by their unlawful actuations here­in
described, created or caused to be created, the impression that labor has all
the rights, to the exclusion of management, including the right to violate with
impunity any and all formal contractual com­mitments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And for the public good, the respondents
should be consequently adjudged liable for exemplary or corrective damages of
not less than P10,000;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That respondents are liable jointly and se­verally to
petitioner for the above-mentioned items of compensatory, special and exemplary
damages, in addition to which, considering that petitioner has been compelled
to file this action due to said illegal acts of respondents, said respondents
should further be adjudged to pay P5,000, <span style="">as
</span>attorney's fees."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The Company prayed that judgment be
rendered declaring the preliminary restraining order permanent, declaring the
strike illegal with loss of employee status of all the participants, add
judging the respondents therein as having lost all their rights and privileges
under R.A. 875, and holding them <span style="">jointly
and </span>severally liable for actual damages in such sum as may be proved, <span style="">P50, 000 in special damages, P10,000 in </span>exemplary
or <span style="">corrective </span>damages, and <span style="">r 5,000 as attorney's fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <st1:place>Union</st1:place> and <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Baylon</span></span><span style="">, represented by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> B. </span><span class="SpellE">Risma</span>, on <st1:date year="1964" day="18" month="5"><span style="">May 18, 1964</span></st1:date><span style=""> filed </span>their answer to the complaint,
ad­mitting the principal allegations thereof but denying the illegal <span style="">acts imputed to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They further alleged that the strikers have
maintained absolute peace and order within the strike zone; that the Company
violated the security of tenure of employment of <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span>
with impunity by dismissing him without cause and proper investigation; and
that the Company interfered with the rights of the employees and laborers to
self-organization by threatening them if they did not return to work and </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">requiring some of them to sign blank forms stating that they were
prevented from, going to work by some of the strikers. The answering
respondents therein also deny the necessity of a restraining order since the
Company had readmitted into its employ during the last week of October, 1963
all the employees and laborers who went on strike, except <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span>
who was refused employment. As special and af­firmative defenses, they further
asserted that the respondent CFI has no jurisdiction over the subject-matter
the case in view of the pending unfair labor practice case (case 3932-ULP)
before the that no damages can be awarded to the Company because by admitting
all of the strikers, except <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span>, back to work, the
Company had thereby condoned the acts complained of:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <st1:place>Union</st1:place> and the FTUP, represented by
Atty. A. E. <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>, filed 'their answer to the amended
petition, alleging, <u>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></u>, that the
respondent <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span> has ceased to be president of <span style="">the </span><st1:place>Union</st1:place> and
an officer of the FTUP and that both unions never autho­rized the acts imputed
to <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
said unions admit that some members, "upon the instruction of respondent <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span>, walk­ed out of their jobs and picketed the premises
[of the Company but have no knowledge as to whether threats and intimidation
were employed by some employees'."</p>

<p class="BODY">Pre-trial in civil case 7863 was calendared for <st1:date year="1964" day="20" month="2">February 20, 1964</st1:date>, postponed to March
20, and finally set for August 10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
this date, the herein petitioners and their counsel failed to appear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So by order of August 10, the Company was
allowed to present its evidence before 'a senior deputy clerk of court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Atty. <span class="SpellE">Risma</span>, on August 25, moved that
he be dropped as counsel for the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> and <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span>, on the ground that he is "no <span style="">longer </span><span style="">their counsel." This motion was denied on August 31, for
"lack of proof of service upon the respondent employees associa­tion and
respondent <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span> <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1964</st1:date>
the respondent CFI rendered judgment, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WREREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered ordering the
respondents, jointly and <span style="">severally, </span>to
pay the petitioner the sum of P58, 000.00 and P7.35 as <span style="">actual </span>and comp<span style="">ensatory </span>damages,
P1,000.00 <span style="">as </span><span style="">exemplary </span><span style="">damages, </span><span style="">and P5,030.00
as attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span> <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span> as well as the

others who have participated in said strike are declared to have lost employee
status from the date of the strike for so participating in an illegal strike
and the petitioner is hereby authorized to dismiss them from their respective
positions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With costs against the
respondents."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thereafter, the FTUP,
through V.E. del Rosario &amp; Asso­ciate, filed a motion for reconsideration
of the said decision, insofar as it affects the said union, praying that it be
permitted to present its evidence to show that while it was the mother union of
the petitioner Union, it did not authorize the strike or condone the illegal
acts complained of; that the </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">FT</span><span style="">UP's</span></span><span style=""> non-appearance at the pre-trial held on
August 10, 1964 "was On account of the disaffiliation of the respondent
Regal Manufacturing Employees Asso­ciation </span>on <span style="">June 15, 1964 from the FTUP and the <span class="SpellE">disauthorization</span>
of undersigned counsel's; that <span class="SpellE">FTUP's</span> inclusion in
the case was by virtue of the fact that it was the mother union, "without,
in any manner imputing liability upon <span class="SpellE">movant</span>
Federation's; that V. E. del Rosario, as <span class="SpellE">FTUP's</span>
president, was abroad at the time the strike was declared and could not have
authorized the same; that at a ge­neral meeting of the members of the Union had
after his (del Ro­sario's) arrival from abroad, he, as president of the FTUP,
then and there <span class="SpellE">disauthorized</span> the strike and scolded
the general mem­bership "for having been unwittingly made ready tools for
a </span>few <span style="">unscrupulous local
leaders"; that this generated, and ultimately,' led to the disaffiliation
of the Union from the FTUP; that the strike was staged without the knowledge of
the executive officers of the FTUP, who, upon, being informed thereof, <span class="SpellE">disauthorized</span> the same; and that the inclusion of the FTUP
in the decision would create grave injustice and cause irreparable injury to
said union, it not having been a party to the illegal acts complained of.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Company opposed the
motion for reconsideration and moved that the same be stricken off the record,
on the ground that it is "in fact a motion for new trial and as such is
defective both </span>in <span style="">form and
substance," for the motion not Only does not point out, pursuant to
section 1 of Rule 37 of the Rules of Court, any fraud, accident, mistake or
excusable negligence which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against to
warrant a new trial but as well is not accompanied by an affidavit of merits
showing, any valid defense, </span>as <span style="">required
by section 2 of the same Rule.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">By </span>order <span style="">of November 14, the case was ordered reopened
as far as the FTUP was concerned, and was tentatively scheduled for December 14
for presentation of its </span>evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">The Company filed a motion for
reconsideration, reiterating the grounds stated in its opposition to the <span class="SpellE">FTUP's</span> motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By order of </span><st1:date year="1965" day="19" month="1"><span style="">January 19, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, the order of </span><st1:date year="1964" day="14" month="11"><span style="">November 14, 1964</span></st1:date><span style=""> was set aside and the scheduled hearing was
cancelled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style=""> and <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span>, on
their part, filed a petition for relief from judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Risma</span>,
alleged there­in that his services as counsel were availed of by them only
during the time when they were in trouble; that Atty. Pacts, upon becom­ing
counsel, moved for the issuance of an <u>alias</u> summons and filed an answer
to </span>the amended petition; that <span style="">when
his (<span class="SpellE">Risma's</span>) motion for withdrawal as counsel was
denied, the </span><u><span style="">ex</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span></span>
<span style="">hearing had al­ready been finished, and
for this, reason his clients "were not rep</span>resented <span style="">by </span>any <span style="">counsel" during the said pre-trial, due to the confusion brought
about by the change of counsel; that his failure to ap­pear at the said
hearing, which is excusable, </span>deprived his clients of their day in court;
and that <span style="">they have a very good defense
which they can prove if given a day in court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Company filed an </span>opposition
to the petition for relief <span style="">from
judgment and at the same time moved that it be stricken off the record,
alleging that it is not a proper, remedy because when the same was filed on November
12, 1964, the decision had not yet become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
as the </span><span class="SpellE">movants</span>' counsel received a <span style="">copy thereof only on October 14, 1964; that
the petition is defec­tive in form as it </span>is <span style="">not verified and is not accompanied </span>by an af­fidavit of merits;
and that <span style="">the </span>respondents and <span style="">their counsel of record are guilty of </span>inexcusable
negligence <span style="">because the manifestation of
withdrawal of the latter was made only after the</span><span style=""> Company </span><span style="">had presented
all its evidence and, therefore, the motion for withdrawal was an attempt on
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Risma's</span> part to "avoid the ef­fects of his
non-appearance at the trial of this case".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Union and <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span>, in </span>reply, <span style="">stated that, the petition for relief was properly filed a, for pursuant
to section 3 of Rule 38 of the Rules of Court, the same-was filed within 60
days from re­ceipt by their counsel of a copy of the decision; that the
petition is duly verified "because be (<span class="SpellE">Risma</span>)
was the one who did not ap­pear due to his assumption that he was
relieved" as their counsel, and that "the verification constitutes
the affidavit of merits re­</span>quired"; that the "allegation<span style=""> in the petition x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> that this Hono­</span>rable Court has no
jurisdiction in <span style="">the subject of this
proceedings, it being a labor dispu</span>te and <span style="">well within the exclusive jurisdiction of the CIR where res</span>pon<span style="">dent has filed the action" (for unfair
labor </span>practice) is a substantial defense; and that the said ULP case
"constitutes the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of another
action" which is also a va­lid and legal ground for a motion to dismiss
under section 1, sub­section (c), of Rule 16 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">By order of <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="1">January 12,
 1965</st1:date>, the petition for relief from, judgment was denied "for
lack of merit." Also denied in the same <span style="">order </span>was the Company's motion for execution of said judgment as
it had "not yet become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>."
The <st1:place>Union</st1:place> <span style="">and </span><span class="SpellE">Baylon</span> filed a motion for reconsideration, contending that
the said <span style="">order </span>"is contrary
to law" and is "unfair, unjust and discrimina­tory." By order of
February 18, this motion for reconsideration was denied "for <span style="">lack </span>of merit." On <st1:date year="1965" day="15" month="3">March 15, 1965</st1:date> the Company moved for
execution of the judgment on the ground that it "has al­ready become final
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, the respondents not having filed an
appeal to the Decision of this <st1:street><st1:address>Hon. Court</st1:address></st1:street>
and its subsequent Orders."</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence the present recourse <span style="">by
</span>the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> and <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The primary issue is whether the respondent CFI acted without or
in excess of its jurisdiction and with grave abuse of discretion in rendering
the decision and issuing the orders complained of.</p>

<p class="BODY">We note that the respondent CFI took cognizance of civil case
7863 because in its view (1) the original petition for injunction was primarily
aimed at preventing the herein petitioners who went on strike from committing
acts of violence within the strike zone, and (2) the amended petition seeks the
recovery of actual, special, exemplary or corrective damages and attorney's
fees, on account of the alleged "bad faith and malice of respondents in
abruptly declaring and in abetting and instigating the walkout or strike by
petitioner's employees, without notice and in gross, <span class="SpellE">wil­ful</span>,
malicious violation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement."</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the first reason given, it is sufficient to
-state that the respondent court correctly ruled that the matter of injunctive
relief "has become moot due to the return to work of the striking
employees."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A searching scrutiny of
the second reason given is vital to the resolution of the issue at hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The original petition for
injunction in civil case 7863 prayed that the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
issue an order restraining the strik­ers from committing and continuing to
commit the allegedly un­lawful acts imputed to them, declaring the strike
illegal, and ad­judging the strikers as having lost their employee status as
well as all their rights and privileges under LA. 875.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition, therefore, on its very face,
presented for resolution an unfair labor practice charge which falls within the
exclusive competence of the Court of Industrial Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Court of First Instance
therefore should have refused to take cognizance "of the petition and
instead dismissed it outright, as it had no ju­risdiction thereon. This is the
teaching in <span class="SpellE">Leduna</span>, et al. vs. Enriquez, et al.,
L-13965, May </span>23, <span style="">1960,
articulated in the fol­lowing words: "the Court of Industrial Relations
had, accordingly, the 'exclusive' authority to determine whether or not the
company was guilty of unfair labor practices and whether the strike called by
reason thereof was justified or not, as well as whether the em­ployees who took
part in the strike have lost their jobs in conse­quence thereof or are entitled
to retain such jobs, or if they have been dismissed, to be reinstated, 'with or
without <span class="SpellE">backpay</span>'; and that, owing to the 'exclusive'
nature of this authority of the </span><span style="">Court
</span><span style="">of Industrial Relations, its
decision thereon in proper cases, would be binding upon the ordinary courts of
justice, and would prevail over the orders and determinations of the latter on
the same matter."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The amended petition for
injunction of </span><st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="10"><span style="">October 18, 1963</span></st1:date><span style=""> can fare no better, and should suffer the
same fate as the origi­nal petition, because this amended petition reproduces <u>in</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span> all the allegations and prayers contained
in the original petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But this is not all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer to the amended petition squarely
challenged the jurisdiction of the respondent </span>CFI <span style="">over the subject-matter of the amended
petition and pointedly called the attention of the said CFI to the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> in the CIR of ULP case 3932 which was filed by the
Union and <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span> long before the promulgation of the
order of August 10, 1964 of the respondent court which allowed the Company to
present its evidence before the senior deputy clerk thereof, and much longer
before the decision of September 28, 1964, hereinbefore adverted to, was </span>rendered
by the said CFI.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The events that ensued
after the filing of the amended petition for injunction - even the declaration
in default of the </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style=""> </span>and <span class="SpellE">BayIon</span>
- could not and did not alter the picture nor invest the CFI with jurisdiction
to proceed with civil case 7863.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The res­pondent
court's actions, orders and decision issued and promul­gated in connection with
the original as well as the amended peti­tions were therefore null and void and
of no effect.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The decision of the
respondent judge of </span><st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="9"><span style="">September 28, 1964</span></st1:date><span style=""> declared the strike illegal, adjudged the
union officers and mem­bers who participated in the strike as having lost
employee status, authorized the Company to dismiss them from their respective
positions, and awarded actual, compensatory and exemplary damages and
attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the extent that the
decision de­clared the strike illegal, adjudged loss of employee status of the
strikers, and authorized their dismissal, the same is void, for the reason that
these adjudications fall within the exclusive com</span>petence of the CIR.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To elaborate, the facts
and circumstances which gave rise to the two ULP cases (3941 and 3932 filed
with the CIR are the same facts and circumstances that constitute the basis of
the ori­ginal petition as well as the amended petition for injunction with the
CFI. The acts complained of by the Company in the CFI are therefore <u>directly</u>
<u>interwoven</u> with the ULP cases filed with the CAME Box Factory Workers
Union, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span>, et al.,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> this Court, looking to National Garment
&amp; Textile Workers Union vs. <span class="SpellE">Caluag</span>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> emphasized that when the "issue
involved in the main case is interwoven with the unfair labor case pending in
the Court of Industrial Relations as to which, its jurisdiction is exclusive,
the main case does not come under the jurisdiction of the trial court </span><span style="">even </span><span style="">if </span><span style="">it </span><span style="">involves violence, intimidation and co­ercion
as averred in the complaint."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Because the strikers have
returned to work, the respon­dent CFI, in its decision of September 28, 1964,
stated that the petition for injunction "has, in effect, been converted
into one for the enforcement of a collective bargaining contract and to seek </span>redress
for a violation thereof," and therefore is within the <span style="">jurisdiction and competence of the regular
courts and not of the Court of Industrial Relations, " citing Dee <span class="SpellE">Cho</span> Lumber Workers Union-NLU vs. Dee <span class="SpellE">Cho</span>
Lumber Company, L-10080, April 30, 1957, and Philippine Sugar Institute vs.
CIR, L-13098, October 29, 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
doctrine laid down in those cases is, however, inapplicable in the case at bar
because those actions were for the enforcement of collective bargaining
contracts and involved, not unfair labor practices, but solely, the
construction and interpretation of the stipulations embodied in the agreements.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At all events, the power
of the CIR to hear and decide the ULP cases is not affected by the conclusion
reached by the res­pondent CFI that the petition for injunction seeks redress
for vio­lations of the collective bargaining agreement, for the reason that
whether or not for such violations damages are recoverable, and to what extent,
will still have to depend on the evidence to be adduced in the ULP cases
pending between the parties and their final outcome.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this Court very aptly stated in Associated
La­bor Union vs. Gomez,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">the
averment of the </span><span style="">c</span><span style="">ompany therein that it suffered damages </span><span style="">by reason of </span><span style="">the strike cannot "work to de­feat the <span class="SpellE">CIR’<span style="">s</span></span> jurisdiction" for the
right to damages "would still have to depend on the evidence in the unfair
labor practice case in the CIR," and to hold otherwise "is to
sanction split jurisdic­tion which is obnoxious to the orderly administration
of justice."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under the environmental
circumstances obtaining, the res­pondent court should have dismissed the
original petition for in­junction outright, or, later, dismissed the amended
petition for injunction, without prejudice, or, in the very least, suspended
action thereon in so far as the question of damages is concerned, </span>until
the CIR shall have finally decided the two labor disputes <span style="">pending before </span><span style="">it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">ACCORDINGLY</span></b><span style="">, the decision rendered by the respondent CFI
