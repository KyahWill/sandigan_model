the amended answer thereto, and the answer in intervention, and after trial,
the Iloilo court, at the time presided over by then Judge, now Associate
Justice, <span class="SpellE">Querube</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>,
rendered judgment, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, judgment is hereby rendered: (a)
declaring the plaintiffs-spouses Federico R. Castro and Regina <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> as owners, pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span>
of 11/15 of Lot No. 3366 of the Cadastral Survey of <span class="SpellE">Janiuay</span>
and the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> <span class="SpellE">Modesta</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Roque</span> and <span class="SpellE">Meliton</span>, together
with the defendant Primo, all surnamed Para-on, as the owners pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span> of the remainder, or 4/15 of the same land; (b)
ordering all the defendants and the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> to
pay the plaintiffs the sum of P411.00 by way of damages corresponding to the
produce for the year s 1948 to 1951 inclusive; (c) ordering the said defendants
and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> to deliver to the plaintiffs 11/15 of
the land in question, after the proper proceeding of partition, judicial or
extra-judicial; and (d) ordering the defendants and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>
to deliver to the plaintiffs 3-2/3 <span class="SpellE"><u>bultos</u></span> of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> or their equivalent value thereof at the rate of P22.
00 a <span class="SpellE">bulto</span> every year beginning 1952 until pos­session
of the plaintiffs' share of the land is finally restored to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With costs against the
defendants and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On appeal by defendants and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>,
the Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> <st1:date year="1964" day="6" month="1">January 6, 1964</st1:date>, affirmed the appealed
judgment without costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts as found by the Court of Appeals are -</p>

<blockquote>"Martina Para-on is the registered owner of a parcel of land
known as Lot No. 3366 of the Ca­dastral Survey of <span class="SpellE">Janiuay</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>, having an area of 30,913
square meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She died, single sometime
in 1939, leaving as her heirs her brother Domingo Para-on, the children of her
deceased brother <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> Para-on namely, Jesus, <span class="SpellE">Modesta</span>, <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Meliton</span>, the last three being <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>
herein, and Primo; one of the defendants herein, all surnamed Para-on, and a
niece by the name of Maria <span class="SpellE">Quintilla</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On May 20, 1939, Domingo Para-on, Jesus
Para-on and Maria <span class="SpellE">Quintilla</span>, each claiming to be the
owner of one third (1/3) of the land in question by inheritance from Martina
Para-on, executed in favor of the spouses Federico R. Castro and Regina <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>, plaintiffs herein, a deed of sale with right to
repurchase within a period of three years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon its execution, plaintiffs took possession of the land while Domingo
Para-on remained therein as their tenant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiffs paid the taxes and Domingo used to deliver to them 1/3 of the
produce.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1948 Domingo died, survived
by his children <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span>, Tomas, <span class="SpellE">Fortunata</span>,
and <span class="SpellE">Aurea</span>, all surnamed Para-on, defendants
herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Asuncion</st1:place></st1:city>,
who is one of the children of Domingo, however, was not included is party de­fendant
for reasons which the record fails to disclose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">After Domingo's death in 1948, defendants and <span class="SpellE">inter­venors</span> took possession of the land and since the
month of October of said year, refused to deliver to the plain­tiffs their
share of the produce."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="2">February 7, 1964</st1:date>,
defendants and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> - having received copy of
the foregoing judgment of the Court of Appeals on <st1:date year="1964" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1964</st1:date> - moved for a rehearing and
reconsideration, which was denied on <st1:date year="1964" day="18" month="2">February
 18, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1964</st1:date>, defendants and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> received copy of the resolution of February 18
denying their motion to reconsider.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1964</st1:date>,
in the very same case, Civil Case 1735, in which the judgment was affirmed by
the Court of Appeals as aforesaid, defendants filed in the Court of First
Instance of Iloilo a motion to repurchase the property adjudicated to
plaintiffs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They deposited with the
clerk of the <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city> court the sum
of P150.00 representing the repurchase price.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiffs opposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="13" month="8">August 13, 1964</st1:date>, the court denied the
motion to repurchase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reconsideration
was refused on <st1:date year="1964" day="26" month="9">September 26, 1964</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants plant their right of repurchase upon the third
paragraph, Article 1606 of the present Civil Code, which gives the vendor <u>a</u>
<u>retro</u> "the right to repurchase within thirty days from the time
final judgment was rendered in a civil action on the basis that the contract
was a true sale with right to repurchase." It is defendants' view that
since they sought repurchase within thirty days from the time final judgment
was rendered, they could, as heirs of Maria <span class="SpellE">Quintilla</span>,
Domingo Para-on and Jesus Para-on, repurchase the property (11/15 share)
adjudicated by final judgment to plaintiffs.</p>

<p class="BODY">For two reasons, we reject this view.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><u>First</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span><u>
de</u> <u>retro</u> sale was consummated (May 20, 1939), and when the
three-year period stipulated in the deed to repurchase expired (May 20, 1942),
the law then controlling was the Spanish Civil Code of 1889.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to Article 1509 of the said old
Code, upon a vendor's failure to repurchase, the vendee "shall irrevocably
acquire the ownership" of the property sold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ownership is consolidated in the vendee by
operation of law.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Second</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants
may-not summon to their aid Article 2253 of the Civil Code, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 2253.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Civil
Code of 1889 and other previous laws shall govern rights originating, under
said laws, from acts done or events which took place under their regime, even
though this Code may regu­late them in a different manner, or may not recognize
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But if a right should be declared
for the first time in this Code, it shall be effective at once, even though the
act or event which gives rise thereto may have been done or may have occurred
under the prior legislation, <u>provided</u> <u>said new</u> <u>right does</u> <u>not</u>
<u>prejudice</u> <u>or</u> <u>impair</u> <u>any</u> <u>vested</u> <u>or
acquired</u> <u>right</u>, <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>same</u> <u>origin</u>.”<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is correct to say that the 30-day period for repurchase
granted in Article 1606 is declared for the first time under the present
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, normally, it "shall be
effective at once." But, under the facts here obtaining, the proviso in
Article 2253 negates <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of that right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Because, the same would
prejudice or impair the vested or acquired right of plaintiffs under the old
law.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs' right of
ownership had already been consolidated in their favor prior to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the new Civil Code on <st1:date year="1950" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1950</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And, defendants not now assert any right of repurchase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the uniform juris­prudence of this
Court is that when the period of redemption expired without repurchase having
been made during the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the old Civil
Code, the vendee <u>a</u> <u>retro</u> consolidated his ownership over the
property sold by operation of law and the vendor <u>a</u> <u>retro</u> can no
longer repurchase said property upon the provisions of Article 1606 of the new
Civil Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>
