				<BR><STRONG>AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Ana F. <span class="SpellE">Retuya</span>, a widow with four minor
children, filed a claim for workmen's compensation against Eastern Shipping
Lines, Inc., the employer of her husband who died in 1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a decision dated December 4, 1970 the Work<span style="">men's </span>Compensation Unit at <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> City awarded to Ana the sum of P8,792.10
consisting of (a) P6, 000 as compen<span style="">sation
</span>benefits, (b) P2,292.10 for medical and hospitalization <span style="">expenses, </span>(c) P200 as burial expenses
and (d) <u>P300 as attorney's fees of Atty. <span class="SpellE">IÃ±ego</span> <span class="SpellE">Gorduiz</span></u> (Case No. 9728).</p>

<p class="BODY">The employer appealed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the appeal, the employer
proposed to compromise the claim by paying P4<span class="GramE">,396.05</span>
or only one-half of the total award.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ana
accepted the proposal and directed that the amount be remitted to Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> <span class="SpellE">Daclan</span> through the
Philippine National Bank's branch at <span class="SpellE">Maasin</span>, <st1:place>Southern
 <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The employer paid the reduced award on <st1:date year="1972" day="16" month="11">November <span style="">16, </span>1972</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ana
sent to the employer the receipt and release <span style="">signed </span>by her with a covering letter
dated <st1:date year="1972" day="19" month="12">December 19, 1972</st1:date>
wherein she explained that her lawyer, <span class="SpellE">Gorduiz</span>, did
not sign the joint motion to dismiss the claim because he wanted twenty percent
of the award as his attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
was <span style="">willing </span>to
give him ten percent.</p>

<p class="BODY">After she had cashed the check for P4<span class="GramE">,396.05</span>,
she <span style="">was </span>not
able to contact <span class="SpellE">Gorduiz</span> and pay his fee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, unexpectedly, in February, 1973, she
was served with a warrant of arrest issued in Criminal Case No. <span class="GramE">R-2362 of the muni<span style="">cipal </span>court of <span class="SpellE">Maasin</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>To avoid detention, she <span class="GramE">had</span>
to post bail in the sum of one thousand pesos.</p>

<p class="BODY">It turned out that on <st1:date year="1973" day="12" month="1">January
 12, 1973</st1:date> Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gorduiz</span> executed an
affidavit stating that Ana had misappropriated his attorney's fees amounting to
three hundred pesos and that he had demanded payment of the amount from her but
she re<span style="">fused </span>to
make payment and, instead, she went to <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>
and stayed there for a long time.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of that affidavit, the acting chief of police filed
against Ana a complaint for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> in the muni<span style="">cipal </span>court
of <span class="SpellE">Maasin</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After posting bail, she filed a motion <span style="">to </span>quash wherein she explained that she did not pay the <span style="">fees </span>of
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gorduiz</span> because he was demanding one-third of <span style="">the </span>award; that when she did not
accede to his demand, he lowered his claim to eight hundred pesos, and that she
bar<span style="">gained </span><span style="">for </span>six hundred fifty pesos but he
refused to accept that amount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ana
averred that the <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> case was filed <span style="">just </span>to harass her.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge Paulo A. <span class="SpellE">Equipilag</span> denied the
motion to quash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">He </span>granted the motion of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gorduiz</span>
requiring Ana to produce a copy of the decision awarding her workmen's compensation
for her husband's death.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> case was not tried.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Erasmo</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Diola</span>, as lawyer of Ana, offered to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gorduiz</span> the sum <span style="">of </span><span style="">five
</span>hundred pesos as settlement of the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The offer <span style="">was </span>accepted.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 22, 1973, the acting chief of police <span style="">filed </span>a motion to dismiss the case on
the basis of the affidavit of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gorduiz</span> executed
on that date stating that the prosecution witnesses had allegedly become
hostile and that <span style="">he was </span>no
longer interested in further prosecuting the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Also,
</span>on that same day, Judge <span class="SpellE">Equipilag</span> dismissed the
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In spite of the dismissal of the <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
case, Ana <span style="">F. </span><span class="SpellE">Retuya</span>
felt aggrieved by the proceedings therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In a complaint dated <st1:date year="1974" day="24" month="7">July 24,
 1974</st1:date> but filed in this Court on <st1:date year="1974" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1974</st1:date>, she asked for the disbarment or sus<span style="">pension </span>of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gorduiz</span>
and Judge <span class="SpellE">Equipilag</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The disbarment case against <span class="SpellE">Gorduiz</span> was
referred to the Solicitor <span style="">General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It is still
pending (Administrative Case No. 1388).</p>

<p class="BODY">The case against Judge <span class="SpellE">Equipilag</span> was
investigated <span style="">by the </span>Judge of the
Court of First Instance of Southern <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant <span class="SpellE">Retuya</span> in support of her
complaint <span style="">testified
</span>that for more than three times at the hearing in <span style="">the </span><span class="SpellE">estafa</span> case respondent judge, with
a contemptuous mien or harsh demeanor and in a loud and thunderous voice, asked
her <span style="">in a </span>sardonic tone in the
presence of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gorduiz</span>: "Are <span style="">you </span>going to pay or not?"</p>

<p class="BODY">She further testified that to settle the <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
case <span style="">she paid </span>three hundred
fifty pesos to the clerk of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Diola</span> <span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1973" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1973</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. M) <span class="GramE">and</span> the balance of one hun<span style="">dred </span>fifty pesos was delivered by her
in the municipal court <span style="">to </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Diola</span> on November 22, 1973 (when the case was dismissed) in
the presence of respondent judge and that after the delivery Atty. <span class="SpellE">Diola</span> entered the chamber of respondent <span style="">judge </span>(14, 20-21 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
<st1:date year="1975" day="26" month="6">June 26, 1975</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Ana F. <span class="SpellE">Retuya</span> testified that on August
5, 1973 she and a police sergeant wanted to deliver the five hundred pesos to
respondent judge but the latter said that he would accept the amount as a
custodian without any receipt since he had <span style="">no </span>form for the official receipt (23-24 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge in his testimony denied Ana's imputation that
during the scheduled hearings of the <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> <span class="GramE">case,</span> he sarcastically shouted at her and asked her whether
she was <span style="">going </span>to pay the fees of
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gorduiz</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The judge said that if it <span style="">were </span>true
that he shouted at Ana, then her counsel would have objected to his conduct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No such objection was inter<span style="">posed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">He recalled that on one occasion, when Ana F. <span class="SpellE">Retuya</span>
wanted to deposit with his clerk of court the fees of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gorduiz</span>,
he advised his clerk of court not to accept the deposit because he had no
authority to do so and he had <span style="">no </span>form
for the official receipt evidencing the deposit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge denied that he was present when Ana allegedly
gave five hundred pesos to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Diola</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He denied that he and <span style="">Atty. </span><span class="SpellE">Diola</span> entered his chamber after
the latter had received the sum of five hundred pesos from <span style="">her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Disciplinary action may be taken against a muni<span style="">cipal </span>judge if he has not been
performing his duties properly or if he is unfit for the office (Sec. 97,
Judiciary <span style="">Law).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The question is whether respondent
judge's handling of the <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> case constituted
malfeasance or misfeasance <span style="">in </span>office.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find that there is no conclusive evidence that he committed
any venality or grave dereliction of duty in the <span style="">disposition </span>of the <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> case.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, some credence may be given to the gripe of Ana F. <span class="SpellE">Retuya</span> that she did not receive gentle treatment from
respondent judge when, in an abrasive, if not coercive manner, he seemingly
pressured her to settle the claim of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gorduiz</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">A judge is expected to practice courtesy and civility <span style="">and </span>to avoid impropriety and the
appearance of impropriety <span style="">(Pars. </span>4,
10 and 31, Canons of Judicial Ethics, Administrative Order No. 162, 42 O. G.
1803).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is possible that respondent judge, by reason of a natural and
congenital tendency or due to tension, habitually <span style="">talks </span>in a loud voice and does not have a diplomatic manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant, <span style="">if </span>of a sensitive nature, might have
felt that she was being bullied when the respondent repeatedly <span style="">asked </span>her to compromise the case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With respect to
respondents giving due course to </span>the complaint for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>,
it may be observed that he followed the procedure for the preliminary
examination indicated in section 87 of the Judiciary Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent was not obligated to notify
the accused, Ana F. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Retuya</span></span><span class="GramE">, that</span> she was charged with <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, considering the small amount involved and the fact,
well-known to the bench and bar, that the offended parties in <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> cases usually use the court as a collection agency,
the respondent could have subpoenaed the accused and ascertained whether the
filing of the complaint was due <span style="">merely </span>to
a misunderstanding or whether she could pay the amount due to her lawyer, <span class="SpellE">Gorduiz</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">He </span>should not have <span style="">been </span>precipitate
in issuing the warrant of arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it
turned out, <span style="">the </span><span style="">respondent did not insist on trying the case
but, according to Ana's version, persisted in pressing her to make a settle</span><span style="">ment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no justification for suspending the respondent or for
imposing upon him any administrative penalty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But he is admonished to be more prudent and circumspect in the discharge
of his duties so as to obviate the suspicion that, for <span style="">an </span>ulterior motive, he is in cahoots with the offended party in <span style="">a </span>criminal case for the purpose of
using the strong arm of <span style="">the law </span>against
the accused in an oppressive and vindictive <span style="">manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>A copy of this
decision should be attached to respondent's personal record.</p>
