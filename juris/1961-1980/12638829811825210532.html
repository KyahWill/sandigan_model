				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The effort in this <i>certiorari</i> proceeding of petitioner
province of Pangasinan to locate a legal justification for a further delay in
the payment of the compensation justly due private respondents<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><i><span style=""> </span></i>for the expropriation of their
lot used for school purposes, the property having been in its possession as far
back as 1963, can hardly elicit judicial sympathy, much less approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As shown by the very petition, the complaint
for expropriation was dated July 10, 1963.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Then came on the very next day an order from the then Judge Guillermo Dacumos
fixing the provisional value of such property at P1,050.48 and authorizing the
Province to take immediate possession.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Subsequently, there was a motion to withdraw the deposit of such sum as part of
the payment due private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was dated more than three years later, on August 27, 1966.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
There was an order allowing such withdrawal two days later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the remainder of the just compensation
to which under the Constitution petitioner was entitled, it took the lower
court more than five years, December 9, 1971 to be exact, to issue an order of
that character, its dispositive portion reading: "In view of the
foregoing, the Court finds that the fair market value of the land taken to be
at P1.92 per square meter and the consequential damages to be [at] P330.00 for
the 22 coconut trees and P1,000.00 for the three mango trees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being no consequential benefits proven,
the just compensation for the 8,754 square meters taken is hereby fixed at
P18,137.68 with interest thereon at the legal rate from the date the plaintiffs
took possession of the premises of the land in question."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
That order had long since then became final and it was not until almost two
years later, on September 14, 1973, that there was a motion for its execution
to enable private respondents to receive the pay足ment awarded them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was an opposition but on October 25,
1973, the then Judge Sixto A. Domondon, who thereafter was appointed as
Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals and had since then retired, issued
this order: "Before this Court is a Motion for execution dated September
14, 1973, filed by Atty. Numeriano Tanopo, Jr., counsel for the defendants, as
well as the opposition dated September 19, 1973, filed by Asst. Prov'l. Fiscal
Oliver Cabel, and considering that the period of appeal has already expired,
without the plaintiff having perfected an appeal from the order of this Court
dated December 9, 1971; [Wherefore], the Court resolves to approve as it hereby
approves, the motion for execution of judgment; Let a writ of execution issue
accordingly."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><i><span style=""> </span></i>Considering the explicit
provision in the 1935 Constitution as in the present Charter that the right on
expropriation is conditioned on the payment of just compensation,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
it becomes difficult to understand and impossible to justify this petition for <i>certiorari</i>
by the Province filed by two Assistant Provincial Fiscals<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
and the then Provincial Attorney<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
to nullify such order on the ground that there had been no final judgment and
that the order of the then Judge Domondon "is a patent nullity." Both
the Constitution and judicial decisions warn against such cavalier disregard of
an obli足gation resting on the condemnor of property to award the just
compensation due the owners of the property expropriated.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no merit to the petition.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. There is full and ample recognition of the power of eminent
domain by Justice Street in a leading case of Visayan Refining Co. v. Camus,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
decided prior to the Commonwealth, the matter being governed by the Philippine
Autonomy Act of 1916, otherwise known as the Jones Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was characterized as "inseparable
from sovereignty being essential to the existence of the State and inherent in
govern足ment even in its most primitive forms."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Nonetheless, he was careful to point out: "In other words, the provisions
now generally found in the modern laws or constitutions of civilized countries
to the effect that private property shall not be taken for public use without
just compensation have their origin in the recognition of a necessity for restrain足ing
the sovereign and protecting the individual."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, he did emphasize: "Nevertheless it should be noted that the
whole problem of expropriation is resolvable in its ultimate analysis into a
constitutional question of due process of law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>* * * Even were there no organic or constitutional provision in force
requiring compensation to be paid, the seizure of one's property without
payment, even though intended for a public use, would undoubtedly be held to be
a taking without due process of law and a denial of the equal protection of the
laws."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
That aspect of the matter was stressed in the recent case of J. M. Tuason and
Co., Inc. v. Land Tenure Administration.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Conformably to such a fundamental
principle then, in accordance with a constitutional mandate, this Court has
never hesitated to assure that there be just compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it were otherwise, the element of
arbitrariness certainly would enter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is bad enough that an owner of a property, in the event of the exercise of this
sovereign prerogative, has no choice but to yield to such a taking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is infinitely worse if thereafter, he is
denied all these years the payment to which he <span style="">is </span>entitled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is one
of the instances where law and morals speak to the <span style="">same effect.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2. There is hyperbole in the exaggerated claim that the order of
the then Judge Domondon "is a patent nullity." It <span style="">is </span>based on a misreading of Section 13
of Rule 67 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its
first sentence reads: "The judgment entered in condemnation proceedings
shall state definitely, by an adequate description, the particular property or
interest therein condemned, and the nature of the public use or purpose for
which it is condemned." What it requires is that there be an adequate
description of the particular property condemned as well as the nature of the
public use or purpose for which it was expropriated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was made clear in the challenged order
that the subject matter of the eminent domain proceeding was the portion of the
lot situated in Barrio San Julian, Malasiqui, Pangasinan, covered by Transfer
Certificate of Title No. 16457 of the Registry of Deeds for the province of
Pangasinan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even on the assumption that
it could have been more definite, petitioner province of Pangasinan would
ignore that such a requirement was met by paragraph V of its complaint dated
July 10, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It reads thus: "That
for the best interest of public service, the plaintiff urgently needs eight
thousand seven hundred fifty-four (8,754) square meters on the southwestern
part of the land described in par. 2 hereof, to be used as a school site for
the construction of a school building for about one hundred fifty school
children in the barrios of Nalsian Norte and Nalsian Sur of the Muni足cipality
of Malasiqui, this province, as per Resolution No. 14 of the barrio councils of
said barrios and Resolution No. 54 of the Municipal Council of Malasiqui,
hereto attached as Annexes 'A' and 'B' and made integral parts of this
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A sketch plan of the land covered
by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 16467, showing the portion sought to be
expropriated which is marked <span style="">as </span>Lot
1-A is hereto attached <span style="">as </span>Annex
'C.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Under the circumstances, even on the assumption that there is an irregularity,
it cannot be considered as sufficiently grave to justify the fantastic
assertion that the order was "a patent nullity." Much less could it
justify the further unconscionable delay in the payment of the just
compensation over a parcel of land in the possession of the province of
Pangasinan for the last fourteen years and utilized for the purpose for which
it was expropriated.</p>
