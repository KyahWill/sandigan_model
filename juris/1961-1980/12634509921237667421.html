				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class=BODY>The Manila Railroad Company and the Manila Port Service have
moved to reconsider our decision dated <st1:date Year="1965" Day="29" Month="11">November
 29, 1965</st1:date>, ordering them to pay plaintiff-appellant Yu <span
class=SpellE>Kim­teng</span> Construction Corporation the sum of P7<span
class=GramE>,935.00</span> as compensatory damages and P1,000.00 as attorney's
fees and liti­gation expenses, including costs.</p>

<p class=BODY>The following grounds are alleged in support of the motion:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(1) that the Court departed from its previous
rulings upholding the validity of paragraph 15 of the manage­ment contract, to
the effect that a claim for the value of the goods damaged, undelivered or <span
class=SpellE>misdelivered</span> must be filed within 15 days from the date of
discharge of the last pack­age from the carrying vessel, as a condition
precedent be­fore the <span class=SpellE>arrastre</span> contractor may be
sued; (2) that <span class=SpellE>movants</span>' liability, if any, under the
management contract is limited to P500 for each package unless the value is
otherwise specified or manifested; (3) that the conclusion that <span
class=SpellE>appel<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold'>lent</span></span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold'> learned of the missing bars at the time when the three lifts were
delivered, is erroneous; and (4) that attorney's fees should not have been
imposed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>The following facts are not disputed:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The carrying vessel arrived in <st1:City><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:City>
on <st1:date Year="1957" Day="28" Month="5">May 28, 1957</st1:date>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The next day, <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>May </span>29, the Bureau of Customs
delivered to appellant the three delivery permits covering the shipment of
eight lifts of reinforced steel bars.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On
<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>May </span>31
the shipment was com­pletely discharged from the ship into the custody of <span
class=SpellE>ap­pellees</span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On June
16 appellant was billed by <span class=SpellE>appellee</span> Manila Port
Service for <span class=SpellE>arrastre</span> charges on the entire shipment,
in the sum of P348.48.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On June 20 the
Manila Port Service is­sued a gate pass to appellant.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the same day it delivered to appellant's
customs broker three lifts only, hence the latter filed provisional claims on
that day for the five missing lifts.</p>

<p class=BODY><span class=SpellE>Appellees</span>' principal defense is that
appellant should have filed its claim within 15 days from the date of the
complete discharge of the goods from the carrying <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:

provisional claim filed before the goods are discharged from the carrying

that such claim must be filed within 15 days from the date of discharge of the
last package.</p>

<p class=BODY>In Commercial Union Assurance Co., LTD. vs. Manila Port Service,
supra, the facts are as follows:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
shipment was completely discharged <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>on </span><st1:date
Year="1956" Day="9" Month="5"><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>May </span>9,

same on <st1:date Year="1956" Day="25" Month="5"><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
 italic'>May </span>25, 1956</st1:date>; and the consignee filed a provisional
claim for loss on the same day.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On
appeal, this Court reversed the lower court's decision and dismissed the
complaint on the ground that the <span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>claim
was one day late.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>In GSIS v. MRR the consignment was discharged into the possession
of Manila Port Service on <st1:date Year="1956" Day="22" Month="5">May 22, 1956</st1:date>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On <st1:date Year="1956" Day="12" Month="6">June
 12, 1956</st1:date>, the Manila Port Service delivered the <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>same to the consignee, and on the same day
the latter filed a formal claim for short delivery.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Manila Port Service invoked paragraph 15
of the management contract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The lower
court dismissed the complaint, and the consignee appealed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></span><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold'>(L-13276, Feb. 25, 1961) This Court through Mr. Justice <span
class=SpellE>Concepcion</span>, now Chief Justice, remanded the case so that
the evidence could be taken &quot;with a view to ascertaining whether or not
the consignee had had reasonable opportunity to comply with the disputed
condition of the management con­tract and, in the negative case, whether or
not, considering the date when it was notified of the arrival of the goods, the
consignee should be deemed to have acted with the diligence required by the
spirit and purpose of said disputed condition, in filing its claim on June 16,
1956.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>After the requisite proceedings, the lower court rendered a
decision on August 20, 1962, stating:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>(1) that no evidence was presented to show that the consignee knew or
was notified of the arrival of the goods earlier than June 2, 1956; (2) that
the Customs examiner inspected and found the entire shipment intact on June 11,
1956; (3) that <span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>the loss occurred only
after the Customs inspection on June 11, 1956 and before delivery to the
consignee's broker on June 12, 1956; (4) that it was impossible for the
consignee to file its claim within 15 days from the discharge of the shipment
by the vessel, since the loss took place only on the 20th or 21st day after
said discharge; (5) that the condition being impossible, it was deemed not
imposed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Accordingly, the Court ordered
the Manila Railroad Company and the Manila Port Ser­vice to pay the insurer of
the consignee.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Upon appeal by the
defendants (L-20342, Nov. 29, 1965) this Court, through Justice J. P. <span
class=SpellE>Bengzon</span>, said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>&quot;Appellants invoke Section 15 of the Management contract
providing for release of the <span class=SpellE>arrastre</span> operator from
liability unless a claim for the value of the goods lost is filed with it with­in
fifteen days from the date of dis­charge of the last package from the carrying
vessel.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As ruled by this Court, however,
such condition does not strictly apply in all cases.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was not so applied in Republic vs. Manila
Port Service, G.R. No. L-19115, March 31, 1964, <span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>because in said case the

<blockquote><span class=GramE>&quot;In <span class=SpellE>Chiok</span> Ho vs. <span
class=SpellE>Compañia</span> <span class=SpellE>Maritima</span>, G.R. No.</span>
L-20553, <st1:date Year="1965" Day="30" Month="4">April 30, 1965</st1:date>, we
held that what is important is the date when the shipment was actually delivered
to the consignee in order that he may be given the chance to discover if there
is something missing or lost in the shipment.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class=GramE>&quot;As early as <span class=SpellE>Consunji</span>
vs. Manila Port-Service, G.R. No.</span> L-15551, November 29, 1960, this Court
stated that it would be unfair and iniquitous to apply the 15-day proviso where
the consignee comes to know the damage or loss only after the lapse of such
15-day period, for instance, where delivery by the con­tractor <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>takes place </span>16
days after the discharge of the last package from the vessel.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;The rule to follow in such cases is that stated in Yu <span
class=SpellE>Kimteng</span> Construction vs. Manila Railroad Co., G.R. <span
class=GramE>No</span>. L-17027, <st1:date Year="1965" Day="29" Month="11">Nov.
 29, 1965</st1:date>, namely to count the 15-day period not from the discharge
of the last pack­age from the carrying vessel, but from the date the consignee
learned <u>or could have learned</u><i>, </i>of the loss, damage or <span
class=SpellE>misdelivery</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;In the case at bar, as stated, the shipment was delivered to
the consignee's broker only on June 12, 1956, after 21 days following its
discharge from the carrying vessel; the loss occurred only after the Customs
examination on June 11, 1956 but prior to the delivery to the consignee's
broker.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is clear that the consignee
learned of the loss only on <st1:date Year="1956" Day="12" Month="6">June 12,
 1956</st1:date>, when the Manila Port<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'> Service <span class=GramE>effected</span> a
delivery that was short by eleven </span>pieces.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A provisional claim was filed on <st1:date
Year="1956" Day="16" Month="6">June 16, 1956</st1:date>, well within 15 days
from such knowledge of the loss.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Such
claim, therefore, was made on time and is not barred by the provision of
Section 15 of the management contract.&quot;</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>In the case under reconsideration, the appellant promptly
expressed its desire to take delivery of the ship­ment.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It presented to the Manila Port Service the
three permits to deliver on <st1:date Year="1957" Day="3" Month="6">June 3,
 1957</st1:date>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On <st1:date
Year="1957" Day="16" Month="6">June 16, 1957</st1:date>, the Manila Port
Service billed the consignee's broker for the full shipment of eight
lifts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One of the bills, No. 54142, is
dated <st1:date Year="1957" Day="2" Month="6">June 2, 1957</st1:date>, while
the other two, Nos. 54143 and 54144, are dated <st1:date Year="1957" Day="16"
Month="6">June 16, 1957</st1:date>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
from appellant's <span class=SpellE>un­controverted</span> statement, it
appears that all three bills were presented for payment to appellant on the
same day, <st1:date Year="1957" Day="16" Month="6">June 16, 1957</st1:date>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From this fact, it is obvious that as of that
date the shipment was still intact.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Otherwise the Manila Port Service would not have billed the consignee
for the <span class=SpellE>arrastre</span> charges thereon.</p>

<p class=BODY>Since the loss must have occurred after the lapse of fifteen days
from date of discharge from the carrying vessel, the consignee could not have
filed a claim during that period.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
could file a claim only after the loss oc­curred, and this it did within
fifteen days thereafter.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Appellant did
all it could and was expected to do under the terms of the management contract.</p>

<p class=BODY>The next question refers to the amount of damages that should be
paid to appellant.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Appellees</span>
invoke the provision of paragraph 15 of the management contract that &quot;the
Contractor shall be solely responsible as an independ­ent contractor for, and
promptly pay to the steamship company, consignee, consignor, or other
interested party or parties the invoice value of each package but which in no
case shall be more than five hundred pesos <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt'>(P500.00) </span>for each package unless the value is otherwise
specified or manifested and the corresponding <span class=SpellE>arrastre</span>
charges had been paid.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>There is indeed no showing that appellant had declared the value
of the five missing lifts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It appears
from the bills sent by <span class=SpellE>appellees</span> (Nos. 54142 to
54144) that appellant paid the <span class=SpellE>arrastre</span> fees on the
basis of the weight of the merchandise, that is, at P5.00 per ton of 1,000
kilos <span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>or 40 cu. ft. of iron or steel
bars (No. 54143); and at P13.50 per ton or any fraction thereof of any single
package weighing more than two tons (Nos. 54142 &amp; 54144).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>However, the defense was not interposed by <span class=SpellE>appellees</span>
in their answer to the complaint, and evidence as to the actual value of the
missing lifts and the other damages suf­fered by appellant in order to procure
their replacement was duly admitted at the trial.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In fact the only reason alleged by <span
class=SpellE>appellees</span> in their answer as to why they refused to pay
appellant's claim was that it had not been filed with­in the fifteen-day period
stated in the management contract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
was quite late for them to raise the new defense for the first time on appeal.</p>

<p class=BODY>With respect to the award of attorney's fees, it should be noted
that in the stipulation of the parties below they expressly left the amount
thereof to the discretion of the court.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>And the amount of P1<span class=GramE>,000.00</span> <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>we </span>have
awarded is just and reasonable.</p>
