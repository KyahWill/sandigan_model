				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by certiorari from the decision of respondent Court of
Agrarian Relations dismissing the action for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
filed by petitioner as plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">lessor</span> against
private respondent as def­endant-lessee.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, raising pure questions of <span style="">law, has adopted in </span>his brief respondent court's <span style="">statement </span>of <span style="">the case and </span>of the facts, as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"(P)<span class="SpellE">laintiff</span>
seeks, in his complaint dated Novem­ber 26, 1964, the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
of <span style="">defendant from the latter's hold­ing
devoted to the production of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> seeded to two and
a half (2 1/2) <span class="SpellE">cavans</span> and situated at Bo. <span class="SpellE">Rajal</span>, Sta. Rosa, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> </span>for his failure to notify and/or <span style="">inform the former </span>of <span style="">defendant's reaping and pre-threshing a
portion of his <span class="SpellE">palay</span> crop in the month </span>of
November, 1964.</p>

<blockquote>"Defendant filed his motion to dismiss of <st1:date year="1964" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1964</st1:date> for want of cause of <span style="">action, claiming that in leasehold tenancy
the </span>entire harvest is owned by the lessee and the latter has no obli­gation
to notify the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> of the reaping or pre-threshing
of the crop planted on the land subject matter of the lease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In add­ition, defendant claims that failure
to so notify the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> is not a cause for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the assumption that the relationship between the parties
is that of the agricultural leasehold system provided for in Repub­lic Act No.
3844, otherwise known as the Agricultural Land Reform Code, <span style="">this </span>Court in its Order of January 12,
1965, denied defen­dant's motion to dismiss pointing out that an agricultural
lessee is, pursuant to said law, under obligation to notify the agricul­tural <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> at least three days before the date of harvesting or
whenever applicable, of threshing and adding that failure of the agricultural
lessee to comply with said obligation is a lawful ground for his <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Answering, defendant admitted that he pre-threshed and reaped his <span class="SpellE">palay</span> in November, 1964, without informing the plain­tiff,
but claiming that even then plaintiff knew of the pre-thresh­ing and reaping so
much so that he even sent constabulary soldiers to see him about this
point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alleging that he is an old lessee
prior to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of Republic Act No. 3844,
defendant pleads good faith, contending that it was his belief that he was
bound by Rep­ublic Act No. 1199, as amended.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By way of special defenses, defendant reiterated his stand that as
lessee since 1960-61, he is bound only by the conditions of Republic Act No.
1199, as amended, until those conditions are changed upon mutual agreement of
the parties, and not by the provisions of Republic Act No. 3844; that
considering that plaintiff knew of the pre-threshing and reaping even without
having been informed of the same by the defendant, there was no damage or
prejudice to said plaintiff and <span class="SpellE">moreoever</span> there was
no necessity for him to so furnish said information to the <span style="">plaintiff.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The fact that defendant became a leasehold tenant of
plaintiff under Republic Act No. 1199, as amended, effective agricultural year
1960-61 is undisputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, it is
well established on record that defendant reaped and pre-threshed a portion of
his <span class="SpellE">palay</span> crop sometime in November, 1964 without
informing the plaintiff about the same, although plaintiff came to known of
said reaping and pre-threshing and sent constabulary soldiers to the
scene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not also disputed that
defendant has been paying his lease rental to plaintiff including that for
agricul­tural year 1964-65."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The parties having submitted the case for decision on the basis
of the above-recited undisputed facts, respondent court rendered its decision
of December 16, 1965, dismissing peti­tioner's complaint for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> but "declaring it a duty of (respondent) to
henceforth notify the (petitioner) at least three days before the date of
harvesting and threshing of his <span class="SpellE">palay</span> crop planted on
the landholding in question conformably to para­graph 5, section 26 of the
Agricultural Land Reform Code (Rep­ublic Act No. 3844)."</p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, petitioner pursues anew his legal contention that
respondent-lessee, who became such lessee or leasehold tenant since 1960-61
under the provisions of the Agricultural Ten­ancy Act (Republic Act No. 1199)
should be ordered ejected from the landholding for having violated in November,
1964, after the Agricultural Land Reform Code (enacted on August 8, 1963) had
already come into force and effect, the provisions of section 26, paragraph (5)
of said Code, imposing upon an agricultural lessee the obligation "to
notify the agricultural <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> at least three days
before the date of harvesting <span style="">or, </span>whenever
applicable, of thresh­ing", in relation to section 36, paragraph (2) of
the same Code, which authorizes the lessee's dispossession for failure to
substan­tially comply with such obligation.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends, since the Agricultural Tenancy Act does not
impose upon the tenant-lessee the obligation of notifying the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> of the date set for reaping or threshing of the
crop,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
while the Land Reform Code expressly requires that the lessee give a three-day
advance notice and failure to comply therewith is a lawful ground for the lessee's
<span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>, that the Tenancy Act must be deemed
repealed under the general repeal clause of the Land Reform Code<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and his relations with respondent-lessee should be governed by the cited Land
Reform Code provi­sions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Several considerations compel the rejection of petitioner's
cause:</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The final proviso of
section 4 of the Land Reform Code, far from repealing the corresponding
provisions of the Tenancy Act, expressly provides as a saving clause
"(T)hat if a lawful leasehold tenancy contract was entered into prior to
the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of this Code, the rights and
obligations arising <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> shall continue to
subsist until modified by the parties in accord­ance with the provisions of
this Code."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In point of <span style="">law, </span>perti­nent provisions of the
Tenancy Act subsist and by express man­date of the Land Reform Code continue to
govern the following agricultural tenancy relations:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) "existing share tenancy contracts
may continue in force and effect in any region <span style="">or </span>locality, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
until the end of the agricultural year when the National Land Reform Council
proclaims that all the government machineries and agencies in that region or
locality relating to leasehold envisioned in this Code are operating, unless
such contracts provide for a shorter period or the tenant sooner exercises his
option to elect the lease­hold system"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>and (2) the consideration, as well as
the tenancy system prevailing, in the case of fishponds, <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span>
and lands principally planted to citrus, coconuts, cacao, coffee, durian, and
other similar permanent trees at the time of the approval of the Land Reform
Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent court properly
sustained respondent-lessee's plea of good faith and belief that the provisions
of the Tenancy Act continued to govern his leasehold relations with petitioner
effective since the 1960-61 agricultural crop, notwithstanding the subsequent
enactment of the Land Reform Code on August 8, 1963, and that he was under no
obligation either under the Tenancy Act or his agree­ment with petitioner-<span class="SpellE">lessor</span> to give any notice of reaping or thresh­ing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Undoubtedly, it is desirable that the
landholder-<span class="SpellE">lessor</span> should be notified in advance of
the date of harvest and threshing to enable him to safeguard his interest and
the lessee in good faith should normally have no objection to giving such
notice, save when thwarted by inadequate communications facilities -- and this
gap has now been supplied in section 26, paragraph (5) which imposes upon the
lessee the obligation to give such three-day advance notice of the date of harvesting,
or whenever applicable, of threshing."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But there is justification for the view that the reason for the lack of
such requirement of notice in the Tenancy Act is that the lessee's principal
obligation is to pay the rental, which is to deliver a generic thing in the
absence of any specific agreement to the contrary, and that the rental is
supposed to be a specific amount, as fixed and limited in section 46 of the
Act; and that consequently, in the absence of any legal obligation imposed on
the lessee to give such notice, the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> should
take it upon himself to verify from the tenant-lessee the date of reaping and
threshing.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, since it is
undisputed that respondent had been paying his lease rental <span style="">to </span>petitioner including that for the
1964-1965 agricultural year when the questioned incident took place, there has
been no damage or prejudice caused to petitioner by the lack of notice, even
assuming that the same was legally required of respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner in his complaint for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> claimed no such damage or prejudice of having
been deprived of any fair share of his rental.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the foregoing point
up to the application of the prin­ciple of security of tenure of the lessee,
even under the provisions of the Land Reform Code invoked by petitioner, to
wit, that the lessee must have failed to substantially comply with the require­ments
of the contract or of the Code to warrant his eviction and dispossession from
the landholding which must be "authorized by the Court in a judgment that
is final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>As stated by Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, speaking for the Court in <span class="SpellE"><u>Tañedo</u></span><u>
vs. de la Cruz</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
"(I)t would seem from this that the court is given some discretion to
determine whether or not the cause, although among those enumerated, is of such
gravity as to warrant the drastic remedy contemplated, or whether or not there
exist circumstances under which its application may be stayed."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner has under the facts of record
failed to make out a valid and justifiable case for the dispossession of
respondent.</p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, petitioner has
no cause for complaint, since respondent court, with the acquiescence of
respondent-lessee, made the requirements of section 26, paragraph 5 of the Land
Reform Code prospectively applicable to their leasehold relation and imposed in
its decision the duty upon respondent thenceforth to give petitioner at least
three days notice before the harvesting and threshing of his <span class="SpellE">palay</span> crop.</p>
