forth in the latter as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“12.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That in view of the above-stated Circulars of
the respondents, members of the affiliate local unions of the CUGCO who are
employed in the Auditing and Legal Depart­ments in the various government-owned

their employment (let alone all the benefits that would be lost which they are

respondents.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">“13.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That because </span>of the
Memorandum-Circular of <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Subido</span>,
the respondent Government Corporate Counsel Tomas P. <span class="SpellE">Matic</span>,
Jr. is subjecting petitioner GERONIMO Q. <span style="">QUADRA,
the </span>principal leader of the afore­mentioned petitioner <span style="">unions </span>to an administra­tive
proceedings in connection with his union activities as PCSEA (CUGCO) President
and as General Secretary of the CUGCO where he appeared in the Court of
Industrial <span style="">Relations in Case No. </span>2701-ULP,
PCSEA (CUGCO-KMP) vs. PCSO, Case No. 3442-ULP, CUGCO &amp; PCSEA VS. PCSO &amp;

of which the latter now is pending consideration on appeal before this
Honorable Tribunal in G.R. No. L-20448, en­titled MAGALIT, et al vs. CIR,
PCSEA, QUADRA, et al.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“14.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the proceedings of the res­pondents
Government Corporate Counsel and Auditor General occasioned by the Memorandum
Circular of the Acting Commissioner of Civil Service to subject members of the
petitioner unions and petitioner GERONIMO Q. QUADRA to administrative
proceedings is without juris­diction, in excess of their jurisdiction and
conducted with grave abuse of discretion."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the above facts and the prayer for relief contained in the
petition, it appears that petitioners main objective is to prohibit
respondents, particularly <span style="">the </span>Government
Corporate Counsel, from proceeding with the administrative investigation
against petitioner Quadra, and to prohibit them further from taking any
administrative or punitive action against the personnel of the auditing and
legal staffs of government owned or controlled corporations who had not
complied with Memo­randum Circular No. 15, series of 1964 of respondent
Commissioner of Civil Service by severing their connection with the Unions
existing in said corporations affiliated with CUGCO.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is not disputed that
on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="23" month="3"><span style="">March 23, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">
the respondent, the Acting Commissioner of Civil Service, issued Memorandum
Circular No. 15, series of 1964, whose pertinent portion reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In view of the foregoing, all per­sonnel of the General
Auditing Office as well as of the legal staffs of all govern­ment-owned or
controlled corporations are hereby declared to be embraced in the Civil Service
and they belong either to the classified or unclassified service unless other­wise
provided by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are therefore not
within the coverage of Memorandum Cir­cular Nos. 1 and 3, current series, of
this Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appointments of these
personnel should be forwarded to this Office for approval in accordance with
the Civil Service Law and Rules.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The said personnel may belong to any labor organization which
does not impose the obligation to strike or to join strikes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If any of these personnel have previously
joined any labor union which imposes the obligation to strike or to join
strikes, he should sever his membership within se­venty-two (72) hours from
receipt of this Memorandum Circular by the corporations con­cerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, if any member of the legal staff of
said corporations is re­ceiving benefits under a collective bar­gaining
contract entered into between management and the union, he should re­nounce
such benefit at once.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failure to secede
from the union which imposes the obligation to strike or to join strikes or to
renounce the benefits of the collective bargaining agreements shall be a ground
for disciplinary action for conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the
service, the severest penalty of which shall be dismissal from the service.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"New appointments should be issued to employees who have
renounced benefits under a collective bargaining contract, which must conform <span class="GramE">with</span> the Civil Service Law and Rules, and submitted to this
Office for approval.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A list of personnel covered by this Memorandum Circular
should be submitted to this Office within thirty (30) days from receipt hereof
by the corporations concerned."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Neither is it questioned
that on April 1, 1964 the Auditor General issued his own Memorandum Circular
No. 487 ordering all chairmen of the board of directors, managing heads and
auditors of government owned or controlled cor­porations performing proprietary
functions, and others concerned, to comply with Memorandum Circular No. 15
mentioned heretofore, and that sometime prior to April 23, 1964 the Government
Corporate Counsel initiated administra­tive proceedings against petitioner
Quadra for misconduct in office and/or conduct prejudicial to the service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In so far as the present action was intended to prohibit the
respondent Government Corporate Counsel and the respondent Commissioner of
Civil Service from continuing with the administrative investigation against
Quadra (AC No. R-28341), the same has practically become moot and academic
because on July 14, 1965 the aforesaid Commissioner of Civil Service rendered
judgment in said case finding Quadra "guilty as charged", and imposed
upon him "the penalty of dismissal from the service effective upon receipt
of this decision" (record pp. 134 and 137).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, from the facts stated in said
decision, it appears that the charges investigated in that administrative case
have no bearing upon Memorandum Circular No. 15 because they involved Quadra's
actuations as Chief Legal Officer of the Philip­pine Charity Sweepstakes
Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Specifically he was charged with
having represented in several particular cases interests adverse to the Philippine
Charity Sweepstakes Office of which he was the Chief Legal Officer; with
neglect of duty and practicing his profession as lawyer without per­mission
from competent authority; all in violation of per­tinent provisions of the
Civil Service Law, rules and regulations.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The above
notwithstanding, of course, the main question raised in the petition remains,
and it is whether Memorandum Circular No. 15, series of 1964, issued by the
respondent Commissioner of Civil Service, is valid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While, on the one hand, petitioners claim
that said respondent had no authority nor jurisdiction to issue said circular;
that the provisions thereof are in violation of the Constitution and of
pertinent laws guaranteeing their right to form associations or societies for purposes
not contrary to law and the right of government employees and workers to form,
join and assist labor unions </span>of their own choosing for the purpose of
collective bargaining, and to engage in concerted activities to secure and
effect changes or modifications in their terms and conditions of employment, on
the other hand, the respondents contend that the questioned memorandum circular
was issued to give life to the civil service law and related legislations,
particularly Republic Act <span style="">No. </span>2266,
affecting the auditing personnel in government owned or controlled
corporations, and Republic Act No. 2337, as amended by Republic Act No. 3838,
affecting the legal staffs of said corporations.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We agree with
respondents' view.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under the </span>provisions
of Republic Act 2266 <span style="">the Auditor
General appoints and fixes the salaries and </span>the number of the personnel
to assist his representative in government owned and controlled corporations,
although the expenses for the maintenance and operation of the Auditing Office
are to be borne by the corporations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the other hand, under Section 1 of Republic Act 2327, as amended by Republic
Act No. 3838, the position of Govern­ment Corporate Counsel is made
"distinct and separate from the office of the Solicitor General" and
is made the principal law officer of all government owned or controlled
corporations, and exercises control and super­vision over all legal divisions
maintained separately by said corporations.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Clearly deducible from
the foregoing is that the personnel of the auditing staff in the different
govern­ment owned or controlled corporations are under the office of the
Auditor General, while those of the legal staff of said corporations are under
the office of the Government Corporate Counsel, and that all of them are
embraced and covered by the civil service law, whether they belong to the
classified or the unclassified service.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This view is in line with our ruling in National Marketing Corporation </span>etc.
vs. CIR and PRISCO Workers Union <span style="">et al.
(G.R. No. </span>L-17004, <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="1">January 31,
 1963</st1:date>) where <span class="GramE">We</span> held as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"We agree with appellants that <span style="">members </span>of the auditing force can not be regarded as employees
of PRISCO in matters relating to their compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are appointed and supervised by the
Auditor General, have an independent tenure, and work subject to his <span style="">orders and instructions, and not to those of
the management of appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Above all,
the nature of their functions and duties, for the purpose of fiscal control of
appellants' operations, imperatively demands, as a matter of policy, that their
positions be completely independent from interference or inducement on the part
of the supervised management, in order to assure a maximum of impartiality in
the auditing functions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both independence
and impartiality require that the employees in question be utterly free from
apprehension as to their tenure and from ex­pectancy of benefits resulting from
any action of the management, since in either case there would be an influence
at work that could pos­sibly lead, if not be positive malfeasance, to laxity
and indifference that would gradual­ly erode and endanger the critical
supervision entrusted to these auditing employees."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While the ruling cited above affected members of the auditing
force working in government owned or controlled corporations, it should
likewise apply to the case of the personnel of the legal staffs or divisions of
the same corporations, for obvious reasons.</p>

<p class="BODY">But petitioners claim that the questioned circular is
unconstitutional because it violates their right to form or join associations
or labor unions of their choice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
believe otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is worth
remembering that the right to form and join associations and <span style="">unions is </span>not absolute or
unlimited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, if a person accepts
employ­ment that falls under the civil service law and his employer performs
governmental functions - such as the General Audit­ing Office and the
Government Corporate Counsel's Office - he may not resort to and exercise the
right to strike, be­cause that <span style="">is </span>prohibited
by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having accepted the em­ployment
freely and being chargeable with knowledge of the fact that he has no right to
resort to strike to enforce his demands against his <span class="GramE">employer,</span>
his only recourse is either to respect and comply with that condition or
resign.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING,</b> the writ prayed for is
denied and the petition for prohibition under consideration is dismissed, with
costs.</p>
