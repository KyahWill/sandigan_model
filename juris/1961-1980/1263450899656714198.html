				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Pio</span> Duran died without testament on
February <span style="">28, 1961 </span>in <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Guinobatan</span></span><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among his </span>alleged heirs <span class="GramE">are</span> Josefina Duran, as surviving spouse; several brothers
and sisters; nephews and nieces.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequent to his death, on June 2, <span style="">1962, </span><span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> Duran, one of the
surviving brothers, executed a public instrument assigning and renouncing his
hereditary rights to the decedent's estate in favor of Josefina Duran, for the
consideration of <span style="">P2<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A year later, on June <span style="">8, </span><span style="">1963, </span><span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
Duran filed in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> a
petition for intestate proceedings to settle <span class="SpellE">Pio</span>
Duran's estate, fur­ther asking that he be named the administrator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>pa</u><u><span style="">rte</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>motion to be appointed special administrator was also filed by
him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Against said petition, Josefina Duran filed on Au­gust <span style="">9, </span><span style="">1963 </span>an opposition, praying for its
dismissal upon the ground that the petitioner is not an "interested
person" in the estate, in view of the deed of transfer and renunciation
afore-stated, attaching a copy of <span style="">the </span>same;
in the alternative, she asked to be appointed <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Replying to this, <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> alleged, on
September <span style="">11, 1963, </span>in his
opposition to the motion to dismiss, <span style="">that
</span>Josefina Duran was not <span style="">the decedent's
wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anent </span>the deed of
assignment, he contended that the same <span style="">was
</span>procured thru fraud, with gross inadequacy of price and viti<span style="">ated by lesion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Still later, another brother of the decedent, Mi­guel Duran,
filed on September <span style="">14, 1963, </span>a
petition to be joined as co-petitioner of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Josefina Duran moved to strike out said
petition as an improper attempt to intervene in the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also filed a reply to <span class="SpellE">Cipriano's</span>
opposition to her motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
turn, Miguel filed an opposition to Josefina's motion to strike out.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on said motions, on June <span style="">5, </span>1964, the Court of First Instance issued an order dismissing
the petition of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> for his lack of interest in
the estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said lack of interest was
premised on the deed of transfer executed by <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>,
regarding which the court declared itself without power to examine in said
proceedings, col­laterally, the alleged fraud, inadequacy of price and le­sion
that would render it <span class="SpellE">rescissible</span> or <span class="SpellE">voidable</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And with
the petition's dismissal, Miguel's petition to be joined <span style="">as </span>co-petitioner was deemed without
leg to stand on.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appeal to Us directly, on questions of law, was ta­ken by <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> and Miguel Duran.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Rules of Court provides that a petition for administration
and settlement of an estate must be filed by an "interested person"
(Sec. 2, Rule 79).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants contend
that the deed of assignment executed by <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> did
not operate to render him a person without interest in the estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Relying on <u><span style="">In Re Irene Santos</span></u><span style="">, </span>L-11848,
May 31, 1962, they argue that an assignment by one heir of his share in the
estate to <span style="">a </span>co-heir amounts to
a par­tition needing approval by the settlement court to be ef­fective; and
that the assigning heir does not lose his status as a person interested in the
estate, even after said assignment is approved by the court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The situation in the <st1:city><st1:place><u><span style="">Santos</span></u></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> </span>case involves an assign­ment between
co-heirs <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">pendente</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span>,
during the course of settlement proceedings, <span style="">proper</span>ly and<span style=""> </span>validly
commenced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time of said
assignment, therefore, the settlement court had already acquired jurisdiction
over the proper­ties of the estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
result, any assignment regard­ing the same had to be approved by said
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And since the approval of the
court is not deemed final until the estate is closed, the assigning heir
remains an interes­ted person in the proceedings even after said approval,
which can be vacated, is given.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, however, the assignment took place when no
settlement <span class="GramE">proceedings was</span> pending.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The properties subject matter of the
assignment <span class="GramE">were</span> not un­der the jurisdiction of a
settlement court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Allowing that the
assignment must be deemed a partition as bet­ween the assignor and assignee,
the same does not need court approval to be effective <u>as between the parties</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An extrajudicial partition is valid as
between the par­ticipants even if the requisites of Sec. 1, Rule 74 for
extrajudicial partition are not followed, since said re­quisites are for
purposes of binding creditors and non­participating heirs only (Hernandez v. <span class="SpellE">Andal</span>, 78 Phil. <span style="">196).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Should it be contended that said
partition was attended with fraud, lesion or inadequacy of price, the remedy is
to rescind or to annul the same in an action for that purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in the meanwhile, the assigning heir
cannot initiate a settlement proceedings, for until the deed of assignment is
annulled or rescinded, it is deemed valid and effective against him, so that he
is left without that "interest" in the estate required to petition for
settlement proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent appellant Miguel Duran, he sought in his pe­tition below to
"join petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> Duran as co-petitioner
in the latter's petition x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>and incorpo­rates herein by adoption all the
allegations made in said petition." <span class="GramE">(Record on Appeal,
pp. 45-46).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same, therefore,
amounted to a petition to intervene in the settlement proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As aptly ruled by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u><span style="">, </span>since there <span class="GramE">was
really no settlement proceedings</span> <span style="">in
the </span>first place, the petition to intervene must be denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, <span class="SpellE">altho</span> Josefina Duran prayed to
be appointed <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>, her doing so did not admit
to ratifica­tion of the petition for settlement under the ruling in <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Valmores</span>, 97 Phil.
163, since she did so mere­ly by way of an alternative prayer, should her
motion to dismiss fail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And said motion
to dismiss was properly sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the dismissal order appealed from is hereby
affirmed, with costs against appellants.</p>
