				<BR><STRONG>MAKALINTAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review by certiorari of the decision of
the Court of Appeals vacating the judg­ment of the Court of First Instance of Manila
in its Civil Case No. 47845 (Juan Go <span class="SpellE">Tieng</span> et al. vs.
Emilio L. <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>, etc.) and remanding the same for
further proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts are set forth in the appealed decision as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"From the record of the case we gather that on the strength of
<span style="">a </span>falsified certificate of
birth, whereby it was made to appear that petitioner Juan Go <span class="SpellE">Tieng</span> was an illegitimate son of one Virginia Tomas, a
Filipino citizen, with <span style="">a </span>certain
Chinaman by the name of Go Tin, said peti­tioner was able to obtain an order
from the Bureau of Immigration on June 29, 1960, <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span>
his registration in the Philippines as an alien (Exhibit A, Ori­ginal Record,
p. 40)<span style="">,</span> and on June 30, 1960, the
issuance in his favor of Identification Certificate No. 11916 (Exhibit B, Orig.
Record, p. 41), both of which declared <span style="">him
to </span>be <span style="">a
</span>Filipino citizen by birth.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>By virtue of her supposed marriage to Juan Go <span class="SpellE">Tieng</span>,
the other petitioner here­in, <span class="SpellE">Sze</span> <span class="SpellE">Sau</span>
<span class="SpellE">Chien</span>, also succeeded in securing from the same
Bureau an order dated September <span style="">8, </span>1960,
<span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> her registration as an alien in the
Philippines (Exhibit C, Orig. Record, pp. 42-43), and the issuance in her favor
on the same date of Identification Certificate No. 12888 (Exhibit D, Orig.
Record, p. 44), both of which also declared her to be a Filipino citizen by
reason of her alleged marriage <span style="">to </span>said Juan Go <span class="SpellE">Tieng</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>However, on July 21, 1961, after the falsity of the birth
certificate of Juan Go <span class="SpellE">Tiang</span> had been discovered,
respondent Commissioner of Immigration issued two orders, one revoking the
order dated June 29, 1960, which declared Juan Go <span class="SpellE">Tieng</span>
a Filipino citizen by birth, <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> his
Identifica­tion Certificate No. 11916 and revalidating his ARC and IRC, and the
other likewise re­voking the order dated September 8, 1960, which declared <span class="SpellE">Sze</span> <span class="SpellE">Sau</span> <span class="SpellE">Chien</span>
a Filipino citizen by marriage, <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> her
Identification Certificate No. 12888,<span style=""> </span><span style="">re­validating </span>her
ACR and requiring her to leave the country within five days from notice
considering that her stay herein was authorized <span style="">as a </span>temporary visitor and the period
of her stay had already expired (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. F &amp; G,
Orig. Record, pp. 48-49).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Meanwhile, petitioners <span style="">Go
Kim </span><span class="SpellE">Chong</span> and Go <span class="SpellE">Siong</span>
Lim, claiming to be the chil­dren of Juan Go <span class="SpellE">Tieng</span>,
arrived in the Philippines on July 15, 1961, aboard of PAL plane from <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> and sought admission into the country as Filipino
citizens, but they were ordered excluded and returned to the country from
whence they came, on the ground that their alleged father <span style="">is </span>not <span style="">a </span>Filipino
citizen (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. H, Orig. Record, p. 50)."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On July 25, 1961 a deportation proceeding under Section 37(a) in
relation to Section 45(f) of the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940, as
amended, was instituted against Juan Go <span class="SpellE">Tieng</span> for
having knowingly made false statements and representations in connection with
his application for the cancellation of his alien certificate of registration
and the certificate of registration of <span class="SpellE">Sze</span> <span class="SpellE">Sau</span> <span class="SpellE">Chien</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deportation case was assigned to the Law
and Investigation Division of the Bureau of immigration for hearing and re­commendation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before it could be heard, however, Juan Go <span class="SpellE">Tieng</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sze</span> <span class="SpellE">Sau</span>
<span class="SpellE">Chien</span>, Go Kim <span class="SpellE">Chong</span> and Go <span class="SpellE">Siong</span> Lim filed in the Court of First Instance of Manila a
petition for prohibition and mandamus against the Commissioner of
Immigration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They prayed the court to
restrain him from carrying out his order requiring <span class="SpellE">Sze</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sau</span> <span class="SpellE">Chien</span>, Go <span style="">Kim </span><span class="SpellE">Chong</span> and Go <span class="SpellE">Siong</span> Lim to depart
from the Philippines and from confiscating their cash bonds; to restrain the
Law and Investigation Division of the Bureau of Immigration from hearing the
deportation case filed against Juan Go <span class="SpellE">Tieng</span>; and to
declare all of them citizens of the Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due hearing, the trial court rendered its decision dated <st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1962</st1:date>, dismissing the
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It found <span style="">that </span>"there
is no <span style="">complete </span>evidence on
record upon which petitioner Juan Go <span class="SpellE">Tieng</span> relies
(for) his claim to be <span style="">a </span>Filipino <span style="">citizen"; </span>that <span class="SpellE">Sze</span> <span class="SpellE">Sau</span> <span class="SpellE">Chien</span> could not claim
Filipino citizenship by marriage; and that as a consequence their minor
children could not claim to be Filipinos by birth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon receipt of a copy of the decision on <st1:date year="1962" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1962</st1:date> counsel for
petitioners below (respondents here) immediately filed a notice of appeal to
the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1962</st1:date> counsel withdrew their
appearance with the conformity of their clients; and the next day, March 2,
said petitioners themselves withdrew their appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following March 12 another set of <span style="">lawyers </span>entered their appearance in
the trial court and filed <span style="">a </span>motion for reconsideration and new trial on the following
grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that they had discovered
new evidence regarding Go <span class="SpellE">Tieng's</span> parentage; (2) that
former counsel had committed a mistake in admitting Go <span class="SpellE">Tieng's</span>
certificate of birth with­out presenting him to testify regarding the
circumstances of his parentage; and (3) that the decision was contrary to the
facts of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commissioner of
Immigration opposed the motion, alleging in effect that the decision had become
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, and that said motion did not
contain any valid grounds for reopening the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By way of rejoinder petitioners below prayed
that their motion be considered as a petition for relief from judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="9">September
 24, 1962</st1:date> the trial court issued an order to the effect that while
the motion for reconsideration and new trial had no legal basis as such, it
might be considered as <span style="">a </span>petition
for relief from judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
the decision dated <st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1962</st1:date>
was set <span style="">aside </span>and the case was
reopened exclusively for the reception of the testimony of Juan Go <span class="SpellE">Tieng</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hearing
was held, and on <st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="9">September 27, 1962</st1:date>,
holding that there was no valid reason to disturb its original findings, the
trial court reaffirmed its previous decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon petitioners below appealed to the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1964</st1:date>
the appellate court rendered the following judgment:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the appealed judgment is hereby vacated, and let
this case be returned to the court of origin for that court to conduct further
proceedings on the matter of the citizenship of Juan Go <span class="SpellE">Tieng</span>,
and thereafter, the trial court is instructed to render another decision as the
evidence presented may justify.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mean­while,
action on the petition of <span class="SpellE">Sau</span> <span class="SpellE">Sze</span>
<span class="SpellE">Chien</span>, Go Kim <span class="SpellE">Chong</span> and Go <span class="SpellE">Siong</span> Lim is held in abeyance until final determination by
the trial court of the citizenship of "Juan Go <span class="SpellE">Tieng</span>,
without any special pronouncement as to costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">His </span>motion for
reconsideration having subsequently been denied, the Commissioner of
Immigration elevated the case on the instant petition for review, assigning several
errors in the decision of the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is first alleged that when herein private respondents filed their
motion for reconsideration and new trial in the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> its
decision had already become final, and that if the motion <span style="">be </span>considered <span style="">as a </span>petition for relief <span style="">from
</span>judgment the grounds relied upon were not valid for that purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner then contends that private
respondents should have exhausted the administrative remedies available to them
before coming to Court, by allowing the deportation proceed­ing to continue and
then appealing to the Secretary of Justice from the decision, if adverse, of
the Commissioner of Immigration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Finally, petitioner maintains that the Court of Appeals committed a
grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction in entertaining the
appeal of private respondents and in remanding the case for further
proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">We first take up the issue posed in the second and third of the
foregoing recapitulation of errors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
should be noted that the basic petition in the Court of First Instance was for
prohibition and mandamus (1) to restrain the Commissioner of Immigration from
carrying out his order for then petitioners (respondents here) <span class="SpellE">Sze</span> <span class="SpellE">Sau</span> <span class="SpellE">Chien</span>,
Go Kim <span class="SpellE">Chong</span> and Go <span class="SpellE">Siong</span>
Lim to depart from the Philippines; (2) to stop the hearing of the deportation
proceeding against Juan Go <span class="SpellE">Tieng</span>; and (3) to declare
all the petitioners (respondents here) Filipino citizens.</p>

<p class="BODY">To begin with, it should be stated that as far as the records of
the Bureau of Immigration are concerned respondent Juan <span style="">Go </span><span class="SpellE">Tieng</span> is
a Chinese citizen, the order of the Commissioner of Immigration dated June 29,
1960 <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> his alien certificate of registration
and declaring him a Filipino citizen having been revoked in the subsequent
order of July 21, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only basis
of the first order was the falsified certificate of birth of Juan Go <span class="SpellE">Tieng</span> and hence the second order was necessary and logical
upon the discovery of the falsification.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After Go <span class="SpellE">Tieng</span> was thus reverted to his former
status as an alien in the records of the Bureau of Immigration, the
Commissioner, on <st1:date year="1961" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1961</st1:date>,
instituted the deportation proceeding against him for having used <span style="">a </span>falsified
certificate of birth in obtaining the order of <st1:date year="1960" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was to secure a judicial declaration of Filipino citizenship and to utilize
such declaration to stop the investigation which was to be con­ducted in
connection with the deportation proceeding that Go <span class="SpellE">Tieng</span>
went to Court on <span style="">a </span>petition for prohibition and mandamus.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not see that prohibition and mandamus are proper vehicles
for such purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first <span style="">is </span>a remedy
against proceedings that are without or in excess of juris­diction, or with
grave abuse of discretion, there being no appeal or other plain, speedy and adequate
remedy in the ordinary course of <span style="">law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
second is <span class="GramE">a recourse</span> to compel the performance of an
act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty - again when there is no other
plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course <span style="">of </span>law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commissioner of Immigration neither
exceeded his authority nor <span style="">abused his </span>discretion
in instituting a deportation proceeding against Go <span class="SpellE">Tieng</span>
and ordering the corresponding investigation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was a proceeding sanctioned by Section 37(a) in relation to Section
45 of the Immigration Act of 1940.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
question of Go <span class="SpellE">Tieng's</span> Filipino citizenship was and
should have been addressed in the first instance to the Commissioner, and his
authority to hear the evidence and pass upon the <span style="">said </span>question to enable him to decide whether or not Go <span class="SpellE">Tieng</span> should be deported cannot be preempted by the courts
in a suit for prohibition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, is pointed out by the Solicitor General, the suit was premature, no
hearing having yet been conducted and no conclusion reached concerning the
deportability of Go <span class="SpellE">Tieng</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Orderly procedure requires that the matter be
threshed out where the law assigns it in the first place.</p>

<p class="BODY">As matters now stand, despite the two chances given to
petitioners below to establish the basis alleged by them for the suit for
prohibition in the Court of First Instance, they have failed to do so.
"After having reviewed at length the entire evidence adduced by both
sides," said the Court of Appeals in its decision, "we find the same
quite deficient to warrant a sound and judicious pronouncement that Juan Go <span class="SpellE">Tieng</span> is or <span style="">is </span>not
a Filipino citizen." If for this reason alone the denial by the trial
court of the basic petition should have been affirmed, <span style="">since after all </span>the burden of making out their case rested upon
the said petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to <span class="SpellE">Sze</span> <span class="SpellE">Sau</span>
<span class="SpellE">Chien</span>, it appears that she came to the Philippines on
April 16, 1960 <span style="">as a </span>temporary
visitor, and was permitted to enter and stay for a period of only one
month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To guarantee that she would leave
upon the expiration of the permit, Juan Go <span class="SpellE">Tieng</span> put
up a cash bond of P1<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence referred to by the Commissioner
of Immigration in the instant petition <span style="">shows
</span>that in her application for a passport visa as a non-immigrant she
stated she was married to a certain Co Cheng Guan, a resident of Rangoon, and
that she had no close relative in the Philip­pines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The clear implication, of course, is that she
is not the wife at all of Juan Go Cheng.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But assuming that she is, the fact of the marriage alone, even conceding
the possibility that her husband may be able to establish his Filipino
citizenship after he is heard in the deportation proceeding, would not make her
automatically a Filipino citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
is the doctrine already settled by this Court in a number of decisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The citizenship of an alien woman who marries
a Filipino husband must be determined in an appropriate proceeding by a showing
that she "might herself be naturalized" as a Filipino citizen.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">+</span></span></a> Consequently, the order of the Commissioner of immigration
for <span class="SpellE">Sze</span> <span class="SpellE">Sau</span> <span class="SpellE">Chien</span> to depart, the period of her authorized stay having
long expired, cannot be said to be in excess of jurisdiction or a grave abuse
of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same conclusion holds
true with respect to the two minor children, allegedly of her marriage to Go <span class="SpellE">Tieng</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apropos is the decision of this Court in the case of <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> Ha vs. <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>, April 27, 1963
7 SCRA 797), from which we quote:</p>

<blockquote>"It should be borne in mind this is a petition for mandamus to
compel respondent to recognize the validity of an order of Associate
Commissioner Felix <span class="SpellE">Talabis</span> which declared petitioners
citi­zens of the Philippines and to restore their identification certificates
as such citizens after respondent commissioner had exercised his authority to
re-examine and re-evaluate the evidence then extent in his office as submitted
in the adminis­trative investigation, and yet the court a quo had acted on the
matter without giving said respondent an opportunity to examine and evaluate
the evidence on which it predicated its amended decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We consider this action unfair and im­provident
for it <span style="">is </span>tantamount to
overruling the decision of respondent on evidence which he himself did not have
occasion to consider.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is like over?ruling
him on a matter which was never submitted to him for consideration.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Another point we should consider here is the nature of the
proceeding be­fore us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be
recalled that this is a petition for mandamus which will only lie to compel an
officer to perform a ministerial duty - not a discretionary duty, for, as it
was aptly held, mandamus will not issue to control the exercise of discretion
of a public officer where the law imposed upon him the duty to exercise his
judgment in reference to any matter in which he is required to act, because it
is his judgment that is to be exer­cised and not that of the court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">In view of what has been</span><span style=""> set </span>forth above we deem it
unnecessary to pass upon the procedural questions raised by petitioner herein,
namely, whether or not the original decision of the trial court dated February <span style="">8, </span>1962 had be­come final and <span class="SpellE">unappealable</span>; whether or not the motion for reconsideration
and new trial dated March 12, 1962, was correctly considered as a petition for
relief from judg­ment; and whether or not such petition was granted on justi­fiable
grounds.</p>

<p class="BODY">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and set aside,
and that of the Court of First Instance dismissing the basic petition is
affirmed, with costs.</p>
