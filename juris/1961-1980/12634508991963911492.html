from an order of the Court of First Instance of Manila dated <st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1964</st1:date>, approving the project
of partition filed by the executor in Civil Case No. 37089 therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Amos G. <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span>, born in <st1:state><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:state>,
was "a citizen of the State of <st1:state><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:state>
and of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>."
By his first wife, Mary E. <span class="SpellE">Mallen</span>, whom he divorced,
he had five legi­timate children:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Edward
A. <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span>, George <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span>
(who predeceased him in infancy), Henry A. <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span>,
Alexander <span class="SpellE">Bel­lis</span> and Anna <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span>
<span class="SpellE">Allsman</span>; by his second wife, Violet Kennedy, who
survived him, he had three legitimate chil­dren:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Edwin G. <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span>,
Walter S. <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span> and Dorothy <span class="SpellE">Bel­lis</span>;
and finally, he had three illegitimate children:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Amos <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span>, Jr.,
Maria Cristina <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span> and Miriam Palma <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 5, 1952, Amos G. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bellis</span></span><span style=""> </span>executed a
will in the Philippines, in which he directed that after all taxes,
obligations, and expenses of administration are paid for, his distributable
estate should be divided, in trust, in the following order and manner:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) $240,000.00 to his first wife, Mary E. <span class="SpellE">Mallen</span>; (b) P120,000.00 to his three illegitimate children,
Amos <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span>, <span style="">Jr., </span>Maria Cristina <span class="SpellE">Be<span style="">llis</span></span><span style="">, and Miriam Palma <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span>, or </span>P40,000.00 each and <span style="">(c) after the foregoing; two items have been
satisfied, the remainder shall go to his seven surviving children by his first
and second wives, namely: Edward A. <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span>, Henry A. <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span>, Alexander <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span>, and
Anna <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span> <span class="SpellE">Allsman</span>, Edwin
G. <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span>, Walter S. <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span>,
and Dorothy E. <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span>, in equal shares.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Subsequently, or on </span><st1:date year="1958" day="8" month="7"><span style="">July </span>8,
 <span style="">1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, Amos G. <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span>
died, a resident of </span><st1:place><st1:city><span style="">San Antonio</span></st1:city><span style="">,
 </span><st1:state><span style="">Texas</span></st1:state><span style="">, </span><st1:country-region><span style="">U.S.A.</span></st1:country-region></st1:place><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
will was ad­mitted to probate in the Court of First Instance of Manila on </span><st1:date year="1958" day="15" month="9"><span style="">September
 </span><span style="">15, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The People's Bank and Trust Company, as executor of the will,
paid all the bequests therein including the amount of $240,000.00 in the form
of shares of stock to Mary E. <span class="SpellE">Mallen</span> and to the three
(3) illegitimate children, Amos <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span>, Jr., Maria
Cristina <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span> and Miriam Palma <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span>,
various amounts <span class="SpellE">totalling</span> P40,000.00 each in sa­tisfaction
of their respective legacies, or a total of P120,000.00, which it released from
time to time accord­ing as the lower court approved and allowed the various
motions or petitions filed by the latter three requesting partial advances on
account of their respective legacies.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On January </span>8, <span style="">1964, preparatory to closing its admi­nistration,
the executor submitted and filed its "Execu­tor's Final Account, Report of
Administration and Project of Partition" wherein it reported, </span><u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">alia</span></u></span><span style="">, the satis­faction of the legacy of Mary E. <span class="SpellE">Mallen</span> by the delivery to her of shares of stock amounting
to $240,000.00, and the legacies of Amos <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span>, Jr.,
Maria Cristina <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span> and Miriam Palma <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span> in the amount of P40,000.00 each or a total of
P120,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the project of
partition, the executor - pursuant to the "Twelfth" clause of the
testator's Last Will and Testament - divided the residua­ry estate into seven
equal portions for the benefit of the testator's seven legitimate children by
his first and second marriages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1964</st1:date>,
Maria Cristina <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span> and Mi­riam Palma <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span> filed their respective oppositions to the project of
partition on the ground that they were de­prived of their <span class="SpellE">legitimes</span>
as illegitimate children and, therefore, compulsory heirs of the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">Amos <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span>, Jr. interposed no
opposition despite notice to him, proof of service of which is evidenced by the
registry receipt submitted on <st1:date year="1964" day="27" month="4">April
 27, 1964</st1:date> by the executor<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After the parties filed
their respective memoranda and other pertinent pleadings, the lower court, on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="4"><span style="">April
 30, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, issued an
order overruling the oppositions and approving the executor's final account,
report and admi­nistration and project of partition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Relying upon Art. 16 of the Civil Code, it
applied the national law of the decedent, which in this case is </span><st1:state><st1:place><span style="">Texas</span></st1:place></st1:state><span style=""> law, which did not provide for <span class="SpellE">legitimes</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Their respective motions for reconsideration having been denied
by the lower court on <st1:date year="1964" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1964</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">opposi­tors</span>-appellants appealed to this Court to
raise the issue of which law must apply - <st1:state><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:state>
law or Philippine law.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this regard, the parties do not submit the case on, nor even
discuss, the doctrine of <span class="SpellE">renvoi</span>, applied by this
Court in <span class="SpellE">Aznar</span> v. Christensen Garcia, L-16749, <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="1">Janua­ry 31, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said doctrine is usually pertinent where the
decedent is a national of one country, and a domicile of another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present case, it is not disputed that the
decedent was both a national of <st1:state><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:state>
and a domicile thereof at the time of his death.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
So that even assuming <st1:state><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:state> has a
conflict of law rule providing that the domi­ciliary system (law of the
domicile) should govern, the same would not result in a reference back (<span class="SpellE">renvoi</span>) to Phi­lippine law, but would still refer to <st1:state><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:state>
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, if <st1:state><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:state>
has a conflicts rule adopting the <span class="SpellE">situs</span> theory (<span class="SpellE">lex</span> <span class="SpellE">rei</span> <span class="SpellE">sitae</span>)
calling for the application of the law of the place where the properties are
situated, <span class="SpellE">renvoi</span> would arise, since the properties
here involved are found in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence, however, of proof as to the
conflict of law rule of <st1:state><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:state>, it
should not be presumed different from ours.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellants' position is therefore not rested on the doctrine of <span class="SpellE">renvoi</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As sta­ted,
they never invoked nor even mentioned it in their ar­guments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather, they argue that their case falls
under the circumstances mentioned in the third paragraph of Article 17 in
relation to Article 16 of the Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 16, par. 2, and Art. 1039 of the Civil Code, render
applicable the national law of the decedent, in in­testate or testamentary
successions, with regard to four items:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(a) the order of succession; (b) the amount of <span class="SpellE">suc­cessional</span>
rights; (c) the intrinsic validity of the provisions of the will; and (d) the
capacity to succeed. They provide that -</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 16.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Real property
as well as per­sonal property is subject to the law of the country where it is
situated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"However, intestate and testamentary suc­cessions, both with
respect to the order of succession and to the amount of <span class="SpellE">successional</span>
rights and to the intrinsic validity of tes­tamentary provisions, shall be
regulated by the national law of the person whose succession is under
consideration, whatever may be the nature of the property and regardless of the
country wherein said property may be found."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Art. 1039.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Capacity to
succeed is go­verned by the law of the nation of the dece­dent." </blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellants would however counter that Art. 17, para­graph three,
of the Civil Code, stating that ?</p>

<blockquote>"Prohibitive laws concerning persons, their acts or property,
and those which have for their object public order, public policy and good
customs shall not be rendered inef­fective by laws or judgments promulgated, or
by determinations or conventions agreed upon in a foreign country."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">prevails as the exception to Art. 16,
par. 2 of the Civil Code afore-quoted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is not correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precisely,
Congress <u>deleted</u> the phrase, “<span style="">n</span>otwithstanding
the provisions of this and the next preceding article' when they incorpo­rated
Art. 11 of the old Civil Code as Art. 17 of the new Civil Code, while
reproducing without substantial change the second paragraph of Art. 10 of the
old Civil Code as Art. 16 in the new.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
must have been their purpose to make the second paragraph of Art. 16 a specific
provision in itself which must be applied in testate and intestate
successions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As further indication of
this legislative intent, Congress added a new provision, under Art. 1039, which
decrees that capacity to succeed is to be governed by the national law of the
decedent.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is therefore evident that whatever public policy or good
customs may be involved in our system of <span class="SpellE">legitimes</span>,
Congress has not intended to extend the same to the suc­cession of foreign
nationals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it has specifically
chosen to leave, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, the <u>amount</u>
of <span class="SpellE">successional</span> rights, to the decedent's national
law. Specific provi­sions must prevail over general ones.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants would also point out that the decedent executed two
wills - one to govern his Texas estate and the other his Philippine estate -
arguing from this that he intended Philippine law to govern his Philippine
estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming that such was the
decedent's intention in executing a separate Philippine will, it would not
alter the law, for as this Court ruled in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Miciano</u></span><u>
v. <span class="SpellE">Brimo</span></u>, 50 Phil. 867, 870, a provision in a
foreigner's will to the effect that his properties shall be distributed in ac­cordance
with Philippine law and not with his national law, is illegal and void, for his
national law cannot be ignored in regard to those matters that Article 10 - now
Article 16 - of the Civil Code states said national law should govern.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The parties admit that
the decedent, Amos G. <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span>, was a citizen of the
State of Texas, U.S.A., and that un­der the laws of Texas, there are no forced
heirs </span><span style="">or </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">legi­times</span></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, since the intrinsic validity of the </span>provision of the
will and the amount of <span class="SpellE">successional</span> rights are to be
determined under Texas law, the Philip<span style="">pine
law on <span class="SpellE">legitimes</span> cannot be applied to the testacy of
Amos G. <span class="SpellE">Bellis</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE,</span></b><span style=""> the order of the probate court is hereby
affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>, with costs against
appellants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
