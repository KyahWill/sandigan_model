				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City in Criminal Case No. 3380,
People v. <span class="SpellE">Pancho</span> <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>,
et al., condemning the appellants, Pancho Pelagio, Oscar Caymo and Jose Guico,
to death for the crime of robbery with homicide as defined and penalized in
Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">The amended information under which the above judgment was
rendered originally recited six defendants, namely, the three <span class="SpellE">aforenamed</span> appellants, and <span class="SpellE">Arcadio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Balmeo</span>, Evelyn Villanueva and Armando <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span> alias Ding <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, however, <span class="SpellE">Arcadio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Balmeo</span> and Evelyn Villanueva were discharged from the
said information when they agreed to turn state witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Armando <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span>,
on the other hand, died while the case was pending trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the trial proceeded only with respect
to the here­in appellants:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pancho</span> <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>, Oscar <span class="SpellE">Caymo</span> and Jose <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records disclose that Jose <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>,
an ex-convict, and Evelyn Villanueva lived in common law relationship at No.
289-A (Int.) <span class="SpellE">Leveriza</span> St., <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>
City, from about January 1955 to March of the same year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among their friends <span class="GramE">were</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pancho</span> <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>, also an
ex-convict, and Armando <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At around <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">three
 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1955" day="23" month="3">March
 23, 1955</st1:date>, while <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span> was at the above
residence, <span class="SpellE">Pancho</span> <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>
came to see the spouses <span class="SpellE">Guico</span> and Villanueva.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pelagio's</span> wife had
just delivered a child and he wanted to borrow money for the hospital expenses.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not determinable from the records if <span class="SpellE">Pancho</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> was then accommodated in his request for a
loan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records disclose, however,
that Armando <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span>, taking advantage of the said
visit, informed <span class="SpellE">Pancho</span> <span class="SpellE">Pe­lagio</span>
of a robbery he, <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span>, was planning with some
other friends who later were revealed by <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span> to
be Jose <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>, Oscar <span class="SpellE">Caymo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Arcadio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balmeo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span> decided to talk the matter over and, in fact, <span style="">did discuss </span>the subject once more
later that afternoon in the presence of Jose <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>
and Evelyn Villanueva, when <span class="SpellE">Caymo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Balmeo</span> arrived in the same house. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The follow­ing day, March 24, 1955, the above
persons, namely Evelyn <span style="">Villanueva, <span class="SpellE">Pancho</span> <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>, </span>Armando <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span>, Oscar <span class="SpellE">Caymo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Arcadio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balmeo</span>, met again at <span class="SpellE">Guico's</span> residence and there finalized and agreed on the
plan to rob the house <span style="">of </span><span class="SpellE">Guico's</span> former landlady, a certain <span class="SpellE">Aling</span>
<span class="SpellE">Nena</span>, at No. 327 G. Villanueva St., <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this
meeting, Jose <span class="SpellE">Guico</span> was absent.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the full and exact nature of Jose <span class="SpellE">Guico's</span>
parti­cipation in the first meeting is unclear because there is evidence to the
effect that while the robbery was then being discussed, <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>
was in the bathroom taking his show­er.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">t.s.n</span></span>. pp. 6, 12-13,
Hearing of <st1:date year="1955" day="23" month="8">August 23, 1955</st1:date>)
It is established, though, that after <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span> had
sketched the intended victim's house and its surrounding, <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>
explained the location of the said house in relation to the surrounding streets
and the points thereof through which entrance and exit should be <span class="GramE">effected</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the meeting broke up at about six o'clock that evening,
March 24, 1955, <span class="SpellE">Pancho</span> <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>,
Oscar <span class="SpellE">Caymo</span>, Armando <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Arcadio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balmeo</span> set out
for the exe<span style="">cution of their plan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>They all walked together <span style="">towards </span><span class="SpellE">Aling</span>
<span class="SpellE">Nena's</span> residence although before reaching the place, <span class="SpellE">Caymo</span> ordered <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span> to hail
and hold <span style="">a </span>taxi which the latter
did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, too, only <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Balmeo</span></span><span style=""> </span>and <span class="SpellE">Caymo</span> actually entered the
victim’s premises because, as was earlier agreed upon, <span class="SpellE">Pancho</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> acted as the lookout for the two and he
simply posted himself by the gate of the said house.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Caymo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Balmeo</span>
gained entrance to the house through its back kitchen door which they <span style="">found </span>to be open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once inside, <span class="SpellE">Caymo</span>
drew his gun and sought out its occupants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Only an old woman, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Severina</span> de Gloria,
however, was in at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Caymo</span> then pointed the gun at the old lady and intimidated
her into producing all the money and jewelry she could.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All in <span style="">all,
</span>the pair got about P437 in cash, three pieces of jewelry worth about
P205.00 and a watch worth about P300.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After they had taken the above items, <span class="SpellE">Caymo</span>
ordered Mrs. de Gloria to <span class="GramE">lie</span> face downward, covered
her with a blanket, and cautioned her against moving or otherwise sounding out
an alarm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two then went down the
house and out into the street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
gate, however, they failed to find <span class="SpellE">Pancho</span> <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">From G. Villanueva Street where the victim's house was located, <span class="SpellE">Caymo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Balmeo</span> walked till they
got to the corner of F. Fernando Street where they found Armando <span class="SpellE">Ma­nalang</span> waiting for them in <span style="">a </span>taxi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Caymo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Balmeo</span> then rode on it.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the taxi was about to leave, however, a jeep from the opposite
direction blocked its way and as the two vehicles were thus stopped, a man
alighted from the jeep and started to walk towards the taxi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the stranger was very near the taxi
already, <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span> instructed <span class="SpellE">Caymo</span>
to shoot at the man as the latter was <span style="">a
police </span>officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereupon, <span class="SpellE">Caymo</span> leveled several shots at the latter, about <span style="">six </span>in all, and the man, who <span style="">was </span>later identified as Patrol­man
Francisco Trinidad of the <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> Police Department,
fell dead.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the scene of the shooting, <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Caymo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Balmeo</span> went
direct to a house in <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> Street owned by <span class="SpellE">Manalang’s</span> sister where they changed clothes and hid the
death weapon <span style="">and </span>the money and
jewelry they had robbed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Shortly thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Caymo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Balmeo</span> proceeded to a house in <span class="SpellE">Blumentritt</span>
where they met <span class="SpellE">Pancho</span> <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>
whom they called to account for his absence at the gate during the
robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter explained that he
had to scamper away before <span class="SpellE">Caymo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Balmeo</span> had gone down because he, <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>,
saw someone slip out of the house apparently to summon the police.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records do not disclose just how and when the herein
appellants and their companions were apprehended by the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears, however, that on March 25, 1955,
or the day following the incident, Oscar <span class="SpellE">Caymo</span> was
taken to the National Bureau of Investigation and subjected to paraffin test
and found positive for nitrate burns in both hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day, he executed his extrajudicial
confession (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. H) <span class="GramE">relating</span>
to his participation in the crime and implicating <span class="SpellE">Pancho</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>, Armando <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Arcadio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balmeo</span> in it.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 26, 1955, appellant Jose <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>
also executed an extra-judicial confession (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">I) owning</span> his participation in the formation of the
conspiracy as earlier recited in this decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He named as co-conspirators <span class="SpellE">Pancho</span> <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> and Armando <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The last to be apprehended was Armando <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On April 8, 1955, he extra-judicially
confessed (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. G) <span class="GramE">to</span> the
above offense and implicated as his companions in it Jose <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>,
Oscar <span class="SpellE">Caymo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Arcadio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balmeo</span> and Evelyn Villanueva.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the trial court, the
herein appellants' common defense was alibi.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Pancho</span> <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>
claimed that at the time of the incident he was playing mahjong at the house </span>of
one Angelina <span class="SpellE">Dadivas</span> in <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Lakandola</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Oscar <span class="SpellE">Caymo</span>, on the
other hand, claimed that he was then at home at No. 2316 <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span>
Street, Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, Jose <span class="SpellE">Guico</span> maintained that during the incident he was at the
residence of one Jose <span class="SpellE">Obligacion</span> where he stayed
until about 11:00 in the evening.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consistently with their alibi, the appellants charged that the
extrajudicial confession given by <span class="GramE">them</span> were secured by
the police through threat and maltreatment.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the appeal before us now, only Oscar <span class="SpellE">Caymo</span>
sticks to the defense of alibi.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Pancho</span> <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>
now <span style="">admits he participated in the crime
in the manner recited above but submits that, under the circumstances, he
should only be convicted for simple robbery and not for robbery with
homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant Jose <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>, on the other hand, argues in this appeal that even
under the </span>facts <span style="">found by the
trial court regarding his participation, he cannot justly be convicted for the
crime charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Office of the
Solicitor General, for its part, urges the <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>
of the decision under review with respect to <span class="SpellE">Pancho</span> <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> and Oscar <span class="SpellE">Caymo</span> but
recommends the acquittal of Jose <span class="SpellE">Guico</span> on reasonable
doubt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful and thorough review of the evidence, this Court
believes that the decision appealed from should be modified to the end that
Oscar <span class="SpellE">Caymo's</span> conviction should stand, <span class="SpellE">Pancho</span> <span class="SpellE">Pelagio's</span> guilt be reduced
to simple robb<span style="">ery, and Jose <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>, as recommended by the Solicitor General, be
acquitted on reasonable doubt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Oscar <span class="SpellE">Caymo's</span> insistence on
his alibi is absolutely futile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
evidence against its credibility is both forceful and overwhelming.</p>

<p class="BODY">To begin with, Oscar <span class="SpellE">Caymo</span> was
positively identified by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Severina</span> de Gloria as
one of those who broke into her house on the night of the incident and robbed
her at gunpoint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was likewise
positively identified during the trial by Francisco <span class="SpellE">Juni</span>,
the driver of the get-away taxi, as the <span class="SpellE">gunwielder</span> in
the fatal shooting of Pat. <st1:place><span class="GramE">Trinidad</span></st1:place><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, state
witnesses Evelyn Villanueva and <span class="SpellE">Arcadio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balmeo</span> testified at the stand that he was among those who
hatched and agreed on the robbery at the house of Jose <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>
previous to the execution of the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And then, too, he was found positive for nitrate burns in both his hands
by the National Bureau of Investigation the very day following the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Against this finding, he has offered neither
denial nor any reasonable explanation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even if this Court disregards his extrajudicial confession, therefore,
though we do not here now find the same in­admissible, the acceptance of <span class="SpellE">Caymo's</span> alibi would still be completely anomalous and
irrational.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No jurisprudence in criminal
cases is more settled than the rule that alibi is the weakest of all defenses
and that the same should be rejected when the identity of the accused has been
sufficiently and positively established by eyewitnesses to the crime.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Briz</span>, <span class="GramE">104Phil.,</span> 329; People v. <span class="SpellE">Asmawil</span>,
G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-18761, </span><st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="3"><span class="GramE">March 31, 1965</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">;
People v. <span class="SpellE">Lumayag</span>, G.<span style="">R. No.</span></span><span style=""> L</span>-19142,
March 31, 1965) When nothing supports it except the testimonies of relatives
and friends and the defendant's own urging of the same, the said defense weighs
and is worth nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People
v. <span class="SpellE">Bañaga</span> et al., G.R. No.</span> L-14905, January
28, 1961) Besides, the rule is to the effect that for alibi to prosper, it is
not enough to prove that he was also somewhere when the crime was committed but
the defend­ant must likewise demonstrate that it was physically impossible for
him to have been at the scene of the crime at such time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People v. <span class="SpellE">Limpo</span>, et al., G.R. No.</span> <span style="">L-13058, </span>January 28, 1961) <span class="SpellE">Caymo's</span>
alibi does not meet this standard.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, this Court would only do wrong and <span class="GramE">miscarry</span>
justice to set aside his conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court, however, concurs with appellant <span class="SpellE">Pancho</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pelagio's</span> submission that, by the trial court's own
factual determination, his criminal liability cannot be extended beyond simple
robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold <span class="SpellE">Pancho</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> guiltless or innocent of Pat. <st1:place><span class="GramE">Trinidad</span></st1:place><span class="GramE">'s death.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Even the decision under appeal recites that when <span class="SpellE">Arcadio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balmeo</span> and Oscar <span class="SpellE">Caymo</span> hurried out of the victim's house after the robbery, <span class="SpellE">Pancho</span> <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> had evidently fled
from his lookout post because the pair, <span class="SpellE">Balmeo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Caymo</span>, failed to locate him at the gate where he was
supposed to have stationed himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
be sure, the said decision itself renders the account that it was only <span class="SpellE">Balmeo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Caymo</span> who walked
together from the said house to the corner of Villanueva and F. Fernando
Streets where then they saw Armando <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span> waiting
for them in a taxi and that it was only when these three had taken to the said
taxi, and the cab was about to leave, that the shooting of Pat. Trinidad
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the homicide was committed,
therefore, <span class="SpellE">Pancho</span> <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>
could not have had the least intervention or participation as might justify
penalizing him likewise for the said killing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So far as the records disclose, the conspirators were agreed only on the
commission of robbery; there is no evidence that homicide besides was
determined by them when they plotted the crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All these warrant the exclusion of <span class="SpellE">Pancho</span> <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> from any responsibility for the said killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Basisten</span>,
et al., 47 Phil. 493) Considering that those who actually participated in the
robbery were only three, <span class="SpellE">Pancho</span> <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>
included, and only one of them was armed, the same evidently was not "in
band." (Art. 296, Revised Penal Code) This being the case, then it would
indeed be irregular or questionable to hold <span class="SpellE">Pancho</span> <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> similarly responsible as <span class="SpellE">Caymo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Balmeo</span> for the killing of Pat. <st1:place><span class="GramE">Trinidad</span></st1:place><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the code, it is only when the robbery
is in band that all those present in the commission of the robbery may be
punished for any of the assaults which its members might commit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Thus, in <u><span style="">People </span></u><u><span style="">v. </span></u><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Pascual</span></u></span><span style="">, </span>G.R.
No.</span> L-4801, June 30, 1953 (unreported), we held that where three persons
committed robbery and two of them committed rape upstairs on its occasion,
while the third guarded the owner of the house downstairs, <span style="">only </span>the two who committed the assault
should be punished for robbery with rape while the third was liable for robbery
only.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, we find the Solicitor General's recommend­ation for the
acquittal of appellant Jose <span class="SpellE">Guico</span> well founded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it seems proven that the said appellant
did participate in the first of two meetings in the dis­cussion of the <span style="">plan </span>to commit the robbery in question
by answering Armando <span class="SpellE">Manalang's</span> inquiries relating to
the intended house and its surrounding streets and the means of entrance
thereto and the channels of exit <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, the
evidence is <span style="">as </span>much that,
thereafter, his involve­ment with the conspiracy ceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be recalled that the conferences on
the robbery were held on March 23, and 24, 1955.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the first meeting, the participants were
Jose <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pancho</span> <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>, Oscar <span class="SpellE">Caymo</span>, Armando <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Arcadio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balmeo</span> and Evelyn <span style="">Villanueva.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At </span>the meeting of the 24th the same
group, save for appellant Jose <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>, conferred and
finalized the plan and, in fact, proceeded to execute the same almost
immediately after the conference adjourned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is ample and positive evidence on record that appellant Jose <span class="SpellE">Guico</span> was absent not only from the second meeting but
likewise from the robbery itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be
sure, not even the decision under appeal determined otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, even if <span class="SpellE">Guico's</span>
participation in the first meeting sufficiently involved him with the conspiracy,
such participation and involvement, however, would be inadequate to render him
criminally liable as a conspirator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conspiracy
alone, without the execution of its purpose, is not a crime punishable by law,
except in special instances (Article 8, Revised Penal Code) which, however, do
not <span style="">include </span>robbery.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, appellant Jose <span class="SpellE">Guico's</span> absence
from the second conference as well as from the robbery itself strongly points
to his evident change of mind regarding his commitment the previous day to be
in on the robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the
circumstances and under a policy of liberal consideration for timely retreat or
repentance, he may be deemed to have desisted voluntarily from the conspiracy
before the contemplated crime could actually be carried out and therefore, free
from penal accountability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Timbol</span>, et al., G.R. Nos. 47473-­47474, August <span style="">4, 1944 [</span>unreported]) As <span class="SpellE">Viada</span> expounds on the rule, "when the action of the
felony starts and the accused, because of fear or remorse desists from its continuance,
there is no attempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> If the author of the attempt,
after having commenced to execute the felony by external acts, he stops by a
free and spontaneous feeling, on the brink of the abyss, he is saved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a call to repentance, to the conscience,
a grace, a pardon which the law grants to voluntary repentance." <span class="GramE">(Cited and translated in <u><span style="">Padilla</span></u><span style="">, </span>Criminal Law, <span style="">p. 120, 1964 Ed.)</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In summary then, this Court finds appellant Oscar <span class="SpellE">Caymo</span> guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of
robbery with homicide attended by the aggravating circumstances, all recited in
the information and proven at the trial, of <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span>
and use of a motor vehicle without any compensating mitigating
circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand,
appellant <span class="SpellE">Pancho</span> <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> is

trial, as recited in the information and proven at the trial, previously
convicted for robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no

qualified to avail of the benefits of the Indeterminate Sentence Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the reasons given above, appellant Jose <span class="SpellE">Guico</span> should be, as he is hereby acquitted.</p>
