				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petitioner is a corporation engaged in the manu­facture and sale
of oxygen and acetylene gases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During
the period from <st1:date year="1953" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1953</st1:date>
to <st1:date year="1958" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1958</st1:date>, it made
va­rious sales of its products to the National Power Corpora­tion, an agency of
the Philippine Government, and to the Voice of America, an agency of the United
States Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sales to the NPC
amounted to P145<span class="GramE">,866.70</span>, while those to the VOA
amounted to P1,683, on account of which the respondent Commissioner of Internal
Revenue assessed against, and demanded from, the petitioner the payment of
P12,910.60 as deficiency sales tax and surcharge, pursuant to the follow­ing
provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 186.</span> <span class="GramE"><u>P</u><u><span style="">ercentage</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>tax</u> <u>on</u> <u><span style="">sales</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>of</u> <u><span style="">other</span></u><span style=""> <u>articles</u>.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- </span>There
shall be levied, assessed and collected once only on every original sale, barter,

eighty-five a tax equiva­lent to seven <u>per</u> <u><span style="">centum</span></u><span style=""> </span>of the

amount of the tax shall be increased by twenty-five <u><span style="">per</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>centum</u>,
the <span style="">increment </span>to be a part of
the <span style="">tax."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner denied
liability for the payment of </span>the tax on the ground that both the NPC and
the VOA are exempt from taxation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
asked for a reconsideration of the assessment and, failing to secure one,
appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court ruled that the tax on the sale of articles or goods in
section 186 of the Code is a tax on the manu­facturer and not on the buyer with
the result that the "petitioner Philippine <span style="">Acetylene </span>Company, the <span style="">manufacturer
or producer </span>of oxygen and acetylene gases sold to the National Power
Corporation, cannot claim exemption from the payment of sales tax simply
because <span style="">its buyer -- </span>the Na­tional
Power Corporation -- is exempt from the payment of all taxes." With respect
to the sales made to the VOA, the court held that goods purchased by the
American Government or its agencies from manufacturers <span style="">or </span>producers are exempt from the payment of the sales tax under
the agreement between the <span style="">Government </span>of
the Philippines and that of the United States, provided the purchases are
supported by <span style="">certificates of exemption,
</span>and since purchases amounting to only P558, out of a total of P1,683, <span style="">were </span>not covered by certificates of
exemption, only the sales in the sum of P558 were subject to the payment of
tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ac­cordingly, the assessment was
revised and the petitioner's liability was reduced from P12<span class="GramE">,910.60</span>,
as assessed by the respondent Commission, to P12,812.16.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner appealed
to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its position is that it
is not liable for the payment of tax on the sales it made to the NPC and the
VOA because both entities are exempt from taxation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The NPC enjoys tax
exemption by virtue of an act</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> of Congress, which provides as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 2.</span> To facilitate the payment of
its indebtedness, the National Power Corporation shall be exempt from all
taxes, except real property tax, and from all duties, fees, imposts, charges,
and restrictions of the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
its provinces, cities and municipalities."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is contended that the
immunity thus given to the NPC would be impaired by the imposition of a tax on
sales made to it because while the tax is paid by the manufacturer or producer,
the tax is ultimately shifted by the latter to the </span>former.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner invokes in support of its
position a 1954 opinion of the Secretary of Justice which ruled that the NPC is
exempt from the payment of all taxes "whether direct or indirect."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We begin with an analysis
of the nature of the percentage (sales) tax imposed by section </span>186 <span style="">of the Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Is it a tax on the producer or on the purchaser?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Statutes of the type under consideration,
which impose a tax on sales, have been described as "act[s] with schizophrenic
symptoms,"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> as they apparently have two faces -- one
that of a vendor tax, the other, a vendee tax.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Fortunately for us the provisions of the Code throw some light on the
problem.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Code states that the sales
tax "shall be paid by the manufacturer or producer,”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> who must "make a true and complete
return of the amount of his, her or its gross monthly sales, receipts or
earnings or gross value of output actually removed from the factory or mill
warehouse and within twenty days after the </span><span style="">end of each month, pay the tax due thereon.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But it is argued that a
sales tax is ultimately pas­sed on to the purchaser, and that, so far as the
purchas­er is an entity like the NPC which is exempt from the pay­ment of
"all taxes, except real property tax," the tax can­not be collected
from sales.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Many years ago, Mr.
Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes expressed dissatisfaction with the use of the
phrase "pass the tax on." Writing the opinion of the U.S. Supreme
Court in <u>Lash's</u> <u>Products</u> <u>v</u>. </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><u><span style="">United</span></u><span style=""> <u>States</u></span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> he said: "The phrase ‘passed the tax
on' is inaccurate, as obviously the tax is laid and remains on the manufacturer
and on him alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purchaser does not
really pay the tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He pays or may pay
the seller more for the goods because of the seller's obligation, but that is
all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * The price is the sum total
paid for the goods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amount added
because of the tax is paid to get the goods and for nothing else.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore it is part of the price * *
*."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It may indeed be that the
incidence of the tax ulti­mately settles on </span>the <span style="">purchaser, but it is not for that rea­son alone that one may validly
argue that it is a tax on the purchaser.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The exemption granted to the NPC may be likened to the immunity of the
Federal Government from state taxation and </span><u>vice</u> <u><span style="">versa</span></u><span style=""> in the federal system of government of the Unit­ed States.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the early case of </span><u>Panhandle</u> <u><span style="">Oil</span></u><span style=""> <u>Co</u>. <u>v</u>. <u>Mississ</u></span><u>ippi</u><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">the doctrine of intergovernmental tax
immunity </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">held as prohibiting the imposition of a tax
on sales </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">gasoline made to the Federal Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said the Supreme Court of the United States:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"A charge at the prescribed rate is
made on ac­count of every gallon acquired by the United States.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is immaterial that the seller and not the
purchaser <span class="GramE">is</span> required to report and make payment to
the state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sale and purchase constitute
a transaction by which the tax is measured and on which the burden rests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * The necessary operation of these
enactments when so construed is directly to retard, impede and burden the
exertion by the United States, of its constitutional powers to operate the
fleet and hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * To use the
number of gallons sold the United States as a measure of the pri­vilege tax is
in substance and legal effect to tax the sale.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>* * * And that is to tax the Unit­ed States -- to exact tribute on its
transac­tions and apply the same to the support of the state."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Justice Holmes did not agree.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In a powerful dissent joined by Justices Brandeis and Stone, he said:</p>

<blockquote>"If the plaintiff in error had paid
the tax and added it to the price the government would have nothing to
say.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could take the gasoline or leave
it but it could not require the seller to abate his charge even if it had been
arbitrarily increased in the hope of getting more from the government than
could be got from the public at large.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>*
* * It does not appear that the government would have refused to pay <span style="">a </span>price
that in­cluded the tax if demanded, but if the government had refused it would
not have exonerated the sel­ler.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * *</blockquote>

<blockquote>“* * * I am not aware that the President, the Members of the
Congress, the Judiciary or to come nearer to the case at hand, the Coast Guard
or the officials of the Veterans' Hospital [to which the sales were made],
because they are instrumentali­ties of government and <span style="">cannot </span>function naked and unfed, hitherto have been held
entitled to have their bills for food and clothing cut down so <span style="">far as </span>their
butchers and tailors have been taxed on their sales; and I had not supposed
that the butch­ers and tailors could omit from their tax returns all receipts
from the large class of customers to which I have referred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question of interfer­ence with
Government, I repeat, is one of reason­ableness and degree and it seems to me
that the interference in this case is too remote."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But time was not long in coming to confirm the soundness of
Holmes' position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon it became obvious
that to test the constitutionality of a statute by determining the party on
which the legal incidence of the tax fell was an unsatisfactory way of doing
things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fall of the bastion was <span class="SpellE">signalled</span> by Chief Justice Hughes' statement in <u>James</u>
<u>v</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Dravo</u></span> <u>Constructing</u> <u>Co</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
that "These cases [referring to Pan<span style="">handle
</span>and Indian Motorcycle Co. v. United States, 283 U.S. 570 (1931)] have
been distinguished and must be deemed to be li­mited to their particular
facts."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In 1941, <u>Alabama</u> <u>v</u>.

<span style="">United </span>States from state
taxation was not infringed by the imposition of a state sales tax with which
the seller was chargeable but </span>which <span style="">he was required to collect from the buyer, in respect of materials
purchased by a contractor with the United States on a cost-plus <span style="">basis </span>for use in carrying out its
contract, despite the fact that the economic burden of the tax was borne by the
United States.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The asserted right of the one to be
free of taxa­tion by the other does not spell immunity from paying the added
costs, attributable to the taxation of those who furnish supplies to the Govern­ment
and who have been granted no tax immunity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So far as a different view has prevailed, see Panhandle Oil Co. v.
Mississippi and Graves v. Texas Co., <u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">, </span>we think it no longer tenable."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Further inroads into the
doctrine of </span><u><span style="">Panhandle</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">were
made in 1943 </span>when <span style="">the U.S.
Supreme Court held that immun­ity from state regulation in the performance of
govern­mental functions by Federal officers and agencies did not extend to
those who merely contracted to furnish supplies or render services to the
Government even though as a re­sult of an increase in the price of such supplies
or serv­ices attributable to the state regulation, its ultimate effect may be
to impose an additional economic burden on the Government.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But if a complete
turnabout from the rule </span>announced in <u><span style="">Panhandle</span></u><span style=""> was yet to
be made, it was so made in </span>1952 in <span class="SpellE"><u>Ess</u><u><span style="">o</span></u></span><span style=""> <u>Standard</u> <u>Oil</u> </span><u>v</u>. <u>Evans</u><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
w<span style="">hich held that a contractor is not
exempt from </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">payment of a state privilege tax on the
business of storing gasoline simply because the Federal Gov­ernment with which
it has a contract for the storage of gasoline is immune from state taxation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"This tax was imposed because <span class="SpellE">Esso</span>
stored gasoline.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not * * * based
on the worth of the government property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instead, the amount collected is graduat­ed in accordance with the
exercise of <span class="SpellE">Esso's</span> privilege to engage in such opera­tions;
so it is not 'on’ the federal pro<span style="">perty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * Federal ownership of the fuel will not
immunize such a private contractor </span><span style="">from
the tax on storage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may generally, as

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We have determined the
current status of the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity in the United
States, by showing the drift of the decisions following the announce­ment of
the original rule, to point up the fact that even in those cases where
exemption from tax was sought on the ground of state <span class="GramE">immunity,</span>
the attempt has not met with suc­cess.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As Thomas Reed Powell
noted in 1945 in reviewing the development of the doctrine:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Since the <span class="SpellE"><u>Dravo</u></span> case settled
that it does not matter that the economic burden of the gross receipts tax may
be shifted to the Government, it could hardly matter that the shift comes about
by explicit agreement covering taxes rather than by being absorbed <span style="">in a </span>high­er contract price by bidders
for <span style="">a </span>contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The situation differed from that in the<span style=""> <u>Pan</u></span><u>handle</u><span style=""> and similar cases in that they </span>involved
<span style="">but two parties </span><span style="">whereas here the transaction </span>was
tripartite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These cases are condemned <span style="">in </span>so far <span style="">as </span>they rested on the economic ground of the ultimate incidence
of the burden being on the Government, but this condemnation still <span style="">leaves open the question whether either the
state or the United States when acting in governmental matters may be made
legally lia­ble to the other for a tax imposed on it as vendee.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The carefully chosen language of the Chief Justice keeps
these cases from fore­closing the issue.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>* * * Yet at the time it would have been <span style="">a </span>rash man who would find <span style="">in this a dictum that a sales tax clearly on
the Government as purchaser is invalid or a dictum </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">Congress may immunize its contractors."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">If a claim of exemption
from sales tax based on state immunity cannot command assent, much less can a claim
rest­ing on statutory grant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It may indeed be that the
economic burden of the tax finally falls on the purchaser; when it does the tax
be­comes a part of the price which the purchaser must pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not matter that an additional amount
is billed as tax to the purchaser.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
method of listing the price and the tax separately and defining taxable gross
receipts as the amount received less the amount of the tax added, merely avoids
payment by the seller of a tax on the amount of the tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The effect is still the same, namely, that
the pur­chaser does not pay the tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
pays or may pay the seller more for the goods because of the seller's
obligation, but that is all and the amount added because of the tax is paid to
get the goods and for nothing else.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But the tax burden may
not even be shifted to the purchaser at all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A decision to absorb the burden of the tax is largely a matter of
economics.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Then it can no longer be contended that a
sales tax is a tax on the purchaser.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We <span style="">therefore hold that
the tax imposed by section 186 of the National Internal Revenue Code is a tax
on the manufacturer or producer and not a tax on the pur­chaser except probably
in a very remote and inconse­quential sense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly its levy on the sales made to tax-exempt entities like the
NPC is permis­sible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This conclusion should
dispose of the same issue with respect to sales made to the VOA, except that a
claim is here made that the exemption of such sales from taxation rests on
stronger grounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even the Court of Tax
Appeals appears to share this view as is evident from the following portion of
its decision:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"With regard to petitioner's sales to the Voice of America, it
