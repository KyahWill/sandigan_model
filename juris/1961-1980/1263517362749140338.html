				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for review of the decision of the Court of Appeals in
C.A. GR-37689-R and C.A. GR-37690-R, modifying that of the Court of Agrarian
Relations in CAR cases 1185 and 1186.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner Geronimo de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes is
the owner of a 200-hectare coconut plantation located in <span class="SpellE">Calauan</span>,
Laguna.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1958 his overseer ("<span class="SpellE">katiwala</span>") therein was Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Belarmino</span>,
who took into the land the 17 respondents under an agreement that the latter
were to receive 1/7 portion of every coconut har­vest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime in October, 1962, the petitioner
dismissed <span class="SpellE">Be­larmino</span>, upon the suspicion that the
latter had been deceiving him, in connivance with the respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 2, 1963 <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> A <span class="SpellE">lcantara</span>, et al., and Gre­gorio <span class="SpellE">Espineli</span>
(respondents here) filed separate petitions (sub­sequently amended) against De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes in the Court of Agra­rian Relations, seeking the
delivery to them of the difference between the 1/7 share which the petitioner
had been giving <span style="">them </span>and the 30%
share to which they, as share tenants, were alleged­ly entitled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the finding that the respondents were
mere agri­cultural workers of the petitioner, the CAR ordered the latter to
retain them as such and to pay them the sum of P4,559.07 "which is the
total of their unpaid shares of 1/7 of the net coconut har­vests for the period
from September 13 to December 23, 1962 and February 25 to May 28, 1963,"
plus P500 as attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
respondents' appeal, the Court of Appeals modified the decision of the CAR, by
declaring the respondents <u>tenants</u> of the petitioner and ordering the
latter to pay them "the difference between the one-seventh (1/7) share of
the crops and the thirty (30%) per cent pro­vided for in the Tenancy Law from
the year 1958 up to the filing of the petitions and so on; the resulting amount
for this purpose to be arrived at in a liquidation to be submitted, if and when
this judg­ment shall have become final and the record remanded to the low­er
court."</p>

<p class="BODY">Basically, the petitioner contends that (1) there existed no
contractual relationship between him and the respondents; (2) the respondents
were not his tenants; and (3) the decision of the Court of Appeals deprives him
of his property without due process of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents attempted to have the present appeal dis­missed
on the ground that it involves questions of fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If indeed the issues posed by the petitioner
necessarily invite calibration of the entire evidence,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
then the appeal should be dismissed since issues only of law may be raised in
an appeal from the Court of Appeals to this Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
It seems to us clear, however, that the petitioner accepts the findings of fact
made by the appellate court, but takes exception to the conclusions drawn <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such be­ing
the case, the questions here tendered for resolution are pure­ly of law.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At the outset, we must resolve the question of existence of a
contract, the petitioner alleging, as he does, that his consent, express or
implied, had never been given.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
position, simply stated, is that at the time the respondents were taken into
his land by <span class="SpellE">Belarmino</span>, the latter was a mere laborer
and therefore with­out the requisite authority to contract in his behalf, and
it was on­ly later that he was promoted to the position of overseer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How­ever, in his "Amended
Complaint" of <st1:date year="1968" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1968</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
the petitio­ner prayed that "judgment be rendered ... finding the
defendants guilty of a <u>breach of their contractual obligation</u> with the
plaintiff," and in the body thereof he incorporated statements from which
it can plainly be seen that a contractual relationship existed between the
parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Verily, there was and still is a contractual relationship between
the petitioner and the respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
our view the pith of the problem is, actually, whether the relationship is that
of agricultural share tenancy (as averred by the respondents) or that of farm
employer and agricultural laborer (as asserted by the pe­titioner).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On a determination of this question depends
the respec­tive rights of the parties, more particularly the proper assess­ment
of the share of the respondents under the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of fundamental relevance in this discussion are definitions of
basic terms.</p>

<p class="BODY">"<span class="SpellE">Agricuitural</span> tenancy" is the
physical possession by a per­son of land devoted to agriculture belonging to,
or legally pos­sessed by, another for the purpose of production through the la­bor
of the former and of the members of his immediate farm household, in
consideration of which the former agrees to share the harvest with the latter,
or to pay a price certain or ascer­tainable, either in produce or in money, or
in both.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
"Share te­nancy" exists whenever two persons agree on a joint
undertaking for agricultural production wherein one party furnishes the land
and the other his labor, with either or both contributing any one or several of
the items of production, the tenant cultivating the land personally with the
aid of labor available from members of his immediate farm household, and the
produce thereof to be di­vided between the landholder and the tenant in
proportion to their respective contributions.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
And a "share tenant" is a person who, himself and with the aid
available from within his immediate farm household, cultivates the land
belonging to or possessed by ano­ther, with the latter's consent for purposes
of production, shar­ing the produce with the landholder.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be readily deduced from the foregoing definitions that
aside from the usual essential requisites of a contract,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
the characteristics of a share tenancy contract are:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(1) the parties are a landholder, who is a
natural or juridical person and is the owner, lessee, <span class="SpellE">usufructuary</span>
or legal possessor of agricultural land,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
and a tenant who, himself and with the aid available from within his immediate
farm household, cultivates the land which is the subject-matter of the tenancy;
(2) the subject-matter is agricultural land; (3) the purpose of the contract is
agricultural pro­duction; and (4) the cause or consideration is that the
landholder and the share tenant would divide the agricultural produce bet­ween
themselves in proportion to their respective contributions.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the Agricultural Tenancy Act did not define the term
"agricultural laborer" or "agricultural worker," the
Agricultural Land Reform Code does.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
"farm worker" is "any agri­cultural wage, salary or piece worker
but is not limited to a farm worker of a particular farm employer unless this
Code ex­plicitly states otherwise, and any individual whose work has ceased as
a consequence of, or in connection with, a current agrarian dispute or an
unfair labor practice and who has not ob­tained a substantially equivalent and
regular employment." The term includes "farm laborer and/ or farm
employees.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
An "agricultural worker" is not a whit different from a "farm
worker."</p>

<p class="BODY">From the definition of a "farm worker" thus fashioned,
it is quite apparent that there should be an employer-employee relationship
between the "farm employer"<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
and the farm worker.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In determining the
existence of an employer-employee relation­ship, the elements that are
generally considered are the follow­ing:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>(1) the selection and engagement of the employee; (2) the pay­ment of
wages; (3) the power of dismissal; and (4) the employer's power to control the
employee's conduct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is this last
element that constitutes the most important index of the existence of the
relationship."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This is not to say that agricultural workers or farm la­borers
are industrial workers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not by any
means, although they may both appear in the same establishment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The difference lies in the kind of work they
do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those whose labor is devoted to
purely agricultural work are agricultural laborers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All others are industrial workers.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Nonetheless, they belong to the same class.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Both are workers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both are
employees.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are here primarily interested in the basic differences between
a farm employer-farm worker relationship and an agri­cultural <span class="SpellE">sharehold</span> tenancy relationship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both, of course, are leases, but there the
similarity ends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the former, the
lease is one of labor, with the agricultural laborer as the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
of his services, and the farm employer as the <span class="SpellE">lesse</span>
thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
In the latter, it is the landowner who is the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>,
and the <span class="SpellE">sharehold</span> tenant is the lessee of
agricultural land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As lessee he has
possession of the leased premises.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
But the relationship is more than a mere lease.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is a special kind of lease, the law refer­ring to it as a "joint
<span class="SpellE">urdertaking</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
For this reason, not only the tenancy laws are applicable, but also, in a <span class="SpellE">suppletory</span> way, the law on leases, the customs of the place
and the civil code provisions on partnership.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
The share tenant works for that joint venture.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The agricultural laborer works for the farm em­ployer, and for his labor
he receives a salary or wage, regardless of whether the employer makes a
profit.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
On the other hand, the share tenant participates in the agricultural
produce.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His share is necessarily
dependent on the amount of the harvest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the relationship between farm employer and agricul­tural
laborer is that of employer and employee, the decisive fac­tor is the control
exercised by the former over the latter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, the landholder has the "right to require the
tenant to follow those proven farm practices which have been found to con­tribute
towards increased agricultural production and to use fer­tilizer of the kind or
kinds shown by proven farm practices to be adapted to the requirements of the
land." This is but the right of a partner to protect his interest, not the
control exercised by an employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
landholder and tenant disagree as to farm practices, the former may not dismiss
the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the court that shall
settle the conflict according to the best interests of both parties.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The record is devoid of evidentiary support for the notion that
the respondents are farm laborers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
do not observe set hours of work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioner has not laid down regulations under which they are supposed to do
their work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The argument tendered is
that they are guards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, it does
not appear that they are under obligation to report for duty to the petitioner
or his agent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They do not work in
shifts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor has the petitioner pres­cribed
the manner by which the respondents were and are to per­form their duties as
guards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not find here that degree
of control and supervision evincive of an employer-employee rela­tionship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, if the respondents are guards,
then they are not agricultural laborers, because the duties and functions of a
guard are not agricultural in nature.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
It is the <st1:street><st1:address>Industrial Court</st1:address></st1:street>
that has jurisdiction over any dispute that might arise between employer and
employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, the petitioner filed his
complaint against the respondents in the Court of Agrarian Relations.</p>

<p class="BODY">We now proceed to determine if there are present here the salient
characteristics of an agricultural share tenancy con­tract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The subject-matter is coconut land, which is
considered agricultural land under both the Agricultural Land Tenancy Act<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
and the Agricultural Land Reform Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
The purpose of the contract is the production of coconuts; the respondents
would receive 1/7 of the harvest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioner is the landholder of the coconut plantation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crucial factors are that the tenant must have physical
possession of the land for the purpose of production<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
and he must personally cultivate the land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the tenant does not cultivate the land personally he cannot be
considered a tenant even if he is so designated in the written agreement of the
parties.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">"Cultivation" is not limited to the plowing and
harrowing of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It includes the
various phases of farm labor described and provided by law, the maintenance,
repair and weeding of dikes, paddies and irrigation canals in the holding
Moreover, it covers attending to the care of the growing plants.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Where the parties agreed that they would "operate a citrus nursery upon
the condition that they would divide the budded citrus in the propor­tion of
1/3 share of respondents and 2/3 as share of petitioner," and that the
"petitioner would furnish all the necessary seedlings and seeds, as well
as the technical know-how in the care, cultivation, budding and balling of the
budded citrus, while respon­dents would furnish the land necessary for the
nursery, the farm labor that may be needed to plant and cultivate, and all the
che­micals, fertilizers, and bud tapes that may be necessary for such
cultivation," then "the tenancy agreement entered into bet­ween the
parties has relation to the possession of agricultural land to be devoted to
the production of agricultural products thru the labor of one of the parties,
and as such comes within the pur­view of the term 'agricultural tenancy' as
defined in section 3 of Republic Act No. 1199 as amended."<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In one instance,<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
the landholder claimed that his care­taker was not an agricultural tenant
because he "does not till or cultivate the land in order to grow the fruit
bearing trees because they are already full grown," and "he does not
even do the actual gathering of the fruits" but "merely supervises
the gathering, and after deducting the expenses, he gives one-half of the
fruits to plaintiff all in consideration of his stay in the land." This
Court's answer was to the point:</p>

<blockquote>"Anyone who has had fruit trees in his yard will disagree with
the above description of the rela­tionship.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He knows the caretaker must water the trees, even fertilize them for
better production, up­root weeds and turn the soil, sometimes fumigate to
eliminate plant pests, etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those chores
obvious­ly mean 'working or cultivating' the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, it seems that defendant <u>planted
other crops</u>, [<span class="SpellE">i</span>. e. cultivated the lot] giving
the landowner his corres­ponding share."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals made some essential findings of fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondents were called "<span class="SpellE">kasama</span>." They have <span style="">plowing im­</span>plements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
respondent Pedro <span class="SpellE">Amante</span> even used to have a <span class="SpellE">ca­rabao</span> which he subsequently exchanged for a horse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Almost all of the respondents have banana
plantations on the land. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>They <span style="">live in </span>the landholding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are charged with the obligation to clean
their respective landholdings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certain
portions of the land are planted to <span class="SpellE">palay</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">These factual findings may not be reviewed by the Supreme Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
Furthermore, the said facts are supported by the testimony of the petitioner
himself, who admitted that the respondents are his "<span class="SpellE">kasama</span>,"
although he tried to minimize the effect of this admission by alleging that
although called "<span class="SpellE">kasama</span>," the respon­dents
"do not perform the work of a '<span class="SpellE"><span style="">k</span>asama</span>'" and that <span style="">in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> </span>the "<span class="SpellE">kasama</span>"
"plow the land, they plant rice, but here in Laguna, they do not do
anything." The appellate court was correct in concluding that "<span class="SpellE">kasama</span>" means "tenant,”<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
not worker or laborer, which is translated into our national language as "<span class="SpellE">manggagawa</span>.”<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
Respecting farm implements, the petitioner admitted that "they have the
implements," but again he tried to minimize the signifi­cance of his
statement by adding that "they have not used it in the farm."
However, the report of the CAR clerk of court, based on his ocular inspection,
pertinently states that he found "certain por­tions planted with <span class="SpellE">palay</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner cannot deny that the respondents were all living
in the landholding and that "all of them have banana planta­tions, small
or big," though he averred, "not one single banana was given to me as
my share."</p>

<p class="BODY">We now come to the all-important question of whether the
respondents have the duty to cultivate the land in order that the trees would
bear more coconuts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner's
answers on cross-examination are quite revealing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>“Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where
these petitioners duty bound to do any cleaning or clearing of the underbrush
with­in the coconut land?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
laborers clean the land from where ... They are getting their food and
subsistence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"COURT:<span style=""> </span>The question is that, are they duty bound to
clean the landholding in question?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A. To make my answer short, I say
that the res­ponsibility is to Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Berlarmino</span>, to
him, because he is the one who engaged them."</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One,
to guard the property and use their names as threat to people who might ...
have the intention of stealing my coconuts, and two, to assist in the clearing
of the Land because that is the responsibility of Gon­zalo <span class="SpellE">Belarmino</span>.

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Undeniably, the petitioner considers it
one of the duties of the respondents to clear and clean the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Ad</span>ditionally,
in his com­plaint the petitioner claimed that "the defendants have
abandoned their posts at the plaintiff's plantation and have likewise failed
and refused to <u>comply with their contractual obligation</u> with the
plaintiff <u>to keep the areas respectively assigned to them clean and clear of
undergrowths and <span class="SpellE">cogonal</span> grass at all times</u>, with
the result that it is now impossible for the plaintiff to harvest the mature
coconuts as these would only be lost amid the under­growth and <span class="SpellE">cogonal</span> which have now grown to unreasonable heights,
thereby causing further damage and prejudice to the plaintiff." (emphasis
supplied)</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner clearly expected the respondents to perform the
duties of a tenant, especially, to maintain the land clean and clear "at
all times," which not only would facilitate harvesting but, more
importantly, would necessarily result in greater production.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As found by the CAR clerk of court during the
ocular inspection,</p>

<blockquote>"the planting of <span class="SpellE">palay</span>
has a direct effect on the grow­ing of the coconuts because in the places he
found planted with <span class="SpellE">palay</span>, the coconut trees displayed
white leaves gray in color with plenty of nuts or fruits, compared to the
portion in the hacienda where we encountered cogon grasses, <span class="SpellE">underbrushes</span>
and <span class="SpellE">ipil­-ipil</span> trees, there is a need for thorough
cleaning, especially the <span class="SpellE">ipil-ipil</span> trees which are
growing high for years already in-between the rows of coconut trees."<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Therefore, the parties to the contract understood, in sum and
substance, that the respondents were to "cultivate" the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether the latter had been remiss in the
performance of their contractual obligations, does not affect the nature of the
contract which the appellate court analyzed and found to be that of share
tenancy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the principal features
and stipulations which deter­mine the true essence of a contract.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
Considering then that the respondents are duty bound to cultivate their
respective holdings (of which they have possession), and that they share in the
har­vest, the Court of Appeals' conclusion must be upheld.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, es­pecially in the light of the facts that
the respondents raise secon­dary crops and have their homes in their respective
holdings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner having entered into a share tenancy con­tract with
the respondents, it certainly cannot be seriously claim­ed that the

Section 3, R.A. 1199. According to section 6 of the same law, tenancy
relationship is a juridical tie which arises bet­ween a landholder and a tenant
once they agree, expressly or impliedly, to undertake jointly the cultivation
of land belonging to the former, either under the share te­nancy or leasehold
tenancy system, as a result of which relationship the tenant acquires the right
to continue work­ing on and cultivating the land, until and unless he is dis­possessed
of his holdings for any of the just causes enume­rated in section 50 of the law
or the relationship is termi­nated on the authority of section 9 thereof.</p>

Sec. 4, RA 1199. Sec. 166(25) of the Agricultural Land Reform Code recites that
"'Share tenancy' as used in this Code means the relationship which exists
whenever two persons agree on a joint undertaking for agricultural production
wherein one party furnishes the land and the other his la­bor, with either or
both contributing any one or several of the items of production, the tenant
cultivating the land personally with the aid of labor available from members of
his immediate farm household, and the produce there­of to be divided between
the landholder and the tenant." This provision lacks only the phrase,
"in proportion to their respective contributions," to amount to an
exact re­production of the definition of share tenancy in sec. 4, RA 1199.</p>
