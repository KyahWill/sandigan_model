				<H3>DY PAC & COMPANY, INC., PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND DY PAC PAKIAO WORKERS UNION, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">At the behest of Dy Pac Pakiao Workers' Union—hereinafter referred to as the 
Union—an acting prosecutor of the Court of Industrial Relations filed therewith 
a complaint for unfair labor practice against Dy Pac &amp; Co. Inc.,—hereinafter 
referred to as the Company—and A. Santos Soriano. The latter and the Company, 
although represented by the same counsel, filed separate answers denying the 
material allegations of the complaint and setting up some special and 
affirmative defenses. After due trial the Court of Industrial Relations rendered 
a decision in favor of the Union, the dispositive part of which reads:
<blockquote>
<p>"In view of all the foregoing considerations, the respondents are hereby 
ordered to pay immediately, the backwages of the complainant workers, from the 
date of the stoppage of work in the old <i>carro</i> up to the date when this 
decision shall become final and executory, without 
reinstatement."</p></blockquote>
<p>A motion for reconsideration of this decision was denied in an unanimous 
resolution of said court sitting <i>en banc</i>. Hence, the present petition for 
review by certiorari filed by the Company.</p>
<p>The latter is a private corporation engaged in the lumber business in the 
City of Manila, where it operated two (2) —machines of a given type—referred to 
in the record as "carros"—for the sawing of ilogs. One of these "carros", which, 
seemingly, was older than the other, was operated at nighttime, by about 
nineteen (19) laborers under the supervision of A. Santos Soriano. Another group 
of persons operated the other "carro" at daytime. Said A. Santos Soriano, was, 
according to the Company, an independent contractor, but the lower court found 
that he was merely a "dummy" of the Company. Indeed, it appears that on November 
14, 1956, the laborers working under A. Santos Soriano organized the Union, and 
then notified the Company about it. Subsequently, or in January, 1957, the Union 
wrote to the Company a letter calling attention to the fact that the 
compensation paid to said laborers was below that fixed in the Minimum Wage Law, 
and requesting, among other things, an increase in their wages. Soon thereafter 
the work under the old "carro" stopped. When the laborers inquired about the 
reason therefor, the Company informed them that it had received a letter from 
Santos Soriano terminating his contract with the Company and that Santos Soriano 
was away. It was only then that the laborers learned of the alleged existence of 
a contract between the Company and Santos Soriano. Sometime in November or 
December, 1957, the old "carro" of the Company resumed. operation under Alfonso 
Soriano, a son of Santos Soriano, with another set of laborers. The Union 
members were not readmitted to the work—although they sought readmission—upon 
the ground that they were troublesome. The record shows, also, that the Union 
members were hired by Santos Soriano subject to the approval of the Company, 
which paid their wages and that although, at first, the laborers signed no 
payroll, they were later required to sign a payroll of the Company. Under the 
foregoing facts, we find that lower court did not err in concluding that Santos 
Soriano was not an independent contractor, but merely an agent of the Company 
(Madrigal Shipping Co., Inc. vs. Workmen's Compensation Commission, L-17495, 
June 1962; Velez vs. PAV Watchmen's Union, 107 Phil., 689; U. S. Lines vs. 
Associated Watchmen &amp; Security Union, L-12208-II, May 21, 1958; Asia Steel 
vs. Workmen's Compensation Commission, L-7636, June 27, 1955), and that the 
stoppage of the work of the members of the Union was due to their Union 
activities, thus constituting an unfair labor practice on the part of the 
Company.</p>
<p>It is next urged that the Court of Industrial Relations should have granted 
the motion for new trial therein filed by the Company upon the ground of fraud, 
accident, mistake or excusable negligence, because it could not introduce the 
testimony of Santos Soriano owing to the failure of their common counsel to 
locate him prior to the trial in the lower court. We find, however, no merit in 
this pretense, for there is no showing that appellant had exercised reasonable 
diligence to notify Santos Soriano of the date of the trial and assure itself of 
his presence on that occasion. Besides, no affidavit of Santos Soriano showing 
what he would testify to if a new trial were held and indicating that the result 
then would probably be otherwise, was submitted in support of said motion. 
Hence, the same was properly denied.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against 
appellant. It is so ordered.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Barrera, Dizon, 
Regala,</i> and <i>Makalintal, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
