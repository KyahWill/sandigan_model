land in question, the respondents-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> and their
predecessor-in-interest Isidro <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, had never
been in possession of said land; that the petitioners-appellants and their

been in possession of the land; that Agustin <span class="SpellE">Cabinar</span>
was the original owner and possessor of the land and subsequently had given to
the petitioners-appellants as a donation by reason of marriage in 1924; that
after acquiring the property in question, the petitioners-appellants
constructed thereon their own house of strong materials which was burned during
the Japanese occupation; that after liberation, they again constructed thereon
their house of mixed materials which was later demolished and re­placed by the
house now presently standing on the land;<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>

registration of the land in question in the names of Isidro <span class="SpellE">dela</span>
Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Sotera</span> <span class="SpellE">Medrana</span> was
fraudulently made.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence in support of the claim of the
petitioners-appellants that Isidro <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz
registered the land in question fraudulently and in breach of trust consists of
the testimonies of Faustino <span class="SpellE">Jaramil</span> and Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Barba</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Faustino <span class="SpellE">Jaramil</span> declared that when the
cadastral survey of <span class="SpellE">Umingan</span> was being undertaken,
Isidro <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz went to him and said that inasmuch
as their lots adjoin each other, Isidro <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz
would take care of the survey and represent Faustino <span class="SpellE">Jaramil</span>
in the cadastral proceedings, promising to deliver Faustino's title as soon as
Isidro's title was obtained; that upon the request of Isidro <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, Faustino <span class="SpellE">Jaramil</span> gave
the former P50.00 to defray the expenses; that in 1958 when the heirs of Isidro
<span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz caused a relocation survey of the land to
be made and claimed it as their own, Faustino <span class="SpellE">Jaramil</span>
discovered for the first time that the property had been registered <span style="">in </span>the names of Isidro <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Sotera</span> <span class="SpellE">Medrana</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Barba</span> testified that he was
one of the surveyors who took part in the cadastral survey of <span class="SpellE">Umingan</span> and that during the cadastral survey, Isidro <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz was his <span class="SpellE">cardman</span> whose
duty was to issue notification cards about the survey.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The majority opinion found the testimony of Faustino <span class="SpellE">Jaramil</span> on the alleged fraud to be incredible because:</p>

<blockquote>"Appellants rely on the bare faced claim of Faustino <span class="SpellE">Jaramil</span> that Isidro <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz
'must have deceived us' because, having been presumably entrusted with the sum
of P50.00 at the inception of the cadastral survey of <span class="SpellE">Umingan</span>,
upon the promise of Isidro <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz that he would
take care of the survey, represent Faustino in court, and secure the title, the
deceased re­gistered the land instead in his own name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears, however, that neither during the
lifetime of Isidro <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz nor after his death did
Faustino <span class="SpellE">Jaramil</span> as much as inquire from the deceased
or his heirs about the P50.00 and whether the land had been registered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fifty pesos before the war was substantial
amount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span>
<span class="SpellE">Jaramil</span> really entrusted such a sum to Isidro <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, it is certain that he would make inquiries at
least as to whether it was applied to the intended purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that he remained silent for more than
three decades bespeaks the weakness and falsity of his claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the tenor of Faustino's testimony
is that the sum was entrusted when the cadastral survey of <span class="SpellE">Umingan</span>
had just began (pp.47-48, TSN, <span class="SpellE">Axibal</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On cross-examination he declared that it was
during the cadastral survey in 1922 when Isidro <span class="SpellE">dela</span>
Cruz told him that he would be responsible for the survey (p. 58, Ibid.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This declaration renders the whole story
about the alleged breach of trust unworthy of rational belief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For from the very evidence of the defense,
the appellants' alleged acquisition of the property took place only in 1924,
when it was donated to them on the occasion of their marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It results that Isidro <span class="SpellE">dela</span>
Cruz had no reason to broach to them in 1922 the idea of registering the land
in their behalf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of
Faustino's incre­dible testimony, we will not impute fraud or breach of trust
on Isidro <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, whose lips have long been sealed
by death."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">It
is indeed odd that Faustino <span class="SpellE">Jaramil</span> had not taken
steps to verify whether or not the title to the land in question had been
registered in his name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence
shows that the cadastral court had adjudicated the land in question to Isidro <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Sotera</span> <span class="SpellE">Medrana</span> on April 17, 1926 and on March 15, 1932, Original

take any steps to cause the transfer of the title to the land to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only when the private respondents
instituted in 1958 Civil Case No. T-535 in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> to recover the possession of the land in

promise that he would take care of the survey and secure the title for Faustino
<span class="SpellE">Jaramil</span>, the said Isidro <span class="SpellE">dela</span>
Cruz caused the land in question to be registered in his name and that of his

neither during the lifetime of Isidro <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz nor
after his death no inquiry had been made by Faustino <span class="SpellE">Jaramil</span>
about the P50.00 and whether the land had been registered in his name.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The preponderance of the evidence is that Isidro <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Sotera</span> <span class="SpellE">Medrana</span> did not perpetrate fraud in having the title to the

<blockquote>"It is idle to bother as to whether the action here is one
founded exclusively on fraud which prescribes in four (4) years <span style="">or </span>one based on constructive trust
which is barred after ten years, there being no question that the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> secured their title more than twenty years before
the filing of the complaint, and it is from the date of the issuance of such
title that the effective assertion of adverse title for purposes of the statute
of limitations is counted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Gerona vs.

<p class="BODY">The cause of action of the petitioners-appellants for the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> to them of the title to the land in question
