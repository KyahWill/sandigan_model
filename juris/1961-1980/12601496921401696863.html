<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The City of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> appeals from the decision of the Court of First 
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> in Civil Case No. 620 entitled 
"Enrique R. Yu King vs. City of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>" declaring 
void Ordinances Nos. 340, 503 and 672 of the City Council of said city and 
ordering it to refund to Yu King the amount of P26,779.92 paid by the latter as 
specific or license tax on the gasoline, kerosene and oil sold by him from 
November 9, 1950 to December 20, 1955, pursuant to said ordinances, with legal 
interest from the date of the complaint and to pay attorney's fees in the sum of 
P1,000.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On July 17, 1956, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed the abovementioned action in the Court of 
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> alleging in his complaint 
that he was engaged in the business of buying and selling gasoline, kerosene and 
oil in the City of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>; that on October 6, 1950, 
the City Council passed Ordinance No. 340, which, among other things, imposed a 
specific tax of P0.50 per liter of gasoline sold, P0.02 per liter of lubricating 
oil, P0.01 per gallon of kerosene and P0.01 per gallon of crude oil sold; that 
said ordinance was superseded by Ordinance No. 503 approved on December 29, 1952 
and later by Ordinance No. 672 approved on December 29, 1954, imposing an 
Identical tax on the sale of the aforementioned items; that Ordinance No. 340 
was approved with retroactive effect as of October 1, 1950 and all said 
ordinances were passed as emergency measures; that pursuant thereto, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was forced to pay to the City Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> from November 9, 1950 to December 20, 1955 the 
total amount of P26,779.92 as specific or license tax on the gasoline, kerosene 
and oil sold by him; that said ordinances were null and void because (1) 
Ordinance No. 340 was made to have a retroactive effect; (2) they were enacted 
and passed as emergency measures without their having been previously so 
certified by the City Mayor as provided for in paragraph (f), Section 10, 
Article II of Commonwealth Act No. 39, as amended, and (3) they were <i>ultra 
<span class="SpellE">vires</span></i> since no power to impose said tax has been 
granted to the City of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> under its charter 
(Commonwealth Act No. 39, as amended); and that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had demanded the refund of said sum of P26,779.92 
from appellant, thru its City Treasurer, but failed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">For its part, appellant City 
claimed that the questioned ordinances were valid, as they were passed by the 
City Council of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> pursuant to Section 10 of 
Article 2, paragraph (f) of Commonwealth Act No. 39, as amended, and were 
authorized under its taxing power, as provided for in Section 14 (M) of its 
charter, which authority to enact said ordinances was confirmed by Congress in 
Section 4 of Republic Act No. 1435, approved June 14, 1956, which provides, 
among other things, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Section 
4.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> Municipal 
boards or councils may, notwithstanding the provisions of section one hundred 
and forty-two and one hundred and forty-five of the National internal Revenue 
Code as hereinabove amended, levy an additional Tax of not exceeding twenty-five 
per cent of the rates fixed in said sections, on manufactured oils sold or 
distributed within the limits of the city or municipality; Provided, That 
municipal taxes heretofore levied by cities through city ordinances on gasoline, 
airplane fuel, lubricating oil and other fuels, are hereby ratified and declared 
valid. The method of collecting said additional tax shall be prescribed by the 
Municipal board or council concerned." <o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">and</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, finally, that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> did not pay the taxes in dispute under protest as 
shown by the official receipts issued to him by appellant as enumerated in its 
answer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After due trial, the court 
rendered the decision appealed from.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Main questions to be determined 
in this appeal are firstly, whether the City of 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Zamboanga</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> had authority to enact the 
questioned ordinances, and secondly, whether or not they were properly enacted 
and approved as emergency measures.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The first question must be 
answered in the affirmative for it appears that under Section 14 (a) of 
Commonwealth Act No. 39, as amended, the City of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> has the power "to tax, fix the license fee for x 
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> regulate the business 
and fix the location of match factory or factories xxx the storage and sale of 
gunpowder x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> coal, oil, 
gasoline, <span class="SpellE">benzine</span> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> petroleum, or any of the products thereof and of all other 
highly combustible or explosive materials".<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The authority of the City of 
<span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> to Impose the tax in question being thus 
clear, the remaining question is whether the ordinances aforesaid are void 
because Ordinance No. 340 was made retroactive and the three other ordinances 
were not duly certified by the City Mayor as required by paragraph (f) Section 
10, Article 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 39, as amended.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellee</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> contends that although the 
ordinances in question were approved as emergency measures there is no proof 
that they had been previously certified by the City Mayor. In this connection it 
is obvious that it was incumbent upon <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to 
prove the absence or lack of certification, he having gone to court to seek the 
annulment of said ordinance precisely upon that ground. To this we must add 
that, even if said ordinances are emergency measures, the presumption must be 
that official duty in connection with their enactment had been duly complied 
with, in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">With respect to the retroactive 
effect given to Ordinance No. 340, it will be observed that the same was passed 
on October 6, 1950 and it was made effective or retroactive as of October 1 of 
the same yearâ€”a matter of five days, lie do not believe such insignificant 
circumstance could render the measure void. Besides, said ordinance was 
superseded by Ordinance No. 50 enacted on </span><st1:date month="12" day="29" year="1950"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 29, 
1950</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
while the present action was commenced only on </span><st1:date month="7" day="17" year="1956"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 
17, 1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Having arrived at the above 
conclusions, we deem it unnecessary to consider and pass upon the other 
questions raised in appellant's brief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the decision appealed from is 
hereby reversed and, as a result, the complaint filed by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> in the lower court is dismissed, with costs. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><i><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Concepcion</span></i></span><i><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>, J.P., <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span> </span></i><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">and<i> Sanchez, <span class="GramE">JJ<span style="font-style: normal;">.,</span></span></i>
