Court of First Instance of Manila entitled "People of the Philippines
versus Ramon <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> y Contreras, Elias Gloria y
Bernardino, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> y Garcia and <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> y <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>",
pursuant to section 9, Rule 122 of the Rules of Court (sec. 9, Rule 118 of the
old Rules), one of the accused therein, <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> y <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>, having been
sentenced by the trial court to the supreme penalty of "Death".</p>

<p class="BODY">The above-named <span class="GramE">accused were</span> prosecuted
in the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> for the crime of murder, the pertinent
information for which, filed on July 12, 1961, alleged as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 10th day of July, 1961, in the City of
Manila, Philippines, the said accused, being all detained prisoners, did then
and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with intent to kill, with
evident premeditation and treachery, and with the use of superior strength,
attack, assault and hit with pieces of wood Roberto <span class="SpellE">Monreal</span>
y <span class="SpellE">Calbario</span>, another detained prisoner, several times
on different parts of his body, thereby inflicting upon said Roberto <span class="SpellE">Monreal</span> y <span class="SpellE">Calbario</span> mortal
physical injuries which were the direct and immediate cause of his <span class="GramE">death</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Contrary to law."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">All the said accused pleaded "not guilty" to the charge
when they were arraigned on <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="7">July 17,
 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the
prosecution presented its evidence consisting of the testimonies of:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) Dr. Mariano B. Lima, Chief of the
Medico-Legal Section, MPD, (b) Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Villalon</span>, a
prisoner serving sentence for robbery in the City Jail of Manila; (c) Pat. Crispin
<span class="SpellE">Umaging</span>, MPD; (d) <span class="SpellE">Servillano</span>
N. David, Chemical Analyst, MPD; (e) <span class="SpellE">Det</span>. Cpl. Carlos

<span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>, MPD; and (g) Pat. <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Leaño</span>, MPD.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Various exhibits, identified and marked during the trial, were also
offered in evidence, among them:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">B, the necropsy report; <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> H-1, a piece of wood stained with blood; <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">I, a blanket with human blood
stains; <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">J, the extra­judicial
statement of accused Elias Gloria; <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">K, the extra-judicial statement of accused <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Peña</span>; <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">L, the extra-judicial statement of accused Ra­mon <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>; <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">M, the extra-judicial statement of accused Francisco <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>; and <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">N, the extra-judicial statement of prisoner Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Villalon</span>, the eyewitness to the killing of the victim
inside Cell 2-A of the city jail who testified for the People.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the aforesaid extra-judicial statements
were objected to by the defense as "hearsay evidence", but were,
nevertheless, admitted by the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Soon after the prosecution rested its case, accused Ramon <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> filed a Motion to Dismiss dated June 1, 1964,
followed by accused Francisco <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> who also
submitted his own Motion <span class="GramE">To</span> Dismiss dated June 4,
1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an order dated August 7, 1964,
the trial court granted the motion of Francis­co <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>
as against whom the case was dismissed for insufficiency of evidence, but the
motion to dis­miss filed by Ramon <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> was denied
in the same order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused Elias
Gloria subsequently escaped from the New <span class="SpellE">Bilibid</span>
Prisons in <span class="SpellE">Muntinlupa</span> and has since then remained at
large; so, the case as against him had to be suspended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Trial continued and evidence was presented
for the defense of <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>
and Ramon <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>; but the latter, on February 10,
1965, died of "<span class="SpellE">asphyxial</span> cardio-respiratory
failure" (<span class="SpellE">bangungot</span>), and the case was likewise
dismissed as against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was,
therefore, submitted for decision on <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="2">February
 16, 1965</st1:date>, as against the only remaining accused, <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>, who, as earlier
stated, now stands convicted of the crime of murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our own examination of the record of the case revealed the
circumstances surrounding the killing of Roberto <span class="SpellE">Monreal</span>
inside Cell 2-A, City Jail of Manila an July 10, 1961, as testified to by the
lone eyewitness, Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Villalon</span>, who was serving
sentence in the same cell of the said jail at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The gist of his testimony follows, to wit:</p>

<p class="BODY">About an hour or so before <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>
in the evening of <st1:date year="1961" day="10" month="7">July 10, 1961</st1:date>,
Roberto <span class="SpellE">Monreal</span> was lying on his belly on a mat on the
cement float of Cell 2-A, City Jail of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The count of prisoners inside had just been taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that cell, measuring about 7 by 15 meters,
were some 80 inmates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cots were not
enough for them and some had to sleep on mats on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The place was illuminated, for the big bulbs
were on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some six (6) meters, from the
place where <span class="SpellE">Monreal</span> was abed on the cement floor and
about five (5) meters from Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Villalon</span> ten (the
witness) who was seated on top of a double-deck bed were the accused Elias
Gloria and <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>;
they (Gloria and <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>) talked in whispers for about
two (2) minutes and <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>
pointed to <span class="SpellE">Monreal</span> with his left thumb.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Monreal</span> who was
lying on the floor (<span class="SpellE">nakadapa</span>) was awake, but he did
not see Elias Gloria and <span class="SpellE">Rufiuo</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>
as they talked because there were beds between them, although the latter could
see <span class="SpellE">Monreal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, Gloria and <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> left walking
towards the end of the cell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon, there
was a relief of guards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Villalon</span> left the double-deck bed where he was after about
five minutes and laid himself on the cement floor beside Roberto <span class="SpellE">Monreal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He slept,
about one (1) meter distant from the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="15" hour="11">11:15</st1:time>,
shortly after he fell asleep, Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Villalon</span> was
awakened by some noise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He got up in a sitting
position and saw that Roberto <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Monreal</span></span>
who was beside him, was being beaten with a piece of wood by Elias Gloria who
was standing near.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Villalon</span>
moved aside, still in his sitting position, farther away from <span class="SpellE">Monreal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Elias
Gloria hit <span class="SpellE">Monreal</span> with the piece of wood a number of
times, about three (3) times; and each time he delivered a blow, Elias Gloria cursed
at the victim:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Ikaw</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bahala</span> Ka".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Blood was seen as Roberto <span class="SpellE">Monreal</span> lay
prostrate on the cement floor, motionless, his body half-covered with a blanket
with the head and right arm exposed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Elias Gloria had companions with him at the time he was beating <span class="SpellE">Monreal</span> but <span class="SpellE">Villalon</span> who <span class="GramE">was near</span> failed to recognize them nor was he able to
ascertain their number for there was already a commotion inside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, nobody was near the place where
Elias Gloria was beating Roberto <span class="SpellE">Monreal</span>; the other
inmates were all far.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the beating,
Elias Gloria dropped the piece of wood and left the place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Villalon</span>
then stood and ran away.</p>

<p class="BODY">Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Villalon</span> testified further
that he was confined in the city jail only on <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1961</st1:date>, but he has come to know of the existence of
gangs or organizations of inmates there - the "OXO", the "<span class="SpellE">Sigue-Sigue</span>" and the "<span class="SpellE">Bahala</span>
Na".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He knows the victim, Roberto <span class="SpellE">Monreal</span>, who was with him for three (3) days inside Cell
2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were later transferred together
to Cell 2-A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have stayed together
since then, during the three days that they were confined in Cell 2-<span class="GramE">A</span> immediately preceding the night of the incident. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The accused are also known to Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Villalon</span> because they use to eat together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He knows them to be members of the <span class="SpellE">Sigue-Sigue</span> Gang, while the victim was affiliated with the <span class="SpellE">Bahala</span> Na Gang during his lifetime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Villalon</span>
was not aware of the existing feud between these organizations or
"gangs", but he learned about it on that very night of the incident
because at about 8:00 or 9:00 o'clock that very same evening there was trouble
inside Cell 2, just beside Cell 2-A, where Arturo <span class="SpellE">Forcuna</span>
@ Boy Golden (a "<span class="SpellE">Bahala</span> Na" gang member)
and some of his companions in Cell 2, were beaten by members of the <span class="SpellE">Sigue-Sigue</span> Gang.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Boy Golden was transferred to the cell bodega after the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admitted though that he does not know the
cause of the gang rivalry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also
confessed that he has tattoo marks on the parts of his body symbolizing
membership in the <span class="SpellE">Bahala</span> Na Gang, but he explained
that he was forced to join the organization after the killing of Roberto <span class="SpellE">Monreal</span> because subsequent thereto "there was no place
where I could be put in the City Jail."</p>

<p class="BODY">Other witnesses for the prosecution testified to the following
effect:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon after the beating, the
prison guards came.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Four detained
prisoners were ordered to carry the victim to a jeep which took Roberto <span class="SpellE">Monreal</span> to the <st1:place><st1:placename>North</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>General</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
where he was pronounced "dead on arrival".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The policemen searched the cell for the
objects used in the killing while the desk sergeant notified the Homicide
Section of the MPD.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Detectives from the
Homicide Section arrived later; they conducted an ocular inspection of the
scene of the crime, and then took custody of the seven suspects delivered to
them by Capt. <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> along with several pieces of
wood found inside the cell and a blood stained blanket.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the City Jail, the seven detention
prisoners picked were taken to the Headquarters of the MPD.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A verbal investigation ensued wherein inmates
Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Villalon</span> and Alfredo de la Rosa pointed to
their co-prisoners Elias Gloria, Ramon <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>,
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> as the persons responsible for the killing of Roberto <span class="SpellE">Monreal</span>, and these persons, when questioned about the
incident, admitted their participation in the killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, their individual statements were
reduced to writing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Det</span>.
Cpl. Carlos Martin, Jr. took the statements of accused Elias Gloria and <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
J &amp; R); <span class="SpellE">Det</span>. Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> reduced to writing the statements of accused
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> and witness Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Villalon</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">L
&amp; N); while the statement of accused Francis­co <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> M) <span class="GramE">was</span> taken by
Pat. <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Leano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The investigations were taken simultaneously,
although separately and independently.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were conducted in one room at the headquarters of the Manila Police
Department in the presence of all the investigators and the answers given to
them could be heard by the others.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Except the accused Francisco <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> who does
not know how to read, and whose statement was first read to him by <span class="SpellE">Det</span>. Cpl. Martin, Jr., all the rest personally read their
respective statements after the investigation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The statements were all signed before office hours started the day
following the night of the incident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After evaluating the statements, they were forwarded to the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> Office by the Homicide Section of the MPD.</p>

<p class="BODY">The medico-legal officer who conducted the autopsy on the body of
the victim found two (2) lacerated wounds at the back of the head, any of which
could have caused the death of Roberto <span class="SpellE">Monreal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were fatal because of the fracture of
the cranium which caused hemorrhage all over the brain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other superficial skin lacerations were found
above the left eye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was of the
opinion that the wounds could have been caused by a blunt instrument, like a
piece of wood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also ventured to say
that the victim could be in a lying position when he was hit by the blunt
instrument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The chemist who examined the
pieces of wood and the blanket recovered by the police from the scene of the
crime testified, on the other hand, that the piece of wood measuring
1-1/2" x 1-1/4" x 23" (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. H-1) and
the colored blanket (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. I) contained human blood,
although be was not able to ascertain whe­ther the blood found in said exhibits
were those of the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>
testified in his own defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He denied
whatever participation in the incident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He repudiated his confession and claimed that he signed his confession
after he had been maltreated by the policemen inside the jail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He declared that as soon as he, Elias Gloria,
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>
reached the Homicide Section at the MPD Headquarters, <span class="SpellE">Det</span>.
<span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> and his Companions repeatedly asked him if
he had anything to do with the killing of Roberto <span class="SpellE">Monreal</span>
inside Cell 2-A, to which he consistently answered "that he had nothing to
do with it".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dissatisfied with his
answer, <span class="SpellE">Det</span>. <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> and
his companions brought him inside the toilet, and once there, <span class="SpellE">Det</span>. <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> and his companions
started giving him blows on different parts of his body - his face, belly, neck
and stomach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He remembered that <span class="SpellE">Det</span>. <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> repeatedly boxed
him; one of his companions gave him three (3) blows, while another boxed him <span class="GramE">four(</span>4) times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
continued boxing him inside the toilet for about ten minutes, during which the
lost consciousness for shout three (3) times, and for which reason he could not
exactly remember how many blows they gave him at different parts of his
body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even with such punishment, he
told them that he had nothing to do with the clubbing of <span class="SpellE">Monreal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They made him lie down on a long bench inside
the toilet after that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the
companions of <span class="SpellE">Det</span>. <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>
sat on his stomach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They held his
hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A towel was placed over his mouth
and nose and then they started pouring 7-Up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The treatment lasted for about five (5) minutes, after which he lost
consciousness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He regained his senses
after that, but because he could no longer bear the punishment, he asked them
to prepare a statement which he would sign.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was given several sheets of paper after that which he signed without
knowing their contents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was about early
the next morning following the incident in Cell 2-A when they asked him to sign
the statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He owned the signature
appearing on the statement he signed (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. K, p. 185,
Record), but maintained that the answers to the question appearing thereon were
not his.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only questions they
repeatedly asked him was "if I know anything about the clubbing of <span class="SpellE">Monreal</span>", and to which question he answered "that
I did not have anything to do with it".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He could not remember if he was ever asked if he had been maltreated; he
could not remember anything because he lost <span class="SpellE">consciouness</span>
several times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not remember also
whether they asked him where he lived at the time, but admitted that the
residence, civil status and age appear­ing in <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. K <span class="GramE">were</span> correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His co-accused
and he were neighbors outside jail, and they all belonged to the "<span class="SpellE">Sigue-Sigue</span> Gang" inside the jail.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the maltreatment in the hands of the police officers at the
headquarters of the MPD, he had hearing in Branch 16 of the Court of First Instance
of Manila in connection with another case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He could not remember whether it was on <st1:date year="1961" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1961</st1:date>, or not, but during that hearing, he told
his parents about the maltreatment they have given him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His parents informed an attorney about it and
the latter had <span class="GramE">him</span> examined the Medico-Legal Section
of the Manila Police Department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
could not remember, however, the name of the Doctor who examined him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time, his face and body were swollen.</p>

<p class="BODY">Like his co-accused Ramon <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> also signed his name
on a blank sheet of paper in open court which was <span class="SpellE">makred</span>
as <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">1-Peña (p. 270, Record) in
his attempt to show that the signature on <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
K was made by him under her duress.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing evidence, the lower court found <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> guilty of murder for
the killing of Roberto <span class="SpellE">Monreal</span> in the night of <st1:date year="1961" day="10" month="7">July 10, 1961</st1:date>, holding that the proof
of <u>corpus</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>delicti</u></span> plus the testimony of
the <span class="SpellE">Ione</span> eyewitness and the confession of the accused
afford more than sufficient bases of conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in its deci­sion dated <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1965</st1:date>, said accused was
sentenced to death; to indemnify the heirs of the victim in the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>; and to pay one-fourth (1/4) of the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The judgment of conviction is here assailed by counsel de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span> appointed to represent the accused <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> in this review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said counsel submitted an enlightening brief
espousing the cause of the convicted man.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Solicitor General, on the other hand, failed to submit any brief notwithstanding
seventeen (17) extensions of time within which to submit one that were
requested by him and granted by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the case of the People was deemed submitted for decision without
any brief.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first important question posed in this review is
procedural:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>whether or not the trial court
was right in admitting in evidence, against <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> his own extra-judicial confession (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
<span class="GramE">K), and the respective extra-judicial confessions (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">J, L and M of his co-accused
Elias Gloria, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> and Ramon Francisco.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that accused Elias Gloria never
testified in court in this case because he escaped from confinement in <span class="SpellE">Muntinlupa</span> during the trial and was never arrested
thereafter; so with accused Francisco <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> as
against whom the case was dismissed by order of the court on August 7,
1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He neither testified for the
prosecution nor for the defense of any of the other accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was shown by the prosecution that all the
accused were investigated in the same room at the headquarters of the MPD, but
there is no showing, since they were investigated simultaneously and separately
by different investigators, that <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Paña</span> knew that Elias Gloria and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> had implicated him in the killing of Roberto <span class="SpellE">Monreal</span> in their statements, or that <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Peña</span> was thereafter informed about the contents of
their statements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have no doubt,
therefore, that the extra-judicial statements of Elias Gloria (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. J) and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. M) may not be directly introduce in evidence as proof
of specific facts against accused <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>, in accordance with the well-settled rule that
extra-judicial statements of an accused implicating his co-accused may not be
utilized against the latter unless repeated in open court.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The said extra-judicial confessions of Elias Gloria and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> are admissible only against them but not against <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> as to <span class="GramE">whom</span> they are hearsay evidence, for the latter never had any
opportunity to cross-examine them.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, these rules admit of
exceptions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it has been held that
where confessions had been made by several accused and there could have been no
collusion with reference to them, the fact that the statements are in all
material respects identical is confirmatory of the testimony of an accomplice.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
It will be noted, however, that there is a marked difference between the case
of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Badilla</span> and the one at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the <span class="SpellE">Badilla</span>
case, several accused were charged under an information alleging conspiracy,
unlike in this case where there was no such allegation in the information and
the defense had seasonably objected to the admission of any evidence, including
Exhibits J and M, tending to prove conspiracy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But even if conspiracy were properly alleged and proven in this case,
the admissibility of Exhibits J and M as against accused <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Peña</span> should be qualified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So explained this Court in that case of
People vs. <span class="SpellE">Badilla</span>:</p>

<blockquote>"In other words, while an extra-judicial declaration of a
co-cons­pirator may not be directly introduced in evidence against another
co-conspirator as proof of specific facts, it may nevertheless under certain
conditions <u>be taken into consideration as a circumstance in the credibility
of the testimony</u> of an accomplice." [Underscoring Ours]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">We find no plausible reason why the
principle should not be made to apply to this case where several accused had
been charged together of a crime without any allegation of conspiracy; but with
the above-quoted authority, there could be no doubt that for purposes of
proving the fact that <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>
participated in the killing of Roberto <span class="SpellE">Monreal</span> as
declared by his co-accused Elias Gloria and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>
in their extra-judicial confessions Exhibits J and M, the said statements are
objectionable, although the court may consider the fact that the confessions of
<span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> and those of
his co-accused Elias Gloria and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> are,
in all material respects, identical as a circumstance in judging the
credibility of <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña's</span>
testimony in court for which purpose Exhibits J and M are admissible against
the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same rule of qualified
admissibility is applicable to the extra-judicial confession of accused Ramon <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> as against <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused Ramon <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> testified in court for his own defense and was
questioned at length about his extra-judicial confession (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
L) <span class="GramE">which</span> he repudiated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He died sometime thereafter; that is why the
case as against him had been dismissed, but his said confession was legally
before the court with the extra-judicial confessions of all the other accused and
We do not think that the trial court erred in taking cognizance of the fact
that they were substantially in accord for purposes of passing upon <span class="SpellE">Rufi­no</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña's</span> credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña's</span> own statement (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. K), on
the other hand, is competent evidence as against him for all purposes under the
Rules,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
provided that its authenticity and <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> are
beyond question.</p>

<p class="BODY">This brings <span class="GramE">Us</span> to the defense of <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> that his statement <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. K is involuntary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But first, let us examine the contents of that extra-judicial confession.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that the confession was taken by <span class="SpellE">Det</span>.
Cpl. Carlos Martin, Jr. in the presence of <span class="SpellE">Det</span>. Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> at the
headquarters of the MPD in the early morning of July 11, 1961, about seven (7)
hours after the commission of the crime or at about 6:20 a.m., to be
precise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that statement, <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> appears to have
declared in <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span> dialect, substantially as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that he was 21 years of age,
sin­gle, a boy at Cine <span class="SpellE">Esa</span> at <span class="SpellE">Herbosa</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, Manila, and was presently residing in the same
place at 440 <span class="SpellE">Herbosa</span>; that he knew why he was at the
headquarters of the MPD at the time, i.e., there was a man they kill­ed the
night before inside Cell 2-A; that he knew the person they killed only by face;
that they agreed to attack (<span class="SpellE">tirahin</span>) that person
because he was a member of the "<span class="SpellE">Bahala</span> Na
Gang"; that there was nothing wrong at all being a member of that gang,
only there was already feud between the two gangs; that those who agreed to
kill the man were Boy AA, Ely, <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> and he (<span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> appears to have been
asked to point to the persons he mentioned and pointed to <span class="SpellE">Ramons</span>
<span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> as Boy AA, to Elias Gloria as Ely, and to
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> as <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>,
who were then all present in the same room where the investigation was
conducted); that they agreed to kill the man at about 9:00 that evening (to a
similar question that followed, the answer given was:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that they agreed to kill the man that same
evening after the roll call at about 11:00 o'clock.); that when they first came
near the man to strike him, the man was lying on the cement floor on his back (<span class="SpellE">tihaya</span>), one of his arms raised near his head; that the
first to come near the man was Boy AA who immediately cover­ed the face of the
man with a blanket; that the blanket shown to him (he appears to have been
shown the bloodstained blanket recovered by the police at the scene or the
crime) was the one used by Boy AA in covering the face of the man they hit;
that the piece of wood (measuring 1-1/2" x 1-1/4" x 23") shown
to him was the one used by them in hitting the man; that they alternately used
(<span class="SpellE">aming</span> <span class="SpellE">pinagpasahan</span>) that
piece of wood, until all of them were able to hit the man; that he was the
first one to strike, followed by <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>; the next was
Ely, and the last one was Boy AA; that the place where they killed the man was
the cement floor where he was lying inside Cell 2-A; that they made the killing
at about 11:00 o'clock after the roll call; that they decided to kill the man
because the "<span class="SpellE">Bahala</span> Na Gang" were all
enemies; that he studied in school and finished Grade III; that he knew how to
read and understood <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>; and that having read and
understood the contents of the statement, he is willing to sign the same to
attest to the truth of what he had therein stated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>
claimed during the trial of the case that his confession (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
K was signed by him only after the members of the MPD had given him a countless
number of blows all over his body, and after they mercilessly gave him repeated
doses of 7-Up treatment into his nose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He testified that as a result of the torture he received in the hands of
policemen who investigated him, his body and face were swollen, and when
sometime thereafter, he appeared before a branch of the Court of First Instance
of Manila in connection with another case, he then informed his parents about
the maltreatment; that his parents contacted a certain attorney who had him
examined in the Medico-Legal Section of the Police Department of Manila by one
of the doctors there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet, no
medical certificate of the doctor who examined him then we ever presented in
the court below; nor was the alleged medico-legal officer who conducted the
examination, asked to testify in the said proceeding even as the prosecution
had re­minded the defense counsel that he had not presented the doctor ho
allegedly conducted the examination, to testify.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that the said counsel asked
permission from the court to confer with accused <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Peña</span>, after which conference, he announced that he
was not calling the doctor who conducted the alleged examination anymore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That circumstance, to our mind, is the best
evidence refuting his statement in court that he had been subject of barbaric
practices by the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We really see
no reason why such evidence had been suppressed, if the accused was sincere in
his allegations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are inclined,
therefore, to discard the torture theory of the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the face of the confession, We see no
sign of suspicious circumstances tending to cast doubt upon its integrity; the
answers given to the questions were responsive and informative, and we are
satisfied that the said confession was voluntary.</p>

<p class="BODY">But counsel for herein <span class="SpellE">reviewee</span> argues
that the extra-judicial confession (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. K) of <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> does not show
"suspicious circumstances", is "replete with details",
"reflects spontaneity and coherence", and the "response therein
to every interrogatory is fully informative", because the said statement was
prepared by the police investigator who propounded the questions and answered
them himself; and that the accused had nothing to do whatever with said
statement except to sign it, after the use of force and violence against
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel draws this conclusion from
the explanation given by the police investigator who conducted the
investigation of the accused in this case that they first conducted a verbal <span class="GramE">examination</span> of all the suspects of the inquiry and only
after they were sure that the persons investigated had something to do with the
crime, were their statements reduced to written form.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent portions of the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Det</span>. <span class="SpellE">Cpt</span>. Carlos Martin, Jr. of
the MPD on this point, follows"</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">We have studied carefully the import of
the foregoing testimony and searched the record with painstaking solicitude,
but we failed to find it was the investigator himself who propounded the
questions and at the same time gave the answers appearing in <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. K, much less, the claim that said accused had no part
in the preparation of the confession except to sign it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our own examination of the extra-judicial statements
shows that all the accused in this case had revealed therein their individual
participations in the killing of the victim and the participation of the
others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Accused Elias
Gloria states in his confession Exhibit J, that Ramon <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>,
Alfredo de la Rosa, <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>
and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> were his companions in killing

<span class="GramE">L, to Elias Gloria and <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> as his companions.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused Francisco <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>,
on the other hand, points to Elias Gloria; <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> and Ramon <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> as the
persons he saw who struck at the victim, with himself taking no part therein;
while the accused <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>
in his confession points to Ramon <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>, Elias
Gloria, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> and himself as the ones who killed
the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other inconsistencies in the
manner these accused took turns in hitting the victim are significant:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, Elias Gloria declared that Ramon <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> was the first to hit with the piece of wood,
followed by Alfredo de la Rosa; then by <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>; <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> was next, with
himself delivering the last blow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña's</span> declaration was to
the effect that he was the first to hit the victim with the piece of wood,
followed by <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>, then Gloria and finally <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ramon <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>, on the other hand, declared in his statement that
it was <span class="SpellE">Rufi­no</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> who
first delivered the blow with the piece of wood, followed by Elias Gloria;
while Francisco <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> stated that it was Elias
Gloria, <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> and
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> who struck at the victim with the piece
of wood in that order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
circumstances may be considered in support of the claim of the police officers
who conducted the investigations of the accused that they conducted the
examinations separately and simultaneously without collusion either on the part
of the investigators or on the part of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sane circumstances may be considered in
disputing the veracity of <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña's</span>
claim that he did not give any of the answers appearing in his confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this effect was the holding of this Court
in a similar case:<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">This</span> inconsistency, the way we look at it, is additional
proof that the confession was indeed voluntary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ordinarily, if the confession was prepared by the Constabulary agents
themselves and imposed upon the appellants, it would be as perfectly tight as
the agents could have done it leaving the appellants no possibility of escape
from his guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Of course, <span class="GramE">We</span> are not unaware that some

confessions through violence and intimidation.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
But the trial court did not give credence to the claim of the accused that he
had no part in the preparation of his confession and that he signed it only
after he was tortured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having seen the
manner and demeanor of the witnesses during the trial, the matter of assigning
values to their statements in court is within the better competence of trial
courts,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
and <span class="GramE">We</span> find no compelling reason to disturb the
findings of the lower court on this point in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, We find the testimonies of the
police officers who testified in this case to be credible, and We cannot but be
slow to believe that these officers would be so totally devoid of conscience
and so recreant to official duty as to confabulate together in pinning a
capital offense on an innocent <span class="GramE">man</span> without apparently
any reason <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>; and no such reason has here been
shown.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Suffice it to say that the crime committed in this case took place inside the
city jail; the police had conducted an investigation of the inmates there
immediately after the incident and <span class="GramE">We</span> believe the
possibility of error in picking the persons really responsible was quite
remote.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also argued that the trial court erred in finding <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> guilty of the crime
charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reliance is placed on the fact
that the lone witness for the prosecution who saw the killing of Roberto <span class="SpellE">Monreal</span> categorically declared that he saw only Elias
Gloria hit the victim with a piece of wood.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is, therefore, contended that the testimony of said witness tends to
exculpate accused <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>
rather than incriminate him in the killing and could not be the basis of
conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conclusion is not en­tirely
correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that the lone
Government witness to the killing had stated that he did not actually see the
other accused hit Roberto <span class="SpellE">Monreal</span> with the piece of
wood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But that alone does not
conclusively show that <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>
did not hit the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent

court how you were awakened when you said you were sleeping at that time?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A.-</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because of the
noise of the beating.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing, there is no doubt that witness Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Villalon</span> was awakened by the noise of the beating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he woke up, the victim was already
mounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He saw only Gloria beating the
victim with a piece of wood at the time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He had companions then who were near or around the victim, although he
did not recognize them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his extra-judicial
confession, an the other hand, accused <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> narrated that the first to approach the victim who was
lying on the cement floor was Ramon <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> (Boy AA)
who immediately covered the face of the victim with a blanket; that he (<span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>) was the first one to
strike at the victim; he was followed by Francisco <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>,
then by Elias Gloria, and lastly by Ramon <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>;
and that they killed the victim hitting him with the same piece of wood
alternately in that order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not
find the testimony of the eyewitness and the confession of <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Peña</span> utterly irreconcilable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of the eyewitness simply means
he did not see <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>
beat the victim because when he woke up, the said accused and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> were already through with their beating of the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is deducible from the
confession of <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>
that he and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> struck at the victim with
the same piece of wood before Elias Gloria had his turn to strike with that
single piece of wood used by all of them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is also a logical conclusion from the statement of the eyewitness
that he was awakened by the beating and that when he first awoke, the victim
was already wounded and prostrate on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At any rate, even if the testimony of the eyewitness on this point is
left wholly out of consideration, still there is sufficient basis of
conviction, for a confession corroborated by evidence of <u>corpus</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>delicti</u></span> will suffice.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
It is really not indispensable that an eyewitness should have seen the
commission of the crime before an accused may be held liable under his awn
confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The usefulness of the
confession as a species of <span class="GramE">proof,</span> would vanish if it
were necessary, in addition to the con­fession, to adduce other evidence
sufficient to justify conviction independently of such confession.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the alleged denial of due process can­not be favorably
considered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that the
case suffered protracted delays due to repeated postponement of the hearings,
but said postponements were either caused by the prosecution or the
defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be sure, the prosecution
appears to have requested a number of postponements caused by absence of
witnesses but <span class="GramE">We</span> presume that said witnesses were
there­after able to satisfactorily explain to the trial court their absences,
otherwise, they should have been cited for contempt by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The witnesses referred to are members of the
Manila Police Department, of the Homicide Section thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crime wave that has besieged the city
these years is only too well known, and their official duties must have
contributed to their repeated inability to appear during the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, the circumstance that there were
eight different counsels <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> who
took turns in handling the defense of accused <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> in this case, does not appear to have materially
prejudiced his cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that
there were repeated charges of counsel during the trial, whenever appointed
counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> for herein accused
was absent, one of the other counsels <u>de</u> <u>officio</u> for the other
accused was designated or substituted in his place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This should not be cause for lament; for on
the contrary, it speaks well of the desire of the court to allow accused <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> to avail himself of
counsel all throughout the course of the protracted proceeding.</p>

<p class="BODY">All the foregoing considered, there is no room for doubt that
accused <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>
participated in the clubbing of Roberto <span class="SpellE">Monreal</span>
inside Cell 2-A of the City Jail of Manila on the night of July 10, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The writer is of the opinion, however, that
said accused should not be convicted of consummated murder, as charged in the
information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Except for <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> Pena's own confession, the evidence for the
prosecution, so far as admissible against the said accused, consists of proof
of <u>corpus</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>delicti</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only evidence of his direct participation
in the commission of the crime was his own extra-judicial confession, a
scrutiny of which, on the other hand, would readily cast doubt as to whether
the blow with the piece of wood he delivered upon the victim as revealed in the
said confession could have been fatal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The said confession, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">K,</span> narrates that when they came near the victim, the latter
was lying on his back (<span class="SpellE">tihaya</span>) on the cement
floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First to approach the victim was
accused Ramon <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> (Boy AA) who immediately
covered the face of the victim with a blanket; and thereupon, <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> struck at him with
the piece of wood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no
suggestion that <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>
hit the victim more than once; he merely confessed that after striking at the victim,
he passed on the piece of wood to Francisco <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The eyewitness, on the other hand, testified
that when he woke up, he saw the victim beside him al­ready wounded, lying
prostrate on the cement floor on his belly (<span class="SpellE">nakadapa</span>),
upon whom Elias Gloria delivered three successive blows with the same piece of
wood used by <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that pre­cise time, according to him, the
body of the victim then was still covered with the blanket although the head
was already exposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The medico?legal
officer who conducted the autopsy on the body of the victim found three (3)
wounds which he described in his necropsy report (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
B) <span class="GramE">and</span> in his testimony before the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two big lacerated wounds at the back of the
bead were described as fatal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctor
was of the opinion that any one of them could have caused the death of the
victim for both wounds caused fractures in the cranium and hemorrhage all over
the brain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The third wound (on the face)
was described as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Contusion and superficial skin laceration with swollen tissue
<span class="SpellE">hematoms</span> of soft tissues around left eye."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This last wound was never described as fatal by the medico-legal
officer, both in his necropsy report and in his testimony during the
trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this, wound, the way We look
at it, could have been the one caused by the accused <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Peña</span> when he delivered the first blow upon the
victim, considering the evidence that at the time the victim was lying on his
back (<span class="SpellE">tihaya</span>) and the face was then cover with the
blanket.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fatal wounds at the back of
the head may reasonably be attributed to the succeeding blows delivered by any
of the other accused who, as seen by the eyewitness, struck at the victim while
the man was <span class="GramE">laying</span> on his belly (<span class="SpellE">nakadapa</span>)
with the head already exposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would
not be far fetched to surmise that after the first blow, the victim made an
attempt to rise, causing the blanket to slip down the bead thus exposing it, at
which precise time, the succeeding blows were delivered, causing the fall of
the victim back on the cement floor on his belly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this were so, then it would be safe to
conclude that the superficial wound was the one that may alone be attributed to
accused <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>,
considering the circumstances that there was no allegation of conspiracy in the
information, and the defense bad seasonably made objections to the introduction
of evidence tending to prove conspiracy, and which objections were all
sustained by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither
did the court below make any finding of conspiracy in the decision under review;
for on the contrary it declared:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> It
should be noted<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that in default of an
allegation of conspiracy, the herein accused is not found responsible for the
acts of his co-accused as his conspirators, but for his individual
participation for the death of the victim."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> should, therefore, be held liable only for the
consequences of his own act - that of inflicting upon the person of the victim
the superficial wound above-mentioned.</p>

<p class="BODY">Intent to kill is apparent on the face of <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Peña's</span> own confession, but he failed to his <span class="GramE">the</span> victim mortally, either because of his poor aim or
because he failed to apply the degree of force necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever the real cause is, there is no doubt
that the in­jury he inflicted upon the victim could not have produced the
intended killing as a consequence; hence, the stage of execution insofar as
accused <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> in concerned, was merely attempted.</p>

<p class="BODY">The qualifying circumstance of treachery was properly considered
by the court; but evident premeditation may not be appreciated as the evidence
tends to show that the attack upon the victim was thought of only some fifteen
(15) minutes before the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Use of
superior strength also should not be considered against the accused, for even
if <span class="GramE">We</span> were to believe the claim of <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Peña</span> in his confession that all the accused in this
case, each delivered blows upon the victim, he declared in the same confession
that they attacked the deceased Roberto <span class="SpellE">Monreal</span>
alternately, one after the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
with the aggravating circumstance of nighttime, <span class="GramE">which does
not appear to have been especially sought since the notion to commit the crime
was thought of only shortly before its commission.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
In the absence of any aggravating circumstance other than treachery which had
been considered as a qualifying circumstance, and in the absence of any
mitigating circumstance either which attended the commission of the crime, the
penalty imposable under the law,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
should be applied in its medium period.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The penalty for attempted murder is <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span> in its maximum period to <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u> in its medium period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Applying the benefits of the Indeterminate
Sentence Law, the accused <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>
should be sentenced to a penalty the minimum of which should be within the
range of <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span> <u>mayor</u> in its maximum
period to <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span>
in its medium period, with a maximum within the range of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision under review is modified
accordingly, and the accused <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> is hereby sentenced to <span class="GramE">two(</span>2)
