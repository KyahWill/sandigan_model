<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region> on 
<st1:date month="5" day="6" year="1957">May 6, 1957</st1:date>, as a temporary 
visitor until <st1:date month="7" day="13" year="1957">July 13, 1957</st1:date>, 
upon a P1<span class="GramE">,000</span> cash bond filed by <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabo</span> Cheng.
<p>She contracted marriage with Santos Chan, a Filipino citizen, on <st1:date month="7" day="8" year="1957">July 8, 1957</st1:date>. And due thereto she 
petitioned the Commissioner of Immigration, on July 10, 1957, for the 
cancellation of her alien certificate of registration, and for her permanent 
stay in the Philippines. . Pending resolution of her petition, she requested for 
a 30-day extension of her permit to remain in this country, which request was 
denied. As she failed to depart on <st1:date month="7" day="13" year="1957">July 
13, 1957</st1:date> - the date of expiration of her permitted stay - the bond 
posted for her was ordered forfeited<span class="GramE">.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2">[</span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2">*]</span></p>
<p>Subsequently, on July 31, 1957, the Commissioner of Immigration wrote to So 
Ming Lee, denying her request for reconsideration of the confiscation of the 
bond and her petition for the cancellation of her alien certificate of 
registration due to the finding that both So and Chan having previous marriages 
- So claimed to be a divorcee - their marriage to each other was without force 
and effect so that she could not have acquired Filipino citizenship. The 
Commissioner advised <span class="GramE">So</span> to leave within three days from 
receipt of his letter or else appropriate action would be taken for her 
departure.</p>
<p>On August 2, 1957, a petition for certiorari, prohibition and mandamus was 
filed by So Ming Lee, Santos Chan and <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabo</span> Cheng, before the Court of First Instance of Manila 
praying for (1) annulment of the Commissioner of Immigration's order denying So 
Ming Lee's petition for cancellation of her alien certificate of registration 
and confiscation of the bond; (2) declaration of So Ming Lee as a Filipino 
citizen, under Section 15 of Commonwealth Act 473; (3) refund of cash bond to 
Cheng; and (4) restraint of the arrest of So Ming Lee and of deportation 
proceedings against her.</p>
<p>Subsequently, a preliminary injunction was prayed for. Because a warrant was 
issued for <span class="SpellE">So's</span> arrest, the court, upon petitionersâ€™ 
request, temporarily restrained the authorities from arresting her.</p>
<p>Instead of answering, as required by the court, the Commissioner filed a 
motion to dismiss on the ground that the petition had no cause of action and 
that it was premature because deportation proceedings had not yet been 
terminated so that the Court of First Instance had no jurisdiction to review the 
Commissioner's actuations. To the motion to dismiss, petitioners filed an 
opposition, denying its alleged grounds and stating further that the petition 
may also be construed as one for declaratory relief.</p>
<p>In its order of August 29, 1957, the court below dismissed the petition, 
declaring It premature and finding that in ordering So Ming Lee's arrest 
preliminary to deportation proceedings, the respondent Commissioner was only 
complying with Section 37 of the Immigration Act of 1940; that the Board of 
Immigration Commissioners had not yet decided on <span class="SpellE">So's</span> 
right to stay, so as to justify interference by the courts; and that the proper 
remedy is habeas corpus. Appeal was taken <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> by 
petitioners to the Court of Appeals which Court certified the case to <span class="GramE">Us</span> as involving questions purely of law.</p>
<p>At issue are, mainly, these two questions: First, did the trial court err in 
acting upon the motion to dismiss and ruling that the petition was premature? 
Second, should the petition be considered as also for a declaratory relief?</p>
<p>Petitioners argue that in a suit for certiorari once the court orders the 
respondent to answer according to Section 6 of Rule, 67 of the Rules of Court 
(now Section 6 of Rule 65), the respondent cannot move to dismiss. They maintain 
that there are only two stages when the court may dismiss a special civil action 
for certiorari, prohibition and/or mandamus, that is, first, upon the filing of 
the petition but before the order to answer; and second, upon the filing of the 
answer.</p>
<p>The rule in ordinary actions may be applied to special civil actions by 
virtue of Section 1 of Rule 65 (now Section 1 of Rule 62) provided it is not 
inconsistent with the provisions on special civil actions. There is no such 
inconsistency that bars the application here of the rule (Rule 8, now Rule 16) 
allowing the filing of a motion to dismiss before filing an answer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in <span class="SpellE">Arvisu</span> v <span class="SpellE">Vernara</span><span class="GramE">,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup><span style2="">[</span></sup></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>1]</sup></span><span class="style3"> als</span>o a 
petition for certiorari, where a motion to dismiss upon the ground that appeal 
was the remedy - filed after an answer was required - was granted, this Court, 
sustaining the dismissal, held that: "On principle, dismissal would also be 
proper if, before the answer is filed, the attention of the court is called to 
the fact that from its own allegations, the; petition appears to be without 
merit."</p>
<p>The petitioners asked the Commissioner to cancel her alien certificate of 
registration on the ground that by virtue of So Ming Lee's marriage to a 
Filipino citizen, she is also a Filipino. Time and again <span class="GramE">We</span> have said that an alien woman marrying a Filipino citizen 
does not by that fact alone become a Filipino. She has yet to prove that she has 
all the qualifications and none of the disqualifications enumerated in Sections 
2 and 4 of the Naturalization Law before she may be deemed a Filipino 
Citizen<span class="GramE"><span class="style2">.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[</sup></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2"><sup>2]</sup></span> If it were otherwise, our laws could easily be 
circumvented by the alien's marriage to a Filipino. Temporary stay being a mere 
privilege, temporary visitors are subject to deportation upon the expiration of 
the period of their stay<span class="GramE"><span class="style2">.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[</sup></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2"><sup>3]</sup></span> 
Prohibition will not prosper to prevent their deportation. If the alien remains 
after the expiration of his stay, he may be proceeded against preparatory to the 
institution of deportation proceedings<span class="GramE"><span class="style2">.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[</sup></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2"><sup>4]</sup></span> 
The alien's remedy is to leave the country and then apply for re-entry.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" style2=""><span class="style2style1"><sup>[5]</sup></span></span></p>
<p>From all the above considerations, therefore, it follows that the disputed 
issue of citizenship - upon which So Ming Lee premises her alleged right to stay 
and not to be deported - should first be threshed out in the Board of 
Commissioners, instead of in the courts. This is in accordance with Section 37 
of the Immigration Act of 1940, as amended: </p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"(a) The following aliens shall be arrested upon the warrant of the 
Commissioner of Immigration or of any other officer designated by him for the 
purpose and deported upon the warrant of the Commissioner of Immigration after a 
determination by the Board of Commissioners of the existence of the ground for 
deportation as charged against the alien: x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></p>
<p>"(b) Any alien who remains in the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>, in 
violation of any limitation, or condition under which he was admitted as a 
nonimmigrant; x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></p>
<p>"(c) No alien shall be <span class="GramE">deported without</span> being 
informed of the specific grounds for deportation nor without being given a 
hearing under rules of procedure to be prescribed by the Commissioner of 
Immigration."</p></blockquote>
<p>And with regard to respondent Commissioner's having looked into So Ming Lee's 
citizenship, it is well settled that for the purpose of determining whether or 
not a prima facie case exists against an alien to warrant his deportation, the 
Commissioner of Immigration may conduct preliminary proceedings and pass upon 
the validity of the marriage of an alien on which the question of her 
nationality depends<span class="style2">.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span> It is not correct 
to say that the question of citizenship should be determined exclusively by the 
courts.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" style2=""><span class="style2style1"><sup>[7]</sup></span></span></p>
<p>Petitioners further allege abuse of discretion when respondent Commissioner 
confiscated the bond, the petition for the cancellation of the alien certificate 
of registration then being pending. The bond posted to insure an alien's 
departure after the expiration of his stay may be confiscated upon failure to 
produce the alien when ordered by the Commissioner, because the condition of the 
bond has thereby been violated<span class="GramE">.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup><span style2="">[</span></sup></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>8]</sup></span> An alien's bondsman seeking refund of 
the cash bond because of marriage of the alien to a Filipino husband, without 
proof that the alien herself may be naturalized, does not sufficiently show 
cause to obtain release of the bond. Stated otherwise, an alien who claims that, 
despite her failure to depart from the country within the period specified in 
the bond, there has been no breach thereof, has the burden of proving her 
alleged change of political status, from alien to citizen<span class="GramE">.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup><span style2="">[</span></sup></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>9]</sup></span> 
And as mentioned, this proof should first be given in the proceedings before the 
Board of Commissioners.</p>
<p>Declaratory relief is discretionary upon the court to entertain. It may 
refuse to exercise the power to declare rights and to construe instruments in 
any case where the declaration or construction is not necessary and proper at 
the time under all the circumstances (Sec. 5, Rule 64, formerly Sec. 6, Rule 66, 
<span class="GramE">Rules</span> of Court). This is one such case, for the proper 
forum in which to first resolve the dispute herein is the Board of 
Commissioners.</p>
