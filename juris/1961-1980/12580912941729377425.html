				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On May 26, 1959, plaintiff Equitable Insurance and Casualty Company, Inc. 
filed with the Court of First Instance of Manila a complaint (Civil Case No. 
40232) against defendant Rural Insurance and Surety Company, Inc. alleging, as 
first cause of action, that on November 11, 1957, plaintiff and defendant 
entered into a reciprocal facultative reinsurance agreement, wherein they agreed 
to cede to each other, by way of facultative reinsurance on policies of 
insurance or reinsurance issued by their respective fire insurance departments 
on risks situated in the Philippines, subject to the stipulations of the 
agreement; that pursuant to said agreement, plaintiff on January 29, 1958, 
reinsured for P2,000.00 with defendant as per Reinsurance Application No. 58/038 
and accepted by defendant on the same date, the stock covered by fire insurance 
Policy No. 5880 issued by plaintiff in behalf of Messrs. Jean Farmers.' 
Cooperative Marketing Association, Inc.; that on July 4, 1958, the stock insured 
and covered by said Policy No. 5880 was burned, and the share of the loss 
assumed by defendant as per reinsurance agreement was computed at P2,024.87 
including adjuster's fee, for which plaintiff sent to defendant for payment by 
the latter, a statement of account dated March 12, 1959; that despite repeated 
demands by plaintiff, defendant refused and failed to pay the sum of P2,024.87. 
On the second cause of action, plaintiff alleged that pursuant to the same 
reinsurance agreement, plaintiff on March 24, 1958 reinsured in the sum of 
P2,000.00 with defendant as per Reinsurance Application No. 58/115 and accepted 
by defendant on the same date, stock covered by fire insurance Policy No. 6026, 
issued by plaintitff in behalf of Electric and Lamp Supplies (Mr. Pedro Casipe); 
that on October 13, 1958, said stock was burned and the share, of loss assumed 
by defendant as per reinsurance agreement with plaintiff was computed at 
P1,334.80 including adjuster's fee, for which plaintiff likewise sent a 
statement of account dated February 4, 1959, to defendant with the request that 
the same be paid; that notwithstanding repeated demands, defendant refused and 
failed to pay plaintiff; and that for defendant's failure to pay its share of 
the losses assumed by it, plaintiff has been compelled to institute the present 
action and to incur attorney's fees and expenses of litigation amounting to 
P500.00. Plaintiff prayed for judgment ordering the defendant to pay said sums 
of P2,024.80 and P1,334.80 with legal interest thereon from the date of the 
filing of the complaint until fully paid, P500.00 as attorney's fees, and the 
costs of the suit.
<p>On June 9, 1959, defendant filed a motion to dismiss said complaint, on the 
ground that states no cause of action, as pursuant to Article VIII of the 
Reinsurance Agreement between the parties, before a court action can be brought 
the parties agreed to submit all disputes to a board of arbitrators. To this 
motion, plaintiff duly filed an opposition. On June 6, 1959, the court denied 
said motion to dismiss for lack of merit and required defendant to answer.</p>
<p>On June 20, 1959, defendant filed its answer alleging as affirmative defenses 
that paragraph 3, Article III of the Reciprocal Reinsurance Agreement between 
the parties is controlled by Article VIII thereof; that the nature of the 
agreement is "self-liquidating between the parties" the reinsurer becoming a 
reinsured, and the reinsured becoming reinsurer; and that said agreement has not 
yet been abrogated, so that plaintiff's liability to defendant is not yet known, 
nor the liability of defendant to plaintiff. Defendant prayed that the complaint 
be dismissed and that plaintiff be ordered to pay to it attorney's fees in the 
sum of P700.00 and the costs of the suit.</p>
<p>On July 8, 1959, plaintiff filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, 
which was opposed by defendant on July 13. On July 15, 1959, the court issued an 
order denying said motion.</p>
<p>Instead of going into a formal hearing, the parties on August 12, 1959, 
submitted the case for decision on the following stipulation of facts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. That the <span style="font-style: italic;">defendant admits the allegations contained in paragraphs 1, 2, 
8, 4, and all other allegations of the complaint</span>, including the letter of the 
Assistant Insurance Commissioner, addressed to Miss Anunciacion Aznar, President 
of the Rural Insurance &amp; Surety Co., dated May 4, 1959, which reads as 
follows:</p>
<p>'MADAM:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'We are enclosing herewith copy of the self-explanatory letter of Mr. S. A. 
Santos, General Manager of the above-subject company, dated April 11, 1959, with 
the request that we be favored with your comments thereon at an early date. 
<br><br>'Kindly give your preferential attention hereto.'</p></blockquote>
<p>"2. That plaintiff admits that the issues and/or dispute subject of the 
present complaint were not submitted to a Board of Arbitrators and umpire, as 
provided in paragraph VIII of Annex 'A' to the complaint, but instead the matter 
was referred to the Insurance Commissioner as evidenced by the letter of said 
office quoted above." (Italics supplied).</p></blockquote>
<p>On October 16, 1959, the Court rendered a decision the dispositive part of 
which reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the 
plaintiff Equitable Insurance &amp; Casualty Co. Inc. and against the defendant 
Rural Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc., ordering the latter to pay to the 
former the sum of P2,024.87, under the first cause of action, with legal 
interest from the date of the filing of the complaint until fully paid; the sum 
of P1,334.80, under the second cause of action with legal interest from the date 
of the filing of the complaint, until fully paid; plus the further sum of P500.00 as attorney's fees and the costs of the suit."</p></blockquote>
<p>From this decision, defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals which elevated 
the case to us, no question of fact being involved.</p>
<p>Under his first assignment of error, defendant-appellant insists that the 
trial court erred in failing to rule that plaintiff-appellee has no causes of 
action against it, the matter not having been referred to the decision of two 
arbitrators or umpire, which, it is claimed, is the condition precedent agreed 
upon in Article VIII of the Reinsurance Agreement entered into between the 
parties, to wit:</p>
<p align="center">"ARTICLE VIII</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the event of any question arising as to the meaning of, or any way 
connected with or relating to this Agreement, whether before or after its 
termination, the parties shall endeavor to arrive at a satisfactory compromise 
by amicable settlement rather than by court action. The dispute shall be 
referred to the decision of two arbitrators, of whom one shall be appointed in 
writing by each of the parties within thirty (30) days after having been 
required so to do by the other party in writing, and in case of disagreement 
between the arbitrators, to the decision of the umpire to be appointed by them 
in writing before entering on the reference. Each party shall submit its case 
with all particulars within thirty days after their appointment. The seat of 
arbitration shall be in Manila, Philippines, and the expenses of arbitration 
shall be borne in equal proportion by the parties. The decision of the 
arbitrators or umpire, as the case may be, shall be final and binding on both 
the Company and the Reinsurer. The arbitrators and umpire shall not be bound by 
the strict rules of evidence and by judicial formalities in making the 
award."</p></blockquote>
<p>It is contended that this agreement, not being contrary to law, moral or 
public policy but, on the other hand, dictated by "wisdom and propriety in 
insurance contracts because losses by fire can duly be determined by competent 
men who have technical knowledge on how to determine losses by fire", 
non-compliance therewith is fatal to the claim of plaintiff-appellee.</p>
<p>We find no merit in this contention. Under the abovequoted provision of the 
Reinsurance Agreement, it would seem clear that the requirement of submitting 
for decision to two arbitrators or an umpire the matter of losses by fire or the 
liability of the parties thereto arises only if and when the same is disputed by 
one of the parties. It does not appear in the instant case that appellant did 
dispute appellee's claims. Consequently, appellant may not invoke said provision 
in avoidance of its liability to appellee. On this point, the trial court 
correctly made the following observations, to which we fully agree and adopt as 
our own:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is true that paragraph (Article) VIII of said Reciprocal Facultative 
Reinsurance Agreement required that 'in the event of any question arising as to 
the meaning of, or any way connected with or relating to this Agreement, whether 
before or after its termination, the parties shall endeavor to arrive at a 
satisfactory compromise by amicable settlement rather than by court action'; and 
that the dispute should be referred to the decision of two arbitrators and 
umpire, as provided therein. However, in this particular case, <i>there is 
absolutely no dispute between the two parties, because in the stipulation of 
facts, the defendant has admitted that plaintiff has paid its liability to the 
insured as per its fire insurance policies specified in the two causes of action 
of the complaint. Defendant has likewise, admitted its liability as reinsurer 
under the Reciprocal Facultative Reinsurance Agreement (Annex 'A' to the 
complaint)</i> to pay to the <i>plaintiff its proportional shares, the amounts 
of which are not disputed. Indeed, according to the complaint as admitted by the 
defendant, statements of account as to the amounts of its share as reinsurer 
and, for all that appears, said defendant has never questioned the correctness 
of said amounts. It is, likewise, admitted by the defendant in the stipulation 
of facts, that because of its failure to pay said amounts, the plaintiff, on 
April 11, 1959, complained to the Assistant Insurance Commissioner, for official 
intervention, but said defendant has continued to ignore plaintiff's demands for 
reimbursement under the reinsurance policies.</i></p>
<p>"Moreover, as decided by the Court of Appeals in the case of Buenaventura 
Maligad vs. United Assurance Co. Inc., 55 Off. Gaz., 6041:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'<i>If in the course of the settlement of a loss, the action of the company 
or its agents amounts to a refusal to pay, the company will be deemed to have 
waived the condition precedent with reference to arbitration, and a suit upon 
the policy will lie.</i> (Chang vs. Assurance Corporation, 8 Phil., 399)'. 
<span style="font-style: italic;">Italics supplied</span>.</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>In the second and last assignment of error, appellant claims that "the court 
<span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> erred in failing to rule that in a facultative obligation the right to 
choose an alternative remedy lies only with the debtor, who in this case is the 
herein defendant-appellant", and in support thereof, cites Article 1206 of the 
New Civil Code.</p>
<p>We find no connection whatsoever between this article and the agreement 
subject to this action, except the word "facultative" used in both. The term 
"facultative" is used in reinsurance contracts, and it is so used in this 
particular case, merely to define the right of the reinsurer to accept or not to 
accept participation in the risk insured. But once the share is accepted, as it 
was in the case at bar, the obligation is absolute and the liability assumed 
thereunder can be discharged by one and only way—payment of the share of the 
losses. There is no alternative nor substitute prestation. </p>
<p>Wherefore, finding no error in the judgment appealed from of the trial court, 
the same is hereby affirmed, with costs against the defendant-appellant. So 
ordered.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, 
J. B. L., Paredes, Dizon,</i> and <i>De Leon, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
