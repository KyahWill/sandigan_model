<p class="BODY">Subsequently, Congress passed a bill, which, upon approval by the
President, on June 17, 1967, became Republic Act No. 4913, providing that the

<p class="BODY">The petition in L-28196 was filed on <st1:date month="10" day="21" year="1967">October 21, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;

referred to as the PHILCONSA --- were allowed to argue as <span class="SpellE"><u>amici</u></span>

resolution of the Commission on Elections<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
dismissing the petition therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two
(2) cases were deemed submitted for decision on <st1:date month="11" day="8" year="1967">November 8, 1967</st1:date>, upon the filing of the answer of
respondent, the memorandum of the petitioner and the reply memorandum of
respondent in L-28224.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ramon A. Gonzales, the petitioner in L-28196, is admittedly a
Filipino citizen, a taxpayer, and a voter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He claims to have instituted case L-28196 as a class suit, for and in
behalf of all citizens, taxpayers, and voters similarly situated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although respondents and the Solicitor
General have filed an answer denying the truth of this allegation, upon the
ground that they have no knowledge or information to form a belief as to the
truth thereof, such denial would appear to be a perfunctory one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, at the hearing of case L-28196, the
Solicitor General ex­pressed himself in favor of a judicial determination of
the merits of the issues raised in said case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The PHILCONSA, petitioner in L-28224, is admittedly a corporation
duly organized and existing under the laws of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and a civic, non-profit and non-partisan organization the objective of which is
to uphold the rule of law in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and to defend its Constitution against erosions or onslaughts from whatever
source.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite his aforemen­tioned
statement in L-28196, in his answer in L-28224 the Solicitor General maintains
that this Court has no jurisdic­tion over the subject-matter of L-28224, upon
the ground that the same is "merely political" as held in <span class="SpellE">Mabanag</span> vs. Lopez Vito.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Senator Arturo M. <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, who appeared before the
Commission on Elections and filed an opposition to the PHILCONSA petition
therein, was allowed to appear before this Court and objected to said petition
upon the ground:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a) that the Court has
no jurisdiction either to grant the re­lief sought in the petition, or to pass
upon the legality of the composition of the House of Representatives; b) that
the petition, if granted, would, in effect, render <span class="SpellE">inoperational</span>
the legislative department; and c) that "the failure of Congress to enact
a valid reapportionment law x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
does not have the legal effect of rendering illegal the House of
Representatives elected thereafter, nor of rendering its acts null and
void."</p>

<p class="BODY">As early as <span class="SpellE">Angara</span> vs. Electoral
Commission,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court – speaking through one of the leading members of the Constitutional
Convention and a respected professor of Consti­tutional Law, Dr. Jose P. Laurel
– declared that "the judicial department is the only constitutional organ
which can be called upon to determine the proper allocation of power between
the several departments and among the integral or constitutional constituent
units thereof."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that in <span class="SpellE">Mabanag</span> vs. Lopez
Vito,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court, characterizing the issue submitted thereto as a political one,
declined to pass upon the question whether or not a given number of votes cast
in Congress in favor of a proposed amendment to the Constitution – which was
being submitted to the people for ratification – satisfied the three-fourths
vote requirement of the fundamental law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The force of this precedent has been weakened, however, by <span class="SpellE">Suanes</span> vs. Chief Accountant of the Senate,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Tañada</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
and Macias vs. Commis­sion on Elections.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
In the first, we held that the officers and employees of the Senate Electoral
Tribunal are under its supervision and control, not of that of the Senate
President, as claimed by the latter; in the second, this Court proceeded to
determine the number of Senators necessary for a <u>quorum</u> in the Senate;
in the third, we nullified the election, by Senators belonging to the party
having the largest number of votes in said chamber, purporting to act on behalf
of the party having the second largest num­ber of votes therein, of two (2)
Senators belonging to the first party, as members, for the second party, of the
Senate Electoral Tribunal; and in the fourth, we declared unconstitutional and
act of Congress purporting to apportion the representative districts for the
House of Representatives, upon the ground that the apportionment had not been
made as nearly as may be possible according to the number of inhabitants of
each province.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus we rejected the
theory, advanced in these four (4) cases, that the issues therein raised were
political questions the determination of which is beyond judicial review.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the power to amend the Constitution or to propose
amendments thereto is not included in the general grant of legislative powers
to Congress.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
It is part of the inherent powers <u>of the people</u> – as the repository of
sov­ereignty in a republican state, such as ours<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
– to make, and, hence, to amend their own Fundamental Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Congress may propose amendments to the
Constitution merely because the same explicitly grants such power.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, when exer­cising the same, it is said that Senators and Members of the
House of Representatives act, <u>not</u> as members of <u>Congress</u>, but as
component elements of a <u>constituent assembly</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When acting as such, the members of Congress
derive their author­ity from the Constitution, <u>unlike the people</u>, when
performing the same function,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
for their authority does <u>not</u> emanate from the Constitution — they are
the <u>very source</u> of all powers of government, <u>including the
Constitution itself</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since, when proposing, as a constituent assembly, amendments to
the Constitution, the members of Congress derive their authority from the
Fundamental Law, it follows, necessarily, that they do not have the final say
on whether or not their acts are within or beyond constitutional limits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, they could brush aside and set the
same at naught, contrary to the basic tenet that ours is a govern­ment of laws,
not of men, and to the rigid nature of our Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such rigidity is stressed by the fact that,
the Con­stitution expressly confers upon the Supreme Court,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
the power to declare a treaty unconstitutional,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
despite the eminently political character of the treaty-making power.</p>

<p class="BODY">In short, the issue whether or not a Resolution of Con­gress –
acting as a constituent assembly – violates the Constitution, is essentially <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>, not political, and, hence, subject to judicial
review, and, to the extent that this view may be inconsistent with the stand
taken in <span class="SpellE">Mabanag</span> vs. Lopez Vito,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
the latter should be deemed modified accordingly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Members of the Court are unanimous on
this point.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 0.1in 0in;"><u>The Merits<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 1 of Article XV of the Constitution, as amend­ed, reads:</p>

<blockquote>"The Congress in joint session assembled by a vote of
three-fourths of all the Members of the Senate and of the House of
Representatives voting separately, may propose amendments to this Constitution
or call a convention for that purpose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such amendments shall be valid as part of this Constitution when
approved by a majority of the votes cast at an election at which the amendments
are submitted to the people for their ratification."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to this provision, amendments to the Constitution may be
proposed, either by Congress, or by a conven­tion called by Congress for that
purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In either case, the vote of
"three-fourths of all the members of the Senate and of the House of
Representatives voting separately" is neces­sary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, "such amendments shall be valid as
part of" the 'Constitution when approved by a majority of the votes cast
at an election at which the amendments are submitted to the peo­ple for their
ratification."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the cases at bar, it is conceded that the R.B.H. Nos. 1 and 3
have been approved by a vote of three-fourths of all the members of the Senate
and of the House of Representatives voting separately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, notwithstanding, it is urged that said
resolutions are null and void because:</p>

demands that the election, in which proposals for amendment shall be sub­mitted

of the Congressmen</span></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The first objection is based upon Section 5, Arti­cle VI, of the
Constitution, which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"The House of Representatives shall be composed of not more
than one hundred and twenty Members who shall be apportioned among the several
provinces as nearly as may be ac­cording to the number of their respective
inhab­itants, but each province shall have at least one Member.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Congress shall by law make an apportionment
within three years after the re­turn of every enumeration, and not
otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Until such apportionment
shall have been made, the House of Representatives shall have the same number
of Members as that fixed by law for the National Assembly, who shall be elect­ed
by the qualified electors from the present Assembly districts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each representative district shall comprise,
as far as practicable, contiguous and compact territory."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is urged that the last enumeration or census took place in
1960; that, no apportionment having been made within three (3) years
thereafter, the Congress of the Philippines and/or the election of its Members
became illegal; that Con­gress and its Members, likewise, became a <u>de</u> <u>facto</u>
Congress and/or <u>de</u> <u>facto</u> congressmen, respectively; and that,
conse­quently, the disputed Resolutions, proposing amendments to the
Constitution, as well as Republic Act No. 4913, are null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not true, however, that Congress has not made an
apportionment within three years after the enumeration or census made in
1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did actually pass a bill, which
became Republic Act No. 3040,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
purporting to make said apportionment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Act was, however, declared uncon­stitutional, upon the ground that
the apportionment therein undertaken had not been made according to the number
of inhabitants of the different provinces of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, we are unable to agree with the theory that, in view of
the failure of Congress to make a valid ap­portionment within the period stated
in the Constitution, Congress became an "unconstitutional Congress"
and that, in consequence thereof, the Members of its House of Representatives
are <u>de facto</u> officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The major
premise of this process of reasoning is that the constitutional provision on
"apportionment within three years after the return of every enumeration,
and not otherwise," is mandatory.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fact that Congress is under legal obligation to make said
apportionment does not justify, however, the conclusion that failure to comply with
such obligation rendered Congress illegal or unconstitutional, or that its
Members have become <u>de</u> <u>facto</u> officers.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is conceded that, since the adoption of the Constitution in
1935, Congress has not made a valid apportionment as required in said fundamental
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The effect of this omission has
been envisioned in the Constitution, pursuant to which:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Until such apportionment shall have been made, the House of Representatives
shall have the same number of Members as that fixed by law for the National
Assembly, who shall be elected by the qualified electors from the present
Assembly districts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The provision does not support the view that, upon the expiration
of the period to make the apportionment, a Congress which fails to make it is
dissolved or becomes illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
contrary, it implies necessarily that Congress shall <u>continue</u> to
function with the representative dis­tricts existing at the time of the
expiration of said period.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is argued that the above-quoted provision refers only to the
elections held in 1935.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This theory
assumes that an apportionment had to be made necessarily <u>before</u> the
first elections to be held after the inauguration of the Commonwealth of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
or in 1938.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
The as­sumption is, however, unwarranted, for there had been no enumeration in
1935, and nobody could foretell when it would be made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those who drafted and adopted the
Constitution in 1935 could be certain, therefore, that the three-year period,
after the earliest possible enumeration, would expire after the elections in
1938.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is more, considering that several provisions of the
Constitution, particularly those on the legislative de­partment, were amended
in 1940, by establishing a bica­meral Congress, those who drafted and adopted
said amendment, <u>incorporating therein the provision of the original
Constitution regarding the apportionment of the districts for representatives</u>,
must have known that the three-year period <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
would expire <u>after the elections scheduled to be held and actually held in
1941</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the events contemporaneous with the framing and
ratification of the original Constitution in 1935 and of the amendment thereof
in 1940 strongly indicate that the provision concerning said apportionment and
the effect of the failure to make it were expected to be applied to conditions
obtaining <u>after</u> the elections in 1935 and 1938, and even after <u>subsequent</u>
elections.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then again, since the report of the Director of the Cen­sus on
the last enumeration was submitted to the President on <st1:date month="11" day="30" year="1960">November 30, 1960</st1:date>, it follows that the
three-year period to make the apportionment did not expire until <u>1963</u>,
or after the Presidential elections in 1961.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There can be no question, therefore, that the Senate and the House of
Representatives organized or constituted on <st1:date month="12" day="30" year="1961">December 30, 1961</st1:date>, were <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>jure</u></span>
bodies, and that the Members thereof were <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>jure</u></span>
officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to the theory of
petitioners herein, upon expiration of said period of three years, or late in
1963, Congress became illegal and its Members, or at least, those of the House
of Representatives, became illegal holders of their respective offices, and
were <u>de</u> <u>facto</u> officers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners do not allege that the expiration of said three-year
period, without a reapportionment, had the effect of abrogating or repealing
the legal provision creating Congress, or, at least, the House of
Representatives, and we are not aware of any rule or principle of law that
would warrant such conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither
do they allege that the term of office of the members of said House
automatically expired or that they <u>ipso</u> <u>facto</u> forfeited their
seats in Congress, upon the lapse of said period for reapportionment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, neither our political law, in
general, nor our law on public officers, in particular, supports the view that
failure to discharge a mandatory duty, whatever it maybe, would automatically
result in the forfeiture of an office, in the absence of a statute to this
effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, it would seem obvious that the provisions of our
Election Law relative to the election of Members of Congress in 1965 were not
repealed in consequence of the failure of said body to make an apportionment
within three (3) years after the census of 1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as the general elections in 1965 were
presumably held in conformity with said Election Law, and the legal provisions
creating Congress - with a House of Representatives composed of members elected
by qualified voters of representative districts as they exist­ed at the time of
said elections - remained in force, we can not see how said Members of the
House of Representatives can be regarded as <u>de</u> <u>facto</u> officers
owing to the failure of their predecessors in office to make a reapportionment
within the period aforementioned.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, the Constitution authorizes the impeachment
of the President, the Vice-President, the Justices of the Supreme Court and the
Auditor General for, <u>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></u>, culpable
violation of the Constitution,<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
the enforcement of which is, not only their mandatory duty, but, also their
main function.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This provision indicates
that, despite the vio­lation of such mandatory duty, the title to their
respective offices remains unimpaired, until dismissal or ouster pursuant to a
judgment of conviction rendered in accordance with Article IX of the
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, the loss of
office or the extinction of title thereto is not automatic.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even if we assumed, however, that the present Members of Congress
are merely <u>de</u> <u>facto</u> officers, it would not follow that the
contested resolutions and Republic Act No. 4913 are null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the main reason for the existence of
the <u>de</u> <u>facto</u> doctrine is that public interest demands that acts
of persons holding, under color of title, an office created by a valid statute
be, likewise, deemed valid insofar as the public - as distinguished from the
officer in question - is concerned.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, otherwise, those deal­ing with officers and employees of the Government
would be entitled to demand from them satisfactory proof of their title to the
position they hold, <u>before</u> dealing with them, or be­fore recognizing
their authority or obeying their commands, even if they should act within the
limits of the authority vest­ed in their respective offices, positions or
employments.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
One can imagine the great inconvenience, hardships and evils that would result
in the absence of the <u>de</u> <u>facto</u> doctrine.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a consequence, the title of a <u>de</u> <u>facto</u> officer
can­not be assailed collaterally.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
It may not be contested except directly, by <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span>
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither may the validity of
his acts be questioned upon the ground that he is merely a <u>de</u> <u>facto</u>
officer.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the reasons are obvious:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) it would be an <u>indirect</u> inquiry
into the title to the office; and (2) the acts of a <u>de</u> <u>facto</u>
officer, if within the compe­tence of his office, are valid, insofar as the
public is con­cerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is argued that the foregoing rules do not apply to the cases
at bar because the acts therein involved have not been completed and
petitioners herein are not third parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This pretense is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
inconsistent with <span class="SpellE">Tayko</span> vs. Ca­pistrano.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
In that case, one of the parties to a suit being heard before Judge Capistrano
objected to his continuing to hear the case, for the reason that, meanwhile, he
had reached the age of retirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
Court held that the objection could not be entertained, because the Judge was
at least, a <u>de</u> <u>facto</u> Judge, whose title can not be assailed
collaterally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted that <span class="SpellE">Tayko</span> was not a third party insofar as the Judge was
concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tayko</span>
was one of the parties in the aforemen­tioned suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, Judge Capistrano had not, as yet,
fin­ished hearing the case, much less rendered a decision therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No rights had vested in favor of any of the
parties, in consequence of the acts of said Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, <span class="SpellE">Tayko's</span>
objection was overruled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to
say, insofar as Congress is concerned, its acts, as regards the Resolutions
herein contested and Re­public Act No. 4913, are complete.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Congress has nothing else to do in connection
therewith.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is, also, unanimous in holding that the ob­jection
under consideration is untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Atty. Juan T. David, as <u>amicus</u> <u>curiae</u>, maintains
that Congress may either propose amendments to the Constitution or call a convention

two (2) alternatives are connected in the Constitution by the disjunctive
"or." Such basis is, however, weak one, in the absence of other circumstances
- and none has been brought to our attention - supporting the conclusion drawn
by the <u>amicus</u> <u>curiae</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, the term "or" has, oftentimes, been held to mean
"and," or vice-versa, when the spirit or context of the law warrants
it.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is, also, noteworthy that R.B.H. Nos. 1 and 3 propose
amendments to the constitutional provisions <u>on Congress</u>, to be submitted
to the people for ratification <u>on </u><st1:date month="11" day="14" year="1967"><u>November 14, 1967</u></st1:date>, whereas R.B.H. No. 2 calls for
a convention in <u>1971</u>, to consider proposals for amendment to the
Constitution, <u>in general</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, the subject-matter of R.B.H. No. 2 is different from that of
R.B.H. Nos. 1 and 3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the
amendments proposed under R.B.H. Nos. 1 and 3, will be submitted for
ratification several years <u>before</u> those that may be proposed by the
constitutional con­vention called in R.B.H. No. 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, although the three (3) resolutions
were passed on the same date, they were taken up and put to a vote separately,
or one <u>after</u> the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, they were <u>not</u> passed at the same time.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, we do not find, either in the Constitution, or in
the history thereof, anything that would negate the authority of different
Congresses to approve the contested Resolutions, or of the same Congress to
pass the same in different sessions or different days of the same congressional
session.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, neither has any plausible
reason been advanced to justify the denial of authority to adopt said
resolutions on the same day.</p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel ask:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since
Congress has decided to call a constitutional convention to propose amendments,
why not let the whole thing be submitted to said convention, instead of,
likewise, proposing some specific amendments, to be submitted for ratification
before said convention is held?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
force of this argument must be conceded, but the same impugns the <u>wisdom</u>
of the action taken by Congress, not its <u>authority</u> to take it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One seeming purpose thereof is to permit
Members of Congress to run for election as delegates to the constitutional
convention and participate in the proceedings therein, without forfeiting their
seats in Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not this
should be done is a political question, not subject to review by the courts of
justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">On this question there is no disagreement among the members of
the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article XV of the Constitution provides:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The
Congress in joint session assembled, by a vote of three-fourths of all the
Members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives voting separately,
may propose amendments to this Constitution or call a convention for that
purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such amendments shall be valid
as part of this Constitution when approved by a majority of the votes cast at
an election at which the amendments are submitted to the people for their
ratification."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is in this provision nothing to indicate that the
"election" therein referred to is a "special," not a
general election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The circumstance that
three previous amendments to the Constitution had been submitted to the people
for ratifi­cation in special elections merely shows that Congress deem­ed it
best to do so under the circumstances then obtaining.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not negate its authority to submit
proposed amendments for ratification in general elections.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would be better, from the viewpoint of a thorough discussion
of the proposed amendments, that the same be submitted to the people's approval
independently of the election of public officials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And there is no denying the fact that an adequate
appraisal of the merits and demerits of proposed amendments is likely to be
overshadowed by the great attention usually commanded by the choice of
personalities in­volved in general elections, particularly when provincial and
municipal officials are to be chosen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But, then, these con­siderations are addressed to the wisdom of holding
a plebi­scite simultaneously with the election of public officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They do not deny the authority of Congress to
choose either alternative, as implied in the term "election" used,
without qualification, in the above-quoted provision of the Constitu­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such authority becomes even more patent when
we con­sider:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the term
"election," normally refers to the choice or selection of candidates
to public office by popular vote; and (2) that the word used in Article V of
the Constitu­tion, concerning the grant of suffrage to women is, not "elec­tion,"
but "plebiscite."</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners maintain that the term "election," as used
in Section 1 of Art. XV of the Constitution, should be construed as meaning a <u>special</u>
election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some members of the Court even
feel that said term ("election") refers to a "plebiscite," <u>without</u>
any "election," general or special, of public officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They opine that constitutional amendments
are, in general, if not always, of such important, if not transcendental and
vital nature as to demand that the attention of the people be focused
exclusively on the subject-matter thereof, so that their votes thereon may
reflect no more than their intelligent, impartial and considered view on the
merits of the proposed amendments, unimpaired, or, at least, undiluted by
extraneous, if not insidious factors, let alone the partisan political
considerations that are likely to affect the selection of elective officials.</p>

<p class="BODY">This, certainly, is a situation to be hoped for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a goal the attainment of which should
be promoted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ideal conditions are,
however, one thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question whether
the Constitution <u>forbids</u> the submission of proposals for amend­ment to
the people <u>except under such conditions</u>, is another thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much as the writer and those who concur in
this opin­ion admire the contrary view, they find themselves unable to
subscribe thereto without, in effect, reading into the Con­stitution what they
believe is not written thereon and can not fairly be deduced from the letter
thereof, since the spirit of the law should not be a matter of sheer
speculation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The majority view - although the votes in favor thereof are
insufficient to declare Republic Act No. 4913 unconstitu­tional - as ably set
forth in the opinion penned by Mr. Justice Sanchez, is, however, otherwise.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not prepared to say that the foregoing measures are
palpably inadequate to comply with the constitutional requirement that
proposals for amendment be "submitted to the people for their
ratification," and that said measures are manifestly insufficient, from a
constitutional viewpoint, to inform the people of the amendments sought to be
made.</p>

<p class="BODY">These were substantially the same means availed of to inform the
people of the subject submitted to them for ratifica­tion, from the original
Constitution down to the Parity Amendment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, referring to the original Constitution, Section 1 of Act No. 4200,
provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Said Constitution, with the Ordinance appended thereto, shall
be published in the Official Gazette, in English and in Spanish, for three
consecutive issues at least fifteen days prior to said election, and a printed
copy of said Constitution, with the Ordinance appended thereto, shall be posted
in a conspicuous place in each municipal and provincial government office
building and in each polling place not later than the twenty-second day of
April, nineteen hundred and thirty-five, and shall remain posted therein
continually until after the termination of the election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At least ten copies of the Constitution with
the Ordinance append­ed thereto, in English and in Spanish, shall be kept at
each polling place available for examina­tion by the qualified electors during
election day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whenever practicable, copies
in the principal local dialects as may be determined by the Sec­retary of the
Interior shall also be kept in each polling place."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The provision concerning woman's suffrage in Section 1 of
Commonwealth Act No. 34, reading:</p>

<blockquote>"Said Article V of the Constitution shall be published in the
Official Gazette, in English and in Spanish, for three consecutive issues at
least fifteen days prior to said election, and the said Article V shall be
posted in a conspicuous place in each municipal and provincial office building
and in each polling place not later than the twenty-second day of April,
nineteen hundred and thirty-seven, and shall remain posted there­in continually
until after the termination of the plebiscite.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At least ten copies of the said Arti­cle V of the Constitution, in
English and in Spanish, shall be kept at each polling place avail­able for
examination by the qualified electors during the plebiscite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whenever practicable, copies in the principal
native languages, as may be determined by the Secretary of the In­terior, shall
also be kept in each polling place."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, Section 2, Commonwealth Act No. 517, re­ferring to the
1940 amendments, is of the following tenor:</p>

<blockquote>"The said amendments shall be publish­ed in English and
Spanish in three consecutive issues of the Official Gazette at least twenty
days prior to the election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A printed
copy thereof shall be posted in a conspicuous place in every municipal, city,
and pro­vincial government office building and in every polling place not later
than May eighteen, nineteen hundred and forty, and shall remain posted therein
until after the election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At least ten
copies of said amendments shall be kept in each polling place to be made
available for examination by the qualified electors during election day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When practicable, copies in the principal
native languages, as may be determined by the Secretary of the Interior, shall
also be kept therein."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As regards the Parity Amendment, Section 2 of Republic Act No. 73
is to the effect that:</p>

<blockquote>"The said amendment shall be publish­ed in English and Spanish
in three consecutive issues of the Official Gazette at least twenty days prior
to the election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A printed copy there­of
shall be posted in a conspicuous place in every municipal, city and provincial
government office building and in every polling place not later than February
eleven, nineteen hundred and forty-seven, and shall remain posted therein until
after the election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At least, ten copies
of the said amendment shall be kept in each polling place to be made available
for examination by the quali­fied electors during election day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When prac­ticable, copies in the principal
native languages, as may be determined by the Commission on Elections, shall
also be kept in each polling place."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The main difference between the present situation and that
obtaining in connection with the former proposals does not arise from the law
enacted <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The difference springs from the circumstance that the major political
parties had taken sides on previous amendments to the Constitution – except,
perhaps, the woman's suffrage – and, consequently, debated thereon at some
length before the plebiscite took place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the other hand, said political parties have not seemingly made an
issue on the amendments now being contested and have, ac­cordingly, refrained
from discussing the same in the current political campaign.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such debates or polemics as may have taken
place – on a rather limited scale – on the latest proposals for amendment, have
been due principally to the ini­tiative of a few civic organizations and some
militant mem­bers of our citizenry who have voiced their opinion thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A legislation cannot, however, be nullified
by reason of the failure of certain sectors of the community to discuss it
sufficiently.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its constitutionality or
unconstitutionality depends upon no other factors than those existing at the
time of the enactment thereof, unaffected by the acts or omissions of law
enforcing agencies, particularly those that take place subsequently to the
passage or approval of the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Referring particularly to the contested proposals for amendment,
the sufficiency or insufficiency, from a consti­tutional angle, of the
submission thereof for ratification to the people on November 14, 1967, depends
– in the view of those who concur in this opinion, and who, insofar as this
phase of the case, constitute the minority – upon whether the provisions of
Republic Act No. 4913 are such as to fair­ly apprise the people of the gist,
the main idea or the substance of said proposals, which is – under R.B.H. No. 1
– the increase of the maximum number of seats in the House of Representatives,
from 120 to 180, and – under R.B.H. No. 3 – the authority given to the members
of Congress to run for delegates to the Constitutional Convention and, if
elected thereto, to discharge the duties of such delegates, without forfeiting
their seats in Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We – who
constitute the minority – believe that Republic Act No. 4913 satisfies such
requirement and that said Act is, accordingly, constitutional.</p>

<p class="BODY">A considerable portion of the people may not know how over 160 of
the proposed maximum of representative districts are actually apportioned by
R.B.H. No. 1 among the provinces in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not improbable, how­ever, that they are
not interested in the details of the ap­portionment, or that a careful reading
thereof may tend, in their simple minds, to impair a clear vision thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, those who are more
sophisticated, may enlighten themselves sufficiently by reading the copies of
the proposed amendments posted in public places, the copies kept in the polling
places and the text of the contested resolutions, as printed in full on the
back of the bal­lots they will use.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is, likewise, conceivable that as many people, if not more,
may fail to realize or envisage the effect of R.B.H. No. 3 upon the work of the
Constitutional Convention or upon the future of our Republic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, then, nobody can foretell such effect
with certainty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From our viewpoint, the
provi­sions of Article XV of the Constitution are satisfied so long as the
electorate knows that R.B.H. No. 3 permits Con­gressmen to retain their seats
as legislators, even if they should run for and assume the functions of
delegates to the Convention.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are impressed by the factors considered by our distinguished
and esteemed brethren, who opine otherwise, but, we feel that such factors
affect the <u>wisdom</u> a Republic Act No. 4913 and that of R.B.H. Nos. 1 and
3, <u>not</u> the <u>authority</u> of Congress to approve the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">The system of checks and balances underlying the judicial power
to strike down acts of the Executive or of Congress transcending the confines
set forth in the funda­mental law is not in derogation of the principle of
separation of powers, pursuant to which each departments is supreme within its
own sphere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The determination of the
conditions under which the proposed amendments shall be submitted to the people
is concededly a matter which falls within the legislative sphere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not believe it has been satisfac­torily
shown that Congress has exceeded the limits thereof in enacting Republic Act
No. 4913.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Presumably, it could have done
something better to enlighten the people on the subject-matter thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, then, no law is perfect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No product of human endeavor is beyond
improvement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, no legislation
would be constitutional and valid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Six
(6) Members of this Court believe, however, said Act and R.B.H. Nos. 1 and 3
violate the spirit of the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as there are less than eight (8) votes in favor of
declaring Republic Act 4913 and R.B.H. Nos. 1 and 3 unconstitutional and
invalid, the petitions in these two (2) cases must be, as they are hereby,
dismissed, and the writs therein prayed for denied, without special pro­nouncement
as to costs.</p>

others except pursuant to and in the manner authorized by law.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Based upon this principle, petitioners Ramon <span style="">A. </span>Gonzales and Philippine Constitution Association (PHILCONSA)
come to this Court in separate petitions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Gonzales, as taxpayer, voter and citizen, and<span style=""> </span>allegedly in representation thru
class suit of all citizens of this country, filed this suit for prohibition
with preliminary injunction to restrain the Commission on Elections, Director
of Printing and Auditor General from implementing and/or complying with
Republic Act 4913, assailing said law as unconstitutional.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner PHILCONSA, as a civic, non-profit and non partisan
corporation, assails the constitutionality not only of Republic Act 4913 but
also of Resolutions of Both Houses Nos. 1 and <span style="">3 </span>of <st1:date month="3" day="16" year="1967">March 16, 1967</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Republic Act 4913, effective <st1:date month="6" day="17" year="1967">June 17, <span style="">1967</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>is an Act submitting to the Filipino
people for approval the amendments to the Constitution of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
proposed by the Congress of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in Resolutions of Both Houses Numbered <span style="">1
</span>and 3, adopted on <st1:date month="3" day="16" year="1967">March 16,
 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said Republic Act
fixes the date and manner of the election at which the aforesaid proposed
amendments shall be voted upon by the people, and appropriates funds for said
election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Resolutions of Both Houses
Nos. <span style="">1 </span>and <span style="">3 </span>propose two amend­ments to the
Constitution:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the first, to amend Sec. <span style="">5, </span>Art. VI, by increasing the maximum
membership of the House of Representatives from 120 to 180, apportioning 160 of
said 180 seats and eliminating the provision that Congress shall by law make an
apportionment within three years after the return of every enumeration; the
second, to amend Sec. 16, Art. VI, by allowing Senators and Representatives to
be delegates to a constitutional convention without forfeit­ing their seats.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since both petitions relate to the proposed amendments, they are
considered together herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Specifically and briefly, petitioner Gonzales’ objec­tions are as
follows: (1) Republic Act 4913 violates Sec. 1, Art. XV of the Constitution, in
submitting the proposed amendments to the Constitution, to the people for approval,
at the general election of 1967 instead of at a special election solely for
that purpose; (2) Republic Act 4913 violates Sec. 1, Art. XV of the
Constitution, since it was not passed with the 3/4 vote in joint session
required when Congress proposes amendments to the Constitution, said Republic
Act being a step in or part of the process of proposing amendments to the
Constitution; and (3) Repub­lic Act 4913 violates the due process clause of the
Cons­titution (Sec. 1, <span class="SpellE">Subsec</span>. 1, Art. III), <span style="">in </span>not requiring that the substance of
the proposed amendments be stated on the face of the ballot or otherwise
rendering clear the import of the proposed amendments, such as by stating the
provisions before and after said amendments, instead of printing at the back of
the ballot only the proposed amendments.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since observance of Constitutional provisions on the <u>procedure</u>
for amending the Constitution is concerned, the issue is cognizable by this
court under its powers to review an Act of Congress to determine its conformity
to the fundamental law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For though the
Constitution leaves Congress free to propose whatever Constitutional amendment
it deems fit, so that the <u>substance</u> or <u>content</u> of said proposed
amendment is a matter of policy and wisdom and thus a political question, the
Constitution nevertheless imposes requisites as to the <u>manner</u> or <u>procedure</u>
of propos­ing such amendments, <u>e</u>.<u>g</u>., the three fourths vote
require­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said procedure or manner,
therefore, far from being left to the discretion of Congress, as a matter of
policy and wisdom, is fixed by the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And to that extent, all questions bearing on
whether Congress in proposing amendments followed the procedure required by the
Constitution, is perforce <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>, it not being a
matter of policy or wisdom.</p>

<p class="BODY">Turning then to petitioner Gonzales' first objection, Sec. 1,
Art. XV clearly does not bear him on the point.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It nowhere required that the ratification be thru an election <u>solely</u>
for that purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It only requires that
it be at "an election at which the amendments are submitted <span style="">to </span>the people for their
ratification".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To join it with an
election for candidates to public <span style="">office, </span>that <span style="">is, </span>to make it concurrent with such
election, does not render it any less an election at which the proposed
amendments are sub­mitted to the people for their ratification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No prohibition being found in the plain terms
of the Constitution, none should be inferred.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Had the framers of the Constitution thought of requiring a special
election for the purpose only of the proposed amendments, they could have said
so, by qualifying the phrase with some word such as "special" or
“solely” or "exclusively".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They did not.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not herein decided that such concurrence of elec­tion is
wise, or that it would not have been better to provide for a separate election
exclusively for the ratifica­tion of the proposed amendments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The point however is that such separate and
exclusive election, even if it may be better or wiser, which again, is not for
this Court to decide, is<span style=""> </span>not
included in the procedure required by the Constitution to amend the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The function of the Judi­ciary is "not
to pass upon questions of wisdom, justice or expediency of legislation.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">It is </span>limited to determining
whether the action taken by the Legislative Department has violated the
Constitution or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this score, I am
off the opinion that it has not.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Gonzales' second point is that Republic Act 4913 is
deficient for not having been passed by Congress in joint session by 3/4 vote.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sec. 1, Art. XV of the Constitution provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 1. The Congress in joint session assembled, by a vote of
three-fourths of all the members of the Senate and of the House of
Representatives voting separately, may pro­pose amendments to this Constitution
or call a convention for that purpose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such amendments shall be valid as part of this Constitu­tion when
approved by a majority of the votes cast at an election at which the amendments
are submitted to the people for their ratification."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Does Republic Act 4913 propose amendments to the
Constitution?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If by the term
"propose amendment" is meant to determine WHAT said amendment shall
be, then Republic Act 4913 does not; Resolutions of Both Houses 1 and <span style="">3 </span>already did that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, on the other hand, it means, or also
means, to provide for how, when, and by what means the amendments shall be <u>submitted</u>
to the people for approv­al, then it does.</p>

<p class="BODY">A careful reading of Sec. 1, Art. XV shows that the first sense
is the one intended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said Section has
two sentences; in the first, <span style="">it </span><span style="">requires </span>the 3/4
voting in Join session, for Congress to "propose amendments’.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And there in the second sentence, it provides
that "such amendments …shall be submitted to the people for their
ratification".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This clearly
indicates that by the term "propose <span style="">amendments" </span>in the first sentence is meant to frame the
substance or the content or the WHAT-element of the amendments; for it is this
and this alone that is submitted to the people for their ratification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The details of when the election shall be
held for approval or rejection of the proposed amendments, or the manner of
holding it, are not submitted for ratification to form part of the Consti­tution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated differently, the plain language of
Section 1, Art. XV, shows that the act of proposing amendments is distinct from
- albeit related to - that of submitting the amendments to the people for their
ratification; and that the 3/4 voting requirement applies only to the first
step, not to the second one.</p>

<p class="BODY">It follows that the submission of proposed amendments can be done
thru an ordinary statute passed by Congress.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Constitution does not expressly state by whom the sub­mission shall
be undertaken; the rule is that a power not lodged elsewhere under the
Constitution is deemed to reside with the legislative body, under the doctrine
of residuary powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Congress therefore
validly enacted Republic Act 4913 to fix the details of the date and manner of
submitting the proposed amendments to the people for their ratification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since it does not "propose
amendments" in the sense referred to by Sec. 1, Art. XV of the
Constitution, but merely provides for how and when the amendments, already
proposed, are going to be voted upon, the same does not need the 3/4 vote in
joint session required in Sec. 1, Art. XV of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, Republic Act 4913 is an
appropriation measure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sec. <span style="">6 </span>thereof appropriates P1,000,000 for
carrying out its provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sec. 18,
Art. VI of the Constitution states that "All appropriation … bills shall
originate exclusively in the House of Representatives".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Republic Act 4913, therefore, could not have
been validly adopted in a joint session, reinforcing the view that Sec. 1, Art.
XV does not apply to such a measure providing for the holding of the election
to ratify the proposed amendments, which must perforce appropriate funds for
its purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Gonzales contends, thirdly, that Republic Act 4913
does not offend against substantive due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An examination of the provisions of the law
shows no violation of the due process clause of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The publi­cation in the Official Gazette at
least 20 days before the election, the posting of notices in public buildings <span style="">not </span>later than October 14, 1967, to
remain posted until after the elections, the placing of copies of the proposed
amend­ments in the polling places, aside from printing the same at the back of
the ballot, provide sufficient opportunity to the voters to cast an intelligent
vote on the proposal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due process refers
only to providing fair opportunity; it does not guarantee that the opportunity
given will in fact be availed of; that is the look-out of the voter and the
responsibility of the citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As long
as fair and reason­able opportunity to be informed is given, and it is, the due
process clause is not infringed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Non-printing of the provisions to be amended as they now stand,
and the printing of the full proposed amend­ments at the back of the ballot
instead of the substance thereof at the face of the ballot, do not deprive the
voter of fair opportunity to be informed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The present wording of the Constitution is not being veiled <span style="">or </span>suppressed
from him; he is conclusively presumed to know them and they are available
should he want to check on what he is conclusively presumed to know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should the voters choose to remain ig­norant
of the present Constitution, the fault does not lie with Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For opportunity to familiarize oneself with
the Constitution as it stands has been available thru all these years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps it would have been more convenient
for the voters if the present wording of the provisions were also to be printed
on the ballot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same however is a
matter of policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As long as the method
adopted provides sufficiently reasonable chance to intelligently vote on the
amendments, and I think it does in this case, it is not constitutionally
defective.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Gonzales' other arguments touch on the merits or
wisdom of the proposed amendments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
are for the people in their sovereign capacity to decide, not for this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two arguments were further advanced:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>first, that Congress cannot both call a
convention and propose amend­ments; second, that the present Congress is a <u>de</u>
<u>facto</u> one, since no apportionment law was adopted within three years
from the last census of 1960, so that the Representatives elected in 1961 are <u>de</u>
<u>facto</u> officers only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not being <u>de</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>jure</u></span>, they cannot propose amendments, it is
argued.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the first point, Sec. 1 of Art. XV states that Congress
"may propose amendments <u>or</u> call a convention for that
purpose".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The term "or",
however, is frequently used as having the same meaning as "and"
particularly in permis­sive, affirmative sentences so that the interpretation
of the word <span style="">"or" as </span>"and"
in the Constitution in such use will not change its meaning (Vicksburg, S.
&amp; P. R. Co. v. Good enough, 32 So. <span style="">404,
411, </span>108 La. 442).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it should
be pointed out that the resolutions proposing amendments (R.B.H. Nos. 1 and 3)
are different from that calling for a convention (R.B.H. No. 2).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely, if Congress deems it better or wise
to amend the Constitution before a conven­tion called for is elected, it should
not be fettered from doing so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For our
purposes in this case, suffice it to note that the Constitution does not
prohibit it from doing so.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the second argument, it is also true that Sec. <span style="">5 </span>of Art. VI of the Constitution
provides in part that "The Congress shall by law make an apportionment
within three years after the return of every enumeration, and not
otherwise".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It however further
states in the next sentence: "Until such apportionment shall have been
made, the House of Representatives shall have the same number of Members as
that fixed by law for the National Assembly, who shall be elected by the
qualified electors from the present As­sembly districts”.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The failure of Congress, therefore, to pass a
valid redistricting law since the time the above provision was adopted, does
not render the present dis­tricting illegal or unconstitutional.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the Constitution itself provides for its
continuance in such case, rendering legal and <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>jure</u></span>
the <u>status</u> <u>quo</u><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">For the above reasons, I vote to uphold the consti­tutionality of
Republic Act 4913, and fully concur with the opinion of the Chief Justice.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Concurring Opinion<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">FERNANDO, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">At the outset, we are faced with a question of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The opinion prepared by the Chief Justice
discusses the matter with a fullness that erases doubts and misgivings and
clarifies the applicable principles.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A few
words may however be added.</p>

<p class="BODY">We start from the premise that only where it can be shown that
the question is to be solved by public opinion or where the matter has been
left by the Constitution to the sole discretion of any of the political
branches, as was so clearly stated by the then Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
in <span class="SpellE">Tañada</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
may this Court avoid passing on the issue before it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever may be said about the present
question, it is hard to speak with certitude, considering Article <span class="GramE">XV, that</span> Congress may be entrusted with the full and un­controlled
discretion on the procedure leading to proposals for an amendment of the
Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be said however that in <span class="SpellE">Mabanag</span>
v. Lopez Vito,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court through Justice <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> followed Coleman v.
Miller,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
in its holding that certain aspects of the amending process may be considered
political.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His opinion quoted with
approval the view of Justice Black, to which three other members of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> Supreme Court agreed, that the
process itself is political in its entirety, "from submission until an
amendment becomes part of the Constitution, and is not subject to judicial
guidance, control or interference at any point.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In a sense that would solve the matter neatly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judiciary would be spared the at times arduous
and in every case soul-searching process of determining whether the procedure
for amendments required by the Constitution has been followed.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the same time, without impugning the motives of Congress,
which cannot be judicially inquired into at any rate, it is not beyond the
realm of possibility that a failure to observe the requirements of Article XV
would occur.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the event that judicial
intervention is sought, to rely automatically on the theory of political
question to avoid passing on such a matter of delicacy might under certain
circumstances be considered, and rightly so, as nothing less than judicial
abdication or surrender.</p>

<p class="BODY">What appears regrettable is that a major opinion of an esteemed
jurist, the late <span style="">Justice <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>, </span>would no longer be controlling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is comfort in the thought that the view
that then prevailed was itself a product of the times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could very well be that con­sidering the
circumstances existing in 1947 as well as the particular amendment sought to be
incorporated in the Constitution, the parity rights ordinance, the better part
of wisdom in view of the grave economic situation then confronting the country
would be to avoid the existence of any obstacle to its being submitted for
ratification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the Republic being
less than a year old, American Supreme Court opinions on constitutional
questions were invariably accorded uncritical acceptance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus the approach followed by Justice <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> is not difficult to understand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be said that there is less propensity
now, which is all to the good, for this Court to <span style="">accord </span>that much deference to constitutional views coming from
that quarter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is this mode of viewing the opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> to do injustice to his memory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For as he stated in another major opinion in <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
in ascertaining the meaning to be given the Emergency Powers Act,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
one should not ignore what would ensure if a particular mode or construction
were followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As he so emphatically
stated, ''We test a rule by <span style="">its </span>results.
“<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The consequences of a judicial veto on the then proposed amend­ment
on the economic survival of the country, an erroneous appraisal it turned <span style="">out </span>later, constituted an effective
argument for its submission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why not
then consider the question political and let the people decide? That assumption
could have been indulged in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could
very well be the inarticulate major premise.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For many it did bear the stamp of judicial statesmanship.</p>

<p class="BODY">The opinion of Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
renders crystal-clear why as of this date and in the foreseeable future
judicial inquiry to assure the <span style="">utmost </span>compliance
with the constitutional requirement <span style="">would
be a more appropriate response.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Concurring Opinion<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">MAKALINTAL, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the foregoing opinion of the Chief <span style="">Justice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>I would make some additional observations in connection with my
concurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sections 2 and 4 of
Republic Act No. 4913 provide:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. <span style="">2.</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="GramE">The</span>
amendments shall be <span style="">published in </span>three
consecutive issues of the Official Gazette at least twenty days prior to the
election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A printed copy thereof shall
be posted in a conspicuous place in every municipality, city and provin­cial
office building and in every polling place not later than October fourteen,
nineteen hundred and sixty?seven, and shall remain posted there<span style="">in until after </span>the election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At <span style="">least
five copies of the said amend­</span>ments shall be kept in each polling place
to be made available for examination by the qualified electors during <span class="GramE">election day</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
practicable, copies in the principal native languages, <span style="">as </span>may be determined by the Commission on Elections, shall be
kept in each polling place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Commission on Elections shall make available copies of each amendments in
English, Spanish and, whenever practicable, in the principal native languages,
for free distribution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 4.</span> The ballots which shall be <span style="">used in </span>the election for the approval
of said amendments shall be printed in English and Pilipino and shall be in the
size and form prescribed by the Commission on Elections:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, however, That at the back of said
ballot there shall be printed in full Resolu­tions of both Houses of Congress
Numbered One and Three, both adopted on March sixteen, nineteen hundred and
sixty-seven, proposing the amendments:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Provided, <span style="">further, That the
questionnaire </span><span style="">appearing on the
face of the ballot shall be as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Are you in favor of the proposed amendment to section sixteen of
Article VI of our Constitution printed at the back of this ballot?</blockquote>

<blockquote>To vote for the approval of the proposed amendments, the voter
shall write the word "yes" or its equivalent in Filipino or in the
local dialect in <span style="">the blank space after
each question; to </span>vote for the rejection thereof, he shall write the
word "No" or its equivalent in Filipino or in the local
dialect."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I believe that intrinsically,
that is, considered in itself and without reference to extraneous factors and
circumstances, the manner prescribed in the aforesaid provisions is sufficient
for the purpose of having the proposed amendments submitted to the people for
their ratification, as enjoined in Section 1, Article XV of the
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am at a loss to say what
</span><span style="">else </span><span style="">should have been required by the Act to make
it adhere more closely to the constitutional requirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly it would have been out of place to
provide, for instance, that government officials and employees should go out
and explain the amendments to the people, or that they should be the subject of
any particular means or form of public discussion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The objection of some
members of the Court to Republic Act No. 4913 seems to me predicated on the
fact that there </span>are so <span style="">many
other issues at stake in the coming </span>general election that the attention
of the <span style="">electorate cannot </span>be
entirely focused on the proposed amendments, such that there is a failure to
properly submit <span style="">them </span>for
ratification within the intendment of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If that <span style="">is
</span>so, then the defect is not intrinsic <span style="">in </span>the <span style="">law </span>but in its implementation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span style="">same
</span>manner of submitting the proposed <span style="">amendments
to the people for ratification may, in a dif­ferent setting, <span class="GramE">be</span>
sufficient for the purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet I cannot
conceive that the constitutionality or unconsti­</span>tutionality of a law may
be made to depend willy-nilly on <span style="">factors
not inherent in its provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a </span><span style="">law </span><span style="">to be </span>struck <span style="">down as </span><span style="">unconstitutional it must be so by reason of </span>some irreconcilable
conflict between it and the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise <span style="">a </span>law may be
either valid or invalid, according to circumstances not found in its
provisions, such as the <span style="">zeal </span>with
which they are carried out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To such a
thesis, <span style="">I </span>cannot agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The criterion would be too broad and
relative, <span style="">and </span>dependent upon
individual opinions that at best are subjec­tive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What one may regard as sufficient compliance
with the requirement of submission to the people, within the context of the
same law, may not be so to another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
question <span style="">is </span>susceptible of as
many views as there are viewers; and I do not think this Court would be
justified in saying that its own view on the matter is the correct one, to the
ex­clusion of the opinions of others.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, I reject the argument that <span style="">the </span>ratification must necessarily be
in <span style="">a special </span>election <span style="">or </span>plebiscite called for that purpose
alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While such <span style="">pro­cedure </span>is highly to be preferred,
the Constitution speaks simply of "<u>an election</u> at which the
amendments are submitted to the <span style="">people
for their </span>ratification," and I do not subscribe to the restrictive
interpretation that the petitioners <span style="">would
</span>place on this provision, namely, that it means only a <span style="">special </span>election.</p>

<i>J.</i>:</span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the result with the opinion penned by Mr. Justice
Sanchez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To approve a mere proposal to
amend the Constitution requires (Art. XV) a three-fourths (3/4) vote of all the
members of each legislative chamber, the highest majority ever demanded by the
fundamental charter, one higher even than that required in order to declare war
(sec. 24, Article VI)<span style="">, </span>with all
its dire consequences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If such an
overwhelming majority, that was evidently exacted in order to impress upon all
and sundry the seriousness of every constitutional amendment, is asked for a
proposal to amend the Constitution, I find it impossible to believe that it was
ever intended by its framers that such amendment should be submitted and
ratified by just "a majority of the votes cast at an election at which the
amendments are submitted to the people for their ratification", if the
concentration of the people's attention thereon is to be diverted by other extraneous
issues, such as the choice of local and national officials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The framers of the Constitution, aware of the
fundamental character thereof, and of the need of giving it as much stability
as is practicable, could have only meant that any amendments thereto should be
debated, considered and voted upon at an election wherein the people could
devote undivided attention to the subject.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That this was the intention and the spirit of the provision is
corroborated in the case of all other constitutional amendments in the past,
that w<span style="">ere </span>submitted to and
approved in special elections exclusively devoted to the <span style="">is</span>sue whether the legislature's
amendatory proposals should be ratified or not.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">SANCHEZ, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">Right at the outset, the writer expresses his deep appreciation
to Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Calixto</span> O. <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>
and Mr. Justice Fred Ruiz Castro for their invaluable contribution to the
substance and form of the opinion which follows.</p>

<p class="BODY">Directly under attack in this, a petition for prohibition, is the
constitutionality of Republic Act 4913, approved on <st1:date year="1967" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Act seeks to implement Resolutions 1 and 3 adopted by the Senate
and the House of Representatives on <st1:date year="1967" day="16" month="3">March
 16, 1967</st1:date> with the end in view of amending vital portions of the
Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the problem here presented has its roots in the resolutions
aforesaid of both houses of Congress, it may just as well be that we recite in
brief the salient features thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Resolution No. 1 increases the membership of the House of
Representatives from 120 to 180 members and immediately apportions 160
seats.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A companion resolution is Reso­lution
No. 3 which permits Senators and Congressmen - without for­feiting their seats
in Congress - to be members of the Constitutional Convention<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
to be convened, as provided in another resolution - Resolution No. 2.
Parenthetically, two of these proposed amendments to the Constitution
(Resolutions 1 and 3) are to be submitted to the people for their ratification
next <st1:date year="1967" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Resolution No.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>2 just adverted to calls for a constitutional
convention also <u>to</u> <u>propose</u> <u>amendments</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u>
<u>Constitution</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The delegates
thereto are to be elected on the second Tuesday of November, <u>1970</u>; the
convention to sit on <st1:date year="1971" day="1" month="6">June 1, <u>1971</u></st1:date>;
and the amendments proposed by the convention to be submitted to the people
thereafter for their ratification.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of importance now are the proposed amendment increasing the
number of members of the House of Representatives under Resolution No. 1, and
that in Resolution No. 3 which gives Senators and Congressmen the right to sit
as members of the constitutional convention to be convened on June 1,
1971.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, these are the two
amendments to be submitted to the people in the general elections soon to be
held on <st1:date year="1967" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1967</st1:date>,
upon the provisions of Section 1, Republic Act 4913, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"The amendments to the Constitution of the Philippines
proposed by the Congress of the Philip­pines in Resolutions of both Houses
Numbered One and Three, both adopted on March sixteen, nineteen hundred and
sixty-seven, shall be submitted to the people for approval at the general
election which shall be held on November fourteen, nineteen hundred and
sixty-seven, in accordance with the provisions of this <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Act."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Republic Act 4913 projects the basic angle of the problem thrust
upon us - the manner in which the amendments proposed by Congress just adverted
to are to be brought to the people's attention.</p>

<p class="BODY">First, to the controlling constitutional precept.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order that proposed amendments to the
Constitution may become effective, Section 1, Article XV thereof commands that
such amendments must be "approved by a majority of the votes cast at an
election at which the amendments are <u>submitted</u> to the people for their <u>ratification</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accent is on two words complementing each
other, namely, "submitted" and "ratification."</p>

<p class="BODY">1. We are forced to take a long hard look at the core of the problem
facing us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this, because the
amendments submitted are transcendental and encompassing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ceiling of the number of Congressmen is
sought to be elevated from 120 to 180 members; and Senators and Congressmen may
run in constitutional conventions without forfeiting their seats.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These certainly affect the people as a
whole.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The increase in the number of
Congressmen has its pro­portional increase in the people's tax burdens.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They may not look at this with favor, what
with the constitutional provision (Section 5, Article VI) that Congress
"shall by law make an apportionment", without the necessity of
disturbing the present constitutionally pro­vided number of Congressmen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, for instance, may balk at the specific apportionment of the 160 seats set
forth in Resolution No. 1, and ask for a Congressman of their own, on the
theory of equal representation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
then, people may question the propriety of permitting the increased 180
Congressmen from taking part in the forthcoming constitutional convention and
future conventions for fear that they may dominate its proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They may entertain the belief that, if at
all, increase in the number of Congressmen should be a proper topic for deliberation
in a constitutional convention which, anyway, will soon take place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They probably would ask:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why the hurry?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These <span class="SpellE">ponderables</span>
require the people's close scrutiny.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. With these as backdrop, we perforce go into the philosophy
behind the constitutional directive that constitutional amendments be submitted
to the people for their ratification.</p>

<p class="BODY">A constitutional amendment is not a temporary expedient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unlike a statute which may suffer amendments
three or more times in the same year, it is intended to stand the test of
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an expression of the
people’s sovereign will.</p>

<p class="BODY">And so, our approach to the problem of the mechanics of submission
for ratification of amendments is that <u>reasoning on the basis of the</u> <u>spirit</u>
<u>of the Constitution is just as important as</u> <u>reasoning</u> <u>by</u> <u>a
strict</u> <u>adherence</u> <u>to the phraseology</u> <u>thereof</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>We</u> underscore this, because it is
within the realm of possibility that a Constitution may be overhauled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Supposing three-fourths of the Constitution
is to be amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or, the proposal is to
eliminate the all-important Bill of Rights in its entirety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe it to be beyond debate that in
some such situations the amendments ought to call for a constitutional
convention rather than a legislative proposal. "And yet, nothing there is
in the books or in the Constitution itself which would require such amendments
to be adopted by a constitutional convention. And then, too, the spirit of the
supreme enactment, we are sure, forbids that proposals <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
be initiated by Congress and thereafter presented to the people for their ratification.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the context just adverted to, we take the view that the words
"submitted to the people for their ratification" if construed in the
light of the nature of the Constitution - a fundamental charter that is
legislation direct from the people, an expression of their sovereign will -
mean that it can only be amended by the people expressing them­selves according
to the procedures ordained by the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, amendments must be fairly laid before the people for their
blessing or spurning. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The people are not
to be mere rubber stamps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are not
to vote blindly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They must be afforded
ample opportunity to mull over the original provisions, compare them with the
proposed amendments, and try to reach a conclusion as the dictates of their conscience
suggest, free from the incubus of extraneous or possibly insidious influences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe the word "submitted" can
only mean that the government, within its maximum capabilities should strain
every effort to inform every citizen of the provisions to be amended, and the
proposed amendments and the meaning, nature and effects thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By this, we are not to be understood as
saying that, if one citizen or 100 citizens or 1,000 citizens cannot be
reached, then there is no submission within the meaning of the word as intended
by the framers of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
the Constitution in effect directs is that the government, in submitting an
amendment for ratification, should put every instrumentality or agency within
its structural framework to enlighten the people, educate them with respect to
their act of ratification or rejection.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For, as we have earlier stated, one thing is <u>submission</u> and
another is <u>ratification</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
must be fair submission, intelligent consent or rejection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If with all these safe­guards the people
still approve the amendment no matter how pre­judicial it is to them, then so
be it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, the people decree their own
fate.</p>

<p class="BODY">Aptly had it been said:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The
great men who <span class="SpellE">builded</span> the structure of our state in

Cooley, who has said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'A good
Constitution should be beyond the reach of tem­porary excitement and popular
caprice or passion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is <span style="">needed for stability and steadiness; it must
yield to the thought of the people; not to the whim of the people, or the
thought evolved in excitement or hot blood, but the sober second thought, which
alone, if the government is to be safe, can be allowed efficiency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * <u>Changes</u> <u>in</u> <u>government</u>
<u>are</u> <u>to</u> <u>be</u> <u>feared</u> <u>unless</u> <u>the</u> <u>benefit

<p class="BODY">3. Tersely put, the issue before Us funnels down to this pro­position:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the people are not sufficiently informed
of the amendments to be voted upon, to conscientiously deliberate thereon, to
express their will in a genuine manner, can it be said that in accordance with
the constitutional mandate, "the amendments are submitted to the people
for their ratification?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our answer
is "No''.</p>

<p class="BODY">We examine Republic Act 4913, approved on <st1:date year="1967" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1967</st1:date> - the statute that submits to the
people the constitutional amendments proposed by Congress in Resolutions 1 and
3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 2 of the Act provides the
manner of propagation of the nature of the amendments throughout the
country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are five parts in said
Section 2, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(1)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">The amendments shall be published
in three consecutive issues of the Official Gazette at least twenty days prior
to the election.</span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(2)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">A printed copy thereof shall be
posted in a conspicuous place in every municipality, city and provincial office
building and in every polling place not later than October fourteen, nineteen
hundred and sixty-seven, and shall remain posted therein until after the
election.</span></p>

<p class="NUM">(3) At least five copies of the said amendments shall be kept in
each polling place to be made available for examination by the qualified
electors during election day.</p>

<p class="NUM">(4) When practicable, copies in the principal native languages, as
may be determined by the Commission on Elections, shall be kept in each polling
place.</p>

<p class="NUM">(5) The Commission on Elections shall make available copies of
said amendments in English, Spanish and, whenever practicable, in the principal
native languages, for free distribution.</p>

<p class="BODY">A question that comes to mind is whether the procedure for
dissemination of information regarding the amendments effectively brings the
matter to the people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A dissection of
the mechanics yields disturbing thoughts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>First, the Official Gazette is not widely read.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not reach the barrios.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And even if it reaches the barrios, is it
available to all?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if it is, would
all understand English?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Second, it should
be conceded that many citizens, especially those in the outlying barrios, do
not go to municipal, city and/or provincial office buildings, except on special
occasions like paying taxes or responding to court summonses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if they do, will they notice the printed
amendments posted on the bulletin board?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And if they do notice, such copy again is in English (sample submitted
to this Court by the Solicitor General) for, anyway, the statute does not
require that it be in any other language or dialect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Third, it would not help any if at least five
copies are kept in the polling place for examination by qualified electors
during election day, As petitioner puts it, voting time is not study time. And
then, who can enter the polling place except those who are about to vote?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fourth, copies in the principal native
languages shall be kept in each polling place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But this is not, as Section 2 itself implies, in the nature of a command
because such copies shall be kept therein <u>only</u> "when
practicable" and "as may be determined by the Commission on
Elections."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if it be said that
these are available before election, a citizen may not intrude into the school
building where the polling places are usually located without disturbing the
school classes being held there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fifth,
it is true that the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> is directed to make
available copies of such amendments in English, Spanish or whenever
practicable, in the principal native languages, for free distribution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> is
not required to actively distribute them to the people. This is significant as
to people in the provinces, especially those in the far-flung barrios who are
com­pletely unmindful of the discussions that go on now and then in the cities
and centers of population on the merits and demerits of the amendments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ruther, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, in
this case, is but a passive agency which may hold copies available, but which
copies may not be dis­tributed at all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Finally, it is of common knowledge that <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
has more than its hands full in these pre-election days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They cannot possibly make extensive
distribution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Voters will soon go to the polls to say "yes" or
"no".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even the official
sample ballot submitted to this Court would show that only the amendments are
printed at the back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this, in
pursuance to Republic Act 4913 itself.</p>

<p class="BODY">Surely enough, when the voters do not have the benefit of proper
notice of the proposed amendments thru dissemination by publication <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>extenso</u></span> and people do not have at hand the necessary
data on which to base their stand on the merits and demerits of said
amendments.</p>

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, hold that there is no proper <u>submission</u> of
the proposed constitutional amendments within the meaning and intendment of
Section 1, article XV of the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contemporary history is
witness to the fact that during the present election campaign the focus is on
the election of candidates. The constitutional amendments are crowded out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Candidates on the homestretch, and their
leaders as well as the voters, gear their undivided efforts to the election of
officials; the constitutional amendments cut no ice with them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The truth is that even in the ballot itself,
the space accorded to the casting of "yes" or "no" vote
would give one the impression that the constitutional amendments are but a
bootstrap to the electoral ballot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse
still, the fortunes of many elective officials, on the national and local
levels, are inextricably intertwined with the results of the vote on the
plebiscite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a clash between votes for
a candidate and conscience on the merits and demerits of the constitutional
amendments, we are quite certain that it is the latter that will be dented.</p>

<p class="BODY">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That proper submission
of amendments to the people to enable them to equally ratify them properly is
the meat of the constitutional requirement, is reflected in the sequence of
uniform past practices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constitution
had been amended thrice – in 1939, 1940 and 1947.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In each case, the amendments were embodied in
resolutions adopted by the Legislature, which thereafter fixed the dates at which
the proposed amendments were to be ratified or rejected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These plebiscites have been referred to
either as an "election" or "general election".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At no time, however, was the vote for the
amendments of the Constitution held simultaneously with the election of
officials, national or local.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even with
regard to the 1947 parity amendment, the record shows that the sole issue was
the 1947 parity amendment; and the special elections simultaneously held in
only three provinces, Iloilo, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>, were merely <u>incidental</u> thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the end, we say that the people are the last ramparts that
guard against indiscriminate changes in the Constitution that is theirs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is it too much to ask that reasonable guarantee
be made that in the matter of the alterations of the law of the land, their <u>true</u>
voice be heard?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer perhaps is
best expressed in the following thoughts:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"<u>It</u> <u>must</u> <u>be</u> <u>remembered</u> <u>that</u> <u>the</u>
<u>Constitution</u> <u>is</u> <u>the</u> <u>people's</u> <u>enactment</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>No</u> <u>proposed</u> <u>change</u> <u>can</u>
<u>become</u> <u>effective</u> <u>unless</u> <u>they</u> <u>will</u> <u>it</u> <u>so</u>
<u>through</u> <u>the</u> <u>compelling</u> <u>force</u> <u>of</u> <u>need</u> <u>of</u>
<u>it</u> <u>and</u> <u>desire</u> <u>for</u> <u>it</u>.”<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">For the reasons given, our vote is that a republic Act 4913 must
be stricken down as in violation of the Constitution.</p>
