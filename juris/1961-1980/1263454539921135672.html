				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, convicting appellant Mariano <span class="SpellE">Daga</span>
of the crime of robbery with homicide, with which he is charged, and sentencing
him to life imprisonment, to indemnify the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Potenciano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Barbasa</span> in the sum <span style="">of P6<span class="GramE">,<span style="">000.00</span></span></span>,
in addition to the sum of P108.40, representing the value of the stolen goods,
and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that on March 5, 1960, at about 2:00 a.m., a
thief entered the house of <span class="SpellE">Potenciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Barbasa</span> – in the barrio of Pawing, municipality of Palo,
province of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> – and stole from the bedroom thereof
two (2) watches and a ring all valued at P105.00, and money in cash amounting
to P3.40, and <span style="">then </span>stabbed <span class="SpellE">Potenciano</span> – <span style="">as </span>the
latter woke up and grappled with him inside said room – with a knife on the
left side of the stomach, thereby inflicting upon him a wound, in consequence
of which he died on March 6, 1960, at 3:00 a.<span style="">m.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The only issue in this case is the identity of the culprit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, <span class="SpellE">Epifania</span>
<span class="SpellE">Barbasa</span>, widow of the deceased, and their children,
Milagros and William, both surnamed <span class="SpellE">Barbasa</span>, who were
inside the bedroom at the time of the occurrence, positively identified
appellant Mariano <span class="SpellE">Daga</span> as the thief and the killer of
<span class="SpellE">Potenciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Barbasa</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Daga</span> denied having
committed the crime charged and set up an alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would have us believe that he was in the
barrio of <span class="SpellE">Binangoran</span>, Municipality of Santa Fe, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, from March 4, 1960, at 7:00 a.m. to March 5, 1960,
at about 11:30 a.m.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this purpose he
introduced his own testimony and the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pedrero</span> and Vicente <span class="SpellE">Caidic</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court, however, found the evidence
for the defense unworthy of credence, and the record does not show that, in
reaching this conclusion, His Honor, the trial Judge – who had the opportunity,
denied to us, to observe the behavior of the witnesses during the trial – had
overlooked or misunderstood any fact or circumstance of weight or im­portance
in the determination of this c<span style="">ase.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the contrary, the aforementioned widow and children of <span class="SpellE">Potenciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Barbasa</span> testified, and
the defense has not denied it, that appellant was well known to them before the
occurrence, so that they could not have committed an honest mistake in pointing
to him as the person who entered the lighted bedroom in which they slept,
picked up two (2) watches from the top of an aluminum tank inside said room,
and got, from one of the pockets of a trouser of Oscar <span class="SpellE">Barbasa</span>,
hanging near said tank, a diary containing cash money, in the sum of
P3.40.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, said witnesses for the
prosecution had no possible reason to falsely incriminate appellant herein, and
hence, there can be no doubt about their veracity.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, appellant could have committed the crime charged in
Pawing, Palo, in the early <u>morning</u> of March 5, 1960, at about 2:00 a.m.,
as testified to by the prosecution witnesses, and then spent the <u>evening</u>
of the same day in <span class="SpellE">Binangoran</span>, Santa Fe, with his
witnesses Federico <span class="SpellE">Pedrero</span> and Vicente <span class="SpellE">Caidic</span>, inasmuch as the two (2) municipalities adjoin each
other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, the testimony of said
witnesses for the prosecution was bolstered up by that of Vicente <span class="SpellE">Dula</span>, municipal policeman of Pawing, Palo, who saw
appellant, in the evening of March 4, 1960, between 9:00 and 10:00 p.m.,
walking between the barrios of <span class="SpellE">Guindapunan</span> and
Pawing, about 1 or 2 kilometers from the latter:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further corroboration is supplied by the fact
that, after conducting an investigation of the occurrence, in the course of
which appellant was named as the culprit, <span class="SpellE">Dula</span> looked
for appellant and found him in the farmhouse of <span class="SpellE">Felino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Capaico</span>, <u>in Pawing</u>, in the evening of March 6,
1960; that appellant they had the knife, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B, in
his pocket; and that, upon inquiry by <span class="SpellE">Dula</span>, appellant
admitted that <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B was the instrument with which he
had stabbed <span class="SpellE">Potenciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Barbasa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is absolutely no evidence that <span class="SpellE">Dula</span> had any particular reason to risk a prosecution for
perjury in order to assure appellant's conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is here­by affirmed,
with costs against appellant Mariano <span class="SpellE">Daga</span>.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Reyes, J.B.L., <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>, J.P., <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span> Fernando, <span class="GramE">JJ.,</span><span style="font-style: normal;"> concur.</span></span><br>
