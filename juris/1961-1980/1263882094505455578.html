signed.</blockquote>

dismissed them on request of the petitioning <st1:place>Union</st1:place>, this
<st1:place>Union</st1:place> was also the one who asked for their reinstatement
when they withdrew their resignation from the union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of the other 40 members who
resigned (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 'A', ‘A-1’ to 'A-49') when they

<p class="BODY">It is not necessary to consider American jurisprudence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue of whether or not the so-called
"maintenance-of-membership" clause requires all employees who were
already members of the <span class="SpellE">Manco</span> Labor Union at the time
the said clause took effect to remain members of the union during the life of
the collective bargaining agreement as a condition of continued employment may
be <span style="">resolved under the consti­tution and
relevant </span>Philippine jurisprudence.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a fact that the complainants were employees of the Manila
Cordage Company and members of the <span class="SpellE">Manco</span> Labor Union
when the following stipulation was included in the collective bargaining
agreement:</p>

<blockquote>"IV MAINTENANCE OF MEMBERSHIP</blockquote>

<blockquote>Both parties agree that all employees of the COMPANY <span style="">who </span>are already members of the <st1:place>UNION</st1:place>
at the time of the signing of this AGREEMENT shall continue to remain members of
the <st1:place>UNION</st1:place> for the duration of this AGREEMENT" <span style="">(Exhibits '5-B' </span>and '6-B'-Company).<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The foregoing stipulation, however, does
not clearly state that maintenance of membership in the <span class="SpellE">Manco</span>
Labor <st1:place>Union</st1:place> is a condition of continuous employment <span style="">in </span>the Manila Labor Cordage Company.</p>

<p class="BODY">In consonance with the ruling in Confederated Sons of Labor vs. <span class="SpellE">Anakan</span> Lumber Co., et al., 107 Phil. 915, in order that the
Manila Cordage Company may be deemed bound to dismiss employees who do not
maintain their membership in the <span class="SpellE">Manco</span> Labor Union,
the stipulation to this effect must be so clear as <span style="">to </span>leave no room for doubt thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An undertaking of this nature is so harsh
that it must be strictly construed and doubts must be resolved against the
existence of the right to dismiss.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apparently aware of the deficiency of the
maintenance-of-membership clause, the petitioner urges that the same should be
construed together with the "Whereas" provision of the contract which
reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, the parties hereto have decided to enter into an
agreement relating to the terms and conditions of employment and reference to
those employees to whom the provisions of this AGREEMENT apply." (Exhibits
'5-A' and '?-A'-Company)<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Anent this point, the Court of Industrial Relations through Judge
<span class="SpellE">Amando</span> <span class="SpellE">Bugayong</span> ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"But whether read disjunctively or
conjunctively, these two provisions would not justify the interpretation which
respondent company would want to attribute to the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For said 'Whereas' proviso neither refers to
tenure or duration of employment which is the dispute in the case at bar but
only to terms and conditions of employment such as working hours, wages, other
benefits and privileges clearly specified therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We need not stretch our imagination too far
to know the difference between or duration of employment from terms and
conditions of employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, even
on the assumption that 'terms and conditions of employment' covers continuity
or period of employment, the ambiguity of the provision should not adversely
affect complainants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, even with
the conjunctive interpretation, these two provisions can not supplant the
omission of said maintenance of membership clause, let alone cure the defect of
the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is especially so if the
rule which states that in case of inconsistency a particular provision like the
disputed 'maintenance of membership' clause prevails over or controls a general
provision, such as the 'WHEREAS' proviso, invoked by respondents, is to be
applied to the interpretation of this doubtful provision (Rule 130(4), Section
10, New Rules of Court)."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To construe the stipulations above-quoted as imposing as a
condition to continued employment in the Manila Cordage Company the maintenance
of membership in the <span class="SpellE">Manco</span> Labor Union is to violate
the natural and constitutional right of the laborer to organize freely.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Such interpretation would be inconsistent with the constitutional mandate that
the State shall afford protection to labor.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Court of Industrial Relations correctly found that
the disputed "maintenance-of-membership" clause in question did not
give the Manila Cordage Company the right to dismiss the complainants just
because they resigned as members of the <span class="SpellE">Manco</span> Labor
Union.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is a showing that the dismissed complainants sought other
substantially equivalent and regular employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They failed to find any.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of the petitioners that they acted in good faith
in dismissing the complainants and, therefore, should not be held liable to pay
their back wages has no merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
dismissal of the complainants by the petitioners was precipitate and done with
undue haste.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that the
so-called "maintenance of membership" clause did not clearly give the
petitioners the right to dismiss the complainants if said complainants did not
maintain their membership in the <span class="SpellE">Manco</span> Labor Union,
the petitioners should have raised the issue before the Court of Industrial
Relations in a petition for permission to dismiss the complainants.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, considering the circumstances and equity of the case,
the petitioners should be held liable to pay the back wages of the complainants
for a period of two years only from the date they were respectively dismissed.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The reinstatement order of respondent Court of Industrial
Relations of complainants <span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> <span class="SpellE">Rabago</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Natalio</span> <span class="SpellE">Nisperos</span> and
Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Trajano</span> to their former positions and with
all the rights and privileges formerly appertaining thereto is correct (<u>supra</u>,
p. 2).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such reinstatement now is of
course subject to said complainants still being within the required physical
and age requirements, but any physical or medical examination to which they may
be subjected is to be given them as old <u>reinstated</u> workers, but <u>not</u>
as a precondition to their reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Our ruling in <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Free Workers Front vs.
CIR, 60 SCRA 408, 425, is fully applicable <u>mutatis mutandis</u> in the case
at bar, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The
filing and <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of an unfair labor practice case
as in the case at bar presuppose a continuing employer-employee relationship
and when the case is decided in favor of the workers, this relationship is in
law deemed to have continued uninterruptedly notwithstanding their unlawful dismissal
or the lawful strike and stoppage of work, and hence, seniority and other
privileges are preserved in their favor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To require them to undergo a physical or medical examination as a
precondition of reinstatement or return to work simply because of the long <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of their case which is due to no fault of theirs
would not only defeat the purpose of the law and the constitutional and
statutory mandates to protect labor but would work to their unfair prejudice as
aggrieved parties and give an undue advantage to employers as the offenders who
<span style="">have </span>the means and resources to
wage attrition and withstand the bane of protracted litigation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Hence, the aggrieved workers may be subjected to periodic
physical or medical examination as old reinstated workers, but not as a
precondition to their re­instatement or return to work with the important con­sequence
that if they are found to be ill or suffering from some disability, they would
be entitled to all the benefits that the laws and company practices provide by
way of compensation, medical care, disability benefits and gratuities, etc. to
employees and workers."</blockquote>
