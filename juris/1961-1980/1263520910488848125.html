				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Together with <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bulahan</span> - who is still at large - defendant Ignacio Mercado
is charged with the crime of murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is alleged in the information:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 26th day of May, 1965, in the Barrio of <span class="SpellE">Bulakin</span>, Municipality of Dolores, Province of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this
Hon. Court, the said accused, Ignacio Mercado together with <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bulahan</span> who is still at large, with intent to kill
and with evident premeditation and treachery, conspiring and confederating
together and mutually helping each other, did then and there willfully,
unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and stab with a blunt instrument one
<span class="SpellE">Escolastica</span> <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span>, thereby
inflicting upon the latter mortal stab wounds in the different parts of her
body which caused the instantaneous death of the said <span class="SpellE">Escolastica</span>
<span class="SpellE">Amparo</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That in the commission of the above described crime, the
following aggravating circumstances were present:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that the offense was committed at night
time;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that it was committed in an uninhabited
place;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>taking advantage of their superior strength
and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that the act was committed with insult or in
disregard of the respect due the offended party on account of her sex."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After due trial, under a plea of not guilty, the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> convicted Mercado of the crime
charged, and sentenced him to life imprisonment, with the accessory penal­ties
prescribed by law, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Es­colastica</span>
<span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> in the sum of P6,000, without subsidiary impri­sonment,
in view of the nature of the principal penalty, and to pay the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this appeal by Mercado.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that early in the morning of <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1965</st1:date>, the dead body of <span class="SpellE">Escolastica</span> <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span>, about 42
years of age, was found a few meters from the road, in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Bulakin</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>muni­cipality</st1:placetype>

the deceased, contained the following findings:</p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. <span class="SpellE">Montilla</span> testified that <span class="SpellE">Escolastica</span> <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> had died about
nine (9) hours before her autopsy, which took place on May 27, 1965, at about
8:00 a.m.; that the nature and position of her wounds indicated that she had
fought, in self-defense, her assail­ant or assailants; and that her death was
due to hemorrhage owing to multiple stab wounds.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main witness for the prosecution was Jose <span class="SpellE">Pamarez</span>,
a 43-year old herb healer or "<span class="SpellE">herbolario</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified that in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1965" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1965</st1:date>, his nephew, <span class="SpellE">Porfirio</span> Rodriguez, went to his house, at San Vicente, <st1:place><st1:placename>San
  Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, and
asked him to treat his child who was sick.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rodriguez and <span class="SpellE">Pamarez</span> left San Vicente, at
about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 p.m.</st1:time>, and arrived at the
house of Rodriguez, in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Bulakin</span>,
Dolores, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, around <st1:time minute="0" hour="20">8:00
 p.m.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp; </span>After examining the
sick child, <span class="SpellE">Pamarez</span> went out of the house and
gathered some herbs in a coconut plantation nearby and then applied the herbs
to the child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, Rodriguez and <span class="SpellE">Pamarez</span> chatted until <st1:time minute="0" hour="23">11:00
 p.m.</st1:time>, when he (<span class="SpellE">Pamarez</span>) left the house
and headed for that of his brother-in-law, to spend the night therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Along the way, he heard somebody calling for
help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Focusing his flashlight at the
place from which the call had come, he saw <span class="SpellE">Escolastica</span>
<span class="SpellE">Amparo</span>, about three (3) fathoms away, embraced by
appellant Ignacio Mercado and one <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bulahan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having
noticed that Mercado had a sharp-bladed weapon in his right hand and held with
his left hand the right hand of <span class="SpellE">Escolastica</span> <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span>, whose breast was bleeding, he yelled at them,
"<span class="SpellE">Bitiwan</span> <span class="SpellE">ninyo</span> <span class="SpellE">yan</span>".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, <span class="SpellE">Bulahan</span> bade appellant to go after
the man with the flashlight, referring evidently to <span class="SpellE">Pamarez</span>,
who, accordingly, ran away, for fear of being stabbed by appel­lant, and
proceeded to his brother-in-law's house, where he slept.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As he left <span class="SpellE">Bulakin</span>
the next morning to return to <st1:place><st1:placename>San Pablo</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, he learned that <span class="SpellE">Escolastica</span> <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> had been found
dead.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only evidence for the defense consisted of the testimony of
Mercado, who denied having committed the acts charged and asserted that he was
in his house in <span class="SpellE">Bulakin</span>, Dolores, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>,
together with his parents and children, during the whole evening of <st1:date year="1965" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court did not believe this testimony, and, rely­ing
upon that of <span class="SpellE">Pamarez</span>, rendered the aforementioned
judgment of conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this
appeal in which appellant maintains that the lower court erred in giving
credence to the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Pamarez</span>, despite the
contradictions allegedly found therein and the fact that he did not report to
the authorities, until a little over a month after the occurrence, what he had
allegedly witnessed in the evening of May 26, 1965.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant maintains that, on <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1965</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Pamarez</span> told the
Chief of Police of Dolores that he (<span class="SpellE">Pamarez</span>)
"was in Dolores, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, in the house of <span class="SpellE">Porfirio</span> Rodriguez <u>in</u> <u>order</u> to pay the
said.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Porfirio</span>
Rodriguez a call '<span class="SpellE">Nagugumusta</span>' which translated in
English (is) 'asking how they are'," whereas on the witness stand, <span class="SpellE">Pamarez</span> claimed to have been "fetched by <span class="SpellE">Porfirio</span> Rodriguez x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> for the purpose of curing the child of the latter as he
is an <span class="SpellE">herbolario</span>." The first statement imputed
by appellant to <span class="SpellE">Pamarez</span> is inaccurate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pamarez</span> did <u>not</u>
say that he had gone to the house of <span class="SpellE">Porfirio</span> Rodri­guez
"in order" to inquire how he was.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Chief of Police having asked him where he was in the evening of May
26, 1965, <span class="SpellE">Pamarez</span> answered that he was in the house
of Rodriguez "<span class="SpellE">nangungumusta</span>", which means
that they engaged in conversation on how they were getting along.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, in fact, is what he stated, on the
witness stand, he did <u>after</u> applying some medicinal herbs to the sick child
of Rodriguez, who had fetched him earlier from his house at <st1:place><st1:placename>San
  Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, in
order that he may treat said child.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant further alleges that, in his direct examination, <span class="SpellE">Pamarez</span> claimed to have heard the call for help, "<span class="SpellE">Saklolohan</span> mo <span class="SpellE">ako</span>," whereas,
on cross-examination, the words used were, "<span class="SpellE">Ako'y</span>
<span class="SpellE">saklolohan</span> <span class="SpellE">ninyo</span>," and
prior thereto, or on July 2, 1965, when the Chief of Police investigated him,
the words he (<span class="SpellE">Pamarez</span>) quoted were, "<span class="SpellE">Ako</span> ay <span class="SpellE">sakluluhan</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not find any contradiction in the foregoing,
since the three expressions have the same conno­tation - "Help!"
Moreover, the phrase "<span class="SpellE">Saklolohan</span> mo <span class="SpellE">ako</span>" was used, <u>not</u> by <span class="SpellE">Pamarez</span>,
but <u>by the prosecutor</u>, in the course of his direct examination of <span class="SpellE">Pamarez</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then,
again, minor variations, and even discrepancies, in the testimony of witnesses
- particularly unenlightened and simple country folks like <span class="SpellE">Pamarez</span>,
a mere herb healer - are often indicative of their good faith and veracity.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is true it took <span class="SpellE">Pamarez</span> a little
over a month to reveal to the authorities in Dolores, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>,
what he saw in the evening of the occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We should, however, bear in mind that he is a resident of San Pablo,
Laguna; that he knew how ruthless appel­lant and <span class="SpellE">Bulahan</span>
could be; that, in the evening of May 26, 1965, he heard <span class="SpellE">Bulahan</span>
tell appellant to go after him; that <span class="SpellE">Bulahan</span> and
appellant had not been apprehended as yet; and that up to now <span class="SpellE">Bulahan</span> is still at large.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Being understandably fearful that the culprits may turn their ire at
him, it is not strange that <span class="SpellE">Pamarez</span> was somewhat
apprehensive about reporting to the authorities, until his friend, Andres <span class="SpellE">Eranzo</span> - to whom he had confided his predicament - advised
him, sometime later, that he could do so.</p>

<p class="BODY">What really is of vital importance in this case, is the admitted
fact that <span class="SpellE">Pamarez</span> had, for many years, known <span class="SpellE">Escolas­tica</span> <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bulahan</span> and appellant
herein, so that <span class="SpellE">Pama­rez</span> could not possibly be
mistaken as to the persons he had seen in <span class="SpellE">Bulakin</span>,
Dolores, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, in the evening of May 26, 1965, and
that he had no motive whatsoever to falsely incriminate appellant and <span class="SpellE">Bulahan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
language of U.S. v. <span class="SpellE">Pajarillo</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
which was reiterated in People v. De Otero,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
"the absence of all evidence as to an improper motive actuating the
principal witnesses for the prosecution strongly tends to sustain the
conclusion that no such improper motive existed, and that their testimony is
worthy of full faith and credit."</p>

<p class="BODY">Needless to say, the alibi set up by appellant, based upon his
uncorroborated testimony, cannot prevail over the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Pamarez</span> who was positive as regards appellant's presence at
the scene of the occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
contrary, since his house, where he allegedly spent the evening of <st1:date year="1965" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1965</st1:date>, is barely 200 meters
away from said place, it would have been a simple matter for him to return to
his house immediately after the assassination of <span class="SpellE">Escolastica</span>
<span class="SpellE">Amparo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant would have Us believe that late in June, 1965,
Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> Loreto, a member of the local
police force, interrogated him concerning the whereabouts of <span class="SpellE">Bulahan</span>, and later warned him that he would be implicated
should he persist in refusing to reveal where <span class="SpellE">Bulahan</span>
was, because the prosecution already had several witnesses, one of them Jose <span class="SpellE">Pamarez</span>, and that the latter had "possibly" been
paid to testify as he did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was,
however, not merely a speculation on the part of appellant, but, also, an im­plied
admission that he could not <span class="SpellE">justifiedly</span> attribute the
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Pamarez</span> to any improper motive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, appellant acknowledged the fact that
there was no ill-feeling between him and <span class="SpellE">Pamarez</span>, and
that he (appellant) did <u>not</u> know whether he (<span class="SpellE">Pamarez</span>)
had been paid or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did he
even try to explain why anybody should be interested in falsely accusing him of
a crime as grave as that charged in this case, to the point of paying a witness
<span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the circumstances, We find no plausible reason to disturb
the findings of fact of His Honor, the trial Judge, who had an opportunity,
denied to Us, to observe the behavior of the wit­nesses in the course of their
testimony and was, accordingly, in a better position to gauge their veracity.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree, therefore, with the lower court that the guilt of
herein appellant, Ignacio Mercado, has been established beyond reasonable
doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Owing to the abuse of superior
strength with which the assailants of <span class="SpellE">Escolastica</span> <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> had acted, the crime committed is that of
murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The disregard of the respect due
to her on account of her sex may be considered absorbed by the abuse of
superior strength.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the crime
was committed at night­time, the record does not sufficiently show that her
assailants had sought it purposely or taken advantage of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, there being no modifying circumstance to
affect the corresponding criminal res­ponsibility, the penalty prescribed by
law for said offense was properly imposed by the trial court in its medium
period.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, except as to the indemnity, which should be
increased from P6,000 to P12,000,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[1]</span></span></a> the decision appealed from should
