<p>At this juncture, respondent Judge dictated in open court the following 
order:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"From the testimony of the complaining witness—coming from her mouth—the 
Court gathers that she agreed to lend the amount of P7,800.00 to the accused, 
Caridad Cabarroguis, under the agreement that the said P7,800.00 would be 
returned in the form of goods.</p>
<p>"This is sufficient to, convince, the court that the crime of estafa, as 
described in the Penal Code, does not obtain in this case.</p>
<p>"WHEREFORE, let this case be, as it is hereby dismissed, against the accused, 
Caridad Cabarroguis, and the bail bond she filed for her, provisional release is 
hereby cancelled."</p></blockquote>
<p>Forthwith, the prosecution sought a reconsideration of the action thus taken 
by respondent Judge, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>* * * And may I show the court this document where it can be shown that the 
herein accused did not have the goods allegedly in the pier when, she took the 
amount in question from the complainant, which shows that there was intention to 
defraud the complainant in this case."</p></blockquote>
<p>Thereupon, respondents set aside or "withdrew" her aforementioned; order of 
dismissal and allowed the prosecution to continue the direct examination of said 
complainant, after which the latter was cross-examined by counsel of petitioner 
herein. When the prosecution closed its evidence, petitioner's counsel asked for 
another day to present her evidence, which was granted by respondent When the 
hearing was resumed on March 7, 1962, petitioner moved to set aside the order of 
respondent withdrawing her aforementioned order, of dismissal, alleging; that 
otherwise petitioner would be again "in danger of being placed in jeopardy." 
This motion was immediately denied, whereupon the present case was instituted, 
upon the theory, based on Catilo vs. Abaya, 94 Phil., 1014; 60 Off. Gaz. 2477), 
and Esguerra vs. De la Costa (66 Phil., 134) that said verbal order of dismissal 
of February 28, 1962, without the consent of the accused (petitioner herein), 
amounted to her acquittal, and that the withdrawal of said order, followed by 
the continuation of the examination of the complainant and the presentation of 
the other evidence for the prosecution, placed the petitioner in double, 
jeopardy. Hence, petitioner prayed that said order withdrawing the verbal order 
of dismissal be set aside and that respondent be commanded to desist from 
further proceeding with the trial of said Criminal Case No. 5355-P.</p>
<p>Petitioner's pretense is untenable. The verbal order of dismissal of said 
case was withdrawn or set aside, as soon as it was dictated by respondent and 
before it could be reduced to writing and signed by her. As a matter of fact, it 
was never put in writing. Much less was it ever signed by respondent. For this 
reason, respondent contends that said order of dismissal was incomplete and did 
not have the effect of acquitting the accused before it was withdrawn. Indeed, 
pursuant to section 2 o£ Rule 116 of the Rules of Court "the judgment"—and the 
order of dismissal in question had, if completed, such effect—"must be 
<i>written</i> * * * personally and directly prepared by the judge, and 
<i>signed</i> by him * * *." The cases cited by herein petitioner involved 
<i>written</i> orders of dismissal, which were signed by the corresponding 
judges. Hence, said cases are not controlling in the one at bar.</p>
<p>Moreover, petitioner did not forthwith object, either to the motion of the 
prosecution for the reconsideration of the verbal order of dismissal, or to the 
order of respondent Judge withdrawing or setting aside the same. Neither did 
petitioner object to the continuation of complainant's examination by the 
prosecution. What is more, upon the conclusion thereof, petitioner's counsel 
cross-examined the complainant. As alleged in the very petition filed herein, 
said continuation of the presentation of the evidence for the prosecution had 
already placed the petitioner twice in jeopardy of punishment for the same 
offense, on the assumption that the order of dismissal in question had 
effectively dismissed the criminal case. Petitioner's failure to object, at that 
time, to the taking of said evidence for the prosecution, and the 
cross-examination of complainant by counsel for the petitioner amounted, 
therefore, to a waiver of her constitutional right against double jeopardy 
(People vs. Casiano, L-15309 [February 16, 1961]; 14 Am. Jur., 958). Petitioner 
did not invoke such right until about a week later, or on March 7, 1962, when 
the hearing was resumed for the reception of the evidence for the defense. The 
objection then made by her came too late, in view of her aforementioned 
waiver.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the petition herein is hereby dismissed, with costs against the 
petitioner. It is so ordered.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L.,
