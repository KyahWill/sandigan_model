in the said case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The above-named petitioners were complainants in Case No.
72-ULP-Iloilo, entitled, "PAFLU, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Binalbagan-Isabela</span>
Sugar Co., <span style="">et </span>al." After
trial, the Court of Industrial Relations rendered a decision, on <st1:date year="1961" day="29" month="3">29 March 1961</st1:date>, ordering the
reinstatement <span style="">with <span class="SpellE">back<span style="">wages</span></span></span> of complainants
Enrique <span class="SpellE">Entila</span> and <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tenazas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
decision became final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="10">18 October 1963</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
Cid <span style="">&amp; Asso</span>ciates, counsel of
record for <span style="">the winning complainants,
filed a </span><span style="">notice of attorney's
lien equivalent to 30% of the total <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="11"><span style="">22 November 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> also filed a similar notice for a reasonable

and <span class="SpellE">Tenazas</span>, </span>on <st1:date year="1963" day="3" month="12">3 December 1963</st1:date>, filed a manifestation indicating their
non-objection to an award of attorney's fees for 25% of their <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, and, on the same day, <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Muning</span> filed a "Petition for Award of Services
Rendered" equivalent to 20% of the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Muning's</span> petition
was opposed by <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> Cid &amp; Associates on the
ground that he is not a lawyer.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records of Case No. 72-ULP-<st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>
show that the charge was filed by <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> Cid &amp;
Associates through Atty. <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the hearings were held in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and appearances made in behalf of the complainants were at first by Attorney <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> and subsequently by respondent <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Muning</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="5">12 May 1964</st1:date>,
the Court of Industrial Relations awarded 25% of the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
as compensation for professional services rendered in the case, apportioned as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>Attys. <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
Cid &amp; Associates----10%</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> <span class="SpellE">Muning</span><span style="">-------------------------- </span>10%</blockquote>

<blockquote>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pacis</span><span style="">------------------- </span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>5%</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The award of 10% to <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> <span class="SpellE">Muning</span>, who is not a lawyer according to the order, is
sought to be voided in the present petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Muning</span> moved in this Court
to dismiss the present peti­tion on the ground of late filing but his motion
was overruled on <st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="1">20 Jan­uary 1965</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
He asked for reconsideration, but, considering that the motion contained
averments that go into the merits of the case, this Court admitted and
considered the motion for reconsideration for all purposes as respondent's
answer to the petition for review.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The case was considered submitted for decision without respondent's brief.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Applicable to the issue at hand is the principle enunciated in
Amalgamated Laborers' Association, et al. vs. Court of Industrial Relations, et
al., L-23467, 27 March 1968,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
that an agreement providing for the division of attorney's fees, whereby a
non-lawyer union president is allowed to share in said fees with lawyers, is
condemned by Canon 34 of Legal Ethics and is immoral and cannot be
justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An award by a court of
attorney's fees is no less immoral in the absence of a contract, as in the
present case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The provision in Section 5 (b) of Republic Act No. 875 that --</p>

<blockquote>"In the proceeding before the Court or
Hearing Examiner thereof, the parties shall not be required to be represented
by legal counsel. . . . . . . .”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">is no justification for a ruling that the
person representing the party-litigant in the Court of Industrial Relations,
even if he is not a lawyer, is entitled to attorney's fees:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>for the same section adds that ?</p>

<blockquote>"it shall be the duty and obligation
of the Court or Hearing Officer to examine and cross examine witnesses on
behalf of the parties and to assist in the orderly presentation of evidence
",</blockquote>

<p class="MsoNormal">thus making it clear that the representation should be
exclusively entrusted to duly qualified members of the bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">The permission for a non-member of the bar to represent or appear
or defend in the said court on behalf of a party-litigant does not by itself
entitle the representative to compensation for such representa­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For Section 24, Rule 138, of the Rules of
Court, providing --</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 24.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Compensation
of attorneys; agree­ment as to fees.</u><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- An attorney shall be entitled to have and recover from his client no
more than a reasonable compensation for his services, . . . . . .”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">imports the existence of an
attorney-client relationship as a condition to the recovery of attorney's
fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a relationship cannot exist
unless the client's representative in court be a lawyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since res­pondent <span class="SpellE">Muning</span>
is not one, he cannot establish an attorney-client relationship with Enrique <span class="SpellE">Entila</span> and <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> <span class="SpellE">Tenazas</span> or with PAFLU, and he cannot, therefore, recover
attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly public policy
demands that legal work in representation of parties litigant should be
entrusted only to those possessing tested qualifications and who are sworn to
observe the rules and the ethics of the profes­sion, as well as being subject
to judicial disciplinary control for the protection of courts, clients and the
public.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the present issue, the rule in American jurisdictions is per­suasive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, it is stated:</p>

<blockquote>"But in practically all jurisdictions statutes have now been
enacted prohibiting persons not licensed or admitted to the bar from <span class="SpellE">practising</span> law, and under statutes of this kind, the great
weight of authority is to the effect that compensation for strictly legal
services cannot be recovered by one <span style="">who
has not been admitted to practice before the court or in the jurisdiction where
the services were rendered."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"No one is entitled to recover compensation for services as an
attorney at law unless he has been duly admitted to practice. . . . .and is an
attorney in good standing at the time."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The reasons are that the ethics of the legal profession should
not be violated<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>;
that acting as an attorney without authority cons­titutes contempt of court,
which is punishable by fine or imprisonment or both<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>,
and the law will not assist a person to reap the fruits or benefit of an
unlawful act or an act done in violation of law<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>;
and that if fees were to be allowed to non-lawyers, it would leave the public
in hopeless confusion as to whom to consult in case of neces­sity and also
leave the <span style="">bar in </span>a chaotic
condition, aside from the fact that non-lawyers are not amenable to
disciplinary measures.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"And the general rule above-stated (referring to non-recovery
of attorney's fees by non-lawyers) cannot be circumvented when the services
were purely legal, by seeking to recover as an 'agent' and not as an
attorney."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The weight of the reasons heretofore stated why a non-lawyer may
not be awarded attorney's fees should suffice to refute the possible argument
that appearances by non-lawyers before the Court of Industrial Relations should
be excepted on the ground that said court is a court of special jurisdiction;
such special jurisdiction does not outweigh the aforesaid reasons and cannot <span style="">justify an exception.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The other issue in this case is whether or not a union may appeal
an award of attorney's fees which are deductible from the <span class="SpellE">backpay</span>
of some of its members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This issue arose
because it <span style="">was the union PAFLU, </span>alone,
that moved for an extension of time to file the present petition for review;
union members <span class="SpellE">Entila</span> and <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Tenazas</span></span><span style=""> </span>did not <span style="">ask for extension
</span>but they were included <span style="">as </span>petitioners in the present petition that
was subsequently filed, it being contended that, as to them (<span class="SpellE">Entila</span> <span style="">and <span class="SpellE">Tenazas</span>), </span>their inclusion in the petition as
co-petitioners was belated.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We hold that </span>a <span style="">union or legitimate labor organization may </span>appeal
an award of attorney's fees which are deductible from the <span class="SpellE">backpay</span>
of its members because such union or labor organization is permitted to
institute an action in the industrial court<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>,
on behalf of its members; and the union was organized "for the promotion
of the employees' moral, social and economic well-being"<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>;
hence, if an award is disadvantageous to its members, the union may prosecute
an appeal as an aggrieved party, under Section 6, Republic Act 875, which
provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="">Unfair Labor Practice </span>Cases - Appeals</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Any person aggrieved by any order of the
Court may appeal to the Supreme Court of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
. . . . . .”, </blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">since more often than not the individual
unionist is not in a position to bear the financial burden of litigations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners allege that respondent <span class="SpellE">Muning</span>
is engaged in the habitual practice of law before the Court of Industrial
Relations, and many others like him who are not licensed to practice,
registering their appearances as "re­presentatives" and appearing
daily before the said court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If true,
this is a serious situation demanding corrective action that respondent court
should actively pursue and enforce by positive action to that purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But since this matter was not brought in
issue before the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, it may not be taken up in the
present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners, however, may
file proper action against the persons alleged to be illegally engaged in the
practice of law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the orders under review are hereby set aside
insofar as they awarded 10% of the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> as
attorney's fees for respondent <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> <span class="SpellE">Muning</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said orders
are affirmed in all other respects.<span style="">&nbsp;
