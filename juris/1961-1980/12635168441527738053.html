				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitions for review of the resolutions of the Court of Appeals,
dismissing the <span class="SpellE">undocketed</span> cases <span style="">Nos. </span>1174 and 1204, CFI, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, <span class="GramE">entitled</span> "<span class="SpellE">Florentina</span> <span class="SpellE">Respicio</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Palteng</span>, et al.",
for failure of therein defendants to pay the docket fees, and denying said
defendants' motion for reconsideration of the appellate court's dismissal
order.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be gathered from the pleadings herein submitted that
petitioners, <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Palteng</span>,
et al., were the defendants in two separate <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
cases originally filed in the Justice of the Peace Court of<span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Gamu</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, by <span class="SpellE">Floren­tina</span> <span class="SpellE">Respicio</span> and Rosa <span class="SpellE">Mallabo</span>.
Receiving an unfavorable verdict, defendants (through attorney <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> <span class="SpellE">Capuchino</span>) appealed to
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span> where the two
cases, docketed as Civil Cases Nos. 1174 and 1204, were jointly tried <u>de</u>
<u>novo</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 31 May 1962, judgment was rendered on the two cases, ordering
the defendants once more (1) to vacate the lands subject of the actions; (2)
defend­ant <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Palteng</span>
to pay damages to the plaintiffs for the produce of the land that the latter
failed to receive since 1957; and (3) all of them to pay attorneys' fees.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Defendants in due time
notified the trial court of their intention to appeal the decision to the Court
of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="25" month="8"><span style="">25
 August 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
notice of appeal, appeal bond and record on appeal, submitted for the de­fendants
by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Teodulo</span> E. <span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span>,
were approved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the records
of the cases were transmitted to the appellate court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="7">20 July 1965</st1:date>,
however, the Court of Appeals ordered the dismissal <span style="">of the two cases for failure of defendants to pay the necessary
docketing fees, notwithstanding the Court's requirement <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When sometime later the dismissal order came
to the knowledge of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span>, who allegedly was
not notified thereof, the latter made inquiries, and it was found out that the
Court of Appeals' notice to pay the fees had been sent to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> T. <span class="SpellE">Capuchino</span>, who was
defendants' counsel of record in the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, <span class="GramE">defendants moved
for reconsideration of the resolution of dismissal of the Court of Appeals,
and, upon its denial, the present petition was</span> filed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In claiming that the dismissal of their appeal constituted a
grave abuse of discretion by the Court of Appeals, petitioners contend that the
service of notice to pay the docket fees on Atty. <span class="SpellE">Capuchino</span>
(who must have failed to inform the defendants of the requirement) was
ineffective and not binding on them, because such notice should have been
served upon Atty. <span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span>, who signed and submitted
the notice of appeal, appeal bond and record on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, it is the contention of
petitioners that, for purposes of the appeal, it is Atty. <span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span>
who should have been considered the counsel of record and upon whom notices and
processes should have been served.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no merit to this argument. For it is not denied that
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Capuchino</span> was petitioners' counsel of record in
the trial court; and that while it is true that it was Atty. <span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span> who filed the notice of appeal, appeal bond and the
record on appeal, it is equally a fact that there had been no formal relief of
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Capu­chino</span> as counsel for the defendants
(petitioners) and no formal substitution by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The situation is that, on record, defendants-appellants
stood re­presented by two lawyers who, in view of the absence of notification
to the con­trary, are considered their attorneys in the appeal (Section 2,
Revised Rule 46).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that,
where a party is represented by two attorneys, service of notice or pleading on
either of them is sufficient to bind such party,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>there was no abuse of discretion in
the Court of Appeals' ruling that there had been proper and adequate notice to
defendants (petitioners) to pay the docket fees, a requirement that they failed
to observe. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>And as failure to pay the
docket fee is a ground for dismissal of an appeal,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>the Court of Appeals clearly acted
correctly in issuing the resolutions in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">If Atty. <span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span> had been engaged to
replace Atty. <span class="SpellE">Capuchino</span>, the provisions of Section 2,
Rule 46, and of Section 26, Rule 138, should have been complied with:</p>
