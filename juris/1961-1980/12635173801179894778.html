				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case is before us on review by <i style="">certiorari</i> of the decision of the Court <span style="">of </span>Industrial Relations dated <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1963</st1:date>, and of its resolution of <st1:date year="1963" day="19" month="7">July 19, 1963</st1:date>, in Case No. 303-ULP-Cebu, Victory
Labor <span style="">Union </span>(VICLU) et <span style="">al., </span>vs. Jose M. Gonzales.</p>

<p class="BODY">Herein petitioner Gonzales was engaged in trawl fishing, and
among his employees were Julian Beltran, <span class="SpellE">Severo</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Apawan</span></span><span style="">, </span><span class="SpellE">Ponciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Sayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quirico</span> Mendez and <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Baes</span> - all of them
working to petitioner's fishing boat, the M/L <span class="SpellE">Emiliana</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="3">March
 31, 1962</st1:date> the Acting Prosecutor of the Court of Industrial Relations
filed a complaint against petitioner, charging him with unfair labor practice <span style="">in dismissing said employees </span>without
just cause but by reason of their membership in VICLU and thereby interfering
and coercing <span style="">them in </span>the
exercise of their <span style="">right to self-organization.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Gonzales
admitted in his answer that the complainants, except <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Baes</span>, were his employees, but denied that be
dismissed them for their union affiliation, and alleged that their <span class="SpellE">dismisal</span> was for cause, they having been found </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">have connived with
each other in pilfering the catch of the fishing boat and selling the same to
the public for their personal benefit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner further denied that he had knowledge, prior to the filing of
the complaint, of the complainants’ membership in the labor union.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After
trial, the court below, in a decision penned by Presiding Judge Jose S.
Bautista, held herein peti­tioner guilty of unfair labor practice, ordered him
to cease and desist from the acts complained of and directed the reinstatement
of the complainants with back wages from </span><st1:date year="1962" day="7" month="2"><span style="">Feb­ruary
 7, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, which was the date of their dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pe­titioner filed <span style="">a </span>motion
for reconsideration before the Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>, but the motion was
denied in a minute resolution signed by Presiding Judge Bautista and concurred
in by As­sociate Judges <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> I. Martinez and <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> M. Villanueva.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>An extended dissent, however, was filed, by Associate Judge <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> </span><span style="">C. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Tabigne</span></span><span style="">, with the concurrence of Associate Judge <span class="SpellE">Amando</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Bugayong</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In
this case we are again faced with the application of the substantial evidence
rule,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> under which the
findings of fact of the Court of Industrial Relations are not disturbed on
appeal as long as they are supported by "such relevant evidence as <span style="">a </span>reasonable mind might accept as </span><span style="">adequate </span><span style="">to support <span style="">a </span>conclusion."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is one circumstance
which, at the very outset, has detained us from accepting the findings of fact
in the decision appealed from as conclusive, namely, that the said decision was
rendered by an almost evenly divided court and that the division was precisely
on the facts as borne out by the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In such a situation this Court feels </span><span style="">called </span><span style="">upon to go over </span><span style="">t</span><span style="">he record and, in order to determine the
substantiality of the evidence, consider it not only in its quantitative but
also in its qualitative aspects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For to
be substantial, evidence must first at all be credible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The question then is
whether or not the conclusion of the bare majority of the Court below, that the
complainants there, now respondents, were dismissed by petitioner for their
union affiliation, meets the test thus established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only evidence on this point </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">the testimony of
respondents Julian Beltran, <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> <span class="SpellE">Apawan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Quirico</span> Mendez, as
well as the testimony of the union president, Attorney Loreto G. Campos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first three more or less uniformly
declared that they be­came members of VICLU on </span><st1:date year="1951" day="15" month="11"><span style="">November 15, 1951</span></st1:date><span style=""> by signing the corresponding membership slip
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A); that they had not violated any rule or
committed any irregularity in the performance of their duties; and that on
February 7, 1962 they were called by the management and told that they were
being dismissed by reason of their union membership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon its face and considered in isolation,
such evidence could conceivably meet the test of substantiality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But there </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">other evidence which cannot be lightly
dismissed without arbitrarily closing the door to a judicious discharge of the
power of review, within the limits set down by the rule.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First of all, there is
the membership slip signed by complainants Julian Beltran, <span class="SpellE">Severino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Apawan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ponciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Sayan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Quirico</span> Mendez when
they allegedly affiliated to the Victory Labor Union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The slip is like<span style="">wise signed by the union president, Attorney Loreto G. Campos, and
bears the handwritten date in ink, "</span><st1:date year="1951" day="15" month="11"><span style="">Nov. 15, 1951</span></st1:date><span style="">." Attorney </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Campos</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> categorically affirmed on the witness stand
the correctness of the date thus written, </span>and said that the actual <span style="">signing was done in the morning of that
day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet the log book of the </span>M/L <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Emiliana</span></span><span style=""> shows that the whole day of </span><st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="11"><span style="">November
 15, 1961</span></st1:date><span style=""> the boat
was out fishing in the </span>sea <span style="">off </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bohol</span></span></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Between </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">entries in a log
book, which </span>is <span style="">required by law
to be kept by every master or captain of a <span class="SpellE">registrable</span>
</span><span style="">vessel,
</span><span style="">and a membership slip such as that
signed by respondents, the first is undoubtedly more reliable.</span></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint for unfair
labor practice named <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Baes</span>
as one of the five complainants, all members of VICLU.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to Attorney Campos, when examined
at the trial, <span class="SpellE">Baes</span> was not <span style="">a </span>member of the union at all, had not signed any membership
paper, and was included in the complaint only through inadvertence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">His </span>inclusion
certainly does not speak well of Attorney Campos' credibility <span style="">as </span>witness, particularly in the light
of his other testimony that before he prepared the complaint, as president and
lawyer of the union, he investigated the complainants one by one, and that
there was <span style="">a </span>preliminary hearing
of the case by the prosecutor of the Court.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner was never
officially notified that respondents were members of the Victory Labor
Union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No demand for check-off
deductions from their wages was ever served upon him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, respondents themselves said that
from <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1961</st1:date>, up
to the time of their dismissal from employment on <st1:date year="1962" day="7" month="2">February 7, 1962</st1:date>, they did not pay any monthly union
dues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And although all the crew members
of the M/L <span class="SpellE">Emiliana</span> were supposedly affiliated to
VICLU, no attempt whatsoever was made by the latter to secure a collective
bargaining agreement or at least a certification election.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A significant fact is
that it was not only respondents who were dismissed by petitioner but also the
captain of the vessel himself, Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Baroc</span>, who was
not a member of the union and whose dismissal <span style="">was </span>for complicity in the pilferage of the catch of the M/L <span class="SpellE">Emiliana</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
foregoing circumstances, objective as they are, lend strong support to the
testimony of petitioner Gonzales and of his witness Felipe <span class="SpellE">Jubay</span>,
to the effect that they had received evidence, consisting of reports from
different sources, that whenever the boat arrived at <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
after a fish­</span><span style="">ing trip
respondents would sell fish at very cheap prices; </span><span style="">that Gonzales
investigated them one by one and was convinced </span><span style="">of their guilt; that he was not yet through with the in­vestigation, but
they failed to return after February 7, 1962; and that he did not know they
were members of any labor union.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Besides the foregoing
evidence for herein petitioner the two dissenting members of the court below
also con­sidered certain significant contradictions in the testimony of
respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We quote from their
opinion:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Regarding their dismissal, we find that there was sufficient
justification for the action taken by the employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that these employees were found to
have sabotaged the interest of their employer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They pilfered the fish caught by them and sold them to private parties
and pocketed the proceeds thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
circumstance is a clear indication of sabotage and pilferage pure and
simple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the dismissal of this
instant case should, therefore, be in order.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is claimed that there <span style="">were </span>acts of discrimination on the part of
the em<span style="">ployer when these employees were
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold the contrary
view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let us take for instance the
so-called interview of the four employees by the employer on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="7" month="2"><span style="">February
 7, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One witness (<span class="SpellE">Boltron</span>)
testified <span style="">that the four of them were
called together to the office of the management and told </span></span><span style="">them </span><span style="">that they were dismissed because management did not like their membership
to their union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other witness
testified that such incident happened aboard the boat M/L <span class="SpellE">Emiliana</span>
(Witness M</span><span style="">e</span><span style="">ndez).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In another instance, Witness <span class="SpellE">Apawan</span> said that he was called alone to the office </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">respondent employer and nobody was with them at the time he was told of
his dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These contradictory statements
clearly indicate that the employer has no knowledge of their membership at the
time except when the complaint was filed and notified by the filing of the same
and their dismissal was not, therefore, motivated by any discriminatory act on
the part of the employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated
above, we find that there was justification of their dismissal because of the
pilferage committed by them in disposing a portion of the catch to private
parties to the loss of their employer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When an employee has committed an act inimical to the employer's
interest, his dismissal is just cause and may be permitted by this Court."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We conclude</span>, in
view of all the considerations above set forth, that the bare testimony of
respondents, complainants below, is insufficient to establish the charge of
unfair labor practice under the standard fixed by law and enunciated in the
decisions of this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The judgment appealed
from is set aside, and the complaint is dismissed, with costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
