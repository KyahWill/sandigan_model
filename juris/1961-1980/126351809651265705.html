<p class="BODY">It appears that in Civil Case No. 5203 of the Court of First
Instance of Manila entitled "Wenceslao Pascual vs. Pilar Bautista,
Primitivo Lovina, Nelly Montilla de Lovina and Leon Yambao", the first
(appellee herein) filed, <span style="">with leave of
court, a third-party complaint against Mariano R. Flores (appellant
herein).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having failed to answer the
third-party complaint, Flores was declared in default (Rec. on appeal pp.
19-20, 40-41) and, after due trial of the whole </span><span style="">case, </span><span style="">the court, on March 7, 1951, rendered judgment as </span><span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the
plaintiff and against the de­fendant Pilar Bautista, ordering the latter to
return to the plaintiff the sum of P2,000.00 representing part of the rent
advanced by him for the second year of the lease; to pay to the plaintiff the
sum of P13,181.86 representing one-half of the <span style="">cost of the improvements and repairs </span>made
by the plaintiff on the fishpond; and against Pilar Bautista and the spouses
Primitivo Lovina and Nelly Montilla de Lovina, ordering them to pay jointly and
severally to the plaintiff the sum of Twenty thousand two hundred fifty pesos
(P20,250.00) representing the value of the fish at the time the plain­tiff was
dispossessed of the fishpond, and the costs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Likewise judgment is hereby rendered <span style="">in favor of the defendant Pilar Bautista as third-party plaintiff and
against Mariano R. </span><span style="">Flores, as </span><span style="">third-party
defendant, for the sums of Five hundred </span><span style="">thousand pesos (P500,000.00) </span>as
liquidated damages and Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) for attorney's fees in
accordance with her contract with him embodied in the afore­said 'Memorandum of
Agreements,' with costs a­gainst said Mariano R. Flores.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff's claim for exemplary damages and
attorney's fees, Pilar Bautista's counterclaim and cross-claim, and the spouses
Lovina's counter cross-claim are hereby dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant Leon S. <span style="">Yambao is </span>absolved from all <span style="">liability under the </span>complaint and
cross-claim."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">All the parties above-mentioned, <u>except the third-party
defendant Flores</u>, appealed from the above decision to the Court of Appeals
(CA-G.R. 7878-R), appellee Pilar Bautista, from the portions thereof adverse to
her and in favor of the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
its decision of February 16, 1953, the Court of Appeals modified the appealed
decision "by eliminating from it the award of damages in favor of
Wenceslao Pascual against Pilar Bautista and Primitivo Lovina and Nelly
Montilla de Lovina, as solidary debtors; and substituting, in its stead, an
award in favor, of Wen­ceslao Pascual in the total sum of P15,181.86, to be
paid by Pilar Bautista alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In all
other respects the judg­ment of the Court below is affirmed, without pronounce­ment
as to costs".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See page 61 of the
Record on Appeal).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not satisfied with
the result, Pilar Bautista and Wenceslao Pascual appealed to Us (G. R. Nos.
L-6569 and L-6576), but on April 18, 1956, We affirmed the decision of the
Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On June 6, 1957, our
decision was en­tered by the Clerk of Court of the Court of First Instance of
Manila in the entry book of his office.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 3, 1957 Pilar Bautista secured the corresponding writ to
execute the <span style="">decision rendered in her
favor in Civil </span>Case No. 5203 as third-party plaintiff therein against
third-party defendant Flores, but the writ was later returned unsatisfied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter she obtained several <span style="">alias writs of execution against the same
party, the latest having </span>been issued on April 17, 1961, but they were
likewise returned unsatisfied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On May 4,
1961, she filed a petition for the examination under oath of her judgment <span style="">debtor (Flores) alleging that the latter had
fraudulently disposed of his </span>properties, and, <span style="">on May 18 <span style="">of the same year, the
court </span>or­</span>dered said judgment debtor to appear before it for
examina­tion under oath on June 5, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon petition of Flores, however, the court, on June 24, 1961, set aside
its order for his examination <span style="">as </span>well as the writ of execution <span style="">then </span>outstanding, on the ground that
"more than ten years had <span style="">already
elapsed since the judgment against third-party </span>defendant Mariano R.
Flores and in <span style="">favor of third-party
plaintiff was entered, so that no writ of execution of said judgment can now be
issued (See. 6, Rule 39 of the </span>Rules of Court)".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August 29, 1961 appellee Bautista filed a
petition for relief from said order of June 24, 1961, but the same was denied
by the court, and although on November 15, 1961 she filed a notice of appeal
from <span style="">said order of denial, no appeal
therefrom appears to have </span>been actually perfected.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 21, 1961, appellee Pilar Bautista filed an action in
the Court of First Instance of Manila (Civil Case No. 48819) for the revival of
the final judgment here­tofore mentioned rendered in Civil Case No. 5203
against appellant Flores.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his answer
to the complaint, the latter alleged that said judgment had already prescribed
pursuant to Sec. 6, Rule 39, Rules of Court, and Article 1144(3) of the New
Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After trial, the lower <span style="">court rendered the appealed judgment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In his brief appellant submits for our consideration ten errors
allegedly committed by the trial court, but brushing aside all non-essential
issues, We believe that the fate of the present appeal depends upon the
following question:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Which judgment, that
of the Court of First Instance of Manila rendered in Civil Case No. 5203 on
March <span style="">7, </span>1951,
or that of this Court in G. R. Nos. L-6569 and L-6576 rendered on April 18,
1956 (affirming the de­cision of the Court of Appeals <span style="">in </span>CA-G. R. L-7878 which, in turn,
modified the aforementioned decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila)
could be revived <span style="">as </span>against appellant Flores?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If it is the former, it is clear that the action to revive it (Civil
Case No. 48859) filed with the same Court came too late on <u>November 21, 1961</u>,
bearing <span style="">in mind that the decision
sought to be revived - a judgment by default as far as the third party
defendant Flores was concerned - was rendered on March 7, 1951.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">On </span><span style="">the
other hand, if it was our decision in G. R. Nos. L-6569 and L-6576 promulgated
on April 18, 1956, the action for revival was timely filed, as held by the
lower court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In connection with the
above question, two undis­puted facts must be borne in mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first is that </span>from the decision of
the Court of First Instance of Manila in Civil Case No. 5203 rendered on March
7, 1951, all the parties thereto, <u>except the third-party defendant therein</u>,
Flores, appealed to the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The latter, therefore, was not affected at all neither by the decision
rendered by the Court of Appeals nor by the one subsequently rendered by this
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second is that the decision
of the Court of First Instance of Manila in Civil Case No. 5203 was, as far as
Flores was concerned, a judgment by default which, under the law then in force,
was not appealable and was deemed to be immediately executory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Lim Toco vs. Go Fay 80 Phil. 166; Rodrigo
vs. Cabrera, G. R. L-6074, Septem­ber 16, 1954, construing the effects of a
judgment by default under Rule 35, Section 7 of the original Rules of
Court).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, even if Flores had
attempted to appeal therefrom, his appeal would have been out of order.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It has been argued that,
as the judgment by default <span style="">against
Flores was in </span>favor of Pilar Bautista upon her third party complaint,
the same may not be considered final <span style="">or
</span>enforceable until the final determination of the main case - which took
place only upon the finality of <span style="">our
decision in G. R. L-6569 and G. R. L-6576 promulgated on April 18, 1956 - and
that, this being so, the action for revival in question was filed on time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This argument might apply if </span>the cause
of action alleged in Pilar Bautis­ta's third party complaint against Mariano R.
Flores was dependent upon the success or failure of the claim subject matter of
the main action instituted by Wenceslao Pascual <span style="">against Pilar Bautista, plaintiff and defendant therein,
respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such, however, is not the
case before Us, where it is </span>clear that Bautista's cause of action as
third party plaintiff against third party defendant Flores was based on
paragraph 5 of their agreement of January 6, 1945 which reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"(5)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The VENDOR shall, in the event that for any
reason whatsoever Nelly Mon­tilla de Lavina shall refuse or fail to execute in
favor of the VENDOR a deed of sale covering the said fish­pond, pay unto the
VENDEE the sum of FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (P500,000.00) legal tender at the
time, as li­quidated damages, plus all expenses that the VENDEE shall have
incurred for the improvement of the fishpond; and in case of non-payment of the
li­quidated damages and the other expenses above stated the VENDEE shall have
the right to foreclose and levy upon the guarantee hereinabove described, the
VENDOR hereby expressly waiving all <span style="">his
rights under the provisions of Rule 39, Section </span>12 of <span style="">the Rules of Court;"<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above stipulation makes it crystal clear that the vendee
(Pilar Bautista) would be entitled to recover from the vendor (Mariano Flores)
the liquidated damages and <span style="">expenses agreed upon "in the event </span><span style="">that </span><u><span style="">for any reason
what</span></u><u><span style="">soever</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">Nelly
Montilla de Lovina shall refuse or fail to execute in favor of the vendor a
deed of sale covering the said fishpond" (Underline supplied).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because Mrs. Lovina refused and/or failed to
execute the contemplated deed of sale the trial court rendered the judgment </span><span style="">by default against Mariano Flores.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the cause of action or claim of Pilar
Bautista, as third party plaintiff, against Mariano Flores, as third party defendant,
did not depend upon the outcome of the principal action (Pascual vs. Bautista
and the Lovinas) <span style="">is evident </span>from
the nature of the claims involved therein described in our decision </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">G. </span><span style="">R. L-6569 and G. R. L-6576 </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"In his </span>complaint
against Pilar Bautista, <span style="">the Lovinas, </span>and
the latter's man, Yambao, Pas­cual alleged his lease, dispossession and losses
and sought:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the rescission of the
lease with Pilar Bautista; (b) the return of the P10,000 he paid; and (c)
payment of P27,556.00, representing the value of the fish he had in the
fishpond; <span style="">P20,814;72 worth of repairs
thereto and P3,000.00 attorney's fees.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Bautista answered
pleading the acquisition of the rights of Mariano Flores; </span>that she
offered to place the fishpond in plaintiff's possession but that the latter
refused to resume possession; and counterclaimed for the balance of the second
year's rent, amounting to P6,000.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Lovinas filed answer denying privity of contract with
Pascual; and pleaded the expi­ration of Flores' option without its being ex­ercised,
and that they had repossessed the fishpond because it was abandoned.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Subsequently, Pilar Bautista filed a third-party complaint
against Mariano R. Flores alleging breach of the contract Exh 6-Bautista, and
conse­quent losses; and prayed for judgment in the sum of P500,000 as
liquidated damages and attorney's fees, and that the mortgage in her favor be
fore<span style="">closed.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Flores was declared in default and his pro­perties were
attached."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Whether or not the filing of the third party complaint was proper
can not now be raised by, nor be invoked in favor of Pilar Bautista, because it
was she precisely who filed it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, it is clear from the provisions of the Rules of Court that for
a claim to be properly raised in a pending action by way of third party
complaint, it is not necessary that it be one arising from or entirely
dependent upon the main action; it <span style="">is </span>enough
that it be "in respect" of the claim of third party plaintiff's
opponent (Rule 6, Section 12, Rules of Court), or that it be "connected
with plain­tiff's claim" (Capayas vs. Court of First Instance of Albay 43
O. G., 2071, 2074; U.S. Commercial Company vs. Macario Guevara et al., 48 O. G.
pp. 612-613).</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing makes unnecessary the consideration of other issues
raised by appellant in his brief.</p>

appealed decision, without costs.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BARREDO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the result.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I </span>find myself
unable, however, to agree with the proposition impliedly, if not-directly,
upheld in the main opinion that even if the claim of plaintiff-appel­lee Pilar
Bautista is considered as a proper third-party complaint, the judgment in her
favor and against Flores <span style="">would </span><span style="">still </span><span style="">have been enforceable even before the decision of this Court in G. R.
Nos. L-6569 and 6576 became final and executory, which, to be sure, is
unnecessary and, therefore, </span><span style="">obiter </span><span style="">dictum.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To start with, if it is true that the allegation of
defendant-appellant Mariano Flores under his contract <span style="">with appellee Bautista was really entirely independent </span>of any
liability of the latter to Wenceslao Pascual who had sued her, I cannot see how
a third-party complaint could have been filed by appellee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To say that the ba­<span style="">sis </span>of Bautista's claim against Flores
<span style="">is </span>completely
in­dependent<span style=""> of Pascual's cause of
action against her and, in the same breath, hold that such claim of Bautista
against Flores is "in respect of" Pascual's claim strikes me </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">lacking in consistency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if
this point, </span><span style="">as the main </span><span style="">opinion holds, can no longer be rais­ed now, </span><span style="">it is my considered
view </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">it is </span><span style="">better that the true nature of the remedy in
question be determined,</span><span style=""> and </span><span style="">thereby clearing any doubt as to the rights
of the </span><span style="">parties </span><span style="">before Us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I maintain, therefore, that the pleading filed by appellee Bautista
against appellant Flores was not a third-party complaint but an ordinary
complaint, mistakenly pleaded </span><span style="">within the pending action between Pascual and
appellee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, since judg­ment </span><span style="">by default was actually rendered thereon by
the court, apparently without anybody being the wiser and <span style="">because there </span></span><span style="">was </span><span style="">no objection from
anyone, the said judgment must be treated </span><span style="">as an </span><span style="">ordinary one, as contradistin­guished from a
judgment upon </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">third-party complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, I concur in the result of the main opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, on the other hand, the pleading in
question were to be considered as a genuine third-party complaint, the
dispositive portion </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">this decision would not be, in my opinion, correct.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I
regret I have to disagree with the excessively broad concept of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">third-party
complaint defined by the main opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
do not believe that the phrase "in re­spect of his opponent's claim"
used in Section 12 of Rule 6 of the Rules of Court concerning third-party com­plaints,
can be equated with or has the </span><span style="">same </span><span style="">connotation as that of being merely "connected
with the plaintiff's claim", </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">the main opinion holds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I realize that this quotation </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">from Capayas vs.
Court of First Instance of Albay, 77 Phil. 181, 183, but I am afraid it can be
out of context, for, precisely in that very decision, this Court held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Petitioner's claim for indemnity against Lladoc and others
does neither arise out of the same transaction or the alleged petitioner's
tortuous act on which plaintiff's action is based, nor is it based on a
different trans<span style="">action but connected with the plaintiff's claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff's claim against petitioner and his
co-defend­ants is, according to the allegations in the complaint, </span><span style="">(a) </span><span style="">to recover from
them damages for the palay which have been illegally harvested from certain
lands belonging to the plaintiff, and (b) to enjoin them from entering said lands
and disturbing and molesting the plaintiff's right of ownership and possession
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereas the peti­tioner's claim
against Isidora Lladoc and others is to recover from the latter the value of
the three parcels of land and t</span><span style="">heir </span><span style="">fruits amounting to P3,200 plus legal interest, for
hav­ing said Isidora, as administratrix of the intestate estate of Ceferino
Cuanzon, sold said lands in 1927 without authority of the court to Domingo
Imperial, from whom said lands were<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>acquired by the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in
</span><span style="">the
present case, it is clear that if the so-called third-party complaint be
allowed, Isidora Lladoc and others named therein as third-party defendants
could not assert any defense which the petitioner has or may have to the
plaintiff's claim."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the true nature and concept of a third-party complaint
was more comprehensively stated in that Capayas case thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Secondly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because the
respond­ent court would have committed an error if it had admitted the
so-called third-party complaint filed<span style=""> by the petitioner against Isidora Lladoc, Fulgencio
Lladoc and Gre­gorio Navera, since the facts al­leged therein do not show that
the petitioner is entitled to indemnity against them '<u>in respect to plain­tiff's
claim</u>.' The test to deter­mine whether the claim for indem­nity in a
third-party complaint, '<u>in respect to</u></span><u><span style=""> </span></u><u><span style="">plaintiff's claim</span></u><span style="">' is, whether it
arises out of the same transaction on which the plaintiff's claim is based, or
the third-party's claim, although aris­ing out of another or different contract
or transaction, is con­nected with the plaintiff's claim.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"According to the decision in the case of Crim. vs.
Lumberman's Mutual Casualty Co. (26 Fed. Supp., 715 [1 Fed. Rules Service,
14a11, Case No. 1]), the test to deter<span style="">mine when a third-party defendant may be impleaded
is whether he could have been joined originally as a defendant by the
plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this could be applied
only if there could be asserted against the defendant as the third-party defend­ant,
jointly and severally or in the </span><span style="">alternatives,
any right to relief <u>arising out of the same transaction</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>For example in an action against the
surety on a bond, the surety may bring in as a third-party de­fendant, the
principal who had agreed to indemnify the surety, be­cause the surety's claim
arises out of the same transaction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(United States vs. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. vs.
Kolling, U. S. Dist. Ct., D. Minn., February 1, 1940, 2 Fed. Rules Service
14a222, Case No. 1).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The above test does
not cover all cases in which im­pleading a third-party may be and have been
allowed, which are also <span style="">covered by the
test we have laid down in the previous paragraph.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Rule </span>14 of Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure, which corresponds <span style="">to </span>our
Rule 12, the bringing in of a third-party defendant <span style="">is </span>proper if he would be liable to
the plain­tiff or to the defendant for all or part of the plaintiff's claim
against the original defendant, although the third-party <span style="">defendant's </span>liability arises out of
another transaction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So in the case of
Carbola Chemical Co., Inc. vs. Trundle Engineering Co. (U.S. Dist. <span style="">Ct., S.D.N.Y., </span><span style="">December 26, 1942), </span>it was held that in <span style="">an action for </span>breach of contract to render en­gineering services
and to survey a plant, the defendant was <span style="">allowed to bring as </span><span style="">a </span>third-party defendant, the manufacturer
which sold defend<span style="">ant's equipment to the
plaintiff </span>(7 Fed. Rules Service, 14a11, Case No. 1).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in <span style="">a </span>negligence action by the purchaser of a
confection <span style="">in </span>which it is
alleged that the <span style="">confec­tion contained
a foreign </span>object, the defendant may bring in the person who supplied him
with the constitu­<span style="">ent containing </span>the
foreign object, as a third-party defendant (Saunders <span style="">vs. Southern Dairies, Inc. U.S. </span><span style="">Dist. </span><span style="">Ct., District of Columbia, November 6, 1939 [2</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">Fed. Rules Service, 14a.226, Case No. 3]</span><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Another test, provided for by section 4, Rule 12, of our
Rules of Court, is whether the third-party defendant may assert any defenses
which the third-party plaintiff has or may have to the plaintiff's claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he may properly assert such defenses, then
he is a proper third-party defendant; otherwise he is not and the claim against
him can not be considered as a third-party complaint."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The way I understand the above-quoted
dissertation, it does not lay down one single test that can be utilized or
applied separately from the others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
determine whether a third-party complaint is proper or not, all the tests
mentioned must have to be satisfied.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that the purpose of a third-party complaint
is to avoid multiplicity of suits, but this principle cannot be so extensive as
to authorize the impleading of a party whose controversy with the implead­er
relates to a claim with which those already in the action have nothing to do,
even if the transactions involved in the controversy already in court may have
some connection, <span style="">as </span>when it is
part of the same series, with that to be involved in the third-party
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What justifies a unity of
proceedings is community of inter­est and issues, except as between parties
already con­tending with each other, in which all kinds of claims are
permissible to be pleaded against each other.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I maintain there <span style="">is </span>a
distinction between related trans­actions and related claims, and the latter,
not the for­mer, are the ones that can be the subject of the third-party complaints.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the claims must be related to
the same transaction and not to merely related transactions.</p>

<p class="BODY">In defining a compulsory counter-claim, Section 4 of Rule 9 uses
the phrase "necessarily connected with".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, the reference here <span style="">is </span>to
transaction or occurence and not to claims.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My point, however, <span style="">is </span>that were it the intention of Section 12, Rule 6 to refer to
merely "connected" claims, it would have used that word instead of
the phrase "in respect of" as in Section 4, Rule 9, and thereby avoid
confusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it is bad to give to the
same word used in the various parts of a single body of rules or laws different
meanings, since it must be presumed that the authors thereof must have intended
a uniform meaning for it throughout, conversely, it is just as bad to attribute
the same meaning to two different, if quite synonimous words therein, for it is
obvious that the use of <span style="">a </span>different
word, with a known somewhat different connotation, indicates that the mean­ing
intended to be conveyed <span style="">is </span>also
different.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears quite clear to me that in ordinary par­lance, to say
that one thing is "connected with" another does not convey the same
import <span style="">as </span>saying that it <span style="">is </span>"in respect of" it.
"Connected with" comprehends a much broader idea than "in respect
of".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I <span style="">am </span>sure that, at least, these two phrases are not always
interchangeable.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to Senator Vicente Francisco, a distin­guished
authority in procedural law, "The rule on third-party complaint requires
that the claim of the defendant be 'in respect of the plaintiff's claim.'
Unlike permis­sive counter-claim, <u>the third-party complaint must be founded
on the claims in the original action</u>." (The Re­vised Rules of Court in
the Philippines, Annotated and Commented by Vicente Francisco, Vol. I, p.
351.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Emphasis supplied.) In this
connection, <span style="">he cites United </span>States
vs. Jollimore vs. Holland Furnace Co., 5 Federal Rules Service 205, thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"A third-party defendant may not be
impleaded if the effect would be to introduce a new and separate controversy
into the action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The test to determine
whether a third-party may be impleaded is whe­ther he could have been joined
originally as a defendant by the plaintiff or whether he is liable <span style="">as a </span>guarantor, surety, insurer, or
indemnifier of the principal defend­ant." Further, the same author opines:</p>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Purpose of third-party com­plaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The purpose of third-party complaint is to
avoid two actions which should be tried together to save time and cost of
reduplication of evidence, to obtain consistent results from identical or
similar evidence, and to do away with the serious handicap to <span style="">a </span>defendant
of a time difference between a judg­ment against him, and a judgment in his
favor against the third-party defendant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Moore's Federal Practice, 740; Tullgreen vs. Jasper, 1939, 27 F. Supp.
413.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The purpose of the rule is to avoid delay and circuity of
actions and to enable the controversy to be disposed of in one suit, that is,
to permit the determination in a single suit of not only the original claim, <span style="">but the added
party's liability therefor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(67 C.J.S.,
1934; The</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">purpose
of third-party procedure </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">to avoid circuity
of action and permits the determination in a single action of the rights and
liabilities of parties growing out of facts that relate to the same transaction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Carbola Che­mical Co., Inc. Trundle
Engineer­ing Co., 7 Federal Rules Service, 269; The primary object of the civil
procedure rule permitting a defendant to bring in a third-party defendant is to
avoid cir­cuity of action and to dispose, in one litigation, of an entire
subject matter arising from a parti­cular set of facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Tullgreen vs. Jasper, (1939) 27 F. Supp.
413.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nature of third-party com­plaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Third-party complaint <span style="">is </span>merely a
device by which the de­fendant can bring into the original suit a party against
whom he will have <span style="">a claim </span>for indemnity or remu<span style="">neration as a result of a liability
established against him in the ori­ginal suit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">a species of joinder of actions where the
second action accrues only as a result of the first action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All liabilities are determined in the one
action and the use of third-party complaint is discretionary with the court.

<p class="BODY">I submit that a fourth-party complaint <span style="">is </span>nothing more nothing <span style="">less </span>than a
third-party complaint, except that it is only in respect of the claim of the
third-party plaintiff against the third-party defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, <span style="">Section
13 of Rule 6 defines a fourth-party complaint as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 13.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fourth, etc.,
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- A third-party defendant may
proceed under this rule against any person not a party to the action who <span style="">is </span>or may
be liable to him or to the third-party plaintiff for all or part of the claim
made in the action against the third-party defendant."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">I am convinced that these simple words
applied <u><span style="">mutatis</span></u><span style=""> <u>mutandis</u> </span>to the definition of
a third-party complaint convey the true concept of such pleading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I simply cannot see why a plaintiff can be
made to saddle the time, inconvenience and expenses of attending to a
third-party complaint wherein the fate of his own claim against the defendant <span style="">is </span>absolutely
independent of the claim of the defendant against the third-party defend­ant
just because the transaction involved in the third-party complaint happens to
be related somehow to the transaction subject of his complaint, specially if
the plaintiff has not taken part nor is he mentioned or re­ferred to in such
transaction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My fear is that such an
amplification of the concept of third-party complaints which the main opinion
seems to sanction will not serve the purpose of "assisting the parties in
obtaining just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action or
proceeding" as envisioned in Section 2 of Rule 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, it <span style="">is </span>bound to create confusion, unneces­sary
delay and expense for the plaintiff without any corresponding benefit to the
interests of justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Applying these views to this case, I reiterate that if the claim
of Bautista were a real third-party complaint, the effect would be that the
judgment, even by the default, against Flores did not become executory until
after the claim against Bautista had been finally determined, for in my
concept, as explained above, of <span style="">a </span>real third-party complaint, the
third-party defendant is never liable to the defendant unless the latter is
liable to the plaintiff.</p>
