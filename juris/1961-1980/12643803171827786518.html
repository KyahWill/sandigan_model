decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City 
in Civil Case No. Q-2487 declaring null and void: (1) the compromise agreement 
dated February 15, 1957; (2) the judgment of the Court of First Instance of 
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City of February 24, 1957, approving the said 
agreement; (3) the order of execution of May 2, 1957; and (4) the writ of 
execution and the sheriff's sale of May 27, 1957, all of which are proceedings 
in its Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">Q-1948.</span></p>
<p><span class="GramE"><u>Antecedents</u>.</span> - On <st1:date month="7" day="11" year="1956">July 11, 1956</st1:date>, Serrano filed against the <span class="SpellE">Miave</span> spouses in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, a complaint for specific performance and 
damages (Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">Q-1948).</span> He demanded the 
execution by said couple of the formal deed of sale of a truck, plus the 
assignment of its certificate of public convenience.</p>
<p>Denying the material allegations of the complaint, the spouses alleged, as 
defense, that non-execution of the said documents was due to Serrano's failure 
to deliver to <span class="GramE">said</span> spouses, a re-conditioned <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> as part of the purchase price of the said truck. The 
parties attended a pre-trial, after which they submitted to the lower court a 
compromise agreement dated February 15, 1957, the pertinent portions of which 
provide;</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"1. That the purchase price of the truck in question is fixed at P5<span class="GramE">,200.00</span>;</p>
<p>2. That the defendants acknowledge to have received from the plaintiff the 
amount of P600.00 on account of the purchase price of said truck;</p>
<p>3. That the plaintiff binds himself to deliver to defendants a <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>, Eisenhower type, new motor, in good running 
condition, painted and with complete upholstery, to be made and taken from 
Francisco Shop in <span class="SpellE">Zapote</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, within 45 days from February 16, 1957, and Mr. 
Francisco, owner of the shop, should certify as to the condition of the 
same;<span class="style1"><sup>[*]</sup></span></p>
<p>4. That the defendants-spouses promise and agree to deliver to the plaintiff 
the papers regarding the registration of the truck in question, and to execute 
the corresponding deed of sale and assignment;</p>
<p>5. That the balance of P1,600.00 shall be paid in monthly installments of 
P400.00 within the first 10 days of every month to begin on April 10, 1957, and 
failure to pay any installment on the date due will render the entire balance 
due and demandable;</p>
<p>6. With the sale of the truck, it is also included the line or certificate of 
public convenience and the plaintiff will take what ever step may be necessary 
so that the certificate of public convenience issued in favor of the defendant 
be transferred to the plaintiff, and the defendants have agreed to cooperate and 
sign whatever document may be necessary to facilitate the transfer of the line 
in favor of the plaintiff;</p>
<p>7. That upon failure of any of the parties to comply with any of the terms 
and conditions stipulated herein, the necessary process may be resorted to, and 
<u>should</u> failure be on the part of the plaintiff, the corresponding writ of 
execution may be issued.”</p></blockquote>
<p>On <st1:date month="2" day="24" year="1957">February 24, 1957</st1:date>, the 
court rendered judgment approving the said compromise agreement, and ordering 
the parties to abide by the terms thereof.</p>
<p>Implementing the said agreement, the <span class="SpellE">Miave</span> spouses 
executed in favor of Serrano the deed of sale over the truck for the amount of 
P5<span class="GramE">,200.00</span>. Simultaneously with the execution of the 
deed, the certificate of public convenience was assigned. Then, to secure 
payment of the balance, Serrano signed a deed of chattel mortgage on the truck, 
in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Miave</span> spouses.</p>
<p>However, because Serrano did not deliver the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> as agreed in the compromise agreement, the spouses 
moved for the execution of the decision of <st1:date month="2" day="24" year="1957">February 24, 1957</st1:date>. Serrano received a copy of said 
motion, and hearing thereof fallowed. Execution was ordered by the court, and a 
writ was issued pursuant thereto. On <st1:date month="5" day="13" year="1957">May 13, 1957</st1:date>, the Sheriff of Manila issued the notice of 
sale of <u>Serrano's own certificate of public convenience in Public Service 
Commission Case No. 79700.</u> Serrano received a copy of this notice of sale. 
The <span class="SpellE">Miave</span> spouses, as highest bidders, purchased 
<u>Serrano’s certificate</u> for P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> in the 
public sale. On <st1:date month="6" day="27" year="1957">June 27, 
1957</st1:date>, they sold to <span class="SpellE">Cresenta</span> <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> (appellant) this Public Service Commission 
certificate of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Serrano for P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</p>
<p><span class="GramE"><u>This Case</u>.</span> - Consequently, on <st1:date month="7" day="12" year="1957">July 12, 1957</st1:date>, Serrano filed against 
the <span class="SpellE">Miave</span> spouses in the Court of First Instance of 
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, this Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">Q-2487.</span> He alleged therein that when he <span class="SpellE">recieved</span> a copy of the motion for execution in Civil Case 
No. Q-1948, he and his lawyer immediately conferred with the spouses' attorney 
and obtained an assurance from the latter that the hearing of the said motion 
would be suspended; that when he received a copy of the notice of sale, he was 
surprised and once more conferred with said spouses' attorney; that as a result 
thereof, the sale was postponed to May 24, 1957; that because he was not able to 
raise the necessary amount on May 24, 1957, he sent appellants-spouses a 
telegram asking for postponement of the sale; that the sale took place on May 
27, 1957; that he was able to return to Manila only on May 28, 1957; that upon 
discovery that the sale had taken place on May 27, 1957, he immediately inquired 
from the Public Service Commission about the status of the certificate of public 
convenience issued to the <span class="SpellE">Miave</span> spouses in Public 
Service Commission Case No. 81523; that he learned <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> that said certificate had been cancelled and 
revoked as early as October 19, 1956. On the basis of these allegations, he 
asked that all the incidents of Civil Case No. Q-1948 be annulled, on the ground 
that the compromise agreement of <st1:date month="2" day="15" year="1957">February 15, 1957</st1:date>, and the judgment of the Court of 
<st1:date month="2" day="24" year="1957">February 24, 1957</st1:date>, in Civil 
Case No. Q-1948 had been procured through fraud; that on the date of said 
agreement (February 15, 1957), the certificate of public convenience in PSC Case 
No. 81523 of the <span class="SpellE">Miave</span> spouses was no longer in 
existence— it had already been cancelled and revoked; that this very important 
fact had been cancelled, which concealment rendered the said agreement void.</p>
<p>The lower court upheld Serrano's theory. As stated at the beginning of this 
decision, it annulled the compromise agreement, the judgment of the Court of 
First Instance approving it, the order and writ of execution and the Sheriff's 
sale.</p>
<p><span class="GramE"><u>Appeal</u>.</span> - The spouses <span class="SpellE">Miave</span> and their co-defendant <span class="SpellE">Cresenta</span> <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> appealed to 
this Court contending that the lower court erred, because <u>it is not true</u>: 
(a) that the compromise agreement had no consideration; and (b) that there was 
fraud on the part of the said spouses in the matter of the certificate of public 
convenience of the truck. Furthermore, they say, the order and writ of execution 
and the Sheriff's sale was valid, there having been due notice of the hearing of 
such proceedings.</p>
<p><span class="GramE"><u>Discussion</u>.</span> - Basically, the lower court 
nullified the above-mentioned incidents of Civil Case No. Q-1948 for the 
following reasons:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>a. The compromise agreement of <st1:date month="2" day="15" year="1057">February 15, 1057</st1:date>, was tainted by fraud because the <span class="SpellE">Miave</span> spouses could not, at that time, transfer the 
certificate of convenience, the same having been previously cancelled by the 
Public Service Commission.</p>
<p>b. The agreement is likewise null and void because it has no consideration. 
The inclusion of the said certificate with the sale of the truck is the <u>main 
consideration</u> of the agreement. Its non-existence at the time of the 
agreement renders the latter without consideration.</p>
<p>c. The order of execution is void, not only because the judgment basis 
thereof is void, but also because no hearing was had to ascertain the existence 
of an alleged breach in the agreement. The same may be said of the writ of 
execution and the Sheriff's sale to the spouses.</p>
<p>d. Similarly, the subsequent sale by the spouses to appellant <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> is null and void, because the former had no right 
whatsoever to transfer to the latter. <span class="SpellE">Victorino's</span> 
purchase was in a private sale and therefore not covered by the protective cloak 
of Article 559 of the Civil Code of the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>. He 
may, therefore, be compelled to return the said certificate to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> without receiving reimbursement <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> from the latter. He may, however, recover the 
P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> he paid for said certificate from the <span class="SpellE">Miave</span> spouses who sold it to him.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our views are these: The judgment of the lower court in Civil Case No. Q-1948 
on the basis of the compromise agreement dated <st1:date month="2" day="15" year="1957">February 15, 1957</st1:date>, was "a judgment upon a compromise" - a 
judgment rendered with the consent of the parties for the purpose of executing a 
settlement of the action. It is in the nature of a contract and is in effect an 
admission by the parties that the judgment is a just determination of their 
rights on the facts of the case, had they been proved. Even more than a contract 
(which may be enforced by ordinary action for specific performance), the 
compromise agreement is part and parcel of the judgment, and may, therefore, be 
enforced as such by a writ of execution.<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> 
In fact, a compromise has upon the parties the effect and authority of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></u>.</p>
<p>But even a judicial compromise may be set aside in case of vitiated consent, 
such as fraud<span class="GramE">.<span class="style1"><sup>[</sup></span></span><span class="style1"><sup>2]</sup></span> 
The question now for determination is: did the <span class="SpellE">Miave</span> 
spouses commit fraud?</p>
<p>In the original agreement of <st1:date month="2" day="6" year="1956">February 
6, 1956</st1:date>, between <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Serrano and the 
spouses <span class="SpellE">Miave</span>, the latter agreed to sell to the former 
the said truck and the certificate of public convenience involved in this case, 
PSC Case No. 81523. On <st1:date month="2" day="10" year="1956">February 10, 
1956</st1:date>, the spouses delivered to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> the 
said truck and the said certificate. From that day (until today), <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had use of the truck. From that time, he had the 
<u>opportunity to investigate</u> the status of said certificate. Moreover, 
being an owner himself of a similar certificate of public convenience (issued to 
Serrano in PSC Case No. 79700), Serrano should have been aware of the 
requirements of the Public Service Commission regarding such matters. It will be 
recalled that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> in Civil Case No. Q-1948 
demanded that appellants-spouses execute the deed of sale of said truck and the 
assignment of the said certificate. The action resulted in a compromise 
agreement wherein among other <span class="GramE">stipulations,</span> Serrano 
bound himself to first secure the approval of the transfer and assignment of 
said line and certificate of public convenience from the Public Service 
Commission at his own expense. He assumed an obligation.</p>
<p><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> was not careful. Had he exercised ordinary 
care, he should have sought immediately the transfer of the said certificate to 
his name in the Public Service Commission; had he done it soon enough, he could 
have known the flaw in the certificate and have it remedied. He had access to 
the necessary papers all the time. The certificate was with him since <st1:date month="2" day="10" year="1956">February 10, 1956</st1:date>. We do not know the 
reason for the certificate's cancellation. It may due to causes traceable to his 
inaction; so it is not proper to ascribe concealment by the spouses of the 
status of the said certificate; <span class="GramE">specially</span> because it is 
not proven that they know of the cancellation. <span class="style1"><sup>[2-a]</sup></span> </p>
<p>Had <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> acted more responsibly, he should have 
delivered the reconditioned <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> and made cash 
payments as stipulated in the compromise agreement. But as he did not, execution 
was ordered against him. Had he attended on time to the transfer of said 
certificate, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, could have discovered that the 
certificate had already been cancelled and revoked and could have had set up 
this fact as defense against execution, - but he did not.</p>
<p>As revealed by the records (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "G"), <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was served a copy of the motion for execution of 
the decision. He could have opposed the motion on the above-mentioned ground. He 
was also served a copy of the notice of the Sheriff's sale. There was even 
postponement at his request with the spouses' consent.</p>
<p>Having thus failed to question in time the validity of the compromise 
agreement, the judgment and its subsequent execution, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> may be said to have forfeited his right to have 
them set aside.</p>
<p>It is also claimed that the compromise agreement is null and void for lack of 
consideration, the said certificate PSC No. 81523 having been revoked as early 
as October 19. 1956.</p>
<p>The records show that the compromise agreement is a <span class="SpellE">reaffirmance</span> of the contract to sell of <st1:date month="2" day="6" year="1956">February 6, 1956</st1:date>. It is a ratification of this 
original verbal agreement. There is nothing incompatible therein with the 
original rights and obligations of the parties under the early contract. The 
compromise agreement embodies the terms of payment and obligations of the 
parties in the contract of February, 1956. The judgment approving this agreement 
is a judicial record containing the original obligations of the parties 
concerned. There was no <span class="SpellE">novation</span> of the earlier 
contract; the parties assumed the terms and conditions of the original 
contract<span class="GramE">.<span class="style1"><sup>[</sup></span></span><span class="style1"><sup>3]</sup></span> At <u>the time of the perfection</u> of that 
early contract of <st1:date month="2" day="6" year="1956">February 6, 
1956</st1:date>, the truck and certificate of public convenience in PSC Case No. 
81523 were existing.</p>
<p>Under the accepted legal principles, existence of consideration is necessary 
only at the time of the perfection of the contract (not after)<span class="style1"><sup>[4]</sup></span> ; and insufficiency (inadequacy) of the 
vendor's title to the property sold is not such lack of consideration as to make 
the contract null and void.<span class="style1"><sup>[5]</sup></span> </p>
<p>Bearing in mind the indifference shown by Serrano, who did not take the 
trouble of inquiring at the Public Service Commission about the status of the 
certificate <u>until after the execution sale</u>, the courts can not escape the 
conclusion, either that the certificate was not so important to the contract or 
that he merely made use of the revocation as a last-minute excuse for his 
failure to perform his part of the compromise. Anyway, there is no claim that 
the certificate could not be revived or a new certificate can not be 
obtained.</p>
<p><u>Conclusion</u><span class="GramE">.-</span> For this and other reasons, we 
believe it was error for the lower court to annul the execution sale and the 
compromise on the grounds stated.</p>
<p><u>Judgment</u><span class="GramE">.-</span> Wherefore, the decision appealed 
from is reversed <u>in <span class="SpellE">toto</span></u>. The compromise 
agreement, the judgment on compromise, the order and writ of execution as well 
as the Sheriff's sale must be declared valid. Consequently, the <span class="SpellE">Miave</span> spouses acquired valid title to Serrano's certificate 
of public convenience sold to them in the Sheriff's sale, and the conveyance 
made by them to <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> is, likewise, valid.</p>
