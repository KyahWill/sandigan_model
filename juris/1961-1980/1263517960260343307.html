				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In the Circuit Criminal Court, 14th Judicial District, Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Englatera</span> was charged with murder as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 6th day of March, 1969, at about 2:00
o'clock in the afternoon, in the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said
accused Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Englatera</span>, armed with a bolo, with
treachery and evident premeditation, with deliberate intent, and with intent to
kill, did then and there suddenly and unexpectedly attack, assault and hack one
Carmelita <span class="SpellE">Ardiente</span> on the head several times with
said bolo, thereby inflicting upon him the following injuries:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">'Intracranial Hemorrhage,
laceration of brain, external hemorrhage, due to incised wounds of the head,
chest, neck and extremities."</span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">and</span> as a
consequence of which said Carmelita <span class="SpellE">Ardiente</span> died
instantaneously."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment on May 20, 1969, the defendant, assisted by his
counsel de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span>, pleaded not guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, when the case was called for trial
on July 8 of the same year, his counsel moved that the defendant be allowed to
withdraw his plea of not guilty and sub­stitute it with a plea of guilty after
proper arraignment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without objection on
the part of the prosecution the motion was granted, the defendant was arraigned
anew, and he forthwith pleaded guilty as charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">What transpired thereafter is set forth in the following portions
of the appealed decision:</p>

<blockquote>"At this instant, the defense invoked in favor of the accused
only the mitigating circumstance of plea of guilty and prayed the Court that
the aggravating circumstances alleged in the amended information, namely, '(a)
by the accused taking advantage of his superior strength; (b) for having
committed the crime without due regard to the opposite sex; (c) and by the
accused deliberately augmenting in the commission of the crime by causing other
wrong not necessary for its commission,' be disregarded on the grounds that the
same is not applicable in the in­stant case, first, because superior strength
is absorbed by treachery; second, because the aggravating circumstance without
due regard to the opposite sex does not apply as there was no showing that
there was disregard of sex, and lastly, that cruelty was not evident in the
present case, thus, the three aggravating circumstances alleged in the
information cannot be considered as against the accused in the imposition of
the penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense further argued
that with one aggravating circumstance of recidivism left which will be offset
by the mitigating circumstance of plea of guilty, the penalty imposable would
be the medium penalty which is that of reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Special Counsel Vicente C. <span class="SpellE">Fanilag</span>,
for the prosecution, vehemently objected to the manifestation of the defense
and maintained a fighting stance that since the accused had already pleaded
guilty to the allegations in the information of the charge of murder, the
aggravating circumstance embodied in said information are therefore wholly
admitted and could no longer be treated independently or absorbed into one
aggravating circumstance as mani­fested by the defense.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In fairness to both parties, the Court required them to
submit their respective memoranda and to cite therein their respective
authorities in support of their respective contentions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After a careful review of the authorities and citations of
the law presented by both parties, the Court is convinced that even if the
three aggravating circumstances <span class="SpellE">abovesaid</span> were
disregarded, for the sake of argument, still the allegations in the amended
information which contains two qualifying circumstances, that of treachery and
evident premeditation, and that it is a well-settled rule in our jurisprudence
that only one is necessary to qualify the killing to the crime of murder and
therefore the remaining qualifying circumstance should be treated as another
aggravating circumstance, thus the result would be the same in the imposition
of the penalty.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Supreme Court, in a long line of decisions, consistently
defined this point when it said:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'That murder will exist with only one of the circumstances des­cribed
in Art. <span class="GramE">248 (U.S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Labai</span>, 17
Phil. 240).</span></p>

<p class="2Q">'When more than one of said circumstances <span class="GramE">are</span>
present, the others must be considered as generic aggravating
circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, when in killing the
victim, the commission of the crime is attended by (1) evident premeditation,
(2) treachery and (3) price, reward or promise, only one of them shall qualify
the killing to murder and the others shall be considered as generic aggravating
circumstances.' <span class="GramE">(Revised Penal Code, B. Reyes, pp. 424).</span></p>

<blockquote>"After mature deliberation, the Court is of-the opinion and so
holds that the maximum penalty for the commission of the crime of murder in
this case should be imposed and the prayer of the accused to reduce the penalty
in its medium penalty should be denied.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Much as the Court wanted to reduce the penalty because it <span class="SpellE">abhores</span> capital punishment, but considering that it his
sole duty to uphold the law even how personally unpleasant it is, the maximum
penalty should be applied in this case."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In view of his plea of guilty, the lower court rendered judgment
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused RODRIGO ENGLATERA
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of MURDER as charged in the amended
information for the killing of Carmelite <span class="SpellE">Ardiente</span>,
and considering the miti­gating circumstance of his plea of guilty which cannot
offset the five aggravating circumstances above-mentioned, and in consonance
with the provisions of Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, hereby sentences
the accused RODRIGO ENGLATERA to the maximum penalty of DEATH, to pay the heirs
of the deceased Carmelite <span class="SpellE">Ardiente</span> the sum of
P12,000.00, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency in view of
the nature of the penalty imposed, and to pay the costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">According to the record on March 12, 1970 counsel de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span>, Atty. Joaquin Ramirez, filed a petition for new
trial based mainly on the claim that "appellant's fundamental rights were
violated, due process of law was not observed, and he stands about to lose his
life in view of the disregard of his constitutional rights", because, in
his opinion, not enough was done below, when appellant was <span class="SpellE">rearraigned</span>,
to inform him of the nature of the charge and of the inevitable consequence of
the plea of guilty that he intended to enter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On March 16, 1970, <span class="GramE">We</span> resolved to defer action
on the petition for new trial until the case is taken up on the merits, and
without prejudice to raising the same issue in appellant's brief.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the brief filed for the appellant by his counsel de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span> on April 13, 1970, he reiterates his petition that
the appealed decision be set aside and that, there­after, the record of the
case be remanded below for a new arraignment of the appellant in accordance
with the procedure and practice outlined on pertinent decisions of this
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support of this renewed
petition for new trial, appellant's brief says the following in part:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"D) <u>Proceedings in the Lower Court.</u></span><u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

cry from that of the Trial Court in the case of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Apduhan</span>,
G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-19491, Aug. 30, 1968, when it repeatedly warned
the therein accused that despite the substitution of his plea of not guilty to
one of guilty, the said Court might probably impose the death penalty.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said Court, in fact, later <u>reopened</u>
the case to obtain that certainty required in this important matter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Trial Judge in the <span class="SpellE">Apduhan</span> case
was later on commended by this Honorable Court in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Solacito</span>, G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-29209, </span><st1:date year="1969" day="25" month="8"><span class="GramE">Aug. 25, 1969</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, which this Honorable Court, thru Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>, remanded for new arraignment and trial.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Yet, if the case at bar is compared to the <span class="SpellE">Solacito</span> case, it would seem that the Trial Judge here did <u>far
less</u> than the judge in the said case, for in the <span class="SpellE">Solacito</span>
case, the Trial Judge 'asked the accused whether he understands the meaning of
a plea of guilty and whether he is admitting all the material averments in the
information,' to which 'the accused answered in the affirmative.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the instant case, <u>not a single question was propounded</u>
by the Trial Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said Trial Judge
simply allowed the accused to withdraw his plea of not guilty and to enter a
plea of guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>No admonition in
whatever manner was given</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE"><u>voluntariness</u></span> of the plea was not established thru
questions from the Trial judge nor was the appellant's awareness that by pleading
guilty to murder with FIVE (5) aggravating circumstances, he will <u>probably</u>
be sentenced to die.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Herein appellant therefore respectfully <u>reiterates</u> his
Petition for New Trial, which as aforesaid is adopted herein and made an
integral part of this Brief, and that this case be remanded to the Trial Court
for new arraignment and trial.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"E) <u>Appeal to the Solicitor General</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In our petition for new trial, <span class="GramE">We</span> requested
the Honorable Solicitor General, considering the clear denial of appellant's
fundamental rights in this case, to join us in petitioning this Honorable Court
to order a new arraignment and trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
reiterate this appeal for we honestly feel that this is one case where the
Solicitor General is left with no reasonable alternative but to join us in
pleading for appellant's cause."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On July 7, 1970 instead of filing the brief for the State,
Solicitor General Felix Q. Antonio, Assistant Solicitor General Crispin B.
Bautista, and Solicitor Pedro E. Ramirez filed a MANIFESTATION AND MOTION
joining "counsel de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span> for the appellant in
his motion for new trial" and praying also that the appealed decision be
set aside and the case remanded below for further proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have gone over the record and <span class="GramE">We</span> find
that the motion for new trial mentioned heretofore is justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The present being one for murder for which
the defendant was sentenced to suffer the maximum penalty of death, We find it
proper to invite the attention of the court a quo and of all trial courts in
gen­eral to what We said in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Apduhan</span>, G. R.
L­-19491, August 30, 1968 and People vs. <span class="SpellE">Solacito</span>, G.
R. No. L-29209, August 25, 1969 on the matter of what the trial court should do

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby set aside
and the record of the case is remanded below for further proceedings,
specifically to have the defendant arraigned once more, with assistance of
counsel, and with full information regarding the nature and gravity of the
offense charged, the penalty that might be imposed upon him if he pleads
guilty, and of all other rights that he might be entitled to under the
