				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an action against Rodrigo Quinit and his father Maximino Quinit to 
recover damages claimed to have been sustained by plaintiff Beatriz Galang for 
an alleged breach of promise on the part of Rodrigo Quinit to marry her. In due 
course, the Court of First Instance of Baguio, in which the case was originally 
instituted, rendered a decision sentencing the defendants jointly and severally 
to pay the sums of P275.00, by way of actual damages, P5,000,00, as moral 
damages, and P500.00, as attorney's fees, apart from the costs. On appeal, taken 
by the defendants, the Court of Appeals absolved Maximino Quinit, and 
accordingly, reversed said decision insofar as he is concerned, and modified it 
as regards Rodrigo Quinit, by eliminating the awards for moral damages and 
attorney's fees. The case is before us on appeal by certiorari taken by 
plaintiff Beatriz Galang.
<p>As found by the Court of Appeals, it appears that plaintiff "and Rodrigo 
Quinit were engaged, but Rodrigo's parents were strongly opposed to their 
marriage"; that "from April 27, 1955", plaintiff "and Rodrigo lived as husband 
and wife in the house of Adolfo Dagawan located at Colorado Falls, Tuba, 
Mountain Province, until May 9 when Rodrigo left and kever returned"; that "both 
were from the same town of Sison, Pangasinan, and their love relations started 
in the year 1953, the two having exchanged a long series of love letters since 
then until they separated", and that "at the time when they went to Colorado 
Falls, both were of age."</p>
<p>The evidence on other pertinent facts is, however, conflicting. In the 
language of the decision appealed from, plaintiff—also referred to therein as 
appellee—tried to prove</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * that Rodrigo courted her in 1953 and they, thereafter, became engaged, 
albeit Rodrigo's mother was opposed to their marriage; that on April 15, 1955 
Rodrigo and his father went to her house and her marriage with Rodrigo were 
arranged, with the concurrence of her mother, appellant Maximino Quinit having 
agreed to give dowry and to defray the expenses of the marriage, with the 
exception of the wedding dress of appellee; that they agreed to have the 
marriage celebrated in Baguio, for which reason on April 27, 1955, appellee, 
Rodrigo and the latter's father left for Bagnio; that upon arriving at Colorado 
Falls, however, Maximino made them alight from the bus and took them to the 
house of Adolfo Dagawan with whom Maximino agreed that appellee and Rodrigo 
would stay in said house, Maximino to pay P5.00 daily for their lodging and 
P6.00 daily for their board; that Maximino further asked Dagawan to make all 
arrangements for their wedding in Baguio and to act as their sponsor; that after 
making these arrangements Maximino left, while appellee and Rodrigo remained in 
Dagawan's house where they lived as husband and wife until May 9; that on May 7, 
appellee and Rodrigo, accompanied by Dagawan, went to Baguio to secure a 
marriage license but failed because Rodrigo did not have a residence 
certificate, although both prospective contracting parties signed the 
corresponding application; that on May 9, on the pretext that he was going to 
their hometown to get his residence certificate, Rodrigo left Colorado Falls and 
never returned; that when appellee returned to their hometown (Sison, 
Pangasinan), she found out that Rodrigo's parents had spirited him away because, 
in their opinion, appellee's reputation was unsavory."</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon the other hand, the defendants sought to establish that Rodrigo and 
plaintiff</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * were engaged; that Rodrigo's parents were opposed to their marriage; 
that while Rodrigo was agreeable to marrying appellee, he wanted the marriage 
to take place after his graduation, while appellee was impatient and wanted the 
marriage to be held at an earlier date; that on April 26, 1955, in view of 
Rodrigo's continued relations with appellee, his parents told him to leave the 
parental home, for which reason on that date he left their house with his 
belongings and some gantas of rice; that before leaving their hometown he passed 
by the house of appellee and told her what had happened and further told her 
that he was intending to go to Manila to look for a job; that appellee convinced 
him to go, instead, to Colorado Falls where they could discuss their plans and 
so there he went—followed later by appellee—both staying at the house of 
Dagawan; that because Rodrigo persistently refused to marry appellee, the 
tetter's relatives, accompanied by policemen and constabulary soldiers, arrived 
at the place and tried to intimidate him; that in view of his continued refusal 
they brought him down to Sison where he was allowed to go home; that thereupon 
his parents placed him under the custody of Mayor Madriaga of the neighborinjr 
town of Rosario where he stayed from May 1, to June, 1955; that sometime during 
the month of June, Adolfo Dagawan sought Rodrigo on the pretext that he was 
going to tell him something important and was able to lure him to a secluded 
place where he was made to sign an application for a marriage license; that 
because of his nonappearance before a notary public, the latter refused to 
acknowledge the application.</p>
<p>"With respect to Maximino Quinit the evidence for appellants tends to show 
that he had never agreed to have his son marry appellee nor to give a dowry to 
the latter; that he did not go with appellee and Rodrigo to Colorado Falls and 
that he did not concoct, much less carry out any plan to have his son satisfy 
his lust and then get rid of appellee."</p></blockquote>
<p>The court of first instance sustained plaintiff's pretense, but the Court of 
Appeals considered her evidence unworthy of credence, and, hence, absolved 
Maximino Quinit. Plaintiff maintains that the Court of Appeals had erred in the 
appreciation of the evidence, but the findings of said Court on the credibility 
of said evidence are beyond our power of review on appeal by certiorari and, 
consequently, conclusive upon us.</p>
<p>It is next urged that said Court had also erred in not awarding moral damages 
to plaintiff, who insists that moral damages for breach of promise to marry are 
collectible under our laws, but this question has already been settled adversely 
to plaintiff's pretense in Hermosisima vs. Court of Appeals, 109 Phil., 629; 60 
Off. Gaz., (13) 1846.</p>
<p>The appealed decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby affirmed, therefore, 
without special pronouncement as to costs. It is so ordered.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L.,
