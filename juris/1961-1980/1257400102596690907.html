				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This &nbsp;is &nbsp;an &nbsp;appeal from the order of the Court &nbsp;of First Instance of Negros &nbsp;Oriental dated October 29, 1958, dismissing plaintiffs' &nbsp;complaint &nbsp;for lack of jurisdiction. The &nbsp;complaint was filed September 17, 1958, &nbsp;alleging that plaintiffs were permanent, year-round employees of defendants by virtue of agreements entered into between them and that, in violation of said agreements defendants dismissed &nbsp;the plaintiffs from their employment. &nbsp;It was prayed &nbsp;that a writ of preliminary mandatory &nbsp;injunction be &nbsp;issued &nbsp; for immediate reinstatement; and &nbsp;after trial that the &nbsp;dismissals be declared illegal and &nbsp;plaintiffs awarded moral damages and attorney's fees. <p>'In their answer defendants &nbsp;alleged that they had no agreement with plaintiffs with respect to the duration of employment and justified the &nbsp;dismissals on &nbsp;the ground that defendants &nbsp;had entered with the United &nbsp;Central and Cellulose Labor &nbsp;Association &nbsp;(UCCLA- PLUM), &nbsp;the &nbsp;exclusive bargaining representative designated by the C.I.R., into a collective bargaining agreement containing a closed-shop clause, &nbsp;with &nbsp;which &nbsp;defendants, at &nbsp; the instance of the UCCLA, &nbsp;asked plaintiffs to comply, &nbsp;but that plaintiffs failed to do &nbsp;so, &nbsp;whereupon defendants considered &nbsp;them separated from employment as of &nbsp; September 15, 1958.</p> <p>In the order &nbsp;appealed &nbsp;from &nbsp;the court declared &nbsp;itself without jurisdiction because plaintiffs' claim for reinstatement was closely interwoven with a question &nbsp;of unfair Labor practice.</p> <p>Plaintiffs &nbsp;now maintain &nbsp;that the &nbsp;lower &nbsp;court erred (1) &nbsp;in holding that it had &nbsp;no jurisdiction over &nbsp;the case; (2) &nbsp;in taking into consideration &nbsp; defendants' answer in determining jurisdiction; and (3) in dismissing the &nbsp;case without defendants' having filed &nbsp;a motion to &nbsp;dismiss. </p> <p>Appellants &nbsp;designate their action &nbsp;as one for "specific performance &nbsp;with &nbsp; damages &nbsp;and &nbsp;preliminary mandatory injunction." &nbsp;This &nbsp;description, however, is not necessarily conclusive as &nbsp;to &nbsp;the nature of &nbsp;the action. &nbsp;In &nbsp;the complaint, after &nbsp;alleging the conditions of their employment, appellants state the &nbsp;manner of &nbsp;their dismissal, thus:</p> <blockquote> <p>"That, predicating their action on the notices to &nbsp;the plaintiffs, copies of &nbsp;which are hereto attached as &nbsp;Annexes A to A-8, which notices are not based on any &nbsp; of the causes specifically provided by law for dismissal of employees and violate their contractual obligations with the plaintiffs, &nbsp;the defendants have &nbsp;dismissed the herein &nbsp; plaintiffs from employment &nbsp;with them &nbsp;as shown &nbsp;in &nbsp;the letters, copies of which are hereto attached as &nbsp;annexes B &nbsp;to B-8 and made integral &nbsp;parts hereof." (par. 4, &nbsp;complaint) </p> </blockquote> <p>The above-mentioned &nbsp;annexes &nbsp;&nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;complaint &nbsp;are deemed part &nbsp;thereof and should &nbsp;be &nbsp;considered together with the formal allegations therein<sup><font color="#ff0000">[1]</font></sup> in order &nbsp;to &nbsp;arrive at correct conclusion &nbsp;as to the nature &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;action. Annexes &nbsp;A &nbsp;to &nbsp;A-8 &nbsp;are individual letters &nbsp;dated August 11, 1958, sent by appellee Compañia Celulosa de Filipinas to appellants, informing them that on April 12, 1958 said company and the UCCLA entered &nbsp;into &nbsp;a collective bargaining agreement, one of the terms of which was that those employees who &nbsp;were not yet members of the union should &nbsp;be required to become members &nbsp;15 days from the signing of the agreement, and should continue &nbsp;to be so as &nbsp;a condition of their continued employment; &nbsp;that the UCCLA &nbsp;had formally demanded from the company that appellants, who were not members &nbsp;of said union, comply with said provision within 30 &nbsp;days &nbsp;from notice; and that if appellants failed to register within said period, without the UCCLA &nbsp;having &nbsp;withdrawn its &nbsp;demands with respect to &nbsp; them, the company would &nbsp;be constrained to &nbsp;consider them separated from the service. &nbsp;Annexes B &nbsp;to &nbsp;B-8 are individual letters to &nbsp;appellants, informing them that since they failed &nbsp;to &nbsp;affiliate &nbsp;themselves with &nbsp;the &nbsp;UCCLA, and the latter &nbsp;had &nbsp;demanded &nbsp;prompt implementation of &nbsp;the closed-shop &nbsp;agreement, they were considered dismissed as of that date.</p> <p>In &nbsp;effect, therefore, the complaint avers that appellants were employees of appellees, &nbsp; and that upon &nbsp;their failure to become members of the UCCLA as required by appellees, the latter dismissed them. &nbsp;&nbsp;This &nbsp;is a clear statement of an unfair labor practice committed by the employers,<sup><font color="#ff0000">[2]</font></sup> cognizance of which, there being in the petition &nbsp;a prayer for reinstatement, as in this case, &nbsp;is given &nbsp;to the Court of Industrial &nbsp;Relations.<sup><font color="#ff0000">[3]</font></sup></p> <p>Appellants insist that what they &nbsp;seek is not &nbsp;the prosecution &nbsp;of an &nbsp;unfair &nbsp;labor practice &nbsp;but the &nbsp;specific &nbsp;performance of &nbsp;their &nbsp;contracts of employment &nbsp;which had been violated by the unwarranted dismissals. &nbsp;Be that as it may, the &nbsp;alleged &nbsp;manner &nbsp;in which &nbsp;the &nbsp;employment contracts were breached, as described by appellants themselves, placed the case outside the &nbsp;jurisdiction of &nbsp;the lower court.</p> <p>A &nbsp;contract of &nbsp;employment &nbsp;&nbsp;may &nbsp;&nbsp;be &nbsp;violated &nbsp;by &nbsp; the employer &nbsp;by unjustifiably dismissing &nbsp;the &nbsp;employee, &nbsp;in which case &nbsp;the general law of contracts applies, and the action to compel the employer to reinstate the employee is &nbsp;cognizable &nbsp;by &nbsp;the court &nbsp;of first instance. &nbsp;However, if &nbsp;the dismissal is discriminatory—though also a breach of &nbsp;a private contract ordinarily remediable by rescission or &nbsp;reinstatement by way &nbsp;of &nbsp;specific performance—it constitutes a violation of a public right which the &nbsp;law specifically protects, and &nbsp;for the &nbsp;redress of which a specific procedure &nbsp;in a designated court, i.e., &nbsp;the &nbsp; Industrial &nbsp;Court must &nbsp;be &nbsp;followed.<sup><font color="#ff0000">[4]</font></sup></p> <p>Upon finding that it has no jurisdiction &nbsp;over the case, the lower court correctly &nbsp; dismissed it, even though &nbsp;appellees had &nbsp;not moved &nbsp;for &nbsp;dismissal.<sup><font color="#ff0000">[5]</font></sup></p> <p>Wherefore, the &nbsp;order appealed &nbsp;from is &nbsp;affirmed, with costs &nbsp;against &nbsp; appellants.</p> <p><i>Bengzon, C. &nbsp;J., Padilla, Bautista &nbsp;Angelo, &nbsp;Concepcion, Barrera, Paredes, &nbsp; Dizon</i> and <i>Regala, JJ.,</i> concur.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup><font color="#ff0000">[1]</font></sup> The &nbsp;copy &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;lease &nbsp;attached &nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;pleadings &nbsp;under &nbsp;the modern &nbsp;rules &nbsp;of practice, became &nbsp;a part of the declaration &nbsp;of the &nbsp;petition, and both are construed together in &nbsp;determining &nbsp;the sufficiency of the statement or averments of &nbsp;the cause &nbsp;of action; (Cox <i>&nbsp;vs.</i> Sinclair Gulf &nbsp;Oil &nbsp;Co., &nbsp;265 SW 196; &nbsp; Warren &nbsp;<i>vs.</i> &nbsp;La Jomales, et al. <i>vs. </i>&nbsp;Central Azucarera &nbsp;de Bais, &nbsp;et al. &nbsp;<p></p> <p>The petition and the document annexed are construed together, and error in the petition as to interest was amended by reference to the contract of lease annexed. &nbsp;Vincent <i>vs.</i> Frelich, 23 S 373. </p> <p>It has been &nbsp;repeatedly held by &nbsp;this and other courts that the mere reference to &nbsp;a &nbsp;contract in a &nbsp;pleading &nbsp;does not make that contract a part of the pleading, unless a copy of it is annexed.
