proceeding against the then Acting Minister of Labor <span class="SpellE">Amado</span>
G. <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span> as principal respondent<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
is the alleged denial of procedural due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As alleged in the petition:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The records of the case will bear fact
that the defendant in NLRC Case No. RB-IV-6421-76 herein petitioner was
deprived of its day in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Honorable Labor Arbiter had violated the rights of the petitioner to the due
process of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case, a decision
was rendered in favor <span style="">of </span>one
Fernando Santos, without the latter having submitted any position paper,
document, or presented any witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This decision is without any factual and legal basis."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The Labor Arbiter, then, so it was contended, "should have required
Fernando Santos to present its evidence so the petitioner could fully prepare
for its defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, the Honorable
Labor Arbiter opined that he should be reinstated and given its pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of these were done despite the timely
objections of petitioner's counsel and a motion to dismiss the case for lack of
interest and non-appearance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this
manner the petitioner was deprived of its right to due process because it was
not able to present its evidence and cross-examine Fernando Santos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision in favor of Fernando Santos
actually came as a surprise for one cannot help but wonder where the Honorable
Arbiter adduced its evidence in favor of Fernando Santos."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
When, subsequently, such decision was affirmed by respondent National Labor
Relations Commission, as well as respondent Acting Minister of Labor <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span>, this petition was filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court in a resolution of <st1:date year="1979" day="2" month="2">February 2, 1979</st1:date> required respondents to comment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The then Acting Solicitor General Vicente V.
Mendoza, complying with the above resolution, submitted the Comment considered
as the answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The point raised was
squarely met in these words:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"There
is no merit to this contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To begin
with, it is not true as claimed by petitioner that private respondent Fernando
Santos did not adduce any evidence by reason of which, it (petitioner) was not
able to present its evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record
readily shows that Fernando Santos submitted to respondent labor arbiter at the
scheduled hearing of the case on October 5, 1976, his affidavit with several
annexes * * * refuting the charges imputed to him by petitioner which affidavit
and its annexes, doubtless, constitute the evidence for said private
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner in turn submitted
at an earlier date its position paper along with several papers or documents as
annexes * * * which it obviously intended as its evidence in the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming, however, for the sake of argument
that respondent Fernando Santos did not present any evidence, this by no means
renders the decision of respondent labor arbiter directing the reinstatement of
said private respondent without basis as erroneously contended by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted that the reinstatement of
Fernando Santos is but a consequence of the denial of petitioner's application
for clearance to terminate private respondents' employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that petitioner failed to
substantiate its application in question or to otherwise establish the,
existence of a legal or justifiable cause to terminate said respondents' employment,
perforce, the latter is entitled to reinstatement regardless of whether or not
he presented any evidence."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The matter was pursued further in the Comment thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Petitioner furthermore may not, simply
on the ground that Fernando Santos allegedly did not present any evidence,
validly complain that it was not able to present its evidence and thereby, was
deprived of its right to due process.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The presentation of petitioner's evidence certainly was not in any way
dependent on the presentation of Fernando Santos' evidence and the former could
have doubtless easily presented its evidence on the various occasions that the
case was scheduled for hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since
petitioner had undeniably ample opportunity to present its evidence, it has
only itself to blame if it allegedly was not able to present its
evidence."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Nor did the Comment stop there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Neither is petitioner's right to due process in the least impaired
by its alleged inability to cross-examine respondent Fernando Santos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that petitioner had ample
opportunity to cross-examine said private respondent - first, when the latter
submitted his affidavit and the annexes thereof, to respondent labor arbiter on
October 5, 1976, and at least on two occasions thereafter - at the scheduled
hearing of the case on December 9, 1976, and on January 11, 1977, at which both
contending parties were present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since
it did not avail of this opportunity, petitioner must be deemed to have waived
any right to cross-examine Fernando Santos."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">How the due process question arose may be discerned from the
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondents Jesus
Valdez and Fernando Santos filed a complaint with the then Department of Labor
charging petitioner corporation with illegal dismissal.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
On <st1:date year="1977" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1977</st1:date>, the
Labor Arbiter rendered a decision reinstating them.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
There was an appeal by petitioner to the National Labor Relations Commission
which on <st1:date year="1977" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1977</st1:date>
sustained the Labor Arbiter.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner on <st1:date year="1978" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1978</st1:date>
elevated the matter to the Office of the Minister of Labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It contended anew that it was denied due
process, but the same adverse fate was in store.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Respondent Acting Minister of Labor

There was a motion for reconsideration, but to no avail.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This petition, as mentioned at the outset, lacks merit.</p>

<blockquote>1. The vigor with which <span style="">counsel
</span>for petitioner pressed the claim that there was a denial of procedural
due process is inversely proportional to the merit of this <i>certiorari</i>
and prohibition suit as is quite evident from the Comment of the office of the
Solicitor General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is undoubted that
the due process mandate must be satisfied by an administrative tribunal or
agency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it was announced by Justice
Laurel in the landmark case of <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Tibay</span> v. Court of Industrial Relations.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
That is still good law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It follows,
therefore, that if procedural due process were in fact denied, then this
petition must prosper.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
It is equally well-settled, however, that the standard of due process that must
be met in proceedings before administrative tribunals allows a certain latitude
as long as the element of fairness is not ignored.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So the following recent cases have uniformly held:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Maglasang</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Ople</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>

From the Comment of the office of the Solicitor General, it is quite clear that
no imputation of arbitrariness can be justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The opportunity to present its side of the
case was given both parties to the controversy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If, for reasons best known to itself, petitioner did not avail of its
right to do so, then it has only itself to blame.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No constitutional infirmity could then be
imputed to the proceeding before the labor arbiter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. There is another consideration that equally militates strongly
against the stand of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
quite apparent from each petition that the alleged denial of due process by the
labor arbiter was ventilated before the National Labor Relations Commission as
well as respondent Acting Minister of Labor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would follow, therefore, that in the light of the <span class="SpellE">Maglasang</span>,
Jacqueline Industries and <span class="SpellE">Montemayor</span> pronouncements,
whatever deficiency there might have been, even on the assumption that there
was any, the matter was cured by the appeals taken not only to the National
Labor Relations Commission, an adminis­trative agency of a higher rank, but to
respondent Acting Minister of Labor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence the futility of the claim that there was a denial of procedural
due process.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. Nor did the Solicitor General ignore the facts to show that no
arbitrariness was committed when public respondents ruled as they did.
Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Finally, petitioner contends
that respondent labor arbiter erred in declaring that it has no justifiable or legal
cause in terminating the services of private respondents allegedly due to the
dismissal of the criminal complaint which it filed against them (private
respondents).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner maintains that
notwithstanding the dismissal of said criminal complaint, it can still validly
dismiss private respondents 'for lack of confidence, misconduct, and other
justifiable causes.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contention is
untenable and evidently arises from a distorted appraisal or understanding of the
decision of respondent labor arbiter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
perusal of the questioned decision clearly shows that no such ruling or
conclusion was ever made by respondent labor arbiter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dismissal of said criminal complaint was
merely taken by him into account as part of the evidence exposing 'the
methodical pattern adopted by herein petitioner 'in seeking the termination' of
private respondents' 'services at all cost(s).'<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If petitioner's application for termination of private respondents'
employment was denied (as it was in fact denied), it was mainly due to the fact
that it failed to present any evidence to substantiate its charges, not to
mention that the same were already settled in Case No. RO4-2-1872-76 wherein
petitioner first sought to terminate private respondents' employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to state, we may even go along with
petitioner in its claim to the effect that an employer has still the right to
dismiss an employee for 'lack of confidence, misconduct, and other justifiable
causes even if the criminal case filed against the employee did not prosper.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, certainly, before any such dismissal may
be ordered by competent authorities, sufficient evidence proving the grounds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> has to be presented without which, the employer's
application for termination of employment necessarily has to be dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, except for the aforesaid
<span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copy of a letter of one Thomas Wisniewski,
dated <st1:date year="1979" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1979</st1:date>, which
is naturally hearsay evidence, petitioner herein failed to present any
evidence, to substantiate his charges against private respondents embodied in
the two (2) memoranda of its president dated <st1:date year="1979" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1979</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, respondent public officials committed no error in denying
petitioner's application for clearance to terminate private respondents'
employment."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">AQUINO, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">I dissent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition is
meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record discloses
sufficient grounds for the dismissal of Jesus R. Valdez and Fernando C. Santos
which were overlooked by the public respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city> worked for the
Gas Corporation of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(Gascor) as a supervisor in its engineering department with a basic salary of
P600 a month while <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> was
employed by Gascor as a draftsman-designer with a basic monthly salary of P400.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 11, 1976 Gascor's vice-president suspended Valdez and
Santos "for an indefinite period effective February 12, 1976, pending
clearance from the National Labor Relations Commission", for "alleged
violation of the Company Regulations and Employees' Rules of Conduct Regarding
Negligence and Breach of Security".</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city> and <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
assailed the suspension order by filing with Labor Regional Office No. <span class="GramE">IV a complaint against Gascor for illegal suspension.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was settled in its conciliation
stage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gascor's vice-president made a
manifestation dated <st1:date year="1976" day="24" month="2">February 24, 1976</st1:date>
reinstating <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> and <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city>
<span style="">effective </span><st1:date year="1976" day="18" month="2"><span style="">February 18, 1976</span></st1:date><span style=""> but "to be reassigned to positions
commensurate with their qualifications and experience without loss of salary,
demotion in rank and seniority".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">That settlement was short-lived.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the following day, February 25, Gascor's president charged <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city>
and <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> with having hijacked
(stolen) an order for a contract of work intended for Gascor and with having
violated company policies and regulations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were suspended effective <st1:date year="1976" day="26" month="2">February
 26, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On that date,
Gascor filed with the Ministry of Labor an application for clearance to
terminate the employment of Valdez and Santos.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing before the Labor Arbiter, Gascor offered in
evidence a letter received on March 5, 1976 by Gascor's president from Thomas
F. Wisniowski, the managing director of the Hospitality Operations System and
Technical Services, Inc., informing him of the participation of Valdez and
Santos "in giving all projects of the company to the competitors"
(Annex I of Gascor's position paper, p. 3 of Appeal to NLRC).</p>

<p class="BODY">Also submitted as evidence by Gascor was a check for P9<span class="GramE">,075</span> issued on <st1:date year="1976" day="26" month="1">January
 26, 1976</st1:date> by the Magellan Hotel to Ibayan Fri-Air Service,
requesting the 50% down payment for the fabrication and repair of kitchen
equipment inclusive of crating and delivery charges to the pier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That check was allegedly received by <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
(Annex J of Gascor's position paper).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">However, Gascor's
complaint against </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Santos</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> and </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Valdez</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> for revelation of industrial Secrets was
dismissed by the provincial fiscal of Rizal in his resolution of </span><st1:date year="1976" day="30" month="6"><span style="">June 30,
 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under these facts, I am of the opinion that clearance should have
been given for the dismissal of <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
and <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Alternatively, I believe that the backpay should be limited to <u>two
years</u> in case <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city> and <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
should be reinstated.</p>
