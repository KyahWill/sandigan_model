  <blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"1.
On or about March, 1958, the Republic of the Philippines filed a suit
against the Sta. Cruz limber Co., alleging, among other things, that
the Sta. <span class="SpellE">Cruz</span> Timber Co. 'is a domestic corporation and may be served with summons through its President, Alfonso L. Felix, residing at 73 <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Boulevard, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City/ Pursuant to this complaint, summons was issued against the Sta. Cruz Timber Co. and on March 29, 1958, the Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City filed a return to the effect that it had served summons and complaint upon de<span class="SpellE">fendant</span> Sta. Cruz Timber Co., thru its President Alfonso L. Felix, at 73 <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, by leaving said copies to Montano <span class="SpellE">Renato</span>, re<span class="SpellE">ceiving</span> clerk of the said Sta. Cruz Timber Co.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">2.
In connection with this return, it is respectfully averred, under oath,
'hat Alfonso Felix was not the President of the Sta. Cruz Tim<span class="SpellE">ber</span> </span><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Co.</span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> on the date appearing on the Sheriff's return, </span><st1:date year="1958" day="29" month="3"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 29, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. The truth of the matter is that, as shown by plaintiff's own <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
O, Alfonso Felix had ceased to be President and Director of Sta. Cruz
Timber Co. on April, 1949. As a matter of fact, plaintiff has
introduced evidence (See <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. G) <span class="GramE">showing</span> that as of February, 1950, it was one Mr. Martinet who was acting as President of the Sta. Cruz Timber Co.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">3. It is further averred, <em>likewise under oath,</em> that Atty. Alfonso Felix, Jr. has never resided at </span><st1:address><st1:street><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">No. 73 <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Boulevard</span></st1:street><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, </span><st1:city><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Quezon</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> City</span></st1:city></st1:address><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, either on </span><st1:date year="1958" day="29" month="3"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 29, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">
or on any other date. The truth of the matter is that Atty. Alfonso
Felix is a resident of 105 West Riverside, San Francisco del Monte, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, as can be seen from the summons dated July 17, 1958 issued by
this Court in connection with the service of the third-party complaint;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">4.
It is further averred, again under oath, that the copy allegedly
received on behalf of the Sta. Cruz Timber Co. was never received by
Atty. Felix or supplied to <span class="SpellE">him</span>; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">5. Finally, it is averred, also <span style="font-style: italic;">under oath</span>, that Mr. Montano <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> is not an employee of the Sta. Cruz Timber Co. much less an agent or director of the same. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">6. In view of the foregoing, we respectfully submit that there h<span class="SpellE">as</span>
been no service of summons upon defendant Sta. Cruz Timber Co.
Consequently, the Order of this Court declaring the Sta. Cruz Timber
Co. in default, which was based on the erroneous <span class="SpellE">assump</span><span class="SpellE">tion</span> of service, should be set aside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">* * * *<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date year="1959" day="12" month="9"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 12, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the lower court, issued the following—<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">* * * * *<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It
appearing that Alfonso Felix was no longer the President of defendant
Sta. Cruz Timber Co. since 1949, or long before the service of summons
and copy of the complaint was affected and that Montano <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> is not one of the persons who can receive summons and a copy of complaint <span class="SpellE">on</span> behalf of the defendant corporation and there being no objection interposed on behalf of plaintiff, the Court hereby <span class="SpellE">sets</span>
aside its order declaring Sta. Cruz Timber Co. in default and hereby
grants said defendant a period of ten days within which to file its
answer."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">the</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> motion for reconsideration presented by <span class="SpellE">plaintiff</span> of the above order, stating that the same was not supported by evidence, and not in accordance with law, since the <span class="SpellE">plaintiff</span>
was not given a chance to oppose or answer said motion, as provided for
by the rules, was denied. Plaintiff brought the matter to this Court on
Petition for <span class="SpellE">Certiorari</span> and Mandamus with Preliminary <span class="SpellE">Injuction</span>, alleging that the respondent Court, in considering the Motion of September 10, 1959, (supra), and <span class="SpellE">thereatfter</span>
setting aside the Order of Default almost one (1) year after the
issuance thereof, and in denying the motion for reconsideration, acted
without jurisdiction or in excess thereof, or with grave abuse of
discretion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This
Court gave due course to the petition. In the Answer, after the usual
admissions and denials, respondents pointed out that respondent Court
had the authority and jurisdiction to lift the Order of default, after
it was informed of the circumstances leading to the failure of
respondent Sta. Cruz Timber to file an Answer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It
would seem that the pivotal issue presented by the pleadings is whether
or not the respondent Court had still the power and authority to act on
the Order of Default, since the motion to set aside the same was
presented outside the period provided for in the Rules.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">There
is no question that the respondent Court had jurisdiction over the
complaint for forfeiture of bond. The Orders lifting the default and
denying the motion for reconsideration were issued in the exercise of
such jurisdiction. The Order of default was lifted, only after the
Court had found the true facts which caused the failure of the
respondent Sta. Cruz Timber Company to present its Answer. The main
case is still in the stage of hearing and after assuring itself that
there was no summons validly served upon respondent Timber Company,
respondent Court was of the opinion that permitting it to refute or
answer the allegations in the complaint, would be giving the said
company a day in court. We find no abuse of discretion, in the above
actuation of respondent Judge. Even if we assume, for purposes of
argument, that the conclusions reached by respondent Judge were
Erroneous, still it is a truism that not all errors of law or of fact,
constitute grave abuse of discretion. Furthermore, even if we concede
that the order lifting the order of default was irregular (it is
claimed that the three day notice was not observed), <span class="SpellE">etill</span> certiorari or mandamus is not the proper remedy, since judicial errors or mistakes of law are proper subjects of appeal (Villa <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> Transit, Inc. <i>vs</i>. </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Bello</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, et al., G. R. No. L-18957, </span><st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="4"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 23, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, and cases cited therein.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The
record is clear that there was no valid service of summons effected,
since the person the complaint had cited as one to whom summons could
be served, was no longer connected with the Timber <span class="SpellE">Company</span> in that capacity. This fact was known to plaintiff, for long before the filing of the complaint, it had <span class="SpellE">been</span> dealing already with Atty. de <span class="SpellE">las</span> Alas on matters having to do with respondent Timber Company. No satisfactory explanation <span class="SpellE">or</span>
refutation appears on record, why plaintiff, in spite of its knowledge
of such fact (that Atty. Felix, Jr., was no longer the President)<span class="GramE">,</span>
it caused the summons to be served upon him. The rules provide that "If
the defendant 13 a corporation formed under the law of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">
* * *, service may be made on the president, manager, secretary,
cashier, agent, or any of its directors" (Sec. 13, Rule 7). Atty. Felix
was not then anyone of those mentioned, and the person (Montano <span class="SpellE">Renato</span>) who allegedly received the summons did not at all occupy any position in the corporation. </span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Under the facts obtaining in the case, and as <span class="SpellE">found</span>
by the respondent Court, We are of the opinion that said court was
correct in lifting the Order of default and denying the motion to set
the same aside. Verily, the trial court had not acquired jurisdiction
over the respondent Sta. Cruz Timber Company.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Wherefore, the Writ is denied, for lack of merits. The Orders lifting the Default and denying the motion for <span class="GramE">reconsideration,</span> are affirmed. No pronouncement as to costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
