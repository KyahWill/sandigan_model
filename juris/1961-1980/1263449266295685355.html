<p class="BODY">Madrigal Shipping Co., Inc. and <span class="SpellE">Cesario</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sipaco</span> appealed to this Court on purely legal <span style="">issues </span>which
are:</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to the
preference of credits among the claimants, should the Spanish Civil Code of
1889 or the New Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(Republic Act 386) be applied?</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the proper law,
who among the claimants enjoys preference?</p>

<p class="BODY">All the claims against the goods in question matured and became
demandable prior to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the Ci­vil
Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the law pre­vailing at the
time, that <span style="">is,
</span>the Spanish <span style="">Civil </span>Code of <span class="GramE">1889,</span> should govern the
preference of credits.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is contended that the claim of the Collector of Internal
Revenue for sales taxes on the goods in question is not preferred because (1)
the <span class="SpellE">Khoongs</span> were not the per­sons <span style="">liable </span>for the sales taxes thereon for
they were not the importer of said goods,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
not to mention that the tax lien does not follow the goods into the hands of a
third party who has no knowledge of the outstanding tax liabi<span style="">lity,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and (2) </span>a surety bond has been posted
to answer for the tax liability.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">theory of
non-liability of the <span class="SpellE">Khoongs</span> for the sales taxes on
the surplus goods in question for the rea­son </span>that <span style="">they were not the importer thereof will not hold,
considering that the <span class="SpellE">Khoongs</span> assumed <span style="">liability </span>for said taxes.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> This assumption of liability on the part of
the <span class="SpellE">Khoongs</span> is understandable and must have been made
with good reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Khoongs</span> are the 90% owner of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>
Sup­ply Corporation, the original importer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a matter of fact, they have considered themselves as the original pur­chasers
of the surplus goods from the U.S. Foreign Liquidation Commission as can be
seen from their statements, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, we have rights, title and in­terests over the
following properties which <span style="">we - </span>through
the <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> Supply Corporation bought from the Foreign
Liquidation Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

and later unloaded at the port of Manila, x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style="">."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As to the argument of
non-existence of the tax lien, it is observed that Article 1922 of the Spanish
Civil Code of </span>1889 <span style="">does not
provide for taxes as preferred cre­dits or <span style="">liens.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Sec. 315 of the </span>National
<span style="">Internal Reve­nue Code however states:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><span style="">"SEC.
</span>315.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Nature
and extent of tax lien</u>.</span> - Every internal-revenue tax on pro­<span style="">perty </span>or on any business or
occupation, and every tax on resources and receipts, and any increment to any
of them incident to delinquency, shall constitute a lien supe­rior to all other
charges or liens not on­ly on the property itself upon which such tax may be
imposed but also upon the pro<span style="">perty used
in any business or occupation upon which the tax is imposed and upon all proper­ty
rights therein."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Accordingly, the lien for sales taxes on
the surplus goods has attached from the moment they were due and shall continue
to exist in accordance with law.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Section 315 of the Tax Code, the pertinent law, limits to five years the
duration of the lien for estate and gift taxes, but re­mains silent with
respect to all other internal revenue taxes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the lien as to all those other tax­es continues until
there is payment or the lapse of the pe­riod within which the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue may assess and collect them pursuant to Sections <span style="">331 </span>to 333 of the Tax Code, whichever
comes earlier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged disso­lution
of the lien by reason of the filing of a surety bond to answer for the payment
of taxes due, finds no sup­port in the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Madrigal Shipping Co., Inc. maintains further that the claim of
the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> Workers Union in the amount of P5,073.00
representing stevedoring wages in loading the surplus goods in question aboard
SS "<span class="SpellE">Lepus</span>" is not pre­ferred under Article
1922 of the Spanish Civil Code of <span style="">1889 </span>nor
under Article 2241 of the Civil Code of the Phi­lippines; and that claims for
laborers' wages mentioned in paragraph <span style="">(6)
</span>of Article <span style="">2241 </span>of the
Civil Code of the Philippines refer to labor in productive industrial enti­ties
and not to stevedoring.</p>

<p class="BODY">As <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, the Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
does not apply herein and so <span class="GramE">We</span> shall confine the
inquiry to the Spanish Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 1922 of the Spanish Civil Code fails to men­tion <span style="">claims </span>for laborers' wages as among
those given pre­ference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, the
proposition that stevedoring wages are not preferred has merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, paragraph <span style="">4 </span>of said article gives preference to credits for transportation
of goods and <u>expenditures for the carriage</u> and preservation thereof, under
which the stevedoring wages can be classified.</p>

<p class="BODY">Stevedoring refers to the <u>carriage of goods</u> from the
warehouse or pier to the holds of the vessel.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
It is a necessary operation in the transportation of goods by sea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the expenses incurred <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> in the form <span style="">of
wages are necessary expenditures in the carriage of the goods.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With respect to the claim
of the Philippine Ports Terminal for <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> and
storage fees which the lower court declared as preferred, <span class="GramE">We</span>
are convinced that it consti­</span>tutes <span style="">a
credit contemplated in paragraph </span>4 <span style="">of
Article </span>1922 <span style="">of the Civil Code
of </span>1889, <span style="">it being an expense for
the preservation of the goods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> and storage ser­vice was rendered by the
Philippine Ports Terminal after the surplus goods were unloaded at Pier 11 of
the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="">Port</span></st1:placetype><span style=""> of </span><st1:placename><span style="">Manila</span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style=""> preliminary </span><span style="">to their transfer to Nichols Air Base.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Without the </span><span style="">services </span><span style="">of the Philippine Ports Terminal, said goods
would have been left on the pier exposed to the ele­ments and pilferage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We now come to the </span><span style="">claim </span><span style="">of defendant-appellant <span class="SpellE">Cesario</span> <span class="SpellE">Sipaco</span> whose credit was not recognized by the trial court
as preferred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1948" day="2" month="9"><span style="">September
 2, 1948</span></st1:date><span style=""> the <span class="SpellE">Khoongs</span> sent <span class="SpellE">Cesario</span> <span class="SpellE">Sipaco</span> a letter-appointment</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> worded as fol­lows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
