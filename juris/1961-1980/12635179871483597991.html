cash balance of P7,404.89 in the possession of the administrator Vicente <span class="SpellE">Estorque</span> as of December 29, 1960.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 18, 1961 the court, after eliminating lot No. 330 because
it was already registered in the names of the two brothers, <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span>
and Vicente <span class="SpellE">Estorque</span>, issued an order for the
division and distribution of the rest of the estate, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"As far as legally possible the will of the testatrix should
be followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As noted above, the
testatrix has left only two heirs has been expressly bettered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(sic).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the old Civil Code then in force when the testatrix died she was
free to dispose or bequeath in favor of the legatees a portion not exceeding
one-third of her estate.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"To the legatee Salvador <span class="SpellE">Estorque</span>
the testatrix herein bequeathed five-sixth (5/6) of Lot No. 345, referred to in
paragraph (b) of the list given above.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since said Lot No. 345 contains an area of 135,438 square meters, the
testatrix, therefore, bequeathed to the legatee Salvador <span class="SpellE">Estorque</span>
a pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span> portion thereof equivalent in area to
112,865 square meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This manifestly
is in excess of what the law then allowed the testatrix to do without impairing
the <span class="SpellE">legitimes</span> of the heirs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Since the testatrix specified Lot No. 345 from which to get
the portion of her estate to be given as a legacy to her grandson Salvador <span class="SpellE">Estorque</span>, her last will would be fulfilled by assigning to
said legatee one third (1/3) of said Lot No. 345 or a pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span>
portion thereof equi­valent in area to 45,146 square meters to­gether with the
granary or storehouse standing thereon.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With this adjustment made pursuant to the order of this Court
of August 13, 1953, the legacies given to the two legatees named herein, as a
whole, no longer impair the <span class="SpellE">legitimes</span> reserved by the
law for the forced heirs.</blockquote>

decedent LUCIA CESAREA AGATON be divided, parti­tioned and distributed, as it

<blockquote>This proceeding is hereby declared closed and terminated."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Vicente <span class="SpellE">Estorque</span> and his son Salvador
moved to reconsider the adjudication thus made, assailing in particular the
division of Lot No. 345 into three equal parts instead of in accordance with
the will of the deceased, wherein 1/6 was bequeathed to Vicente and 5/6 to
Salvador.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion for reconsideration
was denied, and these two brought the case to us on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants contend that the division of said lot as made by the
testatrix in her will should not be disturbed; that the shares of her two sons <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> and Vicente consisted only of the short <span class="SpellE">legitime</span>, or 1/3 of the estate; and that the share willed
to Salvador was in the nature of a <span class="SpellE"><u>mejora</u></span>, did
not impair that short <span class="SpellE">legitime</span>, and was therefore
valid.</p>

<p class="BODY">The value of the properties left by the testatrix, as inventoried
by the commissioners appointed by the lower court, including the cash balance
of P7,404.89 and excluding lot 330 of the Dao cadastre, was P24,064.89.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of this amount, two-thirds corresponded to
the long <span class="SpellE">legitime</span>, or P16,043.24, of which one-half,
or P8,021.62, was available for betterment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The remaining one-third, or P8,021.62, was the freely disposable portion.</p>

<p class="BODY">There can be no dispute that the value of the properties willed
to the two grandchildren, Salvador and <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Estorque</span>, was more than the free portion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The share of Salvador alone, consisting of
5/6 of lot No. 345, had a value of P10,383.30.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That given to <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> was worth
P1,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants, however, contend
that insofar as the share of Salvador exceeded the free portion it was given in
concept of <span class="SpellE"><u>mejora</u></span> or betterment, pursuant to
the second paragraph of Article 808 of the Spanish Civil Code, which provides:</p>

<blockquote>ART. 808.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">legitime</span> of legitimate children and descendants consists of
two-thirds of the hereditary estate of the father and of the mother.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Nevertheless, the latter may dispose of one of the two-thirds form­ing
the <span class="SpellE">legitime</span> in order to apply it as a betterment to
their legitimate children or descendants.</blockquote>

<blockquote>They may freely dispose of the remaining third."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under the appellants' theory the disposition in favor of Salvador
<span class="SpellE">Estorque</span> is valid since it does not impair the strict
<span class="SpellE">legitime</span> of either of the testatrix' chil­dren.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question is, was the bequest to him a <span class="SpellE">mejora</span>?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ac­cording
to Article 828 of the same Code, "the bequest or legacy made by the
testator to one of the children or des­cendants shall not be considered a
betterment (<span class="SpellE">mejora</span>) ex­cept where the testator has
expressly declared that such is his will or when it cannot be included in the
free portion."</p>

<p class="BODY">The will of the deceased Lucia <span class="SpellE">Cesarea</span> <span class="SpellE">Agaton</span> is in the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> dialect
and the bequest to Salvador <span class="SpellE">Estorque</span> reads:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">kag</span> <span class="SpellE">ang</span> <span class="SpellE">nabilen</span> <span class="SpellE">nga</span>
lima ka <span class="SpellE">bahin</span> (5/6) <span class="SpellE">akon</span> <span class="SpellE">ginahatag</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">iya</span>
<span class="SpellE">panubli</span>-on <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">alila</span> <span class="SpellE">ko</span> <span class="SpellE">nga</span>
<span class="SpellE">apo</span> <span class="SpellE">nga</span> <span class="SpellE">si</span>
Salvador <span class="SpellE">Estorque</span>." The word "<span class="SpellE">panubli</span>," the appellants point out, is the nearest
equivalent in the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> dialect to the concept of <span class="SpellE"><u>mejora</u></span> or betterment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no denial of the assertion in the
brief for the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, Article 828, above-quoted, also
considers as <span class="SpellE"><u>mejora</u></span> such bequest or legacy to
a child or descendant as cannot be included in the free portion, as long, of
course, as the strict <span class="SpellE">legitime</span> of the compulsory
heirs is not impaired thereby.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> argue that since Salvador
<span class="SpellE">Estorque</span> is not himself a compulsory heir of the
testatrix, no <span class="SpellE"><u>mejora</u></span> could validly be given to
him, inasmuch as the <span class="SpellE"><u>mejora</u></span> is part of the
long <span class="SpellE">legitime</span>, which is destined exclusively for com­pulsory
heirs - the two sons, Vicente and <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> - in the
present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The language of Article
808 is that the parents "may dispose of one of the two-thirds forming the <span class="SpellE">legitime</span> in order to apply it as a betterment to their <span class="SpellE">legi­time</span> children <u>or descendants</u>." The
preponderant weight of authority is to the effect that a descendant who is not
a forced heir can be given a <span class="SpellE"><u>mejora</u></span>; for
example, a grandchild whose father still lives and is entitled to the <span class="SpellE">legitime</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Manresa</span>, Vol. VI, 7th ed., pp. 486-489; <span class="SpellE">Scaevola</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Codigo</span> Civil, <span class="SpellE">Tomo</span> 14, pp.

62-64; Decision of the Supreme Court of Spain, December 19, 1903).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said decision, after tracing the history
of Spanish legislation on the subject, particularly Law 18 of Toro, which
granted such right expressly, concludes that "there is no provision in the
Law of Bases or in the (Civil) Code which is contrary to what has been
traditionally followed, as would have been undoubtedly expressed were it really
intended to change or modify such important piece of legislation..."</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing considerations, as well as of the rule
that as far as legally possible the expressed desire of the testator must be
followed, the dispositions of her properties made by the deceased Lucia <span class="SpellE">Cesarea</span> <span class="SpellE">Agaton</span> in her will must
be upheld as valid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition to the
shares of the two compulsory heirs, as stated in the will, they are each
entitled to one-half of the other properties not disposed of therein, namely,
the four <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span> and the cash balance of P7,404.89.</p>
