<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>
had on <st1:date year="1955" day="28" month="6">June 28, 1955</st1:date>
previously sold for P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> the said two lots, in
her capacity as heir and devisee thereof, in favor of petitioners. When she
filed on August 10, 1956 a motion in the joint estate proceedings to sell a
part of the estate for the purpose of finally liquidating and settling the two
es­tates, the executor and other heirs filed an opposition alleging that
"a disposal of any of the properties ……. would be prejudicial to the
interest of the heir to whom said property have (sic) been assigned" and
that "(<span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>) has lost all her rights and
interest in the estate of the deceased due to the fact that she has already
sold all her shares and participation (therein). "<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The probate court nevertheless ordered on
October 4, 1956 the sale of some properties, preferably those mentioned in
paragraph XVIII of the testator’s will, referring to "some parcels of land
which are not mentioned in this will, but it is my wish that these lands be
divided in equal shares by nine (9) children - these of my children by the
first and second wife."</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, as recounted in our said decision, from Novem­ber 8,
1956 and thereafter, respondents Jose T. <span class="SpellE">Imbo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Concep­cion</span> <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>, administrator
and co-<span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> of the intestate estate of the
deceased Maria Pastor de <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>, and respondent Ma­riano
<span class="SpellE">Teves</span>, executor of the testate estate of the deceased
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>, embarked on a series of maneuvers to
disregard and nullify <span class="SpellE">Concepcion's</span> sale of the two
lots to petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First came an
aborted sale on December 21, 1956 of the same two lots to the ad­ministrator
Jose T. <span class="SpellE">Imbo</span>, with prior authority and immediate ap­proval
of the probate court, which was opposed at the time by <span class="SpellE">Con­cepcion</span>
"on the ground that such sale was made in bad faith, because the purchaser
knew that said lots were adjudicated by will to <span class="SpellE">Con­cepcion</span>
<span class="SpellE">Teves</span> as her share, with the conformity of all the
heirs, and the same were already sold to Dr. and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Habaña</span>,
for valid and sufficient consideration. "<span style="">&nbsp;

of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Concepcion</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE"> and petitioners, the sale to respondent-administrator.</span> Jose
T. <span class="SpellE">Imbo</span> was "rescinded" by the probate
court on <st1:date year="1957" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1957</st1:date>
upon the latter's own motion, thus discontinuing the appeal that had been
timely appealed by petitioners. But on <st1:date year="1958" day="19" month="3">March
 19, 1958</st1:date>, barely four months after said "rescission", the
executor filed another motion asking for the sale again of the same two lots
for the same price of P10<span class="GramE">,000</span>. 00, to be joined later
on Octo­ber 21, 1958, by respondent <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>, the very same heir and devisee who had already sold
the same to petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the probate
court on January 7, 1959 overruled anew the petitioners' opposition and granted
anew the motion to sell the same lots again, notwithstanding their having been
already sold to petitioners, the matter was elevated to this Court upon
petitioners' appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this Court's decision of <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1964</st1:date>, we upheld the valid­ity of the sale by <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Teves</span> of the two lots
in favor of peti­tioners:</p>

<blockquote>"The distribution made in the Will of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
is in accordance with article 1080 of the Civil Code, which provides that
'Should a person make a par­tition of his estate by an act inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span>, or by will, such partition shall be respected,
insofar as it does not prejudice the <span class="SpellE">legitime</span> of the
compulsory heirs. '<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no showing
that said distribution ever prejudiced the <span class="SpellE">legitime</span>
of the compulsory heirs herein, and <u>as a matter of fact all the heirs gave
their express conformity to the said distribution</u> (see joint manifestation,
supra).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was not even a vague
suggestion of unfairness with respect to the disposition of the <span class="SpellE">legitimes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE"><u>Teves</u></span><u> by
operation of law became the absolute owner said lots because ‘A partition
legally made confers upon each heir the exclusive ownership of the property
adjudicated to him</u>' (Article 1091, New Civil Code), from the death of her
ancestors, subject to rights and obligations of the latter, and, she can not be
deprived of her rights thereto except by the methods provided for by law x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><u>Concepcion</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">Teves</span> could as she did sell the lots in question as a

proposed partition of the properties especially when, as in the present case,
the sale has been <span class="SpellE">expresssly</span> recognized by herself
and her co-heirs; x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The

'question in favor of the appellants, Dr. and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Habaña</span>;
rather, they should comply with the lawful provisions of the Will of the
testator</u>, for it has been well provided that 'should a person make a
partition of his estate by an act inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span> or by
will (as in this case), such partition shall be respected, in so far as it does
not prejudice the <span class="SpellE">legitime</span> of the compulsory heirs'

court in the estate proceedings their motion for execution of Au­gust 19, 1964
for respondent court to direct respondents to deliver possession of the two
lots involved (the use and enjoyment of which had been denied them all these
years) and to issue other appropriate orders necessary for the transfer of the
title thereof in their favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Opposition
thereto was filed on September 10, 1964 by respondent Jose T. <span class="SpellE">Imbo</span> and his six brothers and sisters (all grandchildren of
the deceased <span class="SpellE">Teves</span> spouses, by their pre-deceased
daughter, Asun­cion <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>, <u>Supra</u>), invoking
the reservation clause in this Court's decision of 'any authorized party to
question the validity of the sale made by <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Teves</span> to appellants) herein (petitioners), in the proper
court," and questioning anew the validity of said sale on the ground that
the testator Pedro <span class="SpellE">Teves</span> could not dispose by will of
the said two lots entirely in favor of <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> as
the same per­tained to his conjugal partnership and estate with the deceased
Maria Pastor de <span class="SpellE">Teves</span> and that they had the right to
be subrogated to the rights of petitioners as strangers purchasers under
Article 1088 of the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
action on petitioners' motion was taken by the probate court.</p>

as well as by said Maria <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> de <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>,
filed under date of April 20, 1965 an entirely new and separate complaint
against petitioners and <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Teves</span> as defendants, likewise questioning anew the validity
of the sale of the same properties by <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Teves</span> to petitioners, invoking the same reservation clause
in this Court's decision, alleging that <span class="SpellE">Con­cepcion</span>
had surreptitiously and without notice to them executed the sale of June 28,
1955 in favor of petitioners, and praying the court to declare the sale null
and void and to grant them the preferential right to purchase the properties
for the same consideration of P10,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp;

of cause of action was denied by respondent court on June 8, 1965 as concerning
"mat­ters which could only be properly threshed out and resolved after the

<p class="BODY">As more than a year and a half had already intervened without
their motion for execution in the estate proceedings having been re­solved by
respondent court, petitioners moved anew on April 13, 1966 for the granting
thereof, but respondent court, two months later, issued its order of June 28,
1966, denying execution, "considering that the court is still conducting
further proceedings ….. as directed by the Supreme Court per its decision in
the appealed case ……. and in view of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, the present plea of petitioners, which
we find to be meritorious.</span></p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent court acted
with grave abuse of discretion and in excess of its jurisdiction in taking
cognizance of the new and se­parate complaint filed by respondent Jose T. <span class="SpellE">Imbo</span> and the six other grandchildren of the decedent
spouses and their other co-plaintiffs seeking anew to nullify the sale of the
two lots in question by <span class="SpellE">Con­cepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Teves</span> to petitioners notwithstanding that a re-litigation
of the same question is already barred by this Court's judgment of March 31,
1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There could be no/ such further
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, in upholding
the validity of the sale of the said lots to petitioners, remanded the case to
respondent court, with express instructions "to sell other <span class="SpellE">undisposed</span> or unencumbered properties of any of the heirs,
should there be any obligation of the estate still unpaid<span class="GramE">.
"</span></p>

<p class="BODY">We then found that the only unpaid obligation of the estate, per
information of the executor himself was an insignificant amount of P3, 186.40,
and that <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>,
"according to <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span> disclosure in the
records had paid her share<span class="GramE">. "</span> In the remote event
that the remaining considerable properties of the estate were not suf­ficient
to discharge its obligations, (and we noted that this was not the case), we
further indicated that a notation of a lien in favor of the estate on the
certificates of title of the two lots to guarantee that its obligations would
be met, to which notation petitioners had ex­pressed their conformity, would be
a feasible procedure to "expedite the delivery of said lots to
(petitioners)."</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court then <span class="SpellE">unequivocably</span> ruled
that "(T)he executor of the will and all other heirs of the late Pedro <span class="SpellE">Teves</span> should be pre­cluded from questioning the validity of
the sale of the lots in ques­tion in favor of (petitioners); rather, they
should comply with the lawful provisions of the will of the testator x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>. " The ques­tions raised
by respondent <span class="SpellE">Imbo</span> and his co-plaintiffs in their new
action, as to the alleged surreptitious sale by <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
<span class="SpellE">Teves</span> of the properties and their alleged legal right
to be subrogated to the rights of petitioners as vendees are matters that are
no longer <span class="SpellE">triable</span>, since they are foreclosed by this
Court's prior judgment in the 1964 case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The complaint in said Case No. 4390 therefore clearly stated no cause of
action, besides being barred by <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></u>, and since respondent court patently has no
jurisdiction to even attempt to take cognizance of the action to nullify or
modify a final judgment of this Court, certiorari and prohibition lie to annul
and set aside the pro­ceedings and to direct respondent court to desist from
further pro­ceedings in the matter, as reiterated recently by the Court in <u>Sterling
Investment Corporation vs. Ruiz</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent court also neglected
the performance of its ministerial function of issuing the writ of execution
prayed for by petitioners in the estate proceedings to which they were entitled
as a matter or right, by virtue of this Court's final judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its stated grounds in its long-delayed order
for denying the writ of execution, <span class="SpellE">viz</span>, that it Is
still conducting proceedings as directed by the Supreme Court per its decision
in the appealed case" and that the new civil case (No. 4390) involving the
two lots in ques­tion pending before it should first be duly terminated, are
legally untenable for the reasons already stated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, respondent court failed to take due
note that the 'further proceedings in the estate proceedings, as remanded by
this Court,/ were delimited by the express instructions given in the judgment
to sell other <span class="SpellE">undisposed</span> or unen­cumbered properties
of any of the heirs to meet the unpaid obliga­tions, if any, of the estate and
that it could not deal any longer with the two lots validly sold to petitioners
or entertain any further claim thereto of the executor or any of the heirs
questioning the validity of said sale, except to annotate, if necessary, a lien
in favor of the estate on the titles thereof, to guarantee the discharge of any
obli­gations of the estate in the event of insufficiency of the remaining
properties, as above stated.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reservation clause in
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of the judgment "reserving <u>the
right, if any, upon any authorized party</u>, to question the validity of the
sale made by <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>
to (petitioners), <u>in the proper Court</u>" could in no sense be invoked
by respondents for justifying respondent court's denial of the writ of
execution or the institution anew by plaintiffs-heirs of their new and separate
civil action questioning the same sale.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For by express terms of the judgment, the executor and all other heirs
of the estate were precluded from questioning the validity of the sale in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This should readily have been
perceived by respondents for the Court in its said judgment never referred to
the executor or administrator or their other co-heirs as parties to the case,
much less as an "authorized party" but always, referred to them
therein either in their official capacity as executor or administrator or by
name or collec­tively as heirs, and expressly precluded them collectively as <u>heirs</u>
from questioning the validity of the sale.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reservation clause was obviously intended as a saving clause to
protect <u>third parties</u> (non-heirs) who may have had any title or rights
to the two lots prior or superior to those of the decedent spouses whose
estates were being settled or of <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>, (to whom the said lots had been ad­judicated in the
will of the testator Pedro <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>) whose sale thereof
in favor of petitioners was declared valid as against the adverse claims of all
other heirs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(This was merely a
cautionary reservation as to third parties, since it was not clear in the
record, although the two lots' numbers apparently correspond to the cadastral
survey of <span class="SpellE">Duma­guete</span>, that the lots were duly
registered in the name of either or both of the decedent spouses).</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The new action filed by
respondent <span class="SpellE">Imbo</span> and his co plaintiffs is clearly
barred by <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></u>
by virtue of this Court's final verdict in the 1964 case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The "new" questions raised by said
respondents-plaintiffs now, per their answer to the petition and their
memorandum, pertain to the allegation that one of them, <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>
T. <span class="SpellE">Imbo</span>, was at the time of the "surreptitious
sale" of the lots by <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Teves</span> to petitioners, "was still a minor of less than
eighteen (18) years of age, he having been born on December 1, 1938," as a
basis for their alleged right of subrogation to petitioners' rights; and to the
conten­tion, that assuming that they are barred as heirs from questioning the
sale, “would they not be considered as the creditors, since out of the sale in
favor of Jose T. <span class="SpellE">Imbo</span>, most of the obligations of the
estate were paid,"<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
as to be considered third parties authorized to question the sale under this
Court's reservation clause.</p>

<p class="BODY">These bare allegations have no factual basis, because they are
contrary to the factual findings in this Court's judgment and as to <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Imbo's</span> alleged minority,
assuming that he was born on December 1, 1938 as alleged, then he was already
of age at the time that respondent court ordered in 1959 for a second time the
sale anew of the lots and during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of
petitioners' ap­peal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> to this Court - so it
cannot be truthfully alleged that he had no knowledge or notice of the "surreptitious
sale" of the properties to petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Aside from these allegations being belatedly raised now only in this
case, for they were not pleaded at all in the complaint below in Case No. 4390,
even if they were taken as true, they would have no legal merit or
significance, for as repeatedly stated, since the lots in question were
partitioned by will to <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>,
she became the absolute owner thereof by operation of law from the death of her
parents, free to sell the same to petitioners, more so, when the sale was
expressly recog­nized by herself and her co-heirs, as held by this Court in the
1964 judgment; and therefore, there could be no legal right of subrogation to
petitioners' rights as vendees under Article 1088 of the Civil Code, as invoked
by them.</p>

<p class="BODY">All these allegations and contentions of respondents and the
co-plaintiffs are now barred by <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></u> which has set the contro­versy at rest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A party cannot be permitted to urge one
ground at a time and indulge in “piece-meal and endless litigation", and
"by varying the form of action or adopting a different method of present­ing
his case, escape the operation of the principle that one and the same cause of
action shall not be twice litigated between the same parties and their
privies."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>As reaffirmed by the Court in the recent case
of <span class="SpellE"><u>Zambales</u></span><u> Academy Inc. vs. Villanueva</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
respondents "should finally realize that public policy and sound practice
enshrine the fundamental principle of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></u> that parties ought not to be permitted to
litigate the same issue more than once, as the very object for which courts
were constituted was to put an end to controversies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the provisions of Rule 39, section 49
(b) that the effect of a judgment or final order ren­dered by a court or judge
of the Philippines, having jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment or order, is
'with respect to the mat­ter directly adjudged or as to any other matter that
could have been raised in relation thereto, conclusive between the parties and
their successors in interest by title subsequent to the com­mencement of the
action or special proceeding, litigating for the same thing and under the same
title and in the same capacity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">corrolary</span> principle of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">judicata</span></u> that courts of the present day are not
concerned so much with the form of actions as with their substance' and that
'despite a difference in the form of the action nevertheless the doctrine of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></u> would
be applied where it appeared that the parties in the two suits were in truth 'litigating
for the same thing,' has just as long been enunciated by this Court."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We noted that petitioners
committed a procedural error in not having formally <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span>
in this action as respondents plaintiffs in Civil Case 4390 below, namely, the
six brothers and sisters of respondent Jose T. <span class="SpellE">Imbo</span>
and the widow of the testator's second marriage and their six alleged
"legitimated children".<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
This might have been a serious error resulting in further delay in the
disposition of this case, since said plaintiffs as indispensable parties would
have needed to be formally <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> herein and the
corresponding summons issued to them.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
At any rate, the defect has been cured by the voluntary appearance herein of
said plaintiffs through their counsel, Atty. Luz A. <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>,
plaintiffs' counsel of record in the- case below and who filed the answer and
memorandum in lieu of oral argument as "counsel for respondent Mariano <span class="SpellE">Teves</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
and counsel for plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 4390<span class="GramE">. "</span>
The answer to the petition thus filed by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>
is further verified by Mariano T. <span class="SpellE">Imbo</span>, one of the
plaintiffs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further­more, by the very
nature of the issues, even if said plaintiffs had not thus appeared in this
case, the Court's pronouncement as to their action below being barred by <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></u>, since
copies of the pleadings therein were annexed to the petition, would not be af­fected.</p>

<p class="NUM">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, the Court has
noted the unduly long number of years that the estate proceedings have been
pending since Decem­ber 12, 1949 in the case of the decedent Maria Pastor de <span class="SpellE">Teves</span> (Sp. Proc. No. 675) and since January 8, 1955 in the
case of the decedent Pedro <span class="SpellE">Teves</span> (Sp. Proc. No.
1010), notwithstanding that it is of record in the 1964 case that on October
20, 1956, all the heirs made a joint manifestation for the two proceedings to
be con­sidered either jointly or simultaneously, as the properties left by the
two decedents consisted of their conjugal properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is like­wise of record in the said case
that the indebtedness left by the joint estate was insignificant and that most
of the real properties of the estate were partitioned by the will of the
deceased testator among the heirs including the children of the second wife,
and that all the heirs expressed their conformity with the disposition of the
said will, with no <span class="SpellE">legitime</span> of any compulsory heir
having been prejudiced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, as late as
