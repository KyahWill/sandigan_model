granting motion to dismiss of plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Leoncia</span> (<span class="SpellE">Aloncia</span>) <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> the same being issued without jurisdiction and null

heirs of the deceased; and granting unto the petitioners such other or further
relief as may be deemed just and equitable".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In Civil Case No.</span> V-2589 of the court
named above, <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>
filed a complaint to annul certain deeds of sale and to recover from the
therein defendants <span class="SpellE">Aderiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span>
and others the ownership and possession of one-half of the five parcels of land
described in said pleading, with damages.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In Civil Case No.</span> V-2607 of the same
court, the spouses <span class="SpellE">Leoncia</span> <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> filed a
verified complaint against <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Timtiman</span> and others to annul the deed of sale attached
thereto as Annex A and the deed of mortgage allegedly executed by them in favor
of the spouses <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Timtiman</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Bibiana</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Timtiman</span>,
and to recover ownership and possession of the parcel of land described in said
pleading and instruments, also with damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the parcel of land involved in the second case was one of the
five parcels <span class="SpellE">subjectmatter</span> of the first and both
cases involved the same parties, they were consolidated.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In Civil Case No.</span> <span class="GramE">V-2589
defendant <span class="SpellE">Enicitas</span> <span class="SpellE">Corsino</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span>
filed her answer (See the record on appeal attached to the petition under
consideration as Annex C, p. 28-32), while the other defendants <span class="SpellE">Enicitas</span> <span class="SpellE">Corcino</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span>,

filed their respective separate answers (See at pp. 10-12, 28-40 of the
record).<span style="font-size: 15pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As the present action does not involve the merits of the case,
all that we need to state here is that all the answers of the defendants prayed
that the complaint be dismissed and that the sales sought to be annulled be
declared valid.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In Civil Case No.</span> V-2607 the spouses <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Timtiman</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bibiana</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Timtiman</span> filed their
answer to the complaint now appearing a:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>pp. 34-40 of the same Annex C, praying, in­ter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>,
for a declaration of the validity of the deed of sale questioned in the
complaint, and for damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other defendant <span class="SpellE">Enicitas</span> <span class="SpellE">Corsino</span> filed her own answer now appearing at pp. 4-45 of
the same Annex C praying for the dismissal of the complaint and for a
declaration of validity of the deed of sale questioned in the complaint, and
for damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiffs, in turn, filed their answer to the counterclaims
interposed by the defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">After several incidents involving the issuance <span style="font-size: 11pt;">of a </span>writ of preliminary injunction, the cases
were tried on the merits and finally, on <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1963</st1:date>, the Court rendered its judgment now
appearing at pp. 95-101 of Annex C, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby entered dismissing<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the complaint in the above-captioned cases,
with costs in both <span class="GramE">instance</span> against the plaintiffs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants <span class="SpellE">Necitas</span>
<span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> and her co-defendants, her minor children, are
hereby declared owners of the land in <span class="SpellE">Batiano</span> (des­cribed
in Exhibit 5) and the land in <span class="SpellE">Maralag</span> (described in
Exhibit 6), except the portion of two and a half (2-1/2) hectares of the <span class="SpellE">Maralag</span>, land, which is hereby declared as the property of
the spouses defendants <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Timtiman</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Bibiana</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Timtiman</span> by
virtue of the sale <i>a retro</i> embodied in <span style="">Exhibit </span>16.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
defendants are likewise declared entitled to possession of their respective
properties, and Plaintiffs are hereby ordered to pay to the defendants spouses <span class="SpellE">Timtiman</span> 40 <span class="SpellE">Cavans</span> of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> per agri­cultural crop year starting the month of
April 1962 or their equivalent marked value until the portion of the <span class="SpellE">Maralag</span> land pertaining to said <span class="SpellE">Timtimans</span>
shall have been returned to them."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that the defeated parties filed their notice
of appeal, appeal bond and record on appeal amended subsequently pursuant to an
order of the court - within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period,
and that the appeal was duly perfected on January 3, 1964.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also an admitted fact that <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>, plaintiff in Civil Case No. V- 2589, died in
the month of December 1963 - five months after the cases were decided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">On April 27, 1964, after
the perfection of the <span style="">appeal </span>mentioned
heretofore but before the elevation of the record on appeal and other pertinent
papers to the Court of Appeals, his widow, <span class="SpellE">Leoncia</span> <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>filed in
both cases a <span style="">motion </span>to dismiss
the appeal interposed therein (Exhibit D attached to the petition).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Said </span>motion
was granted by the respondent judge in his order of May 6 the same year
(Exhibit E attached to the same petition).<span style="font-size: 15pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under date of May 20, 1964 <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> <span class="SpellE">Bandorio</span>, through counsel, filed an unverified motion to
set aside the order of the Court dismissing the appeal, with a notice to the
Clerk of Court to set it for hearing ten days later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On May 30, 1964 the respondent judge issued
an order declining to take cognizance of, and to act upon said motion for re­consideration
because of <span class="SpellE">movants</span>' failure to serve notice <span style="">thereof upon the attorney </span>of record of
the adverse party (Exhibit G attached to the petition).</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears further that on May 27, 1964, that is, previous to the
issuance of the abovementioned order of May <span style="">30, 1964, </span>the respondent judge, acting upon a motion <span style="">for execution filed by </span>the winning
parties, issued en order <span style="">for the
issuance of </span>said writ in view of the fact <span style="">that, </span>according to the record, the decision rendered <span style="">in both </span>cases had become final and <span class="SpellE"><span style="">executory</span></span><span style=""> due to the withdrawal of the appeal
interposed by the defeated </span>parties.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under </span>date of June
8, 1964 <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bandorio</span></span><span style=""> again </span>filed a motion for reconsideration of the <span style="">order dismissing </span>the appeal and for
another order <span style="">suspending enforcement of
the writ of execution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under date of July 10, 1964, <span style="">another motion to set a</span>side the order granting the motion <span style="">to dismiss the appeal </span>was filed by
Teresa, <span class="SpellE">Nicolasa</span>, and Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>,
and also by <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> <span class="SpellE">Bandorio</span>
- the latter as <span style="">alleged attorney?i</span><span style="">n-fact </span><span style="">of the spouses <span class="SpellE">Leoncia</span> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Leonor</span></span><span style=""> and of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> - </span><span style="">supported
by </span><span style="">an alleged affidavit of merit
</span><span style="">whose </span><span style="">main </span><span style="">allegations were </span><span style="">that <span class="SpellE">Leoncia</span> <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> was the </span><span style="">surviving spouse of the deceased </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Rufino</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ferrer</span></span><span style="">; that the </span><span style="">latter had
died </span><span style="">intestate and without any
dependents; that his only surviving heirs were his widow and his sisters, </span><span style="">the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> <span class="SpellE">Nicolasa</span> and Teresa <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>, </span><span style="">the other <span class="SpellE">movant</span> <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> <span class="SpellE">Bandorio</span> being only the
son of the latter; that the </span><span style="">order
of dismissal was irregularly issued because the </span><span style="">motion to dismiss the appeal was filed by <span class="SpellE">Leoncia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Resolving the two motions for reconsideration mentioned <span style="">above, the </span>respondent judge on July
18, 1964 <span style="">issued </span>an order <span style="">of the following tenor:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">"With the objection of counsel for the defend­ants on the
ground that the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> herein are <span style="">strangers to those cases, the motion to set
aside </span>the within order <span style="">granting </span>a
previous motion filed <span style="">by the plaintiffs
</span>to <span style="">dismiss the appeal is, for
lack of merits, hereby dismissed."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As </span>stated
heretofore, the<span style=""> </span>respondent judge
refused to take cognizance of, and act<span style=""> </span>upon
the motion for re­<span style="">consideration filed
by <span class="SpellE">Pa<span style="">terno</span></span></span>
<span class="SpellE">Bandorio</span> under date of <span style="">May 20, 1964 </span><span style="">because of </span><span style="">the latter</span>'<span style="">s failure to serve notice thereof upon the attorney </span>of record of
the adverse party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, his Honor
considered said motion - <span style="">end correctly
so - as a motion pro-forma.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such,
therefore, it </span>did <span style="">not suspend
the running of the period of appeal from the order of dismissal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The second<span style=""> motion</span>
for reconsideration filed by <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> <span class="SpellE">Bandorio</span> was<span style=""> </span>dated
June <span style="">8, 1964,</span> while the third
filed by the <span style="">same </span>party,
together with Teresa and <span class="SpellE">Nicolasa</span> <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>,
was dated July 10, 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The former may
be pre­sumed to have been filed within the <span class="SpellE">reglementery</span>
period of thirty days from notice of the order dismissing the appeal, but the
contrary presumption applies to the latter because it was filed more than sixty
days from the date of the issuance <span style="">of </span>the
order dismissing the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More­over,
the respondent judge found that all the parties who filed the motions to set
aside the order dismissing the appeal had no legal standing in the case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> <span class="SpellE">Bandorio</span>
filed said motions in his <span style="">alleged </span>capacity
<span style="">as </span>attorney-in-fact of the
spouses <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Rufino</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> </span>and <span class="SpellE">Leoncia</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Leonor</span></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As</span> <span style="">far as <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>
is concerned, </span>said power of attorney, assuming it to have been validly
executed, must be deemed to have lapsed upon his death <span style="">which took place in the month of December 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>On the other hand, it must be deemed
to have been cancelled or <span style="">withdrawn by
the surviving principal, <span class="SpellE">Leoncia</span> <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span>,
when the latter took over the prosecution of the case by filing a motion to
dismiss the appeal interposed by her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As </span>far as the
other <span class="SpellE">movants</span> are concerned, namely, <span style="">Teresa and </span><span class="SpellE">Nicolasa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>, it does not appear <span style="">that they had ever asked the respondent </span><span style="">court to </span><span style="">allow </span>them
<span style="">to in­tervene or to allow the
substitution of </span>the <span style="">deceased <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> either by his legal
representative or by his intestate heirs - which </span>they <span style="">claim </span><span style="">to be, together with the surviving spouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the pronouncement made by the </span>respondent
judge to the effect that they <span style="">were
strangers to the case at the time their motion for reconsi­deration </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">filed and was</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">resolved </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">correct.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the foregoing, it is
clear that the</span> <span style="">respondent judge,
</span>in <span style="">issuing </span><span style="">the order granting the motion for the </span>dismissal
of the appeal, acted within his jurisdiction and did not commit any grave abuse
of discretion amounting in law to lack of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the writs prayed for are denied
and the present action is hereby dismissed, with costs.</p>
