the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental
dismissing the complaint herein.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs, <span class="SpellE">Romualdo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Justiniana</span>, Odon, <span class="SpellE">Narcisa</span> and
Bernardo, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Montesino</span>, seek the annulment
and cancellation of Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. <span class="GramE">T-16421
and T-31734, of the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span class="GramE">province</span></st1:placetype><span class="GramE"> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Negros</span></span><span class="GramE"> Occidental</span></st1:placename></st1:place><span class="GramE">,
in the names of defendants <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Rullan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Espedito</span> <span class="SpellE">Pison</span>, respectively, and to compel these defendants to
convey the property covered by said certificates of title to the plaintiffs, as
well as to pay dam­ages and costs.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Said property is lot No. 894 of the Cadastral Survey of <span class="SpellE">Himamaylan</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental</st1:placename></st1:place>,
which was covered by an application, filed by Petra <span class="SpellE">Limsiaco</span>,
for a homestead patent, on or about <st1:date year="1939" day="13" month="5">May
 13, 1939</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did not,
however, get the patent before her death in October, 1942, or September,
1943.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">It (Original
Certificate of Title No.</span> P-807) was not issued until <st1:date year="1954" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1954</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it was placed in the name of the
"Heirs of Petra <span class="SpellE">Limsiaco</span>." <span class="GramE">Soon thereafter, or on </span><st1:date year="1954" day="2" month="9"><span class="GramE">September 2, 1954</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, Transfer Certificate of Title No.</span> T-16421 was issued in
favor of <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Rullan</span> –
with whom she had apparently been living as husband and wife – upon the filing
by him of a deed – entitled, "Declaration of <span class="SpellE">Heirship</span>,"
executed by him on <st1:date year="1954" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1954</st1:date>
– adjudicating the lot to himself as her surviving spouse and only heir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="20" month="12">December
 20, 1961</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Rullan</span>
sold the property to <span class="SpellE">Espedito</span> <span class="SpellE">Pison</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This sale was approved by the Secretary of
Agriculture on <st1:date year="1962" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1962</st1:date>,
upon the recommendation of the Director of Lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Accordingly, Transfer
Certificate of Title No.</span> T-31734 was issued, in the name of <span class="SpellE">Pison</span>, on <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="3">March
 23, 1962</st1:date>, upon cancellation of Transfer Certificate of Title No. <span class="GramE">T-16421.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs commenced the present action on April 11, 1962,
alleging that they are the children of a first degree cousin of Petra <span class="SpellE">Limsiaco</span> and, as such, her heirs; that <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rullan</span> is neither her surviving spouse nor her heir;
that he had acted fraudulently in claiming to be so related to the deceased and
thus causing the title to said Lot No. 894 to be transferred to him; and that
defendant <span class="SpellE">Pison</span> is not a purchaser in good faith of
said lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an amended complaint filed
on <st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1962</st1:date>, plain­tiffs
alleged further that they had acquired the rights over said lot of <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> de la Cruz, who, they maintain, is the true
surviving spouse of Petra <span class="SpellE">Limsiaco</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After appropriate proceedings, the lower court rendered the
decision appealed from, dismissing the case, upon the ground that <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> de la Cruz had lost by prescription whatever rights
he may have had in and to the lot in question, and that, accordingly he had
transmitted none to plaintiffs herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, it should be noted that, upon the extra­judicial
adjudication of said lot to <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Rullan</span>, as Petra <span class="SpellE">Limsiaco</span>' s
alleged surviving spouse, <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> de la Cruz –
assuming that he was the legal spouse of Petra <span class="SpellE">Limsiaco</span>,
which, according to the lower court, he was <u>not</u> – or "an heir"
or "other person" who "has been unduly deprived of his lawful
participation in the estate" of the deceased, had two (2) years – pursuant
to Section 4 of Rule 74 of the Rules of Court – or four (4) years – as held in
several decisions of this Court<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
–from the summary "settlement and distribution" of said estate,
which, in the case at bar, took place upon the issuance of said Transfer
Certifi­cate of Title No. T-16421, on September 2, 1954, or not later than
September 2, 1958, within which to enforce judicially such rights, if any, as
he may have in and to the lot in dis­pute.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The complaint herein was not filed, however, until <st1:date year="1962" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1962</st1:date>, or several years after expiration
of the longest of said statutory periods of limitation of action.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from should be, as it is
hereby, affirmed, with costs against plaintiffs­-appellants.</p>
