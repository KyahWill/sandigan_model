				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a Petition for Certiorari seeking to set aside the
Resolution of the Court of Appeals, dated June 8, 1978, reconsidering its
Decision dated December 17, 1977 and reversing the judgment of the Court of
First Instance of Manila in favor of petitioners as well as the Resolutions,
dated July 6, 1978 and November 27, 1978, denying petitioners' Motion for
Reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The factual background of the case is as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">On </span><st1:date year="1969" day="3" month="6"><span class="GramE">June 3, 1969</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">,
private respondent <span class="SpellE">Jesusa</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Afable</span>,
together with <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> L. Mendoza and Ma.</span> Aurora
C. <span class="SpellE">Diño</span>, executed a promissory note in favor of
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Nelia</span> G. Ponce in the sum of P814,868.42,
Philippine Currency, payable, without interest, on or before July 31,
1969.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was further provided therein
that should the indebtedness be not paid at maturity, it shall draw interest at
12% per annum, without demand; that should it be necessary to bring suit to
enforce payment of the note, the debtors shall pay a sum equivalent to 10% of
the total amount due for attor­ney's fees; and, in the event of failure to pay
the indebtedness plus interest in accordance with its terms, the debtors shall
execute a first mortgage in favor of the creditor over their properties or of
the Carmen <span class="SpellE">Planas</span> Memorial, Inc.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the failure of the debtors to comply with the terms of the
promissory note, petitioners (<span class="SpellE">Nelia</span> G. Ponce and her
husband) filed, on <st1:date year="1970" day="27" month="7">July 27, 1970</st1:date>,
a Complaint against them with the Court of First Instance of Manila for the
recovery of the principal sum of P814<span class="GramE">,868.42</span>, plus
interest and damages.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Defendant Ma.</span> Aurora C. <span class="SpellE">Diño's</span> Answer consisted more of a general denial and the
contention that she did not borrow any amount from plaintiffs and that her
signature on the promissory note was obtained by plaintiffs on their assurance
that the same was for "formality only."</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant <span class="SpellE">Jesusa</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Afable</span>,
for her part, asserted in her Answer that the promissory note failed to express
the true intent and agreement of the parties, the true agreement being that the
obli­gation therein mentioned would be assumed and paid entirely by defendant <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> L. Mendoza; that she had signed said document only
as President of the Carmen <span class="SpellE">Planas</span> Memorial, Inc., and
that she was not to incur any personal obligation as to the payment thereof
because the same would be repaid by defendant Mendoza and/or Carmen <span class="SpellE">Planas</span> Memorial, Inc.</p>

<p class="BODY">In her Amended Answer, defendant <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span>
L. Mendoza admitted the authenticity and due execution of the promissory note,
but averred that it was a recapitulation of a series of transactions between
her and the plaintiffs, "with defendant Ma. <span class="GramE">Aurora C. <span class="SpellE">Diño</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jesusa</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Afable</span> coming only as <span class="SpellE">accomo­dation</span>
parties".</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>As affirmative
defense, defendant Mendoza contended that the promissory note was the result of
usurious transactions, and, as counter- claim, she prayed that plaintiffs be
ordered to account for all the interests paid.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs filed their Answer to defendant <span class="SpellE">Mandoza's</span>
counterclaim denying under oath the allegations of usury.</p>

<p class="BODY">After petitioners had rested, the case was deemed submitted for
decision since respondent <span class="SpellE">Afable</span> and her co-debtors
had repeatedly failed to appear before the trial Court for the presentation of
their evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="9" month="3">March 9, 1972</st1:date>,
the trial Court rendered judgment ordering respondent <span class="SpellE">Afable</span>
and her co-debtors, <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> L. Mendoza and Ma. Aurora
C. <span class="SpellE">Diño</span>, to pay petitioners, jointly and severally,
the sum of P814,868.42, plus 12% interest per annum from July 31, 1969 until
full payment, and a sum equivalent to 10% of the total amount due as attorney's
fees and costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">From said Decision, only respondent <span class="SpellE">Afable</span>
appealed to the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
argued that the contract under consideration involved the payment of US dollars
and was, therefore, illegal; and that under the <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>pari</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>delicto</u></span> rule, since both parties are guilty of
violating the law, neither one can recover.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is to be noted that said defense was not raised in her Answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="13" month="12">December 13, 1977</st1:date>,
the Court of Appeals<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">*</span></span></span></a>
rendered judgment affirming the decision of the trial Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a Resolution dated <st1:date year="1978" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1978</st1:date>, the Court of Appeals denied
respondent's Motion for Reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, in a Resolution dated <st1:date year="1978" day="8" month="6">June
 8, 1978</st1:date>, the Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">*</span></span></span></a><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">*</span></span></span> acting on the Second Motion for Reconsideration
filed by private respondent, set aside the Decision of <st1:date year="1977" day="13" month="12">December 13, 1977</st1:date>, reversed the judgment of the
trial Court and dismissed the Complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeals opined that the intent of the parties was that the
promissory note was payable in US dollars, and, therefore, the transaction was
illegal, with neither party entitled to recover under the <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>pari</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>delicto</u></span> rule.</p>

<p class="BODY">Their Motions for Reconsideration having been denied in the
Resolutions dated <st1:date year="1978" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1978</st1:date>
and <st1:date year="1978" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1978</st1:date>,

<p class="BODY">We are constrained to disagree.</p>

<p class="BODY">Reproduced hereunder is Section 1 of Republic Act No. 529, which
was enacted on <st1:date year="1950" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1950</st1:date>:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 1.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every provision contained in, or made with
respect to, any domestic obligation to wit, any obligation contracted in the
Philippines <u>which</u> <u>provision purports to give the <span class="SpellE">obligee</span>
the right to require payment in gold or in a particular kind of coin or
currency other than Philippine currency or in an amount of money of the
Philippines measured thereby, be as it is hereby declared against public
policy, and null, void, and of no effect, and no such provision shall be
contained in, or made with respect to, any obligation hereafter incurred</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The above prohibition shall not apply to (a)
transactions where the funds involved are the proceeds of loans or investments
made directly or indirectly, through bona fide intermediaries or agents, by
foreign governments, their agencies and instrumentalities, and international
financial and banking institutions so long as the funds are identifiable, as
having emanated from the sources enumerated above; (b) transactions affecting
high-priority economic projects for agricultural, industrial and power deve­lopment
as may be determined by the National Economic Council which are financed by or
through foreign funds; (c) forward exchange transactions entered into between
banks or between banks and individuals or juridical persons; (d) import-export
and other international banking, financial investment and industrial
transactions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the exception of the
cases enumerated in items (a), (b), (c) and (d) in the foregoing provision, in
which cases the terms of the parties' agreement shall apply, <u>every other
domestic obligation heretofore or hereafter incurred, whether or not any such
provision as to payment is contained therein or made with respect thereto,
shall be discharged upon payment in any coin or currency which at the time of
payment is legal tender for public and private debts</u>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, That if the obligation was incurred
prior to the enactment of this Act and required payment in a particular kind of
coin or currency other than Philippine currency, it shall be discharged in
Philippine currency measured at the prevailing rates of exchange at the time
the obligation was incurred, except in case of a loan made in a foreign
currency stipulated to be payable in the same currency in which case the rate
of exchange prevailing at the time of the stipulated date of payment shall
prevail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All coin and currency, including
Central Bank notes, heretofore and hereafter issued and declared by the
Government of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
shall be legal tender for all debts, public and private." (As amended by
RA 4100, Section 1, approved June 19, 1964) (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is to be noted that while an agreement to pay in dollars is
declared as null and void and of no effect, what the law specifically prohibits
is payment in currency other than legal tender.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It does not defeat a creditor's claim for payment, as it specifically
provides that "every other domestic obligation x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> whether or not any such
provision as to pay­ment is contained therein or made with respect thereto,
shall be discharged upon payment in any coin or currency which at the time of
payment is legal tender for public and private debts." A contrary rule
would allow a person to profit or enrich <span class="GramE">himself</span>
inequitably at another's expense.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the Court of Appeals itself found, the promissory note in
question provided on its face for payment of the obligation in Philippine
currency, <u>i</u>.<u>e</u>., P814<span class="GramE">,868.42</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So that, while the agreement between the
parties origi­nally involved a dollar transaction and that petitioners expected
to be paid in the amount of US$194,016.29, petitioners are not now insisting on
their agreement with respondent <span class="SpellE">Afable</span> for the
payment of the obligation in dollars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the contrary, they are suing on the basis of the promissory note whereby the parties
have already agreed to convert the dollar loan into Philippine currency at the
rate of P4.20 to $1.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
It may likewise be pointed out that the Promissory Note contains no provision
"giving the <span class="SpellE">obligee</span> the right to require payment
in a particular kind of currency other than Philippine currency," which is
what is specifically prohibited by RA No. 529.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, even if we were to disregard the promissory note
providing for the payment of the obligation in Philippine currency and consider
that the intention of the parties was really to provide for payment of the
obligation would be made in dollars, petitioners can still recover the amount
of US$194,016.29, which respondent <span class="SpellE">Afable</span> and her
co-debtors do not deny having received, in its peso equivalent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As held in <span class="SpellE">Eastboard</span>
Navigation, Ltd. vs. Juan <span class="SpellE">Ysmael</span> &amp; Co. Inc., 102
Phil. 1 (1957), and <span class="SpellE">Arrieta</span> vs. National Rice &amp;
Corn Corp.,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
if there is any agreement to pay an obligation in a currency other than
Philippine legal tender, the same is null and void as contrary to public
policy, pursuant to Republic Act No. 529, and the most that could be demanded
is to pay said obligation in Philippine currency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, what is prohibited by RA No.
529 is the payment of an obligation in dollars, meaning that a creditor cannot
oblige the debtor to pay him in dollars, even if the loan were given in said
currency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such a case, the indemnity
to be allowed should be expressed in Philippine currency on the basis of the current
rate of exchange at the time of payment.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>
