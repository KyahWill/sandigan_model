THE COURT OF APPEALS AND ROBERT TAN, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this petition for the review of respondent Court of Appeal's decision
sustaining the right of the other respondent, Robert Tan, plaintiff in the
lower court, to recover the sum of P5,000.00 as earnest money for a projected
sale of real estate that was not consummated as well as the liquidated damages
agreed upon, the principal legal question raised and relied upon for the
reversal sought is the alleged disregard of the last paragraph of Article 1169
of the Civil Code to the effect that in reciprocal obligations, "neither
party incurs in delay if the other does not comply or is not ready to comply in
a proper manner with what is incumbent upon him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the moment one of the parties fulfills
his obligation, delay by the other begins."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
It was thus incumbent on petitioner Angel T. <span class="SpellE">Limjoco</span>,
defendant in the lower court and thereafter appellant before respondent Court,
to demonstrate that the conduct of respondent Tan could be considered as
falling within the above <span class="SpellE">codal</span> provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That he was unable to do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts as found by the lower court, and
thereafter affirmed by respondent Court, negated his contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conclusion reached by respondent Court
was thus adverse to petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a
careful study of the records and in the light of the facts as found, impressed
as they are with the attribute of finality, there is no justification for a
reversal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY">The basic contract that gave rise to this dispute executed on
April 30, 1957, starts with the recital that petitioner Angel T. <span class="SpellE">Limjoco</span> acknowledged the receipt of P5,000.00 from Robert
Tan, respondent in this case, as earnest money "for the land with a total
area of 3,148 square meters located in the compound at No. 56 (old number) R. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> Street, San Juan, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
together with all the improvements thereon which as absolute owner
thereof,"<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
the aforesaid <span class="SpellE">Limjoco</span> promised and did undertake to
sell to Tan for the sum of P85,000.00, it being further stipulated
"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That within sixty days from
this date [he undertakes] to execute the necessary deed of sale in favor of Mr.
Robert Tan for the above described property as evidenced by Transfer
Certificates of Title Nos. 25184, 7869 and 20713 of the Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> with all the improvements thereon for the sum of
[Eighty five thousand] (P85,000.00) [pesos], the terms of payment of which will
be that the buyer Mr. Robert Tan will assume the mortgage lien of about [Thirty
two thousand] (P32,000.00) [pesos] in said property in favor of the
Rehabilitation Finance Corporation for a ten-year period [with <span class="SpellE">Limjoco</span> undertaking] to arrange with said corporation, and
the said buyer upon [the] execution of the deed of sale will pay [him] one half
of the remaining balance after deducting the amount of mortgage to be assumed
by the buyer and the sum of [Five thousand] (P5,000.00) [pesos] earnest money
here received by [him] within one hundred twenty days thereafter the other half
of the aforesaid remaining balance; 2.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That should [he] fail to perform the undertaking herein stipulated, [he]
hereby [binds himself] to return to Mr. Robert Tan the said sum of [Five
thousand] (P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>) [pesos] within fifteen days
after the lapse of the sixty-day period herein stipulated, otherwise [he] shall
be liable to him for the additional sum of [Five thousand] (P5,000.00) [pesos]
as damages; and 3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That should [he]
comply with all the stipulations herein stated within the sixty-day period and
Mr. Robert Tan fails to purchase the property herein described under the
conditions herein agreed, within fifteen days upon written notice to him, then
his earnest money of [Five thousand] (P5,000.00) [pesos] shall be declared
forfeited by [Tan] in [his] favor."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As noted at the outset, there was a failure to consummate such
proposed sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court found,
and it was upheld by respondent Court, that for such frustration of the intent
of the parties, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Limjoco</span> was to blame.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "As may be seen, defendant in
explicit terms undertook to execute the necessary deed of sale or conveyance of
the property, object of the contract, within 60 days from and after the execution
of the contract, Exhibit A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
contract, as already stated, was executed on <st1:date year="1957" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1957</st1:date>, so that defendant had until <st1:date year="1957" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1957</st1:date>, within which to comply
with its terms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the terms of the
contract also, defendant undertook to arrange with the RFC the assumption by
the plaintiff of the mortgage lien of about P32<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
covering said property in favor of the said corporation for a period of 10
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no <span class="GramE">dispute</span>
that defendant failed to comply with these conditions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant contended, however, that he was not
able to arrange the approval of the assumption of the mortgage with the RFC
because of the refusal of the plaintiff to have his credit rating
investigated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not borne out by
the facts, however, because the plaintiff had expressed his willingness to have
his credit rating investigated although he thought it was unnecessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The truth of the matter is that it was only
on <st1:date year="1957" day="9" month="7">July 9, 1957</st1:date>, when an
attempt was made by a representative of the RFC to investigate him but at that
time the period set forth in the contract, Exhibit A, had already
expired."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Further to the same effect: "As to the reason of the delay of the attempt
to investigate the plaintiff that has not been satisfactorily explained by
defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant further contended
that he had submitted a draft of the deed of sale to the plaintiff before the
expiration of the date but according to him the plaintiff refused to accept the
draft.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The refusal, however, [of] the
plaintiff to accept the draft was based on the fact that there was no need of
the said draft because the terms and conditions of the deed of sale were
explicitly set forth in their agreement, Exhibit A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This he made explicit in his letter to the
defendant, Exhibit J, wherein he stated that he had reminded defendant's lawyer
to execute the necessary deed of sale on or before <st1:date year="1957" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1957</st1:date>. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Defendant, however, failed to execute the
deed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason for this failure was,
in the opinion of the Court, the fact that the defendant could not secure the
signatures of all his children because one of them was in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city> at the time and 'was
expected to he here about the end of next month' (Exhibit G)."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
As it turned out, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Limjoco</span>, whose status
according to the contract was that of a widower, was not the sole owner, His
children apparently were co-owners.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the lower court did reach the conclusion that
petitioner was not successful in trying to prove through certain exhibits that
respondent Tan was not without fault because of the alleged loss of
interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "As may be noted,
these documents bear dates after the period of 60 days had already
elapsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming that plaintiff had
lost interest in the deal, such loss of interest cannot be interpreted as proof
of plaintiff's default in view of the fact that the loss of interest had taken
place after the 60 days period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
should not be lost sight of the fact that defendant had been reminded thru his
counsel to prepare the deed of sale on or before <st1:date year="1957" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1957</st1:date>, as shown by the letter, Exhibit G.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will be noted that the fact of reminder
about the deed has not been denied or refuted by defendant."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There was a reiteration later in the opinion of the lower court,
a view with which respondent Court was in agreement, that petitioner should be
held at fault for the sale not going through.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus: "As has already been shown elsewhere in this decision, the
failure of defendant to comply with the terms of Exhibit A was due in the first
place to the fact that one of his children was not in a position to sign the
deed as she was then in <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, and was not expected
to return until the end of July, and, second, because of the fact that a
representative of the RFC only took steps to investigate the credit rating of
the plaintiff after the expiration of the period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the defendant had exercised due diligence,
these two circumstances could have been avoided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, when he found it impossible to
comply with the terms of the contract, he should have returned the earnest
money and put an end to the contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
failed to do all these however.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead
he asked for extension of 30 days within which to comply with the terms of the
contract or a period of 90 days within which to return the money."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, respondent Court, after quoting in full the above
decision, explained why it was entitled to <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "We have carefully read and
scrutinized the testimonial and documentary evidence presented by both parties
at the pre-trial and at the formal trial of this case, and we are greatly
satisfied that the findings of fact and conclusions of the learned trial Judge
are fully supported by the evidence and the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
was not declared to be the party who failed to comply with his duties and
obligations under his contract with defendant-appellant (Exhibit A), but it was
the latter who was found remiss in connection therewith, is explained at length
in the above-quoted decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As regards
this point, we have nothing to add thereto."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the above facts, which as pointed out we are not at liberty to
ignore, there is, to repeat, no legal basis for the reversal of the decision of
respondent Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first three alleged errors imputed to respondent Court would
seek to impress on us that respondent Tan failed to comply in a proper manner
with what was incumbent upon him and that therefore under Article 1169 of the
Civil Code, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Limjoco</span> could not be
considered as having incurred any delay in the fulfillment of his obligation.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
It is undeniable that if a case were properly made out calling for the
application of Article 1169, then such a contention should be accorded
acceptance. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The facts as conclusively
found not only by respondent Court but also by the lower court negate such a
claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no denying that if the
sale within the two-month period stipulated did not take place, it was due
solely to petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was so aptly
expressed in the opinion of the lower court to which there was full concurrence
on the part of respondent Court, "the failure of the defendant to execute
the deed of sale within the time limit was due to his inability to secure the
signature of all his children, and his failure to secure the approval of the
RFC to the assumption of the mortgage covering said property, which in the
agreement, Exhibit A, he undertook to arrange."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
There is no basis then for the allegation that respondent Court was unmindful
of the reciprocal obligation assumed by respondent Tan and that he should be
held accountable for the failure to comply with what was incumbent upon him
which in turn prevented petitioner from fulfilling his part of the
contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first two assigned errors
are thus obviously without foundation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would likewise follow that, as had been set forth above, the last
paragraph of Article 1169 of the Civil Code cannot be relied upon by petitioner
for relieving him from the obligation to execute the deed within the period
stipulated as his inability to do so was not the result of any fault that could
be imputed to respondent Tan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The third
assignment of error is thus equally lacking in merit as is the fourth alleged
error committed by respondent Court to the effect that the suit by respondent
Tan was premature as he then lacked a cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being a failure on the part of petitioner
to execute the deed of sale, he was required under the contract to return the
earnest money and to pay the liquidated damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">This liability for liquidated damages is assailed in the fifth
assignment of error as immoral, petitioner relying on another provision of the
Civil Code<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
which would allow an equitable reduction in liquidated damages when found
iniquitous or unconscionable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court
does not find persuasive the plea that for the failure on the part of a party
to comply with what is incumbent upon him, he is not only required to return
the earnest money but likewise to pay liquidated damages in the same
amount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner was under no
compulsion to enter into such stipulation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nor, in the absence of other considerations which petitioner's brief
failed to mention at all, could it be held as a matter of law that the sum
agreed upon as liquidated damages could be assailed for the ground of its being
iniquitous or unconscionable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
<span class="SpellE">Limjoco</span> and respondent Tan are both property owners
and men of affairs who are presumed to know how to protect their interests in
dealing with other parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
entering into such an agreement, petitioner cannot thereafter turn his back on
his word with a plea that on him was inflicted a penalty shocking to the
conscience and impressed with iniquity as to call for the relief sought on the
part of a judicial tribunal.</p>

1962 is hereby affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With costs against petitioner.</span></p>
