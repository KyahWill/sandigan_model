respondent judge against petitioner fiscal on the ground that petitioner fiscal
did not act improperly and with contempt of respondent judge's court in filing
the informations in the ten cases in question with the Circuit Criminal Court

<p class="BODY">Petitioner in his capacity as incumbent Provincial Fiscal of
Cavite and ex-oficio City Fiscal of Trece Martires City, upon receipt of the
records of the criminal cases, after studying the same and satisfying himself
of the sufficiency of the evidence for the pro­secution prepared the
corresponding informations and in the exer­cise of his discretion either <u>motu</u>

or at the request of the offended parties or kins of victims of murder and
other serious crimes and their witnesses (who were thus em­boldened to appear
and testify at the trials held by the Circuit Cri­minal Court at Pasig, Rizal
rather than in Cavite) filed the cases with the Circuit Criminal Court at
Pasig, Rizal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 4, 1976, petitioner received identical orders dated
October 21, 1976 issued in the ten cases by respondent judge ordering
petitioner "to show cause and explain within five (5) days from receipt of
copy of this order why he has not reported on the development of this case, it
appearing that he should have acted on this case sooner and should have
reported to this Court on the con­sequences produced by him considering that
the record of this case has been in his possession for quite a long time
already for investigation and/or appropriate action," and ordering him
"to return to this court of these cases immediately, unless there is a
valid ground to retain the same in his possession."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner promptly filed on November 8, 1976 his Explanation
stating that the cases had already been filed with the Circuit Criminal Court
at Pasig, Rizal and "(T)hat the failure to advise the Clerk of Court of
the filing of these with the CCC at Pasig is an unfortunate oversight for which
the undersigned apologizes humbly to this Honorable Court;" pleading that
"the matter of advising the Clerk of Court of the filing of the cases with
the CCC at Pasig, Rizal is purely administrative and should be routinary for
the Administra­tive Officer of this office;" but "begging the
indulgence" of respondent judge for such failure due to "an acute
lack of personnel" in his office; and further stating that two cases
against the Orbistondo brothers (Emilio and Mundo, CCC-VII-1507 and 1508)
"were already decided by the Honorable Judge Onofre Villaluz on October
21, 1976, the brothers Emilio and Mundo Orbistondo having been sentenced to
death for Murder and to suffer an undeterminate sentence of from 10 years and 1
day of reclusion temporal, minimum to 17 years, 4 months and 1 day of reclusion
temporal as maximum;" while a third case against Antonio Orbistondo was
still pending because said accused was confined in the Bilibid Hospital for
advance T.B. and was said to be "in danger of dying of said ailment."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
As to the other cases, petitioner asked for an extension of time to inform
respondent judge of their status as the records were with the Circuit Criminal
Court at Pasig and pending receipt of the reports of his assistant fiscals.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge, however, in six identical orders all dated
November 22, 1976<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
rejected petitioner's Explanation as "not well taken and
unsatisfactory" and found him guilty of indirect contempt of court and
sentenced him to pay a fine of P100.00 in each of the ten cases or a total of
P1,000.00 with a warning "not to repeat the said offense for a repetition
of the same will be dealt with more sternly and severely," ruling that</p>

<blockquote>''His explanation, which drew the ire and dismay of this Court, was
that instead of returning the record of this case to this Court with the
corresponding in­formation filed in connection therewith, he opted to file the
said case before the Circuit Criminal Court of Pasig, Metro Manila, thereby
leaving this case as pending before the docket of this Court for an indefinite
period of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that had this
Court not exer­cised prudence by making the order dated October 21, 1976, the
said case will remain pending and open in its docket forever and the same will
adversely affect the competence and efficiency of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Provincial Fiscal, in filing this case
with the Circuit Criminal Court, did not even have the courtesy of moving nor
informing this Court about the transfer of venue of the same when this Court of
equal power and jurisdiction has already acquired jurisdiction over it upon its
receipt from the Municipal Court of Rosario, Cavite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is very apparent that the Provincial
Fiscal has reduced to and treated this Court as a mere Municipal Court which is
offensive and an insult to this Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present appeals of petitioner fiscal by way of review
on <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent judge
in his comment on the pe­tition reasserted that jursidiction was "already
vested" in his court over the same ten cases which were "docketed"
therein "although there were still no informations in their records;"
that his court should have first "expressly granted and ordered the
withdrawal of such cases from its dockets …. and it is only at such time that
the petitioner-appellant provincial fiscal may exercise his authority to file
such informations with the Circuit Criminal Court;" that "to defend
and stress [his court's] integrity and dignity" he imposed the fines upon
petitioner who "deliberately committed such act(s) of indirect contempt;"
that the Circuit Criminal Court ''did not have any jurisdiction to hear, try
and decide such ten criminal cases" and he therefore prayed for dismissal
of the petition and "that the corres­ponding records of the same ten
criminal cases should be returned by petitioner to the Cavite Court of First
Instance for the lawful ac­tions which are needed on them."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is obvious that respondent judge's contempt orders were based
on the misconception that jurisdiction over the ten criminal cases had already
"vested" in his court when the municipal judges who conducted the
preliminary investigation transmitted the records of the cases to his clerk of
court, as provided by Rule 112, section 12 of the Rules of Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
This may have been true in a sense before the enactment on September 8, 1967 of
Republic Act No. 5179 creating the Circuit Criminal Court in each of the
sixteen judicial districts and granting them concurrent criminal jurisdiction
over the criminal cases therein specified with the regular courts of first instance
which theretofore fell within the latter's original and exclu­sive
jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon receipt of the record in the court of first instance from
the municipal court, it is well settled as reaffirmed in <u>Talusan vs. Ofiana</u><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
that the provincial fiscal (or his assistant) has the power "to conduct
his own investigation or reinvestigation of a case already elevated to the
Court of First Instance by a municipal judge or justice of the peace who
conducted a preliminary investigation thereon, in order to determine his own
course of action as prosecut­ing officer," and thereafter he may either
move to dismiss the case (subject to the sound discretion of the judge
presiding the court who usually grants although he may deny the same, but who
however may not order the movant fiscal to file the corresponding information
in the event of his denial of the fiscal's dismissal motion<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>)
or file the corresponding information.</p>

<p class="BODY">As provided by Rule 110, section 4 of the Rules of Court (and
Republic Act No. 5180) "(A)ll criminal actions either commenced by
complaint or by information shall be prosecuted under the direc­tion and
control of the fiscal." Where the fiscal after his study of the record
finds reasonable ground against the accused and files the information, it is
within his authority and discretion under existing administrative procedures<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
to file the same either with the Court of First Instance or the Circuit
Criminal Court (in the same manner as with cases falling within the concurrent
criminal jurisdiction of these two courts and the city [and municipal]
courts).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in <u>People vs. Abejuela</u><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court recognized the fiscal's choice of court or forum wherein to file the
information for offenses of concurrent criminal jurisdiction and held that
"It is to be assumed that the right of <u>choice of forum</u> granted to
the city fiscal will be exercised properly in the interests of an <u>expeditious
and orderly administration of justice</u>, and experience has borne out that
informations for such offenses have been invariably filed with the inferior
courts - absent an overriding compelling reason to file the same with the
courts of first instance whose dockets are generally more taken up with cases
requiring pro­tracted trials - for considerations equally of benefit to the
State as well as to the accused since their decisions are given the same weight
as those of the courts of first instance and are appealable directly to the
Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court, as the case may be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, provincial and city fiscals have
been granted the <u>choice of forum</u> with regard to the filing of
informations for serious crimes within the <u>concurrent jurisdiction</u> of
the <u>courts of first instance</u> and the <u>circuit criminal courts</u> with
a case filed with the circuit court having the advantage or disadvantage,
depending upon the accused's viewpoint, of <u>continuous trial</u> until
termination and a <u>prompt verdict</u> within thirty days from submittal of
the case for decision, but the validity of the law cannot be seriously
challenged."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner fiscal, as already stated, filed the informations in
the ten cases with the Circuit Criminal Court rather than with the respondent
judge's court to mitigate the latter court's caseload in accordance with the
purpose of the Circuit Criminal Court law or at the request of the offended
parties and complainants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the
filing of the information or complaint "supplies the occasion for the exer­cise
of jurisdiction vested by law in a particular court"<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
and the law confers concurrent jurisdiction in the Circuit Criminal Court, the
said court properly assumed jurisdiction over the said cases and there is no
lawful basis for respondent judge's prayer that said cases be returned to his
court "for the lawful actions which are needed on them" and to set at
naught the judgments of conviction already render­ed by the Circuit Criminal
Court in some of the cases and the other proceedings therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">For administrative and record purposes, however, petitioner
fiscal should have promptly and in due course advised the clerk of respondent
judge's court that the informations had been filed with the Circuit Criminal
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner fiscal recognized this
oversight and duly "apologized humbly" to respondent judge and
pleaded an "acute lack of personnel in his office" in
extenuation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances and
considering that petitioner was only discharging his duty according to his best
lights, and could not be said to have in any way acted arbitrarily or in bad
faith in filing the informations with the Circuit Criminal Court, his apology
could have been graciously accepted by respondent judge with an admonition to
exercise greater care in the future, in lieu of the unwarranted imposition of
punitive fines in the total sum of P1,000.00,</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the questioned contempt orders and fines
imposed therein are annulled and set aside.<span style="">&nbsp;
