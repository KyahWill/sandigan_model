				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The firm and vigorous insistence on the part of <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> Milling Co., Inc. that it would be held liable
under the Workmen's Compensation Act without its right to due process being
respected did suffice for its petition to review the decision of respondent
Workmen's Compensation Commission being given due course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereby, necessarily, the enforcement of the
right to compensation of respondent Julio Segovia, formerly in the employ of
petitioner, the unfortunate victim of pulmonary tuberculosis, suffered <span style="">a </span>delay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It ought not to have been the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">As will hereafter be shown, petitioner's unyield­ing and adamant
attitude had no justification whatso­ever.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It has been permitted long enough to evade fulfillment of an obligation
imposed by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We should write finis to
<span class="GramE">this</span> litigation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We affirm the decision of respondent Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision sought to be reviewed was rendered by respondent
Commission on <st1:date year="1965" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It affirmed an order of its hearing officer,
Reuben D. <span class="SpellE">Borres</span>, of its <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>
Regional Office, sustaining the claim of respondent Julio Segovia For
compensation.</p>

<p class="BODY">How the claim arose, was set forth therein thus: "An examination
of the records of this case reveals that on <st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="5">May 20, 1963</st1:date>, claimant [n<span style="">ow </span>respondent], Julio Segovia filed with the Sub-Regional Office
in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
a notice of injury or sickness and claim for com­pensation against the
respondent <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> Milling Co., Inc. By registered
mail dated June 8, 1963, said Office sent said notice and claim to the
respondent [now petitioner], and requested it at the same time to submit the
employer's report of accident or sickness, physician's report of sickness or
accident and employer's supple­mentary report of accident or sickness (WCC Form
Nos. 3, 4, &amp; 5, respectively), pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 37 of the
Workmen's Compensation Act, <span style="">as </span>amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that the claim was received by the
respondent [now petitioner] on <st1:date year="1963" day="17" month="6">June
 17, 1963</st1:date> as may be evidenced by the registry return receipt."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Mention was thereafter
made of the fact that on December 16, 1963 or six months after petitioner <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> Milling Co., Inc. had been informed of such
claim, respondent here, Julio Segovia, filed <span style="">a </span>motion for judgment by default in view of such failure to
answer such claim within the legal period in accordance with the rules of
respondent Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then <span class="GramE">came</span> a narration in the decision of what happened next:
[Respondent's] motion was granted on <st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="12">December
 20, 1963</st1:date>, and a copy of the Order declaring the [petitioner] in
default was received by it by registered mail on <st1:date year="1964" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1964</st1:date>, as may be evidenced by the registry
return receipt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> hearing was conducted on <st1:date year="1964" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1964</st1:date>, where [respondent] had
established the compen­sability of his claim under Act [No.] 3428, as
amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is evident, therefore, that,
from the facts stated above, [petitioner] was duly notified of the claim for compensation,
but it deliberately refused to answer the claim and, what is worse, nothing was
done by it to protect its interests after having been declared in default until
after it had allegedly received from [respondent's] counsel a copy of the
decision which was rendered <span style="">on t</span>he
case."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Before the respondent Commission, as before us, petitioner would
make much of the due process question, claiming that the regional office
involved never acquired jurisdiction on its person on the ground that no
summons was served on it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
language of the petition: "It is <span style="">a
</span>matter of settled jurisprudence that courts and other judicial and
quasi-judicial bodies acquire jurisdiction over the person of the defendant or
respondent thru the service of summons upon the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, no such summons <span style="">had </span>ever been issued, much less
served, upon the herein petitioner, in direct violation of the above cited Rule
17, <span style="">Sec. </span>2 of the Rules of the
Commission and of Rule 7 of the old Rules of Court."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Such an assertion was not left unanswered in the decision of
respondent Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "This
ground lacks merit for the reason that Rule 13 of the same Rules provides that
'these rules are applicable only to cases involving contested or <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> claims for compensation' and the case or claim
under review was not contested or <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> by the
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence shows that,
prior to [respondent's] termination of his employment with [petitioner], the
latter had for several times allowed the former to return to his work each time
that he was discharged from the hospital until he was finally dismissed on
December, 1957, from his said employ­ment because of his pulmonary tuberculosis
which was un­ arrested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of this
knowledge and extension of hospital facilities, the [petitioner's] failure to
or delay in giving notice of his sickness to the respondent did not operate as
a bar to the present proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Sec.
27, Workmen's Compensation Act).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
knowledge and extension of facilities on the part of the [petitioner] however,
carried with it the election to controvert or not the claimant's right to
compensation by filing <span style="">a </span>notice
or report to that effect with this Commission or Regional Office on or before
the fourteenth day of disability or within ten <span style="">days </span>after it had knowledge of the sickness, but it failed and
its failure to do so constitute a renunciation of its right to controvert the
claim (See Sec. 45, of WCA)."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Further, on the question of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>,
the decision under review stated the following: "The records further <span style="">show </span>that, although the [petitioner]
knew of <st1:city><st1:place>Segovia</st1:place></st1:city>'s illness and in
fact it was for <span class="GramE">ins</span> reason why he was dismissed by the
company due to physical disability, the company nevertheless had failed to give
notice of such fact to Regional Office No. <span class="GramE">VII, or to its
sub-regional office in </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Bacolod</span></span></st1:placename><span class="GramE"> </span><st1:placetype><span class="GramE">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span class="GramE">, as
required by Sec. 37 of Act No. 3428, <span style="">as
</span>amended.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It likewise
failed to file its notice to controvert [respondent's] right to compensation
within the statutory period provided by Sec. 45 of the Act."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is in the light of the above that the due process question
raised <span style="">as </span>well as the other
errors allegedly committed by respondent Commission should be appraised and
considered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What other conclusion can
there be in the light of controlling decisions except that the right of
respondent Segovia to compensation appears to be un­deniable? What is thus
evident at first glance becomes even more so when attention <span style="">is </span>directed to the pronounce­ments
and rulings of this Court, possessing both relevancy and applicability.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner would stress
unduly the alleged deprivation of a day in court to which it had been
subjected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That simply was not the case
considering its failure to controvert.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So we have repeatedly held.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
due process argument is clearly devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Filipino Pipe &amp; Foundry Corp. <span style="">v. </span>Workmen's Compensation Commission,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court, speaking through the present Chief Justice, disposed of the due
process argument in this wise: "It is not denied that petitioner's answer
to <span class="SpellE">Hiwatig's</span> claim had not been filed within ten (10)
days from notice of <span class="SpellE">Hiwatig's</span> claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to section 45 of Act No. 3428,
petitioner is deemed, therefore, to have renounced its right to controvert said
claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the same was
deemed admitted by petitioner, which, according­ly, had no more right to demand
a day in court."</p>

<p class="BODY">Earlier that year, in <span class="SpellE">Malan</span> Brothers
Watchman Agency v. <span class="SpellE">Conanan</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> <span style="">a </span>similar expression was given to
such <span style="">a view </span>in an opinion by
Justice Dixon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "Petitioner's
claim that the <span style="">award </span>is void
because it was rendered without any notice of hearing having been served on him
is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Conanan's</span>
claim being non-<span class="SpellE">controverted</span>, the Regional
Administrator was authorized to decide the same upon the submission to him of
the claim and accompanying evidence – as was done in the present case – without
the necessity of holding a formal bearing.<span style="">&nbsp;

ruling along with two other decisions.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
What we said further in the opinion penned by Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>
possesses relevancy: "The allegation of lack of notice and hearing cannot be
sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner failed to
controvert both claims (injury and death) for compensation, as required by
Section 45 of the Workmen's Compensation Act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By reason of such failure petitioner waived his right to present
evidence concerning the claims and therefore cannot complain that he was not
duly heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances the
hearing officer could make the award without the necessity of <span style="">a </span>formal hearing, treating the claim
as uncontested and thus dispensing with the reception of evidence."</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even in the absence of
such controlling precedents, the same conclusion would inescapably emerge, if
there were a keener appreciation on the part of petitioner of what procedural
due process requires.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For in this assignment
of error, which would predicate the absence of jurisdiction over its person, in
view of the alleged absence of a formal service of summons, the stress on
technicality is most marked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due process
properly understood frowns on such an attitude, which negates what such a
concept has always stood for.</p>

<p class="BODY">Tersely put, due process is identified with fair­ness or
reasonableness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What transpired in this <span style="">case can </span>hardly be characterized as
unfair or unreasonable unless words have lost their meaning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was an admission in the petition as
well as in the brief of petitioner that the hearing officer did send to it by
registered mail a copy of the claim with a request that the accompanying forms
be submitted so that the matter could be properly passed upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner could not then thereafter disclaim
knowledge of the possible liability to which it could be subjected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had it complied with such a request and
abandoned its adamant stand, it could have been heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Independently of its failure to controvert
then, which had fatal consequences, it could not impute to the hearing officer
of respondent Commission <span style="">a </span>failure
to abide by the command of due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">To repeat, what was done under the circumstances was not an
affront to reason <span class="GramE">nor</span> <span style="">a </span>disregard of fair­ness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If it were such, then a serious procedural due process question would
have arisen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was done could have
been condemned as arbitrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would
have been marred by the absence of fair play which must exist for this cardinal
precept to be respected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could be
appropriately said that an unjust act would have been condoned contrary to its
mandate.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To reiterate, it was not error for respondent Commission to hold
that under the circumstances there was jurisdiction over the person of
petitioner, the due process argument being futile and unavailing.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The third and fourth
assigned errors would, now be <span class="GramE">considered,</span> the former
alleging that petitioner had not lost its right to controvert and the latter
impugning the jurisdiction of respondent Commission in view of the alleged
tardiness of the filing of the claim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither of the above alleged errors could rightfully be imputed to
respondent Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">To allege that the right to controvert could still be availed of
by petitioner would be to dis­regard the facts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner was correct of course in pointing to the claim of respondent <st1:city><st1:place>Segovia</st1:place></st1:city>
having been filed on <st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="5">May 20, 1963</st1:date>
or almost six years after he left its employ.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The verity of such allegation does not serve to defeat respondent
Segovia's right to compensation, in view of the undeniable absence of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we
have decided time and time again.</p>

<p class="BODY">Failure to controvert amounts to <span style="">a </span>waiver<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
or renunciation<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
or forfeiture<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
or loss of right<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
of the defense that the claim for compensation was not filed within the statutory
period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is undeniable is that
"the failure to controvert is fatal to its defense of the claim having
been filed out of time."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus the third and fourth alleged errors are exposed as <span class="SpellE">underserving</span>
of credence and belief.</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fifth error assigned
would assail the refusal of the respondent Commission to allow petitioner the
opportunity of introducing what it referred to as "its substantial
defense.”<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consider­ing the state of the
law as reflected in the above-cited controlling decisions, petitioner ought to
have known better.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was made clear,
after its failure to controvert, it could not thereafter raise the question of
being denied its day in court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nonetheless, if only for the purpose of demon­strating how
lacking in merit is the above assignment of error, reference may be made to the
appealed decision, inasmuch as the question of the alleged "substantial
defense" was likewise raised before respondent Commission as well as
before the hearing officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision
now sought to be reviewed made clear that the right to compensation of
respondent Segovia was "sufficiently established by the evidence adduced
during the <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> hearing of the
case."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Nor was such <span style="">a </span>conclusion
<span style="">a </span>mere expression of <span style="">a </span>predisposition on the part of
respondent Commission to look with favor on the claim of a sick employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had more than ample support in the
evidence as submitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "The
records show that the claimant was employed by the respondent in their Civil
Con­struction Department doing carpentry work and hauling logs from 1952 to
1955; and that, from 1956 to 1957, he was transferred to the work in the <span class="SpellE">drydock</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the <span class="SpellE">drydock</span>, he worked daily, six days a week, from 6:00 to
3:00 P.M. and, if he <span style="">was </span>not
relieved, he had to work for <span style="">a </span>total
of 16 hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their work at the <span class="SpellE">drydock</span> was to build canal as foundation for the walls of
the <span class="SpellE">drydock</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The canal was 140 feet long and 80 feet wide in square style.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After digging, they erected posts for the
walls and they had to dive or stay in the water four to six feet deep,
depending on whether it was low or high tide to nail those posts and that the
water in the canal was muddy, full of oil, paint and other matters used in
constructing the walls of the <span class="SpellE">drydock</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records likewise <span class="GramE">show,</span>
that at the time he was first employed by the respondent, he was free from any
illness because all its employees were required to undergo physical
examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since 1952, when he entered
the company, up to 1956, his chest x-rays showed no signs of P. T. B.; and it
was only in the year 1957 that his x-ray revealed that he had it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of this finding, he was hospita­lized
and was treated by Dr. Jose <span class="SpellE">Dungo</span> at the St. Joseph
Hospital for 38 days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After his release
from the hospital, he reported to their foreman, Felix <span class="SpellE">Jardinico</span>,
for work but the latter told him that he could not go back to his work because
he was found to be sick of tuberculosis.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Prior to his dismissal, he was earning a salary of P4.24 <span style="">a </span>day, working 6 days a week.”<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The decision under review then goes on in the next paragraph to
render clear beyond all doubt why under the circumstances above disclosed the
illness which unfortunately afflicted respondent Segovia was the result of or
was aggravated by the nature of his employment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the language of the decision: "Considering the nature and
conditions under which claimant had worked <span style="">as </span>stated above, the compensa­bility of the claim may be
sustained on the theory that the claimant's illness of P.T.B. was the result of
or was aggravated by the nature of his employment in the absence of proof to
the contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This gains support from
the fact that claimant, during the period of his said employment, was exposed
to the elements when he was in the Civil Construction Depart­ment and to the
variations of temperature and dirt in the muddy water of the canal when he was
assigned to work in the <span class="SpellE">drydock</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Again, petitioner ought to have been aware that under the
doctrine repeatedly announced by this Court, the above findings of <span style="">fact are </span>not for us to review or to
disregard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They bind us; we have to
accept their conclusive character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
would be different if there is no support in the proof offered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such is not the case however.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are based on the substantial evidence of
record.</p>

<p class="BODY">So our decisions have held with impressive unanimity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>
Transportation Co. v. Rivera,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court, speaking through <span style="">Justice
J. </span>B. L. Reyes, stated: "As <span style="">a
</span>general rule, findings of fact by the Industrial Court or the Workmen's Compensation
Commission are final and conclusive * * *, unless the lower court acted with
grave abuse of discretion, or said findings find absolutely no support in the
evidence on record, or are unsupported by substantial or credible evidence * *
*."</p>

<p class="BODY">Only last year, in <span style="">a
case </span>where petitioner was <span style="">a </span>party,
we rendered <span style="">a </span>decision,
speaking through Justice Castro, affirming such <span style="">a </span>ruling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "We
have consistently refused to reverse or modify the findings of fact made by the
WCC on the ground, here urged by company, that there is testi­monial evidence
on record contrary to the said findings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The WCC findings in the present case are supported by substantial
evidence on record and are therefore binding upon us."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The facts as thus found by the Commission and the <span class="GramE"><span style="">law </span>as thus
expounded by us demonstrate</span> rather conclusively why no further attention
need be paid to this particular alleged error.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even petitioner must have been aware of its far-from-persuasive
character as shown by its devoting only two pages of its rather comprehensive
brief to its discussion.</p>

<p class="BODY">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That leaves only the
second error assigned, which is an allegation that the decision rendered by the
hearing officer <span style="">as affirmed </span>by
the respondent Commission should not be considered <span style="">as final </span>and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering what has been already set forth,
this particular assignment of error is notable only for its futility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Try <span style="">as
</span>petitioner did, and its efforts were rather considerable, it could not
make out a case for its refusal to comply with its obligation under the
Workmen's Compensation Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The delay,
as already pointed out, has lasted long enough.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> character of the award
to re­spondent <st1:city><st1:place>Segovia</st1:place></st1:city> is beyond
question.</p>

<p class="BODY">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is <span style="">all </span>too clear then that not one of
the alleged errors <span class="GramE">wash</span> in fact committed by
respondent Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is all that
has to be said for re­spondent Segovia to be at long <span style="">last </span>freed from the nagging fear that what the law grants, a
technicality would suffice to deprive him of.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A further observation may not, however, be out of place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is need it seems, even at this late
date, for petitioner and other employers to be reminded of the high estate
accorded the Workmen's Compensation Act in the constitutional scheme of social
justice and protection to labor.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The distaste with which management faces the prospect of being
held <span class="SpellE">pecuniarily</span> liable under any circumstance is
understandable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, there
should be by now a greater receptivity to the claims of labor and certainly
much less reliance on objections grounded on technicality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the impression may be hard to
resist that the attitude betrayed by management is informed by hostility to the
basic pur­pose underlying the Workmen's Compensation Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">It cannot be denied that many of the amenities, which for those
who can afford it make life worth living, especially in this era of
industrialization, is obtained at too high a price in terms of the illness or
injury from which all too often there is no escape for the workers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That seems to be unavoidable with the use of
machinery, in itself an ever present danger to life and limb.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then too, the conditions of labor are usually
such that they impose a taxing, at times even intolerable, burden on the health
of those who toil.</p>

<p class="BODY">Labor thus in order to meet the daily needs must run such a
risk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the least then, provision
should be made to take care that if such harm does occur, it is not left <span class="SpellE">unprovided</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is
the justification for <span style="">a </span>statute
of this character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not afford <span style="">a </span>complete solution of course, but it
does mitigate an unavoidable evil by compensation for illness or injury,
possibly even death, incurred in the course of and arising from the performance
of one's task.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is the employer at the losing end of the bargain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if primarily the additional financial
liability <span style="">is </span>cast on him,
ultimately through the price he exacts for his products as well as through
resort to insurance, the cost is borne by the public.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that sense, there should be less hesitancy
on the part of the employer to pay the just claim of the laborer for any
illness or injury arising out of <span style="">and
in </span>the course of employment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Perhaps, more than in other labor disputes, promptness in the discharge
of obli­gation is of the essence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise the necessitous laborer is completely at his mercy, when what
he is en­titled to is not charity but justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is in the light of the above basic purpose that the constant
interpretation of the Workmen's Compensation Act has been liberal, all doubts
as to the right to com­pensation being resolved in favor of the employees and
all presumptions being indulged in their favor. Such <span style="">a </span>formulation was favored by this Court, through Justice Recto,
in a 1936 decision, just shortly after the Constitution took effect.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Since then, there has been <span style="">a </span>steadfast
adherence to such an approach.</p>

<p class="BODY">No other judicial attitude may be expected in the face of a
clearly expressed legislative determination which antedated the
constitutionally avowed concern for social justice and protection to
labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is </span>easily understandable why the judiciary frowns on resort to
doctrines, which even if deceptively plausible, would result in frustrating
such <span style="">a </span>national policy.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be more specific, the principle of social justice is in this
sphere strengthened and vitalized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
realistic view is that expressed in Agustin v. Work­men's Compensation
Commission: "As between a laborer, usually poor and unlettered, and the
employer, who has resources to secure able legal advice, the law has reason to
demand from the latter stricter compliance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Social justice in these cases is not equality but protection."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To repeat, courts should ever be on the alert lest through
inadvertence or faulty analysis the expected opposition from management be
appraised much more favorably than warranted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The unfortunate result would be that both the social justice concept and
the complementary constitutional command of protection to labor would be
disregarded and set at naught.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
no higher duty cast on the judiciary than to guard against such an undesirable
possibility, fraught <span style="">as </span>it is
with consequences truly to be deplored.</p>

Cf. "It is responsiveness to the supremacy of reason, obedience to the
dictates of justice. Nega­tively put, arbitrariness is ruled out and unfairness
avoided. To satisfy the due process requirement, official action, to paraphrase
<span class="SpellE">Cardozo</span>, must not outrun the bounds of reason and
result in sheer oppression. Due process is thus hostile to any official action
marred by lack of reasonableness. Correctly has it been identified as freedom
from <span class="GramE">arbitrariness.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is the embodi­ment of the sporting idea of fair play. It exacts fealty
‘to those strivings for justice' and judges the act of officialdom of whatever
branch 'in the light of reason drawn from considerations of fairness that
reflect [democratic] traditions of legal and political thought.'" (<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ermita-Malate</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hotel</st1:placetype>
