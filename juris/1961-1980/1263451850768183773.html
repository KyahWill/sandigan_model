				<BR><STRONG>ANGELES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The main issue in this appeal is, whether or not the call for
bids for the supply of steel and centrifugal cast iron pipes for the waterworks
projects in Manila and suburbs, and in the cities of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
and Iloilo, the National Waterworks &amp; Sewerage Authority (NAWASA) violated
the provisions of Repub­lic Act No. 912, section 1 of which provides <span style="">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 1. In construct­ion or repair work undertaken by the
Government, whether done di­rectly or through contract awards, Philippine made
materials and pro­ducts, whenever available, practi­cable and usable, and will serve
the purpose as equally well as foreign made products or materials, shall be
used in said construction or repair work, upon the proper certification of the
availability, practicability, usability and dura­bility of said materials or
products by the Director of the Bureau of Public Works and/or his
assistants."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the decision appealed from the Court of First Instance of
Manila has permanently enjoined the NAWASA from the procurement of the
materials needed for the projects involved which, according to the appellant,
are designed to alleviate the sufferings of the mill­ions of inhabitants in
said places where <span style="">there is a </span>crying need for <span style="">more water - an item so vital to human existence -
and the delay occasioned by the injunctions complained of, has in no little
way, further aggravated </span>the inconvenience of the consuming public in
said metro­politan areas where acute water crises have recurred through the
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, it is vehemently
contended by the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> that the declaration of an
econo­<span style="">mic national
policy as envisioned in the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> provision of
the law which, like the original "Flag Law</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">” </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">impressed with the clear nationalistic policy of giving preference to
locally produced materials and products, has been violated; and if this is so,
no amount of public clamor could justify the acts of the </span>NAWASA
complained of, for above all the supremacy of the <span style="">law must be </span>upheld.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have, therefore, examined the record of
this <span style="">case </span>with
these considerations fore­most in Our minds.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that the case, originally commenced <span style="">in the Court of First Instance of Manila, on
July 7, 1965, as a petition for declaratory relief for the </span>purpose of
securing a judicial pronouncement on the interpretation of the word
"practicable" as used in Republic Act No. 912, i.e., whether it means
that the cheapest materials among the locally produced or manufactured products
should be preferred and speci­fied in construction and repair works undertaken
by the Government, was later converted into an action for prohibition with
preliminary injunction through the process of supplemental pleadings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The corresponding complaint was filed on 19 July 1965, alleging
that the NAWASA had started to negotiate for direct purchase of centrifugally
cast iron pipes (CCI) for the improvement of the San Pablo Waterworks System in
violation of the provisions of Republic Act 912 and the law on public biddings,
excluding the C &amp; C Commercial Company, the plaintiff, which can supply
instead asbestos cement pressure pipes which are <u>available</u>, <u>practicable</u>
and <u>usable</u>, and will serve the purpose of the said project at a much
lower cost.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="6" month="8">6 August 1965</st1:date>,

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="8">16 August 1965</st1:date>,
as prayed for in the com­<span style="">plaint, the </span>court
issued a writ of preliminary in­junction restraining the NAWASA from further
nego­<span style="">tiating the purchase of </span>the
CCI pipes from the <span class="SpellE">inter­venor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 23 September 1965, the plaintiff and the NAWASA entered into <span style="">a </span>partial
stipulation of facts, on the basis of which and the additional evidence adduced
at the hearing, the court rendered a partial decision on 31 January 1966,
dismissing the complaint <span style="">insofar as the
San Pablo Waterworks System was con­cerned and dissolving the preliminary
injunction is­</span>sued <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">partial

<p class="BODY">On 10 August 1965, the plaintiff filed a <u>(First) supplemental

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="13" month="9">13 September 1965</st1:date>,
the NAWASA <u>advertised for bids for the </u><u><span style="">supply </span>of 30 to 42-inch steel pipes</u> for the use and

</span>On 10 November 1965, the C &amp; C Commercial Co. filed a <u>(Third)
supplemental complaint</u> seeking to restrain the NAWASA and its
representatives from holding the bidding under the aforementioned notice to
bid, <span style="">aver­</span>ring
identical facts as those alleged in the previous supplemental complaints, that
the call for bid for steel pipes for the Manila project and suburbs vio­lates
the provisions of Republic Act 912.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over
the objection of the defendant NAWASA, the supplemental complaint was admitted;
and as prayed for therein, <span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="11">20 November 1965</st1:date>,
a writ of preliminary injunction was issued restraining the NAWASA from holding

court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pending the case in the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, the NAWASA
filed three separate motions praying for the dissolu­tion of the preliminary
injunctive writs issued in connection with the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>,
Iloilo and Manila projects, pleading to the court to consider the crying need
for a more adequate supply of water <span style="">in </span>those cities, par­ticularly in the City
of Manila and its suburbs, where the lack of adequate supply of potable water
has been a recurrent crisis which affected to <span style="">a </span>dangerous ex­tent, the health and
the life of the inhabitants, and that the continuation of the injunctive writs
may bring about the cancellation of the $20,200,000.00 loan of the NAWASA from
the World Bank, which would result from the failure of the NAWASA to comply
with the for­mulated work schedule of the waterworks projects, which under the
agreement with the World Bank, has to be completed in the month of October
1967; but the court failed to take any action on the motions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Parodying Shakespeare, "Set honor in one
eye, and death in the other, and I will look on both indifferently."</p>

<p class="BODY">After a trial of the case, of 15 August 1966, the court rendered
a decision finding and concluding that the act of the NAWASA in specifying
steel pipes for the project of the City of Manila and its suburbs, and in
awarding the contracts for the supply of steel pipes in the cases of the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> and Iloilo Waterworks System, constituted a violation
of the provisions of Republic Act 912; the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the de­cision reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the supplemental com­plaint, making
permanent the pre­liminary injunction dated Septem­ber 2, 1965, enjoining the
defend­ant or its representatives and agents from formalizing or imple­menting

Waterworks Pro­ject in respect of the award of pipes to be used therein;
rescind­ing the award made in favor of <span class="SpellE">Tirso</span> del
Rosario; and ordering the re­appraisal of the bids with a view to complying
with the provisions of Re­public Act No. 912;</blockquote>

the issuance of <span style="">a </span>permanent injunction to enjoin the defendants or its agents
and representatives from formalizing the award of the contract for the fur­nishing
of 18" steel pipes for the Iloilo Waterworks System; ordering <span style="">a </span>new
bidding for the said project so as to include in the call for bids for the
supply and delivery of mate­rials, asbestos cement pipes, as well as CCI pipes;
and rescinding the award of the contract in favor of the Regal Trading
Corporation;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the third supplemental complaint, making
permanent the preliminary injunction dated December 14, 1965, or any other
subsequent date calling for imported steel pipes from 30" to 42" diameter
for the interim Development of Waterworks System for Manila and suburbs; and
ordering the defendant to specify asbestos cement pressure pipes for the said
project; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(d)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ordering the defendants to pay the
costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the decision, NAWASA appealed to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant contends that the provisions of Repub­lic Act 912, are
applicable only to construction or repair works undertaken by the
Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It argues, that since the
NAWASA, <span class="SpellE">tho</span> a public corporation, is not a municipal
corporation or agency of the State em­powered to regulate or administer the
local affairs of a town or city,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
nor one of the various arms of the government through which political authority
is made effective in the Islands, consequently, the NAWASA should not be
included within the meaning of the term "Government" as used in the
law.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
It is to be noted, however, that Section 2 of the Revised <span style="">Administrative </span>Code
defining the term "Government" which is heavily relied upon by the
appellant recognizes an exception:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"when a different meaning for the word or phrase is given <span style="">a </span>particular
statute or is plainly to be collected from the context or connection where the
term is used." In this context of the law, the term "govern­ment"
without any qualification as used in Republic Act 912, should be construed in
its implied sense and not in the strict signification of the term
"Government of the Philippines" as the political entity through which
political authority is exercised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
comparative analysis of Republic Act 912 and Commonw<span style="">ealth Act </span>138, otherwise known as the "Flag Law", the
latter "An Act to Give Native Products and Do­mestic Entities the
Preference in the Purchase of Articles for the Government”, and the former
"An Act to Require the Use, Under Certain Conditions, of Philippine Made
Materials or Products in Government Projects or Public Works Construction,
Whether Done Directly by the Government or Awarded thru Contracts",
discloses that both relate to the same subject matter and have the same
nationalistic purpose or object:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to give
preference to locally produced materials in purchases, works or projects of the
Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ob­servation that
Commonwealth Act 138 expressly includes <u>purchases by Government-owned
companies</u>, while Republic Act 912 merely relates to <u><span style="">con</span>s</u><u><span style="">truction o</span>r repair work done by the Government</u>, is no
argument for the proposi­tion that government-owned or controlled corporations
have been excepted from the operation of the latter law, for it is clear that
Commonwealth Act 138 also <span style="">ordains that </span>the
Purchase and Equipment Division of government-owned companies authorized to
purchase or contract for materials and supplies for public use, buildings, or
public works, shall give preference to locally produced materials or products.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being <span style="">statutes <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>pari</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>materia</u></span>, </span>they should be construed
together to attain the purpose of an expressed national policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it has been aptly stated:</p>

<blockquote>"On the presumption that when­ever the legislature enacts a
pro­vision it has in mind the previous statutes relating to the same sub­ject
matter, it is held that in the absence of any express repeal or amendment
therein, the new provision was enacted in accord with the legis­lative policy
embodied in <span style="">those prior statutes, and </span>they
all should be cons­trued together.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Provisions in an act which are omitted in another act re­lating to the
same subject matter will be applied in a proceeding under the other act, when
not inconsistent with its purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prior
statutes relating to the same subject <span style="">matter
</span>are to be compared with the new provisions; and if possible by
reasonable construction, both are to be construed that effect is given to every
provision of each.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Statutes <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>pari</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>materia</u></span>,
although in appa­rent conflict, are so far as reason­ably possible construed to
be in harmony with each other."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The main objective of the Government is to de­velop our domestic
industries so that the country will be economically self-sufficient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And both Com­monwealth Act 138 and Republic
Act 912 aim to contri­bute to the realization of the aforesaid nationalis­tic
policy by requiring the use of Philippine made products or materials, whenever <u>available</u>,
<u>practicable</u> and <u>usable</u> in government construction work or repair
projects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged conflict between the
two laws is more apparent than real, and should not be allowed to defeat the
purpose of these laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have to
declare, therefore, that, the NAWASA, like any other corporation exercising <span style="">proprietary or
governmental func­tions should </span>be deemed embraced within the term
"Go­vernment" found in Republic Act 912, and in the repair or
construction of their works or projects or the pur­chase of materials
therefore, local materials should be given preference whenever available,
practicable and usable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next issue for consideration is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did the NAWASA violate the provisions of
Republic Act 912?</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant vehemently denies the charge and de­cries the holding
of the lower court appealed from that in specifying steel pipes in the call for
bids for the supply of materials for the waterworks pro­jects under
consideration it had defied the mandate of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant insists that at the time it called
for bids for the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> project, followed by the call
for the supply of materials for the Iloilo project, herein <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
plant was only capable of producing asbestos cement pressure pipes up to 12
inches diameter; while at the time the call for bids for the supply of
materials for the Interim Project of Manila and suburbs was advertised, the
largest size of asbestos cement pipes available were of 24 inches being
produced at the time by another local manufacturer, the <span class="SpellE">Eternit</span>
Corporation, which never protested against the bids in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have reexamined the record of the case with painstaking
solicitude and, indeed, We find the facts indubitable and conclusive that the C
&amp; C Commercial Corporation had not theretofore and even up to the present
time ever produced pipes larger than 12 inches in diameter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
corporation has implicitly admitted this as a fact; and although it claims to
have a complete plant that is equipped with the necessary machinery,
technicians and skilled laborers capable of producing pipes in the sizes called
for in those bids (18 to 42 inches in diameter) had the NAWASA spe­cified them
in asbestos cement, the weakness of the argument is at once exposed by a mere
examination of the pertinent evidence adduced during the trial of the case on
this particular point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim is
belied by <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> del Rosario, a staff civil
engineer of the NAWASA, who testified as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Q. -<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place><st1:city>Engineer</st1:city>
 <st1:state>Del</st1:state></st1:place> <st1:city><st1:place>Rosario</st1:place></st1:city>,

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A. -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We based on <span class="SpellE">NAWASA's</span>
experience, we have purchased only sizes up to 12 inches, but on certifica­tion
of the Bureau of Public Works, a report has been submitted to us that asbestos
cement pressure pipes (is) <span style="">b</span>eing
manufactured by one lo­cal manufacturing company in the Philippines, the <span class="SpellE">Eternit</span> Corpora­tion, which is a pipe manufacturer, and <span style="">we </span>have recently purchased pipes for
the Manila interim project of sizes up to 24 inches non-pressure pipes.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q. -<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is there any other local manufacturer of
asbestos cement pressure pipes besides C &amp; C Commercial Corporation?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A. -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>N</span>one,
sir, only the C &amp; C Commercial Corporation.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

and the specification engineer, member-secretary of the <span style="">Pre-Qualifications </span>Committee and the present chairman of all the
bidding committees of the NAWASA, do you know if C &amp; C Commercial
Corporation, the plaintiff herein, is manufactur­ing asbestos cement pressure
pipes from sizes thirty inches and up in diameter?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A. -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The company does not manufacture size beyond
twelve inches.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q. -<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why do you say that the C &amp; C Commercial
Corporation is not manufacturing asbestos cement pressure pipes beyond twelve
inches?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A. -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because we had bi-yearly inspection of all
local plants here as a mat­ter of policy of the committee to determine the
capacity or capability of the local manufactures to supply, and even to
bid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So every six months the
pre-qualifications committee in collaboration with the procurement inspects all
the facilities of the chemical producing plant, this cast iron and asbestos
plant, the galvanized iron pipe plant, these are regularly inspected every six
months and so the pre-qualifications would know what is available."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">And the foregoing testimony relative to
the “non-availability" of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> products in
sizes above 12 inches in diameter was corroborated by Mrs. Clara Reyes Pastor,
herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> corporation's President, who declared
as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing testimony of witnesses, and in the light of
other evidence submitted by the par­ties, the following may be deduced:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that it <span style="">is </span>the practice of the NAWASA - which We find both practical and
logical - to send out its own men to the <span style="">various local </span>manufacturing plants for the purpose of knowing <span style="">the availability </span>of materials needed
for <span style="">its projects; that at </span>the
time it specified 18 and 24 inches diameter steel pipes for the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> and Iloilo waterworks projects, there were no locally
produced materials in <span style="">said sizes; </span>and
that with respect to <span style="">those sizes that
were already available, the NAWASA has actually spe­cified and used them in
various </span>other construction <span style="">and
repair </span>works even without the certification of the <span style="">Director of Public Works.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We really do not see Our way clear how </span>herein
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> could have charged that the NAWASA had
discriminated against its products un­der the circumstances when its own president
admits that it has supplied the NAWASA <span style="">before
locally pro­duced asbestos cement pressure pipes up to 12 inches </span>diameter
only and all those with diameters above 12 inches were of foreign
manufacture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence, therefore, is
conclusive that locally produced as­bestos pipes above 12 inches in diameter
were not available for purposes of claiming any preference under the provisions
of Republic Act 912.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this conclusion
becomes even more cogent if <span style="">We </span>are to consider the fact that C &amp; C Commercial Corporation
failed to produce the necessary certification from the Director of Public Works
to show that its pro­ducts were already certified as available, practi­cable
and usable at the time that the call for bids for the supply of materials for
the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, Iloilo and Manila Interim projects were
made to give some semblance of the right it claims to have been viola­ted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> points out the fact
that it has subsequently secured the necessary certification from the Director
of Public Works certifying to the availability, practicability, usability and
durability of the asbestos cement pressure pipes produced from its plant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree, and there should be no quarrel at
all that with respect to pipes of 4 to 12 inches in diameter which it is actually
producing now, the preference claimed under the law may be allowed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be that as it may, however, the certification
referred to did not in any way improve its position; for the stubborn fact
still remains that at the time said certification was issued on July 6, 1966, C
&amp; C Commercial Corpo­ration <span style="">was </span>actually producing asbestos pipes up to
12 inches only, which its existing equipment or machinery, when inspected by a
representative of the Office that issued the certification, was found capable
of producing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, We cannot subscribe
to the holding of the court below that locally produced asbestos cement pipes
above 12 inches in diameter may be considered "avail­able" within the
meaning of Republic Act 912 simply because the President of herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> corporation had manifested or promised that <span style="">it </span>can
procure bigger <span class="SpellE">mandrils</span> worth $25,000.00 from abroad
and will be able to produce pipes in the larger sizes called for in the
questioned bids shortly after their installation, for that would be giving the
term "available" a very strained meaning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would really be unfair to re­quire in
order to be "available" within the meaning of the law that herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> should have in stock the sizes of pipes called for
in the bids in the <span style="">quan­tity </span>needed
by the appellant; but We cannot also be­lieve, by any stretch of the
imagination, that the Director of Public Works would certify to the avail­ability,
practicability, usability and durability of certain products even before the
machinery, equip­ment or tools needed to produce said products are actually
bought from abroad and installed in its plant by the manufacturer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Statutes granting advantages to private persons have in many
instances created special privileges or monopolies for the grantees and thus
have been viewed with suspicion and strictly construed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is alto­gether appropriate in the
majority of situations, for if public advantage is gained by the grant, it
normally appears to be of secondary significance compared with the advantage
gained <span style="">by </span>the grantee.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
And rights which exist only by virtue of such statutes come into being only
after strict compliance with all the condi­tions found in those statutes.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
These rules should apply to the case at bar where the law invoked grants a
preference to locally produced products or materials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since Republic Act 912 grants preference only
upon the certification of availability, practicability and usa­bility of
locally produced materials by the Director of Public Works, that certification
must be existing and effective before any right arising <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
may be claimed to have been violated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Notwithstanding the clear nationalistic policy of the law
aforementioned, We cannot, by any mistaken sympathy towards herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, recognize the existence of its right under the
law alleged to have been violated, which C &amp; C Com­mercial Corporation has
miserably failed to prove in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the Interim Project for the City of Manila and
its suburbs, it would seem that the decision appealed from had virtually become
moot and academic by reason of the passage of Republic Act 4858 which
authorizes the President to allow the procurement of supplies necessary for the
rehabilitation of the project as an exception to the restrictions and
preferences provided for in Republic Act 912, and the President appears to have
authorized the General Mana­ger of the NAWASA under the said statutory power to
purchase all the pipes and materials necessary for the project by negotiated
sales.</p>

<p class="BODY">For all the foregoing, We find it unnecessary to discuss further
the other errors assigned by the appel­lant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby set aside,
with costs against the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The writs of preliminary injunctions issued
by the lower court are set aside, and declared null and void.</p>
