of <span class="SpellE">Daet</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte
until the full amount is paid, with costs against plaintiff-appellant,"
must be affirmed in the light of the unusual, unique and abnormal circumstances
obtaining in this case where the complaint for condemnation was filed on August
9, 1962 or seventeen (17) years ago but up to the present, the petitioner
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Daet</span> has failed to make the deposit
required to take possession of the property sought to be expropriated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Daet</span> instituted

genuine necessity for the proposed expropriation, still the petitioner cannot,

ways and means by which the commissioners could ascertain the fair market value
of the property subject of this proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There are two basic approaches used in the appraisal of land sought to
be condemned - the sale approach, and the income approach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The commissioners as well as the counsels of
both parties agreed to use the sale approach.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In order to enable the counsels of both parties, as well as the
commissioners, to gather or secure documents regarding transactions of real property
which the commissioners might use as guide in determining the fair market
value, the parties agreed to postpone the hearing to <st1:date year="1969" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1969</st1:date>, at <st1:time minute="30" hour="18">6:30</st1:time>

<span class="SpellE">Poco</span>, to see Mr. Jose <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>,
the representative of Mr. William Lee, for the purpose of making an offer to
buy the land subject of this proceeding for a price of P120.00 per square
meter, and P30,000.00 for the structure thereon; that he had talked with Mr.
Jose <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>, for the same purpose, on several occasions
5 or 6 times, the last was sometime in the first week of May, this year wherein
he offered to pay as high as P150.00 per square meter, and P50,000.00 for the
structure thereon; and that Mr. <span class="SpellE">Ty</span> <span class="SpellE">Poco</span>, having been born in Mercedes, and resided here since
birth, was desirous of buying said property because he intends to build a
memorial thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel likewise
presented Mr. Jose <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> as witness to corroborate the
testimony of Lo Chin.</blockquote>

held by the commissioners, Atty. Ernesto de Jesus, who is the incumbent
provincial assessor, dig up the records in his office for the purpose of
finding, in addition to the exhibits already presented, other documents
covering transactions of properties located within the areas near the land
sought to be condemned, but failed to locate even a single document.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the commissioners have no other
recourse but to base their appraisal of the value of the land under
consideration from the Exhibits submitted by the parties.</blockquote>

67, of the Rules of Court, just compensation is to be determined as of the date

of the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The offer of Mr. Jesus
<span class="SpellE">Ty</span> <span class="SpellE">Poco</span> could not also be
considered because the same was made by one who was under an imperative

<blockquote>After all the
exhibits submitted by the plaintiff had been examined by the commissioners, and
upon a conscientious and analytical study of the sales of land near the land
subject of this proceeding, and after serious deliberations on the matter, the
commissioners agreed that, in the year 1962, the reasonable or fair market
value of the land subject of this pro­ceeding should be P60.00 per square

<p class="BODY">Prior to the promulgation of the Rules of 1940, however, there is
another case that touched on the question of time when valuation of the
property taken should be fixed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
the case of <u>Provincial Government of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Caro</span> de <span class="SpellE">Araullo</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> a
1938 case, where the value of the property therein involved was fixed as of the
date when it was taken in 1927 and not at the time of the filing of the
complaint in 1928.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This ruling was
reiterated in <u>Republic vs. Lara</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
a 1954 case, where it was held that the value of the lands expropriated must be
reckoned as of the time of the actual possession by the Government in 1946 and
not as of the time of the filing of the complaint in 1949.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such was the ruling notwithstanding the fact
that the Rules of 1940 was al­ready in force and effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In explaining the ruling, the Court therein
held:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Ordinarily,
inquiry is limited to actual market values at the time of the institution of
the condemnation proceedings because under normal circumstances, the filing of
the complaint coincides or even precedes the taking of the property by the
plaintiff; and Rule 69 simply fixes this convenient date for the valuation of
property sought to be expropriated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Where, however, the actual taking or occupation by the plaintiff, with
the consent of the landowner long precedes the filing of the complaint for
expropriation the rule to be followed must still be that enunciated by us in
Provincial Government of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Caro</span>, <u>supra</u>, that 'that value of the pro­perty
should be fixed as of the date when it was taken and not of the date of the
filing of the proceedings.' For where property is taken ahead of the filing of
the condemnation proceedings, the value thereof may be enhanced by the public
purpose for which it is taken, the entry of the plaintiff upon the property may
have depreciated its value thereby, or there may have been a natural increase
in the value of the property from the time it is taken to the time the
complaint is filed, due to general economic conditions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The owner of the private property should be
compensated only for what he actually loses, it is not intended that his
compensation shall extend beyond his loss or injury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And what he loses is only the actual value of
his property at the time it is taken.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is the only way the compensation to be paid can be truly just,
i.e., 'just' not only to the individual whose property is taken, 'but to the
public, which is to pay for it.' (18 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>. 873,
874)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Subsequent cases where the taking preceded the filing of the
expropriation proceedings followed the doctrine in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Caro</u></span>
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These cases were:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Republic vs. <span class="SpellE">Garcellano</span>,

where the expropriation proceeding preceded the taking, it was held that the
value of "the property to be considered are those <u>at the beginning</u>
of the expropriation" and not accordingly at the time of the taking of
said property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason, this
Court fittingly saw the need to clarify the departure of some cases from the
mandate of Section 5, Rule 69 of the Rules of Court of 1940 (now Section 4,
Rule 67 of the Revised Rules of Court) in the case of Republic of the
Philippines vs. Philippine National Bank,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
where it was held:</p>

<blockquote>"It is apparent from the foregoing that, when plaintiff takes
possession <u>before</u> the institution of the condemnation proceedings, the
value should be fixed as of the time of the taking of the said possession not
the filing of the complaint, and the <u>latter</u> should be the basis for the
determination of the value, when the taking of the property involved coincides
with or is <u>subsequent</u> to, the commencement of the proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, otherwise, the provision of Rule 69,
Section 5, directing that compensation "be determined as of the date of
the filing of the complaint," would never be operative."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Capitol Subdivision, Inc. vs. Province of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental</u>, 7 SCRA 60, the Court said that
"Since the right of the Province of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental to expropriate the lot in question in the present case is not
contested, the owner of said lot is entitled to recover from said province the
fair and full value of the lot, as of the time when possession thereof was
actually taken by the province, plus consequential damages - including
attorney's fees - from which the consequential benefits, if any, should be
deducted with interest at the legal rate, on the aggregate sum due to the owner
from and after the date of actual taking." And in the case of <u>J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; </u><st1:place><u>Co.</u></st1:place><u>, Inc.
vs. Land Tenure Administration</u>, 31 SCRA 413, the Court, speaking thru now <span class="SpellE">Chiep</span> Justice Fernando, reiterated the "well-settled
(rule) that just compensation means the equivalent for the value of the
property at the time of its taking.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Anything beyond that is more and anything short of that is less, than
just compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It means a fair and
full equivalent for the loss sustained, which is the measure of the indemnity,
not whatever gain would accrue to the expro­priating entity."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, it is a fact that there has been no taking of
the property prior to the institution of the condemnation proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it cannot even be said that the filing of
the complaint coincided with the taking of the property by the plaintiff
because the latter did not enter into possession of the property since it
failed or did not comply with the order of the Court requiring the municipality
to make the necessary deposit of the provisional value as fixed by the Court in
its Order of April 15, 1969.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
did not even move for a reconsideration of said Order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial proceeded and after hearing and
submission of evidence for both parties, the trial court rendered on December
2, 1969 its decision "fixing the reasonable value of the property sought
to be expropriated at P117.00 per square meter or for a total amount of Three
Hundred Seventeen Thousand Eight Hundred Eighty Nine Pesos (P317,889.00), and
the value of the improvement at Thirty Six Thousand Five Hundred Pesos
(P36,500.00), said amount x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
to bear interest at the legal rate from the date of the filing of the complaint

<p class="BODY">Still questioning the value determined by the trial court,
petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals and on <st1:date year="1972" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1972</st1:date>, the appellate court in its judgment
fixed the value of the property at P200.00 per square meter and P36,500.00 for
the improvement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not yet satisfied, the
municipality appealed to the Supreme Court and meantime took no step to take
possession of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While petitioner
submitted a Manifestation on September 15, 1977 to this Court invoking
Presidential Decree No. 42 dated November 9, 1972 and manifesting that it had
made a deposit to the Philippine National Bank in the amount of P54,370.00 as
per PNB Certificate No. 9381 dated February 9, 1973, We hold that petitioner
has not made the correct and proper deposit of the provisional value as fixed
by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is elementary
that Presidential Decree No. 42 of November 9, 1972 which grants the right to
take or enter upon the possession of the property sought to be expropriated if
he deposits with the Philippine National Bank an amount equivalent to the
assessed value of the property for purposes of taxation has no application to
the case at bar where the Court of Appeals had already fixed the value of the
property at P200.00 per square meter and P36,500.00 for the improvement in its
decision promulgated on October 18, 1972 about three weeks earlier than the
issuance of the Presidential Decree No. 42.</p>

<p class="BODY">By not complying with the orders of the trial court and the
appellate court, petitioner would benefit by its non-compliance and
dilly-dallying in taking posses­sion of the property which We will not sanction
or allow to the prejudice of the private respondent landowner who should not be
penalized by the protracted delay of petitioner in taking over the property
over a period of seventeen (17) years during which time private respondent was
deprived of the beneficial use of the land and the improvement thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner upon filing the complaint has the
duty to make the deposit in the amount provisionally ascertained and fixed by
the court (Sec. 2, Rule 67, Rules of Court), which deposit serves the double
purpose of pre-payment of the property if the same is finally expropriated and

respondent opposed as not being the proper procedure under the law to abate a

of the improvement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court re­solved

provisions of the new Civil Code in its Resolution of <st1:date year="1974" day="24" month="7">July 24, 1974</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records further disclose that in the Petition to Cite the Mayor
of the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Daet</span> (Herein Petitioner) in
Contempt of Court filed by private respondent on February 14, 1978, this Court
was informed that the petitioner acting thru its Mayor, Engineer Jose P. <span class="SpellE">Timoner</span>, started to demolish on February 6, 1978 the
building of the private respondent, attaching thereto photographs marked
Annexes 1 and 2 showing the building before and during the demolition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent prayed that the Mayor be
cited for contempt or alternatively, that the petitioner be ordered to deposit
with the Philip­pine National Bank the amount of P36,500.00 instead of
P28,830.00 to await the final outcome of this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Commenting on the petition to cite the Mayor in contempt of
court, petitioner again relies on Presidential Decree No. 42 alleging that the
assessed value of the property for taxation purposes is only P18,250.00 which
is less than the amount of P28,830.00 it had already deposited with the
Philippine National Bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">The above antecedent facts and circumstances of this case are
unusual, unique and abnormal such that by reason thereof, We agree with the
judgment of the Court of Appeals fixing the fair market value of the property
sought to be expropriated at P200.00 per sq. meter or for a total of FIVE
HUNDRED FORTY THREE THOU­SAND FOUR HUNDRED (P543,400.00) PESOS, and the value
of the improvement thereon at THIRTY SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED (P36,500.00)
PESOS, Philippine Currency, both amounts to bear legal interest from and after
the date of the actual taking of possession by the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Daet</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte until the
full amount is paid, with costs against plaintiff-appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the decision of the Court of Appeals fixing the
market value of the property to be that obtaining, at least, as of the date of the
rendition of the judgment on December 2, 1969 as prayed by private respondent,
which the Court fixed at P200.00 per square meter is in conformity with
doctrinal rulings herein-above cited that the value should be fixed as of the
time of the taking of the possession of the property because firstly, at the
time judgment was rendered on December 2, 1969, petitioner had not actually
taken possession of the property sought to be expropriated and secondly, We
find the valuation determined by the Court of Appeals to be just, fair and
reasonable.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the second assignment of error, petitioner faults the
respondent court in modifying, disregarding and amending its own decision in
CA-G.R. No. 32259-R which directed payment of just compensation to be determined
as of the date of the filing of the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner claims that this decision has long become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and it would be contrary to the doctrine of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> to

was expressly reserved by the Court of Appeals for the trial court to
determine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perforce, between the first
case wherein the judgment is rendered, and the second case wherein such
judgment is invoked, there is identity of parties but there is no identity of

the judgment is conclusive in the second case only to those matters actually

"declaring that plaintiff Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Daet</span>

public use described in the complaint, upon payment of just compensation <u>to

likewise consti­tute the <span class="SpellE">Iaw</span> of the case, which is a
doctrine closely akin to <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law of the case, as applied to a former

It differs from <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, this case is before the Supreme Court and being the

</span>(<span class="SpellE">Kabigting</span> vs. Acting Director of Prisons, 6
SCRA 281, 286).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's second
assignment of error is, therefore, without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first part of the third assignment of error hinges on what is
the proper procedure in determining the just compensation in expropriation
proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 5, Rule 67 of the Revised Rules of Court calls for the
appointment of not more than three (3) competent and disinterested persons as
commissioners to ascertain and report to the court the just compensation for
the property sought to be taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to
the extent of this function and power of the commissioners, this Court held in
Manila Railroad Company vs. Velasquez<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
that the commissioners' power is limited to assessing the value and determining
the amount of damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There it stops;
they can go no farther.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The value and
damages awarded must be a just compensation and no more and no less.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in fixing these amounts, the
commissioners are not to act <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>libitum</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are to discharge the trust reposed in
them according to well-established rules and form their judgment upon correct
legal principles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To deny this is to
place them where no one else in this country is placed, above the law and
beyond accountability.</p>

<p class="BODY">Corollary to this limitation, it has been held that reports
submitted by commissioners of appraisals in condemnation proceedings are not
binding, but merely advisory in character, as far as the court is concerned.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
An early case enunciated the rule that a Court of First Instance has the
undoubted right to reject the report of the commissioners as to the value of
the land, if the report is not founded upon legal evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judge has the undoubted right also to
discharge the commission and appoint a new one.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He also has the right to formulate an opinion of his own as to the value
of the land in question, nevertheless, if he formulates such an opinion, he
must base it upon competent evidence.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
When the commissioners' report is not in accordance with the law on the matter,
another case ruled that it cannot serve as the basis of the judicial decision
but must be annulled and set aside, and the case remanded to the court below
for reopening of trial.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
Then, in still other cases, it was held that a Court of First Instance or on
appeal, the Supreme Court may substitute its own estimate of value as gathered
from the record submitted to it, in cases where the only error of the
commissioners is that they have applied illegal principles to the evidence
submitted to them; or that they have disregarded a clear preponderance of
evidence; or that they have used an improper rule of assessment in arriving at
the amount of the award; provided always that the evidence be clear and
convincing and the amount allowed by the commissioners is grossly inadequate or
excessive.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">That the commissioners' report is not final and conclusive, but
merely recommendatory is bolstered by the requirement in Section 8, Rule 67 of
the Revised Rules of Court of conducting a hearing thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated, said provision requires
that upon the expiration of the period of ten (10) days within which all
interested parties may file their objects to the report, or even before the
expiration of such period if all interested parties have filed their objections
to the report or their statement of agreement therewith, the court must conduct
a hearing on the report.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of these basic provisions of the Rules of Court on
eminent domain and various jurisprudence on the function of the commissioners
as limited by the Court, We hold that the respondent Court of Appeals did not
err in giving credence to the appraiser employed by private respondent and in
disregarding the commissioners' report.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent court found that aside from being a civil engineer,
Aurelio B. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> is a licensed real estate broker
and appraiser of long standing, being one of the incorporators of C.M. Hoskins
and Co., Inc., a corporation engaged in real estate brokerage since October,
1938 and of which firm he is presently the Chairman of the board of
directors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With these qualifications,
respondent court committed no error in concluding that he was com­petent to
make the appraisal of the fair market value of the parcel of land under
consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although he does not
maintain an office in <span class="SpellE">Daet</span> nor does he appear to have
had any transactions in said locality, he is competent since a commercial
parcel of land retains the same characteristics whether it is located in Manila
or <span class="SpellE">Daet</span>, and the criterion for making an appraisal of
a parcel of land is universally applied, irrespective of the locality where it
is situated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And since the value of a
parcel of land taken by eminent domain is always a matter of opinion, the same
may be proved by opinion evidence of the real estate appraiser.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, We find substantial basis for the court to fix the value of the land at
P200.00 per square meter and the building at P36,500.00 as testified to by the
broker.</p>

is not a court distinct and separate from the others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jurisdiction is vested in the court, not in
the judges, so that when a complaint or information is filed before one branch
or judge, jurisdiction does not attach to said branch or judge alone, to the
exclusion of the others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Trial may be
had or proceedings may continue by and before another branch or judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is for this reason that Section 57 of the
Judiciary Act, expressly grants the Minister of Justice, upon recommendation of
the district Judge, the administrative right or power to apportion the cases
among the different branches, both for the convenience of the parties and the
coordination of the work by the different branches, and the judges presiding
each branch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The apportionment does not
involve a grant or limitation or jurisdiction; this continues to be vested in
the court of first instance of the province as a whole, and trial may be had by
any judge or branch of the court.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We do agree, however, that the apportionment of cases must be
respected by the judges in the interest of order and coordination in the
dispatch of cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the question of
whether Branch II took cognizance of a case properly belonging to another
branch is negated by the fact, pointed out by respondents, that Administrative
Order No. 472 of the Secretary of Justice dividing the Province of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte bet­ween Branch I and Branch II took effect
on January 1, 1971 long after Branch II had disposed of the case at bar because
said case was decided on December 2, 1969.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fourth assignment of error is clearly untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Presidential Decree No. 42 issued on <st1:date year="1972" day="9" month="11">November 9, 1972</st1:date> does not limit the
just compensation in expropriation proceedings to the assessed value of the
value sought to be condemned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By its
title alone, i.e., "Authorizing the Plaintiff in Eminent Domain
Proceedings to Take Possession of the Property Involved Upon Depositing the
Assessed Value for Purposes of Taxation," it can already be gleaned that
said decree fixes only the provisional value of the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a provisional value, "it does not
necessarily represent the true and correct value of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The value is only 'provisional' or
'tentative' to serve as the basis for the immediate occupancy of the property
being expropriated by the <span class="SpellE">condemnor</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This decree repealed Section 2, Rule 67 of the Revised Rules of
Court which imposed upon the court having jurisdiction of the proceeding with
the duty of ascertaining and fixing the provisional value of the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated in the said decree itself, the
repeal was necessary inasmuch as the "existing procedure for the exercise of
the right of eminent domain is not expeditious enough to enable the plaintiff
to take possession of the real property involved as soon as possible, when
needed for public purposes."</p>

<p class="BODY">Even in Presidential Decree No. 76, "Requiring All Persons,
Natural or Juridical, Owning or Administering Real Property, Including the
Improvements Thereon, to File Sworn Statement of the True Value of Such
Property," issued on <st1:date year="1972" day="6" month="12">December 6,
 1972</st1:date>, it is clearly stated that the just compensation is based on
the current and fair market value and not on the assessed value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent provisions state as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"For purposes of just compensation in cases of private
property acquired by the government for public use, the basis shall be the
current and fair market value as declared by the owner or administrator or such
market value as determined by the assessor, whichever is lower.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Under this Decree, the assessed valuation which shall be the
basis for payment of real property tax beginning the calendar year 1974 shall
be fifty per centum of the current fair market value, as determined by the
assessor, in case of commercial, industrial or mineral lands; forty per centum
in the case of agricultural lands and thirty per centum in the case of lands
for purely residential purposes."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Clearly, therefore, the assessed value of
a property constitutes only a percentage of its current fair market value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot, thus, be the direct basis of just
compensation in expropriation proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">But more importantly, this assignment of error is bereft of merit
because Presidential Decree No. 42 is inapplicable in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As pointed out by private respondent, it is a
cardinal rule of statutory construction that laws shall have only prospective
effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The provisional value of the
property in this case having already been fixed, the deposit on February 9,
1973 of the amount of P54,370.00 representing the assessed value of the land
and the deposit on October 21, 1977 of the amount of P25,830.00 representing
the assessed value of the improvement, both pursuant to the said decree, are
not sufficient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, said
amounts should be deducted from the total amount due to private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">To elucidate and clarify the judgment of this Court in affirming
the decision appealed from, We consider and hold that the demolition of the
building of private respondent standing on the land by the Municipal Mayor, <span class="SpellE">Engr</span>. Jose P. <span class="SpellE">Timoner</span> on February
14, 1978 constituted the actual taking of possession of the property sought to
be expropriated by the Municipality of Daet.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And from said date, <st1:date year="1978" day="14" month="2">February
 14, 1978</st1:date>, interest at the legal rate shall be paid by the
municipality until the full amount is paid.</p>
