				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Angela <span class="SpellE">Puruganan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Warnick</span> obtained on
<st1:date year="1950" day="26" month="9">September 26, 1950</st1:date> a P1<span class="GramE">,000</span>-loan from the Philippine National Bank, secured by a
real estate mortgage executed by them and registered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said debtors not having made any payment on
the loan, the Philippine National Bank filed on <st1:date year="1953" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1953</st1:date> a complaint before the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
to recover the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Puruganan</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Warnick</span> defaulted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After submission of evidence by the bank, the
court in its decision of December 22, 1953, ordered the aforesaid defendants to
pay jointly and severally the Philippine National Bank P1<span class="GramE">,414.85</span>
- the amount due the bank as of that day which already includes the principal,
the accrued interest, filing and sheriff's fees and the stipulated attorney’s
fees of P200 - plus daily interest, of P.1644 on the principal, until full
payment.</p>

<p class="BODY">To satisfy the judgment, the mortgage, which purportedly covered
a parcel of land situated in <st1:city><st1:place>San Juan</st1:place></st1:city>,
Barrio <span class="SpellE">Culao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dingras</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, was foreclosed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said property was thereupon sold at public
auction on <st1:date year="1955" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1955</st1:date>
for P1<span class="GramE">,814.45</span> to the Philippine National Bank as
highest bidder at the auction.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 15, 1963, the Philippine National Bank filed the
present complaint for revival and enforcement of the judgment of December 22,
1953, alleging, among others, that the property mortgaged was really a part of <span class="SpellE">Bimornay</span> River and thus, far from being owned by the
debtors-mortgagors, was beyond the commence of man; and that the judgment was
therefore, never really satisfied, since the debtors had no title to the land,
contrary to and in breach of their warranty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The bank sought to recover P2<span class="GramE">,220.83</span> - the
amount due as of <st1:date year="1963" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1963</st1:date>
plus P.1644 daily interest until payment is made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="1">January
 15, 1963</st1:date>, the Philippine National Bank asked for a writ of
preliminary attachment <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>,
alleging that the defendants were disposing or about to dispose of their
properties, to its prejudice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The writ
was, however, denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants answered that <span class="SpellE">Puruganan</span>
had always owned the land which she acquired from <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span>
Castro; that there was no breach of warranty because the land was not part of
public domain at the time the Philippine National Bank bought it; that if the <span class="SpellE">mortagaged</span> property was later overflowed by the river, it
was due to a fortuitous event for which they should not be held liable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants likewise argued that by <st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1963</st1:date> when revival was
sought, 10 years had lapsed and the action has prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a counterclaim they also prayed for P1<span class="GramE">,000</span> as actual damages and P500 attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="14" month="1">January 14, 1965</st1:date>,
after a pre-trial conference, the lower court dismissed the complaint,
declaring that the washing away of the land by the river was an act of God, for
which defendants were not liable; that if a warranty was breached, <span class="GramE">the</span> action to enforce the same within six months under Art.
1571, New Civil Code, had already prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court observed that the Philippine National Bank had its examiners
to see to it that the land sought to be mortgaged was worth the loan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It believed that the sheriff would not have
sold nor the Philippine National Bank bought the land, if it did not really
exist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this dismissal order, the
Philippine National Bank appealed to <span class="GramE">Us</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Philippine National Bank argues that the dismissal deprived
it of its right to adduce evidence in support of its complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find its position tenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the land mortgaged was really part of the
river as appellant alleges, then there could not have been a mortgage or sale
at public auction,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
for such property of the public domain would be outside the commerce of
man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, if the
defendants are right that the land did exist, as private land, and that defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Puruganan</span> was in
possession thereof as owner prior to and at the time of the loan, mortgage and
foreclosure, <span class="GramE">then</span> the judgment was properly
satisfied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is necessary then to
determine the truth as regards the respective allegations of the complaint and
the answer, and <span class="GramE">this calls</span> for trial on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed order of dismissal is here­by set
aside and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
