				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioners, surnamed Julian, seek review and reversal of the
judgment rendered by the Court of Appeals, in Case No. CA-32182-R, ordering the
dismissal of their complaint against the validity of the sale to respondents <span class="SpellE">Burnamans</span> of an undivided one-fourth (1/4) of urban Lot No.
9008 of the Cadastral Survey of <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, and reversing the decision of the Court of
First Instance of said province in its Civil Case No. 2609.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following facts were found by the Court of Appeals:</p>

<p class="BODY">The aforesaid lot was originally decreed in undivided halves, one
in favor of <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonoan</span>
(1/2) and the other half in favor of the five peti­tioners <span class="SpellE">Julians</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Dionicia</span>, Amador, <span class="SpellE">Escolastica</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>), as owners
in equal shares of said moiety.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> had in her possession Original
Certificate of Title No. 7139, covering the land in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she died on <st1:date year="1938" day="19" month="11">19 November 1938</st1:date>, the Cer­tificate passed to the
hands of her son, <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonoan</span>
@ <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> Hernando.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The land tax assessment was also in the name of <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span>,
but when she died, it was placed in the names of <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span>
Hernando (<span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonoan</span>) and
<span class="SpellE">Engracia</span> Hernando, her children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Engracia</span> was the
mother of the petitioners <span class="SpellE">Julians</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 4 May 1950, <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> executed a sworn
affidavit (Exhibit "A") adjudicating unto himself the entire half
interest of his mother, <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonoan</span>,
in Cadastral Lot No. 9008, as "her only legal heir the affiant named
herein who is her only child", and this sworn statement was entered,
recorded on the same day, and annotated on the back of the certificate of
title, subject to a 2-year reservation in favor of possible claimants, in <span class="GramE">conformity</span> with Rule 74 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the very same day, there was entered in
the Registry of Deeds a special power of attorney, executed by the <span class="SpellE">Julians</span> in favor of <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> as
their attorney-in-fact, empowering him to mortgage the principals' share and
interest to the Philippine National Bank.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This mortgage was executed the next day and, likewise, recorded.</p>

<p class="BODY">Six (6) years later, on <st1:date year="1956" day="7" month="4">7
 April 1956</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> ceded by way of
absolute sale -</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">all</span> his
rights, participation and interest over his entire share of one fourth unto
Nancy Warwick <span class="SpellE">Burnaman</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">for</span> the price of
P1,500.00 (Exhibit "2"), but the deed was not recorded.</p>

<p class="BODY">Eight months afterward, on 5 December 1956, <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bonoan</span>, or Hernando subscribed another deed of sale
(Exhibit "3") wherein, for a price of P2<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>
he conveyed unto the same vendee, Nancy W. <span class="SpellE">Burnaman</span>,
not one-fourth but an undivided half (1/2) interest of Lot 9008, stating in the
deed of sale that he was "the absolute owner and actual possessor of the
said undivided half interest in the above-described parcel of land".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This deed of sale was recorded on <st1:date year="1956" day="17" month="12">17 December 1956</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A new Certificate of Title No. T-4215 was
issued, with <st1:city><st1:place>Nancy</st1:place></st1:city> as owner of an
undivided half and with the <span class="SpellE">Julians</span> as holders of the
other half (Exhibit "7").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Original Certificate of Title No. 719 was cancelled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1957" day="2" month="1">2
 January 1957</st1:date>, at the instance of Nancy <span class="SpellE">Burnaman</span>,
the court ordered the cancellation of the two-year reservation in favor of
possible claimants, since more than two years had lapsed from the recording in
1950 of the extra judicial adjudication in favor of <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners <span class="SpellE">Julians</span> filed, on 18 July
1957, a complaint against Nancy <span class="SpellE">Burnaman</span>, her
husband, Ells J. <span class="SpellE">Burnaman</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span>
Hernando, seeking the avoidance of the <span style="">sale
</span>by the latter in so far as concerned a one-fourth (1/4) undivided
interest in the lot, on the basis that the original half owner, <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonoan</span>, died leaving two
children, <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Engracia</span>,
the latter being the mother of plaintiffs <span class="SpellE">Julians</span>;
that upon <span class="SpellE">Engracia's</span> death, her children, the <span style="">Ju</span>lia, became entitled to half of <span class="SpellE">Gregoria's</span> half interest (<span class="SpellE">i</span>. e.
1/4 of the whole) in addition to their recorded half share; that the <span class="SpellE">Burnamans</span> were duly informed of the <span class="SpellE">Julians</span>'
claim and were purchasers <span style="">in </span>bad
faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They prayed to be declared owners
of an undivided three-fourths (3/4) of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> No. 9008, and
to be awarded damages and other relief.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants <span class="SpellE">Burnamans</span> denied the
allegations of the complaint; pleaded good faith in their purchase from <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> Hernando and counterclaimed damages; while <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> answered admitting that <span class="SpellE">Engracia</span>
B. Hernando was his sister, but denied that she had any right or participation
in the land in question and pleaded that the lot was purchased with his
earnings as a soldier in the Philippine Scouts, and that his mother, <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span>, and his sister, <span class="SpellE">Engracia</span>,
had recognized his rights to the undivided half of Lot No. 9008 of the <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span> Cadastre.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the court of first instance found for the plaintiffs
<span class="SpellE">Julians</span>; declared them owners of an undivided 3/4 of
the lot; annulled <u>pro</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>tanto</u></span> the
adjudication in favor of <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span>, and his sale in favor
of the <span class="SpellE">Burnaman</span> spouses; ordered the cancellation of
Transfer Certificate of Title No. 4215; and ordered defendants to pay damages
at P5.00 per month from 6 December 1956.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon appeal by the defendants, the Court of Appeals found, in its
turn, that <span class="SpellE">Engracia</span> (mother of the <span class="SpellE">Julians</span>) was an illegitimate child of <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bonoan</span>, and was never recognized voluntarily or
compulsorily, by her mother; that her certificate of baptism on 16 April 1879,
even if considered a public document at the time it was issued, was incompetent
evidence of her acknowledgment; that not being acknowledged, expressly or
tacitly, she could not inherit from <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span>, unlike <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> who was acknowledged, according to <span class="SpellE">Dionicia</span> Julian <span class="SpellE">Cid's</span> testimony;
that <span class="SpellE">Cenon's</span> admission that <span class="SpellE">Engracia</span>
was his sister did not make the former an acknowledged natural child of his
mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals, likewise,
declared that the buyers acted in good faith, although this issue was
subordinate to the previous one.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Reversing the court of first instance, the appellate court decreed that
the <span class="SpellE">Julians</span>' complaint be dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this appeal.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The first attack <span class="SpellE">levelled</span> at the
appealed decision by petitioners-appellants is that, their action being
"an ordinary civil action on the ground of fraud" (Brief, page 10),
it was Improper for the appellate court to "make a declaration of <span class="SpellE">heirship</span> which is within the exclusive competence and
jurisdiction of the court in special proceedings," citing <span class="SpellE">Litam</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>, 100 Phil.
365.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants suffer from a misconception of the true purpose of the
inquiry by the Court of Appeals into the <span class="SpellE">filiation</span>
and status of their mother, <span class="SpellE">Engracia</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonoan</span> (or Hernando).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiffs, as claimants of an additional undivided fourth (1/4) of Lot
9008 are duty bound to rely on the strength of their title thereto, and not en
the weakness of the defendants' claim (Civil Code, Article 434; <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Lumber Co. vs. Director of Lands, 57 Phil
881).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the plaintiffs <span class="SpellE">Julians</span> based their title upon hereditary succession from
the original recorded owner, <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonoan</span>, through their mother, <span class="SpellE">Engracia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bonoan</span>, it was perfectly proper for the appellate
court to inquire whether <span class="SpellE">Engracia</span> was, or could be,
an heir of <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To be such heir, it is not enough that <span class="SpellE">Engracia</span>
was <span class="SpellE">Gregoria's</span> daughter; for not every child is
entitled to inherit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To succeed, a child
must be, under the rules of the Civil Code of 1889 (in force when <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> died in 1938), either a child legitimate,
legitimated, or adopted, or else an acknowledged natural child, for
illegitimates not natural are disqualified to inherit (Civil Code of 1889,
Article 807, 939).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As appel­lants' own
Exhibits "G" and "H" showed that both <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Engracia</span> were children of <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span>
but with father unknown, their legitimacy or <span class="SpellE">legitimation</span>
was out of the question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it
became imperative to ascertain whether <span class="SpellE">Engracia</span> was
properly acknowledged, assuming that her parents could marry each other when
she was conceived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Because
if <span class="SpellE">Engracia</span> was not recognized, she could not inherit
from her mother <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> and, consequently, could not
transmit to her own issue any <span class="SpellE">successional</span> rights to <span class="SpellE">Gregoria's</span> estate.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">The court of
first instance held that <span class="SpellE">Engracia</span> was deemed
acknowledged</span> by a public instrument, because her baptismal certificate
in the parish records was a public document before General Order No. 68 and Act
190; but the Court of Appeals correctly held that this' certificate did not
constitute a sufficient ac, Of acknowledgment since the: latter must be
executed by the child's father <span style="">or </span>mother,
and the parish priest can not acknowledge in their stead (Canales vs. <span class="SpellE">Arrogante</span>, 91 Phil. 6).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This action of the appellate court was not a <span style="">declara</span>tion of <span class="SpellE">heirship</span> but a testing
of the chain of title of herein petitioners-appellant plaintiffs in first
instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being no other evidence
of her acknowledgement, <span class="SpellE">Engracia</span> and her children
were properly refused a share in her mother's property.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> <span class="SpellE">Herrnando</span> (or <span class="SpellE">Bonoan</span>) admitted in
his answer that <span class="SpellE">Engracia</span> was his sister, but this
certainly is not an admission that she was <span class="GramE">a</span>
acknowledged by their common mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
acknowledgment is not a consequent of <span class="SpellE">filiation</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners also contest the finding in the decision of the Court
of <span class="SpellE">Apeellee</span><span style=""> </span>that
<span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonoan</span> was
acknowledged by his mother, <span class="SpellE">Engracia</span>; but they do
impugn the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Dionicia</span> Julian, cited by the
appellate court (Decision page 22), that he was acknowledged when their old
grandfather was sick in be At any rate, even if <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span>
was not properly acknowledged, that will not <span style="">help </span>plaintiffs-appellants' case at all; for it will not make <span class="SpellE">Engracia</span> an heir, and complaint must still be dismissed for
lack of a cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">The same thing can be said about the appellate court's finding
that <span class="SpellE">Burnamans</span> were purchasers in good faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if they were in bad faith, such fact
would be irrelevant for the purposes of the present case, since <span class="GramE">the are</span> not entitled to the proprietary interest that they
claim to have inherited through their mother, <span class="SpellE">Engracia</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question of <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
<span class="SpellE">Burnamans</span>' good <span style="">or
</span>'faith can be put in issue only by someone entitled to the ownership of
that Un­divided interest; <span class="GramE">either <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span>,
if he was properly acknowledged; and</span> if not by some other heir of <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span>, whether ascendant or collateral, who may be found
to <span style="">be </span>entitled thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other assignments of error, being mere consequence of those
here discussed, need not be separately resolved.</p>
