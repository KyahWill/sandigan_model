<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hence, on May 3, 1968,

THEM BY HEREIN PRIVATE RESPOND­ENTS."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that the allowance or denial of motions for
extensions of time is addressed mainly to the sound discretion of the
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is likewise axiomatic that
such discretion must be exercised "wisely and prudently, never
capriciously, with a view to substantial justice."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In this case, the Court of
Appeals denied petitioners' Motion for a 3rd extension to file their brief on
the ground that </span>said Motion was "filed 2 days late." This was
a clear misappre­hension of the facts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copy of the envelope containing that
3rd Petition bears two post office stamps, one postmarked <span class="SpellE">Binangonan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, dated February 16, 1968, and the other
post-marked Manila, dated February 20, 1968.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Since it is the date of mailing which is considered as the date of filing under
Section 1, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court, it is evident that petitioners' 3rd
Petition must be considered filed on February 16, 1968, or two days before the
last day, which was February 18, 1968.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The error was compounded when respondent Court denied the 4th Petition
for extension "it appearing that the earlier petition for a 3rd extension
had been denied."</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Court likewise denied on <st1:date year="1968" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1968</st1:date>, the petition for 4th extension on the
ground that up to then the appeal brief had not been filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As pointed out, however, by petitioners in
their Petition to Admit Plaintiffs-Appellants Brief dated <st1:date year="1968" day="21" month="3">March 21, 1968</st1:date>, they had actually filed their <span style="">printed Brief on </span><st1:date year="1968" day="20" month="3"><span style="">March 20, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">, three days before respondent Court's
Resolution dated </span><st1:date year="1968" day="23" month="3"><span style="">March 23, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The interests of substantial justice, therefore, mandate that
petitioners’ appeal be reinstated and their printed brief admitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Equally relevant in the resolution of this
case is the consideration that the expiration of the time to file brief, unlike
lateness in filing the notice of appeal, appeal bond or record on appeal is not
a jurisdictional matter.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Additionally, this case involves a land controversy and the brief
prese<span style="">nted</span> by petitioners
presents cogent reasons for hearing petitioners' side.</p>

<blockquote>"Suffice it to state that where there is no assertion or <span style="">showing whatsoever of any intent </span>to
delay on the part of appellant or of injury or prejudice to the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">appellee</span></span><span style="">, and valid special rea</span>sons are
presented for the granting of an additional extension within which to file the
appellant's <span style="">brief which in fact is
filed within </span>the requested extended period and such brief shows that it
is not perfunctory <span style="">but on the contrary
presents strong prima facie arguments for hearing the side of the appellant
instead of dismissing the appeal outright, the exercise of sound discretion
favors the granting of such extension of time in consonance with the settled
principle that judicial discretion must be exercised 'wisely and prudently,
never capriciously, with a view to substantial justice."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
