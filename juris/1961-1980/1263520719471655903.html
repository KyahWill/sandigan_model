				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for <i>certiorari</i> to annul an order, dated 28 March
1968, of the respondent judge, the Hon. Gregorio T. <span class="SpellE">Lantin</span>
of the Court of First Instance of Manila (Branch VII), deferring the
determination of a motion to dismiss <span style="">a
</span>complaint of a foreign corporation until the trial of the case on the
merits, the said respondent being of the opinion that the alleged lack of legal
capacity of the plaintiff to sue in Philippine courts, which was the ground
stated in the said motion, does not appear to be indubitable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition also prays that respondent Judge
be ordered to allow petitioners to present evidence upon the said ground.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent <span class="SpellE">Katoh</span>, &amp; Co.
Ltd., as plaintiff in the court below, alleged in its complaint (docketed as
Civil Case No. 70942) that it is a corporation duly organized and existing
under the laws of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
with head office in <st1:place><st1:city>Tokyo</st1:city>, <st1:country-region>Japan</st1:country-region></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint alleged ten (10) causes of
action against the defendants, the petitioners herein, Philippine Columbia
Enterprises Co., with principal place of business in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
and the general partners thereof, <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> Chin and <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> who reside in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These ten (10) causes of action are for the
collection of payment of ten (10) different shipments of angle bars, mild steel
bars and cold rolled steel sheets allegedly ordered in May, July, October and
November, 1966 by the defendants from the plaintiff which plaintiff had duly
shipped and defendants duly received but which defendants refused to pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint does not allege that plaintiff
has secured a license to transact business in the Philippines but it alleges
that it "has not been and is not engaged in business in the Philippines
and that the transactions averred in this complaint were exports made and
consummated in Tokyo, Japan in pursuance of international trade."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="22" month="11">22 November 1967</st1:date>,
the petitioners-defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the following
grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<st1:place>I<span class="GramE">.</span></st1:place><span class="GramE"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The</span> plaintiff has no legal capacity to
sue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>II<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The</span> complaint states no cause of
action because (a) it failed to allege facts showing plaintiff's capacity to
sue, as required by the Rules of Court, and (b) the contracts giving rise to
the obligations sought to be enforced by the complaint, are null and void for
being executed against prohibitory provisions of the Corporation Law."
Respondent-plaintiff opposed the dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The motion was heard in argument by the court on <st1:date year="1968" day="6" month="1">6 January 1968</st1:date>, with the court asking
the parties whether they wanted to present evidence on the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel for petitioners Columbia Enterprises
manifested his readiness to present evidence and asked the court to set a date
for the reception of evidence, while counsel for respondent <span class="SpellE">Katoh</span>
&amp; Co., Ltd., replied that he was leaving the matter to the pleasure of the
petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court gave five (5)
days to the petitioners to reply to the opposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said reply, petitioners averred that the
very causes of action alleged in the complaint constitute by themselves
transacting business in the Philippines by the plaintiff, <span style="">for by their contracts the goods were to be </span>delivered
<span style="">to, and be paid for in, the
Philippines; the transactions were characterized by their frequency and
continuity; and the amounts involved were substantial, <span class="SpellE">totalling</span>
P395<span class="GramE">,748.76</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners
again manifested their readiness to prove also that </span><span style="">respondent </span><span style="">company had been engaged in selling and
buying steel and other products for more than seven years in the Philippines,
that it maintains a regular office in the Philippines, and that the contracts
it had entered into were perfected and consummated in the Philippines pursuant
to orders solicited and negotiated by respondent company's representatives in
the Philippines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="15" month="1">15 January 1968</st1:date>,
respondent judge issued an order setting the hearing of the motion to dismiss
on <st1:date year="1968" day="27" month="1">27 January 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But on <st1:date year="1968" day="24" month="1">24 January 1968</st1:date>, respondent company filed a
"Rejoinder" to the "Reply" to the "Opposition to the
Motion to Dismiss", arguing that the ground stated in the motion to
dismiss does not appear to be indubitable.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the hearing on <st1:date year="1968" day="27" month="1">27
 January 1968</st1:date>, respondent judge announced that he will hear
petitioners' evidence but respondent company asked that reception of evidence
be deferred to another date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
agreement of the parties, the court ordered that the presentation of evidence
be set on <st1:date year="1968" day="22" month="2">22 February 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But on the date thus set, respondent company
objected to the reception of evidence and, after some argument, the court
suggested that respondent company file a motion to defer the hearing and the determination
of the motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1968" day="28" month="2">28 February 1968</st1:date>, respondent company
filed its motion, as suggested, and, on <st1:date year="1968" day="28" month="3">28
 March 1968</st1:date>, the respondent court, without receiving any evidence on
the motion to dismiss, issued the order complained of, deferring the
determination of the motion until the trial of the case on the merits because
the ground stated therein does not appear to be indubitable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners moved to reconsider, but their
motion was denied; hence, they filed the present petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
pursuing only the first ground, lack of capacity to sue, stated in their motion
to dismiss.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In issue in this case is
whether or not respondent-plaintiff's allegations in its complaint,
particularly in its ten (10) causes of action, constitute by <span class="GramE">themselves</span>
an admission that it is transacting business in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
allegations in the first cause of action, which may be considered as a sample
for all the rest, read, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">"II</p>

<blockquote>"That in or about July 1966, defendants ordered from plaintiff
angle bars valued at US$10,185.00 including consular fees and charges that
pursuant to said order, plaintiff shipped unto said defendant <span style="">on the </span>SS <span style="">'<span class="SpellE">Aminaka</span> <span class="SpellE">Maru</span>' on
or about November 9, 1966 said angle bars;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

already been disposed of and sold by them, said defendants having appropriated
the proceeds of said sale without applying <span style="">them to the payment of said shipment;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="">"</span>IV</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about November 15, 1966, plaintiff drew in Tokyo,
Japan upon defendants a D/A draft or bill of exchange for the sum of
US$10,185.00 covering the value or purchase price of said angle bars and
payable at 120 days after sight to the Tokai Bank, Ltd. of Tokyo, Japan, which
draft has been endorsed in due <span style="">course
to the Consolidated Bank &amp; Trust Corporation, Manila for collection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A white print copy of said draft is attached

defendants for payment but said defendants requested for extension of time to
pay said draft; that said extension of time was granted, whereupon said defendants
following banking routine, re-accepted said draft, same to be due as it became
due according to the tenor of said acceptance, on May 31, 1967;</blockquote>

of plaintiff;"</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Following the ten (10) causes of action,
the complaint alleged, as follows:</p>

FOREGOING CAUSES OF ACTION</span></p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the plaintiff in this case has not been
and is not engaged in business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and that the transactions averred in this complaint were exports made and
consummated in <st1:place><st1:city>Tokyo</st1:city>, <st1:country-region>Japan</st1:country-region></st1:place>
in pursuance of international trade;"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is petitioners' position that respondent company is
transacting business in the Philippines and that petitioners have evidence to
show that the transactions involved in the ten (10) causes of action were
transactions in the Philippines, apart from other activities of respondent
company in the Philippines, contrary to the allegations in the complaint; that
it was error and, in fact, abuse of discretion by the trial court in not
allowing them to present their evidence before proceeding to trial on the
merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They submit the proposition that
it is only after the parties have been permitted to present evidence that the
court may determine whether the ground of the motion to dismiss is indubitable
or not; that the court must receive evidence first before it can order the
deferment of the determination of a motion to dismiss under Section 3, Rule 16,
of the Rules of Court, which provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 3.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Hearing and order.</u></span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- After hearing the court may deny or grant
the motion or allow amendment of pleading, or may defer the hearing and
determination of the motion until the trial if the ground alleged therein does
not appear to be indubitable."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Cited in support of petitioners'
proposition is a comment in 1 Moran (Rules of Court) 429, that there must be a
hearing wherein the motion may be proved or disproved in accordance with Rule
133, Section 7, that is upon affidavits or depositions presented by the parties
but the court may direct that the matter be heard wholly or in part on oral tes<span style="">timony; and what was stated in <span class="SpellE">Asejo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Leonoso</span>, 78 Phil. 213,
that in denying or granting a motion to dismiss, or in deferring the hearing or
determination of a motion to dismiss if the ground does not appear to be
indubitable, there must be a hearing where the </span>parties should be allowed
to present evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be obvious, however, that a hearing with reception of
evidence is only indispensable when the motion to dismiss is ultimately ruled
upon and granted by the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">For such evidence is, as pointed out in the case cited by
petitioner (<span class="SpellE">Asejo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Leonoso</span>),
then necessary to enable the appellate court to resolve whether or not the
dismissal is warranted.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>But where
the trial court decides to defer the hearing, because the ground for the motion
to dismiss is not indubitable, there can be no appeal to the superior courts,
and the <u>ratio</u> for requiring a hearing with presentation of evidence does
not exist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What would be the sense of
receiving evidence if after all the hearing is to be deferred?</p>

<p class="BODY">It is settled that the court has discretion to <u>defer the
hearing</u> if the ground in the motion to dismiss is not indubitable;<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
although a deferment has been held to be in excess of jurisdiction if the
ground for the motion to dismiss were lack of jurisdiction,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
or lack of cause of action,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
for, in these events, the allegations in the complaint are deemed admitted for
purposes of the motion to dismiss so that it can be resolved without waiting
for the trial on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">If at all, where the court below might have committed an abuse of
discretion or excess of jurisdiction in this case could be in declaring that
the ground alleged in the motion to dismiss "does not appear to be
indubitable".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But not only does
petitioner not challenge this finding of the court <u>a quo</u> (as distinct
and separate from its claimed right to produce evidence at a preliminary
hearing), <span style="">but </span>the environmental
circumstances strongly point to its correctness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main ground of the motion to dismiss was
that the complaint does not allege a cause of action because plaintiff is not
licensed to do business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and its transactions constituted engaging in business within the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
so that the contracts sued upon became invalid and unenforceable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, an examination of the complaint will
show that the same expressly avers that the transactions upon which respondent
plaintiff is suing were "consummated in <st1:city><st1:place>Tokyo</st1:place></st1:city>"
and, hence, not in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners-defendants' assertion that the
contracts were made in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
squarely contradicts the averments in the complaint, and violates the basic and
well-known rule that whether a cause of action is pleaded or not must be
ascertained solely upon the face of the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, petitioners-defendants' position is
contradictory; it alleges that the complaint avers no cause of action because
petitioners' transactions were contracts made within the Philippines, contrary
to what the complaint pleads.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
inconsistency suffices to render the ground of the motion to dismiss
doubtful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it is by no means
clear or certain that the rule invoked by petitioner herein (that a foreign
corporation must obtain a license in order to be able to sue in this forum) was
intended to enable a Philippine entity to evade payment for goods it has
solicited and obtained from abroad.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the petitioners' averment that the plaintiff's transactions
were made in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
being contradictory of the complaint, can not be set up in a motion to dismiss
for lack of cause of action, but must be pleaded in an answer, any reception of
evidence on the point would merely duplicate the trial on the merits, and
should be deferred.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, conclude that the court below committed no abuse
of discretion amounting to excess of jurisdiction in resolving to defer action
on the motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Applicable
here are the considerations expressed by this Court in <span class="SpellE">Escaler</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> (L-23457, 16 December 1968), 26 SCRA
379 (at page 382):</p>

<blockquote>"True, by reason of the order complained of, petitioners will
be compelled to file their answer and go to trial, but We are of the opinion
that the orderly procedure established for the disposal of judicial cases
should be followed, there being no clear showing in this case that to do so
would cause unnecessary and substantial prejudice to one of the litigants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts of the case, as disclosed in the
petition under consideration, do not seem to demand a protracted and cumbersome
trial.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The last objection of the petitioners to the deferment order is
that if they file a counterclaim against respondent foreign corporation, they
would be recognizing the legal capacity of said corporation which they are
precisely questioning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fear is
without legal basis, for actions <u>by</u> foreign corporations are governed by
rules different from those in actions <u>against</u> them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A counterclaim partakes of the nature of a
complaint and/or cause of action against the plaintiff,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
so that if the petitioners-defendants should file a counterclaim, the private
respondent-plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Katoh</span> &amp; Co., Ltd., would be
a defendant thereto, in which case the said foreign corporation would not be
maintaining a suit and, consequently, Section 69 of the Corporation Law would
not <span style="">apply.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
