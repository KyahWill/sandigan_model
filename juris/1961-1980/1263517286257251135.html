Honorable Court, the above-named accused with deliberate intent to kill and
with out justifiable motive, <u>with</u> <u>treachery</u> and <u>evident</u> <u>premeditation</u>,
by conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one another in that the
accused Eduardo Bernal handed a firearm namely, a car­bine caliber .30, to
accused Ricardo Bernal, while in the dwelling of the offended parties and
taking advantage of night time and the slumber of the intended victims; and
disregarding any respect due to one of the victims who is an old man and being
his father-in-law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously
shoot one, Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Barro</span>, inflicting upon him
multiple gunshot wounds on the different parts of his body which caused his
instantaneous death; and on the same commission of Murder, the accused
conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one another, did then and there
willfully, unlawfully and feloniously assault and shot <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>

<p class="BODY">The controlling facts are these:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1965</st1:date>,
accused Ricardo Bernal, assisted by his counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> Pre, pleaded guilty to the foregoing
information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court withheld
sentence upon said Ricardo Bernal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">And this because his co-accused Eduardo Bernal, likewise assisted
by counsel, pleaded not guilty.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By reason of which, the hearing of the case as against the last named
accused was transferred.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the case against Eduardo Bernal came up for hearing on
January 13, 1966, the Provincial Fiscal moved for the provisional dismissal of
the case against him upon the ground that the evidence he had on hand was not
sufficient to convict said accused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Eduardo Bernal and his defense counsel both gave their consent to the
provisional dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereupon, the
case against Eduardo Bernal, was provisionally dismissed with one-half of the
costs <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>, and the Provincial
Warden was directed to <span class="GramE">effect</span> his release unless
detained for another case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day, January 13, 1966, the trial court promul­gated
its judgment upon the plea of guilty of Ricardo Bernal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court declared that the
circumstance of disregard of age of the victim, Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Barro</span>,
alleged in the information, is offset by the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
plea of guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court ruled,
however, that the "penalty imposable under Art. 248 of the Revised Penal
Code is reclusion temporal in its maximum period to death which, pursuant to
Article 48 of the same CODE, should be imposed in its maximum period." <span class="GramE">Because, as the court said, the crime committed by Ricardo Bernal
is "'murder with double frustrated murder."</span> The trial court
thereupon sentenced him to suffer the supreme penalty of death, to indemnify
the heirs of the deceased Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Barro</span> in the
amount of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and to pay one-half of the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two errors were assigned in the brief <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>First</u>
the lower court erred in ruling that the crime to which the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ricardo Bernal pleaded guilty is a complex
crime; and <u>second</u> the lower court erred in imposing the death penalty.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first error assigned
calls for a close scrutiny of the averments of the amended information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So examining, we find that the shots fired by
the accused - which caused the death of Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Barro</span>
and inflicted the almost fatal wounds to <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Barro</span> and like wounds inflicted on <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span>
<span class="SpellE">Carnate</span> <span class="SpellE">Barro</span> a were
distinct and separate acts on the part of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this, <i>we </i>are not alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both the brief of the accused and the
People's brief confirm this view.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our inquiry then is narrowed down to the application to the facts
of the provisions of Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, which
reads:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 48.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Penalty</u>
<u>for</u> <u>complex</u> <u>crimes</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- When a single act constitutes two or more grave or less grave
felonies, or when an offense is a necessary means for<i> </i>committing the
other, the penalty for the most serious crime shall be imposed, the same to be
applied in its maximum period."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not long ago in <u>People</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Pineda</u> (July 21,
1967), 20 SCRA 748, 751, we held that "Article 48 provides for two classes
of crimes where a single penalty is to be imposed:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>first, where a single act constitutes two or
more grave or less grave felonies (<span class="SpellE"><u>delito</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>compuesto</u></span> and, second, when an offense is a
necessary means for committing the other (<span class="SpellE"><u>delito</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>complejo</u></span>)."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Easily the grave offenses committed in the instant case were not
caused by one single act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither <i>was
</i>the murder committed by defendant Ricardo Bernal a necessary means for
committing each of the frustrated murders charged in the information or
vice-versa.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conclusion then is that
defendant is guilty of three separate crimes: one for the murder of Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Barro</span>; another, for the frustrated murder of <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Barro</span>; and a third, for
the frustrated murder of <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> <span class="SpellE">Carnate</span>
<span class="SpellE">Barro</span>.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We now come to the
problem of the penalty imposable.</p>

<p class="BODY">No evidence was taken by the trial court prior to the imposi­tion
of the penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are to be guided
solely by the averments of the information.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We note that on page 2 of the information (page 39 of the record below)<span class="GramE">,</span> the aggravating circumstances of nighttime and dwelling
were stricken off in ink and initialed.</p>

<p class="BODY">We first take up the crime of murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We take stock of the fact that in the body of
the information and in paragraph two thereof, averment is made that the
commission of the offense of murder in which Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Barro</span>
was the victim was attended by the aggra­vating circumstance of disregard of
said victim's age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court's
decision considered this circumstance offset by the plea of guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">But two other circumstances, treachery and evident preme­ditation,
are alleged in the main body of the amended information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of these two must be the qualifying
circumstance for the crime of murder.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And the other is to be considered as the remaining aggravating circumstance.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> <i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">The result is<i> </i>that there are two aggravating circumstances
to be taken against defendant, one of which is offset by the plea of
guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the case for the crime of
murder committed stands, there exists one qualifying circumstance and one
aggravating circum­stance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For lack of
necessary votes, however, we may not impose the death penalty for the crime of
murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">In reference to each of the two frustrated murders, two
circumstances are attendant:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>treachery
and evident premeditation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One qualifies
the crime, the other in aggravation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is, of course, the plea of guilty in mitigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, neither aggravating nor
mitigating circumstance may be considered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Indeterminate Sentence Law is applicable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The penalty imposable upon defendant ranges
from four (4) years, two (2) months and One (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span>
<u>correctional</u> to ten (10) years of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span>
<u>mayor</u>, as minimum, to a maximum of from ten (10) years and one (1) day
of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u> to twenty (20) years
of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>.</p>
