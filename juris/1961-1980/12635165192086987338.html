				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner here, as did petitioner in, Casco Philippine Chemical
Co., Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Gimenez</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
would seek a refund<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
from respondent Central Bank on the claim that it was exempt from the margin
fee under Republic Act No. 2609 for the importation of urea and formaldehyde,
as separate units, used for the production of synthetic glue, of which it was a
manufacturer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the specific
language of the Act speaks of "urea formaldehyde",<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and petitioner admittedly did import urea and formaldehyde separately, its plea
could be granted only if <span style="">we </span>could
construe the above provision of law to read "urea and
formaldehyde".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the above Casco
decision, we could not see our way clear to doing so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We still cannot see it that way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this petition must fail.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our inability to indulge petitioner in the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>
Casco petition was made clear by the present Chief Justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"Hence, 'urea formaldehyde' is clearly a finished product, which <span style="">is </span>patently distinct and different
from 'urea' and 'formaldehyde’, as separate articles used in the manufacture of
the synthetic resins known as 'urea formaldehyde'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner contends, however, that the bill
approved in Congress contained the copulative conjunction 'and' between the
terms 'urea' and 'formaldehyde', and that the members of Congress intended to
exempt 'urea' and 'formaldehyde' separately as essential elements in the
manufacture of the synthetic resin glue called 'urea formaldehyde', not the
latter as a finished product, citing in support of this view the statements made
on the floor of the Senate, during the consideration of the bill before said
House, by members thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, said
individual statements do not necessarily reflect the view of the Senate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much less do they indi­cate the intent of the
House of Representatives * * *.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, it is well settled that the enrolled bill - which uses the
term 'urea formaldehyde' instead of 'urea and formaldehyde' - is conclusive
upon the courts as regards the tenor of the measure passed by Congress and
approved by the President * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
there has been any mistake in the printing of the bill before it was certified
by the officers of Congress and approved by the Executive - on which <span style="">we </span>cannot
speculate, without jeopardizing the principle of separation of powers and
undermining one of the cornerstones of our democratic system - the remedy is by
amendment or curative legislation, not by judicial decree."</p>

<p class="BODY">To which we can only add that deference to the scope and
implication of the function entrusted by the Constitution to the judiciary
leaves us no other alternative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
nothing is better, settled than that the first and fundamental duty of courts
is to apply the law as they find it, not as they would like it to be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fidelity to such a task precludes
construction or interpretation, unless application is impossible or inadequate
without it.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Such is not the case in the situation presented here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we have held in Casco Philippine Chemical
Co., Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Gimenez</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We do so again.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, again, there is merit in the contention of the
Solicitor-General, as counsel for respondent Central Bank, and the Auditor General,
that as a refund undoubtedly partakes of a nature of an exemption, it cannot be
allowed unless granted in the most explicit and categorical language.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was held by us in Commissioner of Internal
Revenue v. Guerrero:<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
"From 1906, in Catholic Church vs. Hastings to 1966, in <span class="SpellE">Esso</span> Standard Eastern, Inc. vs. Acting Commissioner of
Customs, it has been the constant and uniform holding that exemption from
taxation is not favored and is never presumed, so that if granted it must be
strictly construed against the taxpayer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Affirmatively put, the law frowns on exemption from <span class="GramE">taxation,</span>
hence, an exempting provision should be construed <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">strictissimi</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>juris</u></span>."
</span>Certainly, whatever may be said of the statutory language found in
Republic Act 2609, it would be going too far to assert that there was such a
clear and manifest intention of legislative will as to compel such a refund.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">One last matter.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner would assail as devoid of support
in law the action taken by the respondent Auditor-General in an <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> to the respondent Central Bank<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
causing it to over­rule its previous resolution and to adopt the view in such <span class="SpellE">indorse­ment</span> to the effect that the importation of urea and
of formaldehyde, as separate units, did not come within the purview of the
statutory language that granted such exemption.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It does not admit of doubt that the respondent Auditor-General's
interpretation amounts to a literal adherence to the statute as enacted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, it cannot be said to be contrary to
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, it is any
other view, as is evident from the <span class="GramE">above, that</span> is
susceptible to well-founded, criticism, as lacking legal basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, the respondent
Auditor-General was merely complying with his duty in thus calling the
attention of respondent Central Bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">The limit of his constitutional function was clearly set forth in
Guevara v. <span class="SpellE">Gimenez</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
the opinion being rendered by the present Chief Justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Under our Constitution, the authority of the Auditor General, in
connection with expenditures of the Government is limited to the auditing of
expenditures of funds or property pertaining to, or held in trust by, the
Government or the provinces or municipalities thereof (Article XI, section 2,
of the Constitution).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such function is
limited to a determination of whether there is a law appropriating funds for a
given purpose; whether a contract, made by the proper officer, has been entered
into in conformity with said appropriation law; whether the goods or services
covered by said contract have been delivered or rendered in pursuance of the
provisions thereof, as attested to by the proper officer; and whether payment <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> has been Authorized by the officials of the corresponding
department or bureau.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If these
requirements have been fulfilled, it is the ministerial duty of the Auditor
General to approve and pass in audit the voucher and treasury warrant for said
payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has no discretion or
authority to disapprove said payment upon the ground that the aforementioned
contract was un­wise or that the amount stipulated thereon is
unreasonable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he entertains such
belief, he may do no more than discharge the duty imposed upon him by the
Constitution (Article XI, section 2), 'to bring to the attention of the proper
administrative officer expendi­tures of funds or property which, in his
opinion, are irregular, unnecessary, excessive or extravagant'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This duty implies a negation of the power to
refuse and disapprove payment of such expenditures, for its disapproval, if he
had authority <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, would bring to the attention
of the aforementioned administrative officer the reasons for the adverse action
thus taken by the General Auditing office, and, hence, render the imposition of
said duty unnecessary."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the same way that the Auditor General, by virtue of the above
function, which is intended to implement the constitutional mandate that no
money can be paid out of the treasury except in the pursuance of appropriation
made by law,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
must carefully see to it that there is in fact such statutory enactment, no
refund, which likewise represents a diminution of public funds in the treasury,
should be allowed unless the law clearly so provides.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Auditor General would be sadly remiss in
the discharge of his responsibility under the Constitution if, having the
statute before him, he allows such a refund when, under the terms thereof, it
cannot be done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His actuation here
cannot be stigmatized as <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of any legal
precept; as a matter of fact, it is precisely in accordance with the
constitutional mandate.</p>
