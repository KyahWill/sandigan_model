<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">inculpatory</span> facts show that at
about 12:30 o'clock in the afternoon of July 14, 1968, while the deceased
Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Orquina</span>, his brother <span class="SpellE">Pompio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Orquina</span>, Claudio Mendez, <span class="SpellE">Armingol</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ugay</span>, Arturo <span class="SpellE">Ugay</span>, and

arrived and belligerently demanded from those present whether "<span class="SpellE">Bayo</span>" and "<span class="SpellE">Pato</span>",
the sons of "<span class="SpellE">Kijaw</span>",<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>

The deceased Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Orquina</span> stood up and mollified
Simeon <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span>, saying that his brothers were not
there and that only he and <span class="SpellE">Pompio</span> were present and
that they had nothing to do with the "incident"<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> concerning

municipal policeman of <span class="SpellE">Bacuag</span>, also stood up and
pacified Simeon <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span>, who then put away his bolo
and joined the group in drinking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not
long thereafter, a commotion took place at the "<span class="SpellE">tabo</span>-an"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Orquina</span> went ahead of his
brother <span class="SpellE">Pompio</span> who stayed behind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Orquina</span>
was on his way to their jeep parked near the market place, Max <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span>, a son of Simeon, approached him and asked for a
cigarette.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Orquina</span> replied that he had none, Max <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span>
pushed and kicked him in the buttocks.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Orquina</span> did not retaliate as Max <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span> was armed with a piece of wood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, he ran around the jeep to elude Max <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span>, who was trying to beat him with the piece of
wood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, when he saw <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span>, a brother of
Max <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span>, drawing a bolo and coming towards him,
Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Orquina</span> ran towards a hill, pursued by Max <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span>, who now and then tried to hit him with the piece of
wood, and by <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span>,
who was brandishing a bolo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then <span class="SpellE">Rotillo</span> <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span>, also armed with a
bolo, came from another direction and joined his brothers in the pursuit of
Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Orquina</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Upon being overtaken, Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Orquina</span> was assaulted
by <span class="SpellE">Rotillo</span>, Max, and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Jamero</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Orquina</span> had fallen, he knelt before his
assailants, raised his hands, and pleaded for his life saying, "You just
stab me but don't kill me because I have many children."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
But, his plea went unheeded because <span class="SpellE">Rotillo</span> <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span> raised his bolo and stabbed Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Orquina</span> in the left chest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After delivering the deathblow, <span class="SpellE">Rotillo</span> <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span> went towards the highway, followed by his brothers
Max and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Rotillo</span> was met by policeman Arturo <span class="SpellE">Ugay</span> who demanded the surrender of the bolo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Rotillo</span> refused,
saying that there were still two others in town.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Max and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span>
were also intercepted by their father, Simeon, who disarmed them.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Rotillo</span> <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span> was eventually
persuaded to yield his bolo to Arturo <span class="SpellE">Ugay</span>, who then
brought him to the municipal hall of <span class="SpellE">Bacuag</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the course of the attack, <span class="SpellE">Pompio</span> <span class="SpellE">Orquina</span>, upon learning that his brother Gerardo was being
assaulted by the appellants, tried to go out of the house of <span class="SpellE">Asterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Eludo</span> in order to help
Gerardo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, when he saw Simeon <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span> standing ominously outside the doorway with a drawn
bolo in hand, he went up the house of <span class="SpellE">Asterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Eludo</span> and remained thereat until he was fetched <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> by the town chief of police.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

</span>After trial, <span class="SpellE">Rotillo</span> <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span>,
Max <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span> were found guilty as charged and sentenced
accordingly, while Simeon <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span> was acquitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants claim that <span class="SpellE">Rotillo</span> <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span> alone is accountable for the death of Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Orquina</span> and that Max and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Jamero</span> did not participate in the commission of the
offense.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Jamero's</span>
defense is an alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, he testified
that on the day in question, July 14, 1968, he was in <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>,
driving the jeep of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Odchimar</span> of <span class="SpellE">Bacuag</span> which was on loan to the Jaycees who had a
convention at <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>, having been there since July
12, 1968, until about 12:30 o'clock in the afternoon of July 14, 1968, when he
left for home after eating his lunch at the public market of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He arrived
at <span class="SpellE">Bacuag</span> at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00
 o'clock</st1:time> that same afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After returning the jeep to Mayor <span class="SpellE">Odchimar</span>, he
left for barrio Campo, arriving thereat at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="14">2:30
 o'clock</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon getting off at
a street intersection, he was informed that his brother, <span class="SpellE">Rotillo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Jamero</span>, had met an "incident".<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
When he reached their house, he informed his father of what he heard and his
father replied:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“Yes, I do not know what
happened".<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Although this claim is corroborated by Mayor <span class="SpellE">Odchimar</span>
who testified that his jeep was driven by <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span> while it was on loan to the Jaycees since July 12,
1968, it cannot be conclusively said that the appellant <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Jamero</span> was not at barrio Campo when the crime was com­mitted
because the offense in question was perpetrated at about 1:00 o'clock in the
afternoon and the jeep could have been returned to Mayor <span class="SpellE">Odchimar</span>
at 2:00 o'clock, after the crime was committed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, this claim cannot stand in the face of the positive
identification made by <span class="SpellE">Cresencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ugay</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Felicitas</span> <span class="SpellE">Orquina</span>, as
well as the testimony of Max <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span> that he saw his
brother <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> in their house in the morning of
that day.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Max <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span>, for his part, declared that
he was also in the same "<span class="SpellE">tabo</span>-an" of barrio
Campo on that day of July 14, 1968, selling dried octopus and smoked fish, from
6:30 o'clock in the morning until 1:00 o'clock in the afternoon, when a
commotion took place in said "<span class="SpellE">tabo</span>-an".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon seeing the people scampering, he
hurriedly gathered his wares and went home across the river.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After putting his merchandise in a safe place,
he went back to the " <span class="SpellE">tabo</span>-an" in order to
find out what caused the commotion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
returning, he was informed that his brother, <span class="SpellE">Rotillo</span> <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span>, was involved in an "incident".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not long thereafter, he saw <span class="SpellE">Rotillo</span> accompanied by a policeman, Arturo <span class="SpellE">Ugay</span>, who was carrying a bolo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon seeing them, he went back home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also denied having participated in the
killing of Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Orquina</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This claim, however, is negated by the testimony of the
prosecution witnesses that he struck the deceased with a piece of wood and by
the post mortem report showing that abrasions were found on the head, chest,
hands, and forearm of the deceased Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Orquina</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Rotillo</span> <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span>,
upon the other hand, claims that he killed Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Orquina</span>
in self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His version of the
incident is that while he was at the said market place of barrio Campo on that
fateful day, talking with his friends, <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Bentulan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Servano</span> Roy alias
"<span class="SpellE">Nonoy</span>", the deceased Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Orquina</span> approached them and punched his stomach when he
refused the offer of Gerardo to have a drink with him, resulting in a fist
fight between him and Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Orquina</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After exchanging several blows, Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Orquina</span> ran towards a jeep parked near the market
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon coming to the jeep, Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Orquina</span> reached for a bolo placed underneath the steering
wheel of the vehicle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also tried to
take hold of the bolo and was successful, while Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Orquina</span>
was left in possession of the scabbard.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Finding himself at a disadvantage, Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Orquina</span>
ran away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused ran after Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Orquina</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a
while, Gerardo stopped and waited for him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When he came to Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Orquina</span>, he slashed
and stabbed the latter with the bolo, after which he left.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the plea of self-defense, the burden of proof is on the
accused pleading it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failing to do so, a
conviction must necessarily lie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
very testimony of <span class="SpellE">Rotillo</span> <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span>
establishes that he was committing unlawful aggression against the victim at
the time the fatal blows were delivered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, self-defense cannot prosper.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants impugn the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Cresencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ugay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Felicitas</span> <span class="SpellE">Orquina</span> as unworthy of credence, the former because of his
previous convictions and brushes with the law, and the latter for being a
coached and tutored witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has repeatedly ruled that the matter of assigning
values to the testimony of witnesses is best performed by the trial courts
because, unlike appellate courts, they can weigh such testimony in the light of
the demeanor, conduct, and attitude of the witnesses at the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that <span class="SpellE">Cresencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ugay</span> had been previously convicted of minor offenses
and that he had several brushes with the law does not disqualify him from
testifying; nor does it render his testimony devoid of belief in the absence of
any motive to testify falsely against appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Felicitas</span>
<span class="SpellE">Orquina</span>, it is not punctured with any serious
inconsistencies as to lead one to believe that she was coached or tutored.</p>
