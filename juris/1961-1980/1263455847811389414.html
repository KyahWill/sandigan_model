Rodolfo Chuanico of the GSIS Hospital, Jose T. Oconor and Erlinda de Luna of Mary Chiles Clinic, and Orlino A. Pacioles of Santo Tomas University Hospital, diagnosed him, and issued the corresponding medical certificates (Annexes "B", "C", "D", "E" and "F") confirming his ailments.&nbsp; In the process, petitioner incurred medical expenses amounting to P1,355.18, with the supporting receipts paid by him (Annex "H").&nbsp; Re­spondent company was fully appraised and well-advised of all these relevant circumstances.&nbsp; </p><p> The foregoing facts, contrary to the findings and conclusion of respondent Commission, undisputably proved that petitioner's illness was work-connected and was aggravated by, if not the direct result of, his almost fourteen (14) years of employment with re­spondent company.&nbsp; </p><p> And, significantly, respondent failed to contro­vert petitioner's claim for compensation, which con­stitutes waiver of all its defenses not otherwise jurisdictional.&nbsp; </p><p><strong> WHEREFORE</strong> , THE DECISION DATED JANUARY 28, 1976 OF THE RESPONDENT WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION IS HEREBY SET ASIDE AND THE RESPONDENT UNIVERSAL TEXTILE MILLS, INC., IS HEREBY ORDERED:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> (1) TO PAY CLAIMANT:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> (A) SIX THOUSAND PESOS (P6,000.00) FOR TEMPORARY PARTIAL DISABILITY; </p>&nbsp; <p> (B) ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY-FIVE PESOS AND EIGHTEEN CENTAVOS (P1,355.18) AS REFUND FOR MEDICAL EXPENSES INCURRED;&nbsp; </p><p> (C) TEN PER CENT (10%) OF THE TOTAL COMPENSATION AS ATTORNEY'S FEES;&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p> (2) TO PROVIDE THE CLAIMANT SUCH MEDICAL, SURGICAL AND HOSPITAL SERVICES AND SUPPLIES AS THE NATURE OF THE AILMENT MAY REQUIRE;&nbsp; </p><p> (3) TO PAY THE SUM OF SIXTY-ONE PESOS (P61.00) AS ADMINISTRATIVE FEE; AND&nbsp; </p><p> (4) TO PAY THE COSTS.&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p><strong> SO ORDERED.</strong></p><p><em>Teehankee, (Chairman), Muñoz Palma, Concepcion, Jr., </em>and<em> Martin, JJ., </em>concur. </p> </div>
