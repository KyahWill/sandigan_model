				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY" style="margin-right: -1.15pt;">Petitioner, Rural Transit Employees'
Association – hereinafter referred to as the Union – seeks the review by
certiorari of an order of the Court of<span style="">
</span>Industrial Relations, dismissing the present case, without prejudice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said Union is composed of employees of the <span class="SpellE">Bachrach</span>
Motor Co., Inc., which was, <span class="GramE">subsequently</span>, reorganized
as <span class="SpellE">Bachrach</span> Transportation Company – hereinafter
referred to as the Company – and is engaged in the transportation of passengers
and freight by land in the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It appears that in May, 1958, the members of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
declared a strike against the Company, in consequence of a labor dispute which
was later certified by the President to the Court of Relations as one involving
the national interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">The background of said dispute was this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Company used to accept freight, either
accompanied or unaccompanied by the owners, shippers or agents thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Union contended that this practice
brought about undue inconvenience to the riding public, because it cramped the
space available to the latter and caused unnecessary delays, owing to the fact
that the buses had to go to barrios and remote places to look for the
consignees of said unaccompanied freight; because the buses <span style="">did not have </span>separate compartments for
freight, whether accompanied or not, so that the passengers, fearing that their
baggage may get lost, insisted on placing them near their seats, subject to
their surveillance; and because the absence of such compartments gave occasion
for the loss, damage, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">misdelivery</span></span><span style=""> or </span><span class="SpellE">nondelivery</span> of <span style="">the </span>freight,
for which the employees of the Company were penalized by the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Union had, accordingly, presented for compulsory arbitration,
<u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, two interrelated demands,
which were segregated from the main dispute and designated as Case No. 22-IPA
(19) of the Court of Industrial Relations, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) that separate freight trucks be
commissioned to haul exclusively freight unaccompanied by the owners, shippers
or agents thereof; and (b) that the penalties formerly imposed upon and collected
from the drivers <span style="">and </span>conductors
of the buses on which they were loaded, on account of the loss, damage, <span class="SpellE">misdelivery</span> <span style="">or </span><span class="SpellE">nondelivery</span> of said freight, be declared unjustified as
well as harsh, and ordered refunded to the employees con­cerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">To bolster up these demands, the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
averred that the practice of accepting freight unaccompanied by the shipper was
illegal and <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the Company's certificate of
public convenience, "especially when it disregarded the convenience,
comfort and safety of the riding public." In support of this averment, the
<st1:place>Union</st1:place> had presented a letter of the Acting Chief of the
Complaint, Investigation and Enforce­ment Office of the Public Service
Commission, expressing said view.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its answer, the Company contended that, under the provisions
of its certificate of public convenience, its buses could transport, not only
passengers, but, also, freight, either accompanied or unaccompanied by the
shipper, and that the penalties complained of were <span style="">imposed only in "clear cases of </span>negligence" of the
employees concerned, when freight was lost, damaged, <span class="SpellE">misdelivered</span>
or undelivered.</p>

<p class="BODY">Passing upon the issue thus raised, the Court of Industri<span style="">al Relations issued an order, dated May 14,
1963, dismissing the petition without prejudice, upon the theory that the question
whether or not the acceptance of accompanied and unaccompanied freight, under
the conditions already adverted to, violated the Company's certificate of
public convenience, was </span>within <span style="">the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the present petition for review by
certiorari.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We do not share the conclusion reached by the Court of <span style="">Industrial </span>Relations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the Union contended that the acceptance of said freight
in passenger buses, without any suitable compartment <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
constituted a violation of the Company's certificate of public convenience,
this was merely <u>one</u> of the grounds of the demand by the Union for a
refund of the penalties imposed upon the employees concerned and collected by
the Company for the loss, damage, <span class="SpellE">misdelivery</span> or <span class="SpellE">nondelivery</span> of said freight, as <u>one</u> of the causes of
the labor dispute and the strike certified by the President to the Court of
Industrial Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was, not only
within the competence, but, also, the duty of the Court of <span style="">In</span>dustrial Relations to settle the
issue raised by said demand, which led to the aforementioned strike,
considering particularly that the labor dispute between the parties herein had
been certified by the President as one involving or affecting the national
interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although it appears that the Company had subsequently secured a
certificate of public convenience to operate trucks for the transportation
exclusively of cargoes unaccompanied by the shippers thereof, the issue in the
present case has not thereby become academic, in view of the fact that the
demand <span style="">of the Union for a refund of the
penalties imposed and collected by the Company for the loss, damage, <span class="SpellE">misdelivery</span> or <span class="SpellE">nondelivery</span> </span>of
freight, has not been settled in consequence of the issuance of said
certificate of public convenience.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, <span style="">even if the acceptance
of freight, under </span>the aforementioned circumstances, did not violate the
rules of the Public Service <span style="">Commission,
there would still be the issue whether the Company was justified in punishing
its employees <span style="">as </span>it did and </span>should
make the corresponding refund.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order appealed from is hereby set aside and
the case remanded to the Court of Industrial Relations for further pro<span style="">ceedings, </span>with the costs of this
instance against the <span style="">Company.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Reyes, J.B.L., <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>, J.P., <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span> Fernando, <span class="GramE">JJ.,</span> <span style="font-style: normal;">concur.</span></span><br>
