				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">There is need in this appeal from a decision of respondent Auditor
General <span class="SpellE">Ismael</span> <span class="SpellE">Mathay</span> for
an inquiry into the meaning and significance of the constitutional inhibition
against an officer or employee of the government receiving additional or double
compensation unless specifically authorized by law,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
the decisive legal question being whether or not the cost of living allowance
as well as incentive and Christmas bonuses paid to petitioner Pedro G. Peralta,
a Trustee of the Government Service Insurance System, hereinafter called the
GSIS, did fall within <span style="">such a ban.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer given by respondent Auditor
General was in the affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a
careful study of the matter, this Court arrives at a similar conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this appeal cannot prosper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The facts are undisputed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As set forth in the brief of petitioner, the GSIS, on <st1:date year="1966" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1966</st1:date>, in a resolution duly
passed, granted him an optional retirement gratuity of P40,336.07.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of that amount, he was not able to collect the
sum of P7,032.26, covering P3,982.26 as cost of living allowance, P1,275.00 as
incentive bonus, and P1,775.00 as Christmas bonus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such items were not passed in audit, the view
of respondent Auditor General being that they should be deducted from his
gratuity, although during petitioner's incumbency as Trustee, no question was
raised when he was paid such allowance and bonuses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Auditor General justified his
action on the ground that they "partake of the nature of additional
compensation," a trustee's remuneration being fixed by law in the form of
a per diem of P25.00 for every board meeting of the GSIS attended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent so ruled on <st1:date year="1966" day="28" month="6">June 28, 1966</st1:date>, and maintained such a stand on <st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1966</st1:date> when he denied a
motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this
appeal <span style="">for review filed on </span><st1:date year="1966" day="29" month="9"><span style="">September
 29, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The ruling of respondent
Auditor General, being in accordance with what the Constitution requires, must
be upheld.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

This is to manifest a commitment to the fundamental principle that a public
office is a public trust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is expected
of a government official or employee that he keeps uppermost in mind the
demands <span style="">of public welfare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is there to render public service. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>He is of course entitled to be rewarded for
the performance of the functions entrusted to him, but that should not be the
overriding consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The intrusion
of the thought of private gain should be unwelcome.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The temptation to further personal ends,
public employment as a means for the acquisition of wealth, is to be
resisted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That at least is the
ideal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is then to be an awareness
on the part of an officer or employee of the govern­ment that he is to receive
only such compensation as may be fixed by law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With such a realization, he is expected not to avail himself of devious
or circuitous means to increase the remuneration attached to his position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an entirely different matter if the
legislative body would itself determine for reasons satisfactory to it that he
should receive something more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it
were to be thus though, there must be a law to that effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So the Constitution decrees.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As is expressly declared in the Constitution, the Civil Service
is to embrace "all branches and subdivisions of the Government * *

Petitioner has not disputed, nor can he dispute that as a trustee, he was an
officer of the government, the GSIS having been established in order "to
promote the efficiency and welfare of <span style="">the
employees of the Government of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> and to replace the [then] pension systems

additional or double compensation unless specifically authorized by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the GSIS Act, he is entitled as trustee
"to a per diem of P25.00 for each day of actual attendance in
session."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> As in the case of government-controlled

compensation or remuneration attached to the office of Trustee.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Such is not the meaning usually attached to

identified with the daily allowance "for each day he (an officer or
employee) was away from his home base." </span>Its usual signification is
thus that of a reimbursement for expenses incurred in the performance of one's
duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If employed in a statute, as in
this case, in the concept of remuneration, however, there must be, to justify
an additional compensation, <span style="">a </span>specific
law that so provides.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise,
fidelity to the constitutional command is lacking.</p>

<p class="BODY">A similar approach is called for in determining the nature of a
cost of living allowance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it could
rightfully be considered as in the nature of a reimbursement rather than
additional emoluments or perquisites, then the ruling of respondent Auditor
General cannot find support in the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was said in an <st1:place><st1:placename>American</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>State</st1:placetype></st1:place> decision<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
has relevance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was therein
categorically stated "that it is universally held that an allowance for
expenses incident to the discharge of the duties of office is not an increase
of salary, a perquisite, nor an emolument of office."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
To the same effect is this excerpt appearing later in the opinion:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"A careful and, we believe, exhaustive
exami­nation of the decisions fails to disclose a single case in which it has
ever been held that a legislative act, providing for an allowance, for expenses
incurred in the discharge of official duties, to a public officer, whose salary
or compensation was fixed at a stated sum, was in violation of provisions such
as are found in many state Constitutions, forbidding an increase of salary
during official terms, or forbidding the granting of 'fees,' 'perquisites,' or
'emoluments' to such officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Legislative
acts which directly in terms, or as construed, attempted to increase such
salaries, have been held invalid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But no
decision has been found or, as we believe, can be found, which holds a
legislative act to be unconstitutional which merely relieves an officer, who
received a fixed salary or com­pensation, from expending such salary for
expenses incident to the performance of his official duties."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
It is worth noting that there are specific provisions in the applicable
statutes allowing trustees or directors, traveling expenses which may be collected
by the board of directors of the Philippine Virginia Tobacco Administration;<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
traveling and subsistence expenses by the members and board of directors of the
Central Luzon-<span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> Valley Authority;<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
and traveling and other necessary expenses by the members of the Philippine
Medical Care Commission.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Such provisions are prompted by what may appear to be an excess of caution, for
the accepted doctrine is that an allowance to take care of expenses incurred by
an official to enable him to fulfill his task cannot be looked upon as an
additional compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a
principle does not come to the aid of petitioner though.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was unable to show that the cost of living
allowance received by him was in the nature of a reimbursement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did amount then to an additional com­pensation.</p>

<p class="BODY">So it is in the case of the bonuses received by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is quite obvious that by its very nature,
a bonus partakes of an additional remuneration or compensation.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The very characterization of what was received by petitioner as bonuses being
intended by way of an incentive to spur him possibly to more diligent efforts
and to add to the feeling of well-being traditionally associated with the
Christmas season would remove any doubt that the Auditor General had no choice
except to deduct from petitioner's gratuity such items.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. It is apparent that respondent Auditor General accorded respect
and deference to a constitutional command.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To impute legal error to his actuation is to be oblivious of the
fundamental postulate that the Constitution is supreme.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obedience is manda­tory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be disregarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every public official is sworn to uphold
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can be no justification for
any other course of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To condone
whether by intent or inadvertence any deviation from what it prescribes is to
display less than full fealty to the cardinal precept of our polity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A mistaken sympathy for the situation in
which the petitioner did find himself cannot suffice to confer authority on
respondent to grant what is asked of him in view of the constitutional
ban.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both petitioner, who was himself
once a public official, and respondent Auditor General must be cognizant of the
paramount character of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus everyone in the public service is only the more strongly bound to
submit to such supremacy and to abide by the limitations which it imposes upon
every aspect of the authority thus conferred.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>
