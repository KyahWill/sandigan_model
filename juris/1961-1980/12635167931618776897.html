<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="17" month="3">March 17, 1960</st1:date>,
a complaint for reinstate­ment and collection of salaries and damages was filed
before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> by plaintiffs-appellants <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Azur</span> and Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Bulalacao</span>

against the <span style="">Provincial Board </span>and
the above-named officials of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Camarines</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
<st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.</st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint alleged that:</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs are provincial guards who have been holding their
positions continuously for more than five years; they took the Patrolman <span style="">Qualifying Examination at <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>
City on February </span>27, 1960; on or about January 15, <span style="">1960, they were
notified by the Secretary of the defend­ant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Provincial Board that their positions had been abolished </span><span style="">by its Resolution No. 16, <span style="">Series </span>of <span style="">1960, and that thirty (30) </span></span><span style="">days </span><span style="">thereafter </span><span style="">their work "is </span><span style="">already
terminated"; on January 30, 1960, </span>Resolution No. 16 was amended by
Resolution No. 45 which, "in order to economize", reduced the
forty-five (45) existing posi­<span style="">tions of
provincial guards to thirty-five (35), ten (10) positions eliminated and </span>their
<span style="">items abolished "subject </span>to
the approval <span style="">of the Secretary of </span>Finance";
said Reso­lution No. 45 had not been approved by the <span style="">Secretary of Finance and, was, </span>therefore, still ineffectual; the
real <span style="">purpose in separating </span>the
ten <span style="">(10) persons occupy­</span>ing the
positions abolished was not to economize but to <span style="">have them replaced by persons </span><span style="">belonging </span><span style="">to the political party of the </span><span style="">new provincial administration; prior to </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">separation of plaintiffs from </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">service, </span><span style="">the provincial administration hired five </span>(5) new <span style="">provincial guards who were later on separated
for sometime to conceal defend­ants' intention to replace plaintiffs, <span style="">as in </span>fact, they <span style="">were again allowed </span>to work on March
16, 1960; </span>the <span style="">appointment of
said five (5) new provincial guards is illegal; plaintiffs have </span>been
rendering service conti­<span style="">nuously from February 15, 1960 up to the filing of the complaint but had
not received their salaries because </span><span style="">defendants were </span>compelling them <span style="">to submit their resig­nations and </span>clearances before they would
be paid; on February <span style="">23, 1960,
plaintiffs informed defendants of the illegality of their separation from the service
and <span style="">demanded their pay for services </span></span><span style="">rendered until </span><span style="">they are </span><span style="">legally separated </span>by <span style="">competent
authority, but they had </span>not yet been paid on the date the complaint was
filed; due to their illegal separation from the service and the refusal of
defendants to pay their salaries, they <span style="">have
suffered damages and have, therefore, engaged the services of </span>counsel,
for a fee, for the <span style="">protection of </span>their
rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint ends with the
prayer that defendants be ordered to reinstate them and, on the <span class="SpellE">the</span> other hand, to separate from the service the <span style="">five </span>(5) new provincial guards whose
appointments are ille­gal; to pay them the salaries to which they are entitled
until they resign or are legally separated; and to pay them P600.00 as
attorney's fees and P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> <span style="">in moral damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In due time, defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> filed
their ans­wer to the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said
answer, defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> admitted the employment
and subsequent dismis­sal of plaintiffs-appellants and the approval of Reso­lutions
16 and 45.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rest of the allegations
of the complaint were denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
affirmative defenses, they alleged that (1) plaintiffs had no cause of action
since the complaint admitted that they were still rend­ering service; (2) they
have not exhausted all adminis­trative remedies; (3) the abolition of their
positions was legal; and (4) not being civil service <span class="SpellE">eligibles</span>,
they were merely temporary employees" whose tenure of office could not be
more than three (3) months unless re­appointed at every end of the three months
period", and they were not reappointed "at the beginning of the
present administration".</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the case was thereafter set for trial on <st1:date year="1960" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1960</st1:date> but this was postponed
until the next assignment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1960" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1960</st1:date>, the date next set
for the trial of the case, the court postponed the hearing to give the
Provincial Fiscal time to file a motion to dismiss on behalf of defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
motion referred to was subsequently filed and defendants-<span class="SpellE">appel­lees</span>
prayed therein for the dismissal of the complaint on the grounds that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the complaint states no cause of action;
(b) the plaintiffs have no legal right to de­mand for reinstatement; (c) the
abolition of their posi­tions by Resolution No. 16, as amended by Resolution
No. 45, is legal and authorized by Republic Act No. 2260; and (d) petitioners
did not exhaust administrative re­medies as required by law, which grounds, as
can be readily noted, were mere reiterations of the affirma­tive defenses in
their answer and in effect, all of them amount to only one, <span class="SpellE">i</span>.
<span style="">e., </span>that the complaint stated
no cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs-appellants opposed the motion for dis­missal,
alleging, that defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> have already
filed their answer and, therefore, the motion was filed out of time; that
except for ground (a), the others re­lied upon are not grounds provided for in
the Rules; that there was no merit in defendants-appellants conten­tion that
the petition states no cause of action; that they have <span style="">a </span>right to reinstatement under the Civil Service Law, as the
abolition of their positions is illegal because the purpose was to replace them
with others chosen by the Provincial Board; and that exhaustion of
administrative remedies is not applicable to the case which is "for
reinstatement or <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">warranto</span></u></span> proceedings."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Resolving the motion to
dismiss, the trial court issued the questioned order of dismissal sustaining
the ground relied upon by respondents that the complaint states no cause of
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His Honor reasoned thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In paragraph 12 of the petition it is alleged that the
petitioners have been rendering service continuously from <st1:date year="1950" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1950</st1:date> (sic) to the present time,
indicat­ing thereby that they did not vacate their positions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They do not have, therefore, a right to
demand for re­instatement since by their own alle<span style="">gation they are still holding their
positions.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"But even conceding that they have vacated their positions,
they still have no cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Since </span>they
are temporary employees whose employment automatically expires after 3 months
if no new appointment <span style="">is </span>extended to them, they cannot de­mand reinstatement (Civil
Service Law).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appointments which are
tempo­rary in character can be terminated at pleasure by the appointing power

<p class="BODY">In a subsequent order, the trial court denied the motion for
reconsideration of the above-mentioned order of dismissal, hence the instant
appeal<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
interposed by petitioners who maintain that the dismissal of the petition is
not in accordance with law and jurisprudence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants now contend that the court below erred in holding that
they have no cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They maintain
that the dismissed complaint contained suffi­cient allegations of fact which,
if proven, constitute a sufficient cause of action against <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
who have unjustly and illegally terminated their services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold there is merit in this contention
and, therefore, the order of dismissal appealed from should be set aside.</p>

<p class="BODY">In order to sustain <span style="">a </span>dismissal
on the ground that the complaint states no cause of action, the insufficiency
of the cause of action must appear on the face of the complaint,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and the test of the sufficiency of the facts alleged in the complaint, to
constitute a cause of action, is whether or not, admitting the facts alleged,
the court could render a valid judgment upon the same in accordance with the
prayer of the complaint.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">Examining the allegations of the complaint in question in the
light of the foregoing rules, there can be no doubt that appellants are
correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The averments in their
complaint show, in synthesis, that they are invoking a right to stay in office
on the basis of their allegation that they have been duly appointed thereto and
have been holding their positions continuously for more than five (5) years,
that they claim a violation of that right by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>'
act of abolishing their posi­tions and terminating their services in bad faith,
as shown by their averment that the excuse of economy put forth by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> was belied by the fact that soon after their
separation from the service, five(5) new provincial guards were appointed, that
they have conse­quently suffered injury since they were not being paid and were
being <span class="SpellE">disemployed</span> and that on this basis, they would
be entitled to the <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> of retention or rein­statement
and payment of back salaries prayed for.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is obvious that if the above allegations are assumed to be
true, appellants have a cause of action stated in their complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have alleged facts <span style="">showing that <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
have committed acts constituting "a <span class="SpellE">delict</span> or
wrong by which one party violates the rights of <span class="GramE">another
causing</span> him loss or injury," hence </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">cause of action has been alleged by
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(I Moran,
Comments on the Rules of Court, p. 91, 1963 ed.)</span> When the ultimate facts
alleged in the complaint show that plaintiff has a right and that right has
been violated by the defendant, then there is a cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Com­munity Investment et al. v. Garcia, </span><span style="">88 </span><span style="">Phil. 215, 217-­218)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Appellees</span> maintain, on the other hand,
that the lower court was right in dismissing the action by reason of appellants
own allegation in the complaint "that they have been rendering service <span class="SpellE">continously</span> from February 15, 1960 to the present
time" which shows, it is asserted, that they have not vacated their
positions and, consequently, cannot demand reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">contention
is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The allegation referred to
may indeed appear inconsistent with the demand for reinstate­ment, but the same
should be overlooked in the light of the more prominent and positive averments
in the com­plaint that the services of appellants have been termi­nated by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Cf.
Worldwide Ins. &amp; Surety Co., Inc. v. Manuel, 98 Phil. 46, 48-49) To warrant
the dis­missal of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">complaint for insufficiency, it should appear that a claim for relief
does not exist rather than that a claim has been defectively stated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A com­plaint should not be dismissed for
insufficiency unless it appears to </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">certainty, from the face of the complaint,
that plaintiff would be entitled to no relief under any state of facts which
could be proved within the facts alleged therein.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Stated otherwise, though the alle­gations of
the complaint are ambiguous, indefinite or un­certain, but, nevertheless, a
cause of action can, in any manner, be made out <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
and plaintiff would be entitled to recover in any aspect of the facts or any
combination of the facts alleged, if they were to be proved, then the motion to
dismiss should be denied.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As to appellants' allegation in their complaint that they have
been continuously rendering service up to its filing, the same should not be
given any legal sig­nificance, in view of their other averment that they were
duly notified by the Secretary of the Provincial Board that their services were
terminated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants may have
continued discharging the functions of their o<span style="">ffice, but the same does not detract from the
fact that they had been dismissed and that said dismissal had been implemented,
also alleged in the complaint under consi­deration, by non-recognition of their
official capacity or non-payment of their salaries.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Consequently, ad­mitting
the truth of both averments, appellants would still be entitled to
reinstatement under the circum­stances.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants next assail the reasoning of the lower court that conceding
they have been <span class="SpellE">disemployed</span>, still they could not
demand for reinstatement because, being temporary employees, their employment
automatically ex­pired after every three (3) months and had to be given new
appointments at the end of each such period, and that, in any event, their
tenures were terminable at the pleasure of the appointing power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants maintain, on the other hand, that
even if they may be considered as temporary employees, they are still protected
under the Civil Service Law by reason of the fact that they have been
continuously holding their positions for more than five (5) years.</p>

<p class="BODY">This position of appellants also deserves appro­val.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the complaint to sustain
the view that appellants' appointment had lapsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the allegation in their complaint that
appellants had been continuously holding their positions for more than five
years, it is not legally deducible that from their first appointment as
provincial guards, no new appoint­ments had been extended to them during their
more than five years of continuous service.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To conclude otherwise would be to go beyond the allegations of the
complaint and the presumption of regularity which arises <span class="SpellE">there­from</span>,
and to dismiss the complaint under such circum­stances is not legally
sustainable.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On
the contrary, precisely because of the allega­tion in their complaint that they
had been serving for more than five (5) years already, and there being no
allegation therein that those who have been appointed to replace them were <span class="SpellE">eligibles</span>, appellants are entitled to the preferential
rights under the following provi­sions of the Civil Service Law:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 23<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Qualification in an appropriate examination shall be required
for appointment to positions in the competitive or classified service in
accordance with the <span style="">civil </span>service
rules, except as otherwise provided for in this Act:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, That whenever there is a civil
service eli­gible available for appointment, no person who is not such an
eligible shall be appointed even in a temporary capacity to any vacant position
in the competi­tive or classified service in the government or in any govern­ment-owned
or controlled corpo­ration:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided,

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Thus, under the facts alleged by them,
which, as al­ready stated have to be hypothetically assumed to be <span style="">true by the motion to dismiss, appellants
have the right to await the results </span>of the qualifying examina­tions they
alleged in their complaint they had taken on February 27, 1960, which was well
within the one year grace period fixed by the above provision, from the
approval of the Civil Service Law, Republic Act 2260 on June 19, 1959, and only
if they had failed <span style="">therein, which does not appear in said complaint, </span>that they can be
replaced, and more importantly, only by <span class="SpellE">eligibles</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Parenthetically, <span class="GramE">We</span>
note that in the motion for reconsideration appellants filed<span style=""> with the lower
court on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="26" month="7"><span style="">July 26, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, they alleged that
they had passed the examination, and the interesting sequel thereto is related
by them thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The provision of Republic Act 2260 is very clear and
petitioners fall squarely under the provision of Section 23 for the reason that
they have rendered more than five years satisfac<span style="">tory service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They took the
civil service examination within the required period and luckily they passed
said examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact,
on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="19" month="3"><span style="">March 19, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">,
the Provincial Governor of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> thru the Provincial Warden wrote Pvt. Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Bulala­cao</span> to report for duty, but he <span style="">refused to return to work because one of the
conditions was to first get a clearance from the President of the Liberal Party
of his muni­cipality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is then very
plain that the motive in the abolition of petitioners, positions is po­litical,
but even if it is not political, still said abolition <span class="GramE">are</span>
illegal in accordance with the executive power, law and decision of the Supreme
Court previously cited." <span class="GramE">(Record on Appeal, pp. 23-24.)</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Of course, <span class="GramE">We</span>
are not taking these acts into account because they are not alleged in the
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are quoted only to make
it more evident that, in any event, <span class="GramE">We</span> are on the
right <span style="">track </span>in going along with
appellants.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the same reasons <span class="GramE">We</span> have just
discussed, the holding of His Honor that appellants' temporary appointments are
terminable at the pleasure of the appointing power, cannot stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Insofar <span style="">as </span>appellants were concerned, the rule invoked by His Honor was
subject to the above-quoted Sec­tion 23 of the Civil Service Law regarding an
appointee who has already served more than five years under a temporary
appointment at the time of the approval of the Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the said pro­vision, it is indeed clear
that, as already stated, after an employee who had been given a temporary
appointment had, for any reason, al­ready served under said appointment, upon
the approval of the Civil Service Law, <span style="">he
acquired a right to continue holding his position until three conditions have
been complied with, namely, </span>(1) he must have been given a qualifying
exami­nation within one year from <span style="">said approval, (2) </span><span style="">he either failed in said examination or failed </span><span style="">or refused to take
it, and </span>(3) <span style="">he could be re­</span><span style="">placed only
</span>by one who has the requisite or, appropriate civil service
eligibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without these conditions,
he had the right to continue in his position even permanently.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Appellees</span> contend, nevertheless, that
the abolition of appellants' positions by respond­ent Provincial Board is

Law itself which authorizes that the staff of any office, bureau or agency may
be reduced whenever it is advisable in the interest of economy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Section 24 [G], Republic Act 2260) Again, <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> must be overruled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The com<span style="">plaint </span>alleges that the abolition of their po­sitions was made by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in bad faith, <span class="SpellE">i</span>. e.,

appellants, as, in fact, they were replaced by <span style="">at least five other guards, in violation of their preferential </span>rights

which <span class="GramE">We</span> are to assume, the fol­lowing rulings laid
down this Court are squarely applicable:</p>

<blockquote>"There is no statute expressly empowering the Board to abolish
the office or positions it has created; however, it is <span style="">a </span>well-established <span style="">principle in the
law of public ad­ministration that the power to es­tablish an office includes
the authority to abolish it - unless there are constitutional or statu­tory
rules expressly or impliedly providing otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the abo­lition of the office terminates
the right of the incumbent to exercise the rights and duties thereof." <span class="GramE">(Castillo vs. <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span>, etc., et <span style="">al. G.R.

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> while
abolition of the office does not imply removal of the incumbent, the rule <span style="">is </span>true
only where the abolition is made in good faith; that the right to abolish can
not be used to <span class="GramE">discharge</span> employees <span style="">in violation </span>of the civil service <span style="">law </span>nor can
it be exercised for per­sonal or political reasons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>

<blockquote>"This Court has held that it is a well established principle
in the law of public administration that the power to establish an office
includes the authority to abolish it unless there are constitutional or
statutory rules expressly or impliedly providing other­wise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, this Court has held that the power
of <span style="">a </span>local
<span style="">government </span>to abolish an office that
it had created is subject to limitations, that is, that that power must be
exercised in good faith, not for personal or poli­tical reasons, and not in
violation of the civil service law." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>, et al.,

<p class="BODY">It is of no moment that the above-quoted precedents involved
employees who were dismissed despite the fact that they were <span class="SpellE">eligibles</span> holding permanent positions, for as We have
already explained, since the appellants had already more than five years of
service to their credit, their right to continue in office is as fully
protected under the Civil Service Law as those of <span class="SpellE">eligibles</span>
with permanent appointments unless the conditions imposed by Section 23 above-quoted
are complied with.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It may not be amiss to
add here that in the lower </span>court, appellants <span style="">questioned the propriety of the motion </span>to dismiss on the ground
that <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> had already filed an answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have not, however, reiterated the same <span style="">argument here, realizing perhaps and
correctly that the </span>rules expressly provide that the ground of dismissal
here­in involved, that the complaint states no cause of action, may be alleged
in a latter pleading or even at the trial, <span style="">so much so that in the latter case, the motion <span style="">is </span>to be resolved in the light of the evidence which may have been
received.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Sec. 2,

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Finally, the contention
of <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> </span>that appel­lants have not
exhausted available administrative <span class="GramE"><span style="">reme­dies,</span></span><span style=""> <span style="">is </span>as groundless as all their other

that the invoked rule of exhaustion of administrative remedies <span style="">is </span>not a <span style="">hard and fast rule; it </span>admits of exceptions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Admitting the truth of appellants' <span style="">allegations in </span>their complaint to the

the hypothetical assumption that the facts alleged <span style="">in </span>the complaint are true, </span>immediate re­<span style="">course </span>to
the courts of justice by appellants <span style="">is </span>not <span style="">objectionable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of </span>the well-known exceptions to

into error in dismissing the complaint of appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find that if the<span style=""> </span><span style="">facts alleged in </span><span style="">said complaint are true, and they must be
