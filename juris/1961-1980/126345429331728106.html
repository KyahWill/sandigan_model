<p class="NUM">"9. <span class="GramE">That</span> the parties have reserved
to present in Court evidence on facts not agreed to herein by the
parties."</p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">is </span>to be
observed that the reservation of additional evidence was <span style="">waived </span>by the parties at the trial
(see Decision of trial court, <span style="">Rec. </span>App.
p. 54).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> overruling the contention of the
Administrator-appellant that the death <span style="">of
</span>the accused prior to final judgment extinguished all criminal and <span style="">civil </span>liabilities resulting from the
offense, in view of Article 89, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code, admitted
<span style="">the </span>claim against <span style="">the estate </span>in the amount of P2<span class="GramE">,025.80</span> with legal interest from the date claim was fi<span style="">led </span>(30 July 1959) <span style="">until paid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No payment was ordered pending final </span>determination of the <span style="">sum </span>total of <span style="">claims admitted against the estate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the ruling, the Administrator has appealed,
insisting on his theory in the Court below.</p>

<p class="BODY">We see no merit in the plea that the civil liability has been
extinguished, in view of the provisions of the Civil Code of the Philippines of
1950 (Rep. Act No. 886) that became operative eighteen years after the Revised
Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">As </span>pointed out by the Court below, Article 88 of the Civil Code
establishes a civil action for damages on account of physical injuries,
entirely <u>separate and distinct from the criminal </u><u><span style="">action</span></u><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"ART. 33. In </span>case
of defamation, fraud, and physical injuries, a civil action for damages,
entirely separate and distinct from the criminal action, may be brought by the
injured party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such <span style="">civil </span>action shall proceed
independently of the criminal prosecution, and shall require only a
preponderance of evidence."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Assuming that for lack of express reservation, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Belamala's</span></span><span style=""> </span>civil action for damages was to be
considered instituted together <span style="">with the
criminal action, still, since both proceedings were terminated without final
adjudication, the civil action of the offended party under Article 33 may yet
be enforced separately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such claim in no
</span><span style="">way </span><span style="">contradicts Article 108, of the Penal Code,
that imposes the </span><span style="">ob</span><span style="">ligation to indemnify upon the deceased
offender's heirs, because </span>the <span style="">latter
acquire their decedent's obligations <u>only to the extent of the value of the </u></span><u><span style="">inheritance</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">(Civil Code, Art.
774).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the obligation of the
offender's heirs under Article 108 ultimately becomes an obligation of the
offender's estate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant, however, is correct in the contention that the
claim should have been prosecuted by separate action against the administrator,
as permitted by sections 1 and 2 of Revised Rule 87, since the claim is
patently one "to recover damages for an <span style="">injury </span>to <u>person</u> or property (Rule 87, sec. 1).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Belamala's</span> action
can not be enforced by filing a claim against the estate under Rule 86, because
section 5 of that rule explicitly limits the claims to those for funeral
expenses, expenses for last sickness, judgments for money and "claims
against the decedent, arising from <u>contract, express or implied</u>;"
and this last category (the other three being inapposite) includes only
"all purely personal obligations <u>other than</u> those which have their
source in <span class="SpellE"><u>delict</u></span> or <u>tort</u>" (Leung
Ben vs. <span class="SpellE">OBrien</span>, 38 Phil. 182, 189-194) and <span class="SpellE">Belamala's</span> damages manifestly have a <span class="SpellE">tortious</span>
origin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this effect was our ruling in
<span class="SpellE"><u>Aguas</u></span> <u>v</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Llemos</u></span>,
L-18107, <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="8"><span class="GramE">Aug</span>.
 30, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, it does not appear that the award of the trial Court
was based on evidence submitted to it; apparently it relied merely on the
findings in the criminal case, as embodied in decisions that never became final
because the accused died during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of said
case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision under appeal is hereby reversed
and set aside, but without prejudice to the action of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
<span class="SpellE">Belamala</span> against the Administrator of the Estate of
Mauricio <span class="SpellE">Polinar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
