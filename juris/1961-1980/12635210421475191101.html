				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The insistence on the part of respondent Shell Company of the
Philippines to dissolve its security guard section, stationed at its <span class="SpellE">Pandacan</span> Installation, notwithstanding its being embraced
in, and its continuance as such thus assured by an existing collective
bargaining contract, resulted in a strike called by petitioner Shell Oil
Workers' Union, hereinafter to be desig­nated <span style="">as </span>the Union, certified <span style="">a
</span>month later on June 27, 1967 by the President to respondent Court of
Industrial Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Against its decision
declaring the strike illegal primarily on <span style="">the
ground that such dissolution was </span><span style="">a
</span><span style="">valid exercise of a manage­ment
prerogative, this appeal is taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
due recognition that the system of industrial democracy fostered in the regime
of unionization and collective bargaining leaves room for the free exercise of
management rights, but unable to close our eyes to the violation of a contract
still in force implicit in such </span><span style="">dis­</span><span style="">solution thus giving rise to an unfair labor
practice, we cannot </span>sustain respondent Court of Industrial
Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the harsh and
unwarranted sanction imposed, the dismissal of the security guards and the
officers of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>, cannot stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Insofar, however, as individual liability is
deemed incurred for serious acts of violence, whether committed by a leader or
member of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>, we leave things as adjudged.</p>

<p class="BODY">The deep-rooted differences between the parties that led to the
subsequent strike were made clear in the presidential certification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As set forth in the opening paragraph <span style="">of </span>the decision now on appeal:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Before this Court for resolution is the
labor dispute between the petitioner Shell Oil Workers' Union, Union for
brevity, and the respondent Shell Company of the Philippines Limited, Company
for short, which was certified to this Court on June 27, 1967 by the Office of
the President <span style="">of </span>the Republic of
the Philippines pursuant to the provision of Section 10 of Republic Act No.
875.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said dispute * <span style="">* * 'was </span>a result of the transfer by
the Company <span style="">of </span>the eighteen (18)
security guards to its other department and the consequent hiring of <span style="">a </span>private security agency to undertake
the work of said security guards.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The respective contentions of the parties were then taken
up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner "filed the petition
on <st1:date year="1967" day="7" month="7">July 7, 1967</st1:date> alleging,
among others, that the eighteen (18) security guards affected are part of the
bargaining unit and covered by the existing collective bargaining contract, and
as such, their transfers and eventual dismissals are illegal being done in
violation of the existing contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It,
therefore, prayed that said security guards be reinstated with full back wages
from the time of their dismissal up to the time of their actual
reinstatement."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Then came a summary of the stand of Shell Company:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Four hours thereafter, respondent
Company filed its Answer [to] the material allegations in the Union's petition
and adverted that the issues in this case are:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) whether or not the Company commits unfair labor practice in contracting
out its security service to an independent professional security agency and re­assigning
the 18 guards to other sections of the Company; (2) whether or not the
dismissal of the 18 security guards are <span style="">justified;
and (3) whether or not the strike called by the Union on May 25, 1967 is legal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As special and affirmative defenses, the
Company maintained that in contracting out the security service and redeploying
the 18 security guards affected, it was merely performing its legitimate
prerogative to adopt the most efficient and economical method of operation;
that said guards were transferred to other sections with increase, except for
four (4) guards, in rates of pay and with transfer bonus; that said action was
motivated by business considerations in line with past established practice and
made after notice to and discussion with the Union; that the 18 guards
concerned were dismissed for <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span> refusing to
obey the transfer order; and that the strike staged by the Union on May 25,
1967 is illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Primarily, the Company
prayed, among others, for the dis­missal of the </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style="">'s petition and the <span style="">said </span></span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style="">'s strike be declared illegal followed by the
termination of the employee status of those responsible and who participated in
said illegal strike."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The move for the dissolution of the security section by
reassigning the guards to other positions and contracting out such service to
an outside security agency had its origins as far back as 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A study made by the Shell Company for the
purpose of improving the productivity, organization and efficiency of its <span class="SpellE">Pandacan</span> Installation recommended its dis­solution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If an outside agency to perform such service
were to be hired, there would be a savings of P96,000.00 annually in addition
to further economy consequent on the elimination of overtime and administration
expenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its implementation <span style="">was </span>scheduled for 1965.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>There was
then, in July 1966, a joint consultation by the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
and management on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that
stage, it would appear that there <span style="">was </span>no
serious opposition to such a move provided it be done gradually and in close
consultation with the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was even an offer of cooperation as
long as a scheme for retirement of the security guards affected or their
redeployment would be followed.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The tentative character of such <span style="">proposed dissolution was made evident </span>by the fact however that on <st1:date year="1966" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1966</st1:date>, <span style="">a </span>collective
bargaining contract was executed between the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> and
the Shell Company effective from the first of the month of that year to <st1:date year="1969" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It contained the usual grievance procedure
and no-strike clauses.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>More
relevant to the case before this Court, however, was the inclusion of the
category of the security guards in such collective bargaining contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was stressed in the brief for the
petitioner where specific mention is made of the agreement covering rank and
file personnel regularly employed by the Company, included in which is the work
area covered by the <span class="SpellE">Pandacan</span> Installation.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
There was likewise specific reference to such positions in the wage schedule
for hourly-rated categories appearing in an appendix thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Mention was expressly made in another appendix of the regular <span style="">remuneration as well as premium pay and night
com­pensation.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">Nonetheless, Shell Company was bent on
doing away with the security guard section, to be replaced </span>by an outside
security agency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was communicated
to the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> in a panel to panel meeting on <st1:date year="1967" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A counter-offer on the part of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
to reduce the working days per week of the guards from <span style="">six </span>to five <span style="">was </span>rejected
by Shell Company on the ground of its being unusual and impracticable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two days later, there was <span style="">a </span>meeting
of the Union where a majority of the <span style="">members
made clear </span>that should there be such a replacement of the company guards
by a private security agency, there would be a strike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was noted in the decision that when the
strike vote was taken, out of 243 members, 226 were for the approval of a
motion to that effect.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
On the afternoon of <st1:date year="1967" day="24" month="5">May 24, 1967</st1:date>,
a notice of reassignment effective at 800 o'clock the next morning was handed
to the guards affected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time> that evening, there was a meeting
by the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> attended by ten officers and a majority of
the members wherein it was agreed <u>viva</u> <u>voce</u> that if there would
be an implementation of the circular dissolving the security section to be
replaced by guards from an outside agency, the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
would go on strike immediately.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
The strike was declared at half-past <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00
 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning of <st1:date year="1967" day="25" month="5">May
 25, 1967</st1:date> when security guards from an outside agency were trying to
pass the main gate of the Shell Company to start their work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the picket line established, they were
unable to enter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Efforts were made by
the Conciliation Service of the Department of Labor to settle the matter, but
they were unsuccessful.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
It was not until <st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1967</st1:date>,
however, that the Presidential certification came.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
There was a return to work order on <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="7">July
 6, 1967</st1:date> by respondent Court, by virtue of which pending the
resolution of the case, the Shell Company <span style="">was </span>not to lockout the employees involved and the employees in
turn were not to strike.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision of respondent Court <span style="">was </span>rendered on <st1:date year="1967" day="5" month="8">August 5,
 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It declared that no
unfair labor practice was committed by Shell Company in dissolving its security
section and replacing it with security guards from an outside agency, <span style="">as </span>such a step was well within
management prerogative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence for it,
the strike was illegal, there being no compliance with the statutory requisites
before an economic strike could be staged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent Court sought to reinforce such a conclusion by a finding that
its purpose was not justifiable and that it was moreover carried out with
violence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was thus a failure on
its part to accord due weight to the terms of an existing collective bargaining
agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, as was made
clear in the opening paragraph of this opinion, we view matters
differently.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The strike cannot be
declared illegal, there being a violation of the collective bargaining
agreement by Shell Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if it
were otherwise, however, this Court cannot lend the sanction of its approval to
the <span style="">outright dismissal of all union </span>officers,
a move that certainly would have the effect of considerably weakening a labor
organization, and thus in effect frustrate the policy of the Industrial Peace
Act to encourage unionization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the
extent, however, that the serious acts of violence occurring in the course of
the strike could be made the basis for holding responsible a leader or <span style="">a </span>member of the Union guilty of their
commission, what was decided by respondent Court should not be disturbed.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is </span>the
contention of Shell Company, sustained by respondent Court, that the
dissolution of the security guard section to be replaced by an outside agency
is a management prerogative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
argues otherwise, relying on the assurance of the continued existence of <span style="">a </span>security
guard section at least during the lifetime of the collective bargaining
agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second, third and fourth
assignment of errors, while they could have been more felicitously worded, did
attack the conclusion reached by respondent Court as contrary to and in
violation of the existing contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is to be admitted that the stand of Shell Company as to the scope of management
prerogative is not devoid of plausibility if it were not bound by what was
stipulated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The growth of industrial
democracy fostered by the institution of collective bargaining with the workers
entitled to be represented by <span style="">a </span>union of their choice, has no doubt
contracted the sphere of what appertains solely to the employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be going too far to assert, however,
that a decision on each and every aspect of the productive process must be
reached jointly by an agreement between labor and management.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Essentially, the freedom to manage the
business remains with management.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
still has plenty of elbow room for making its wishes prevail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In much the same way that labor unions may be
expected to resist to the utmost what they consider to be an unwelcome
intrusion into their exclusive domain, they cannot justly object to management
equally being jealous of its prerogatives.</p>

<p class="BODY">More specifically, it cannot be denied the faculty of promoting
efficiency and attaining economy by a study of what units are essential for its
operation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To it belongs the ultimate
determination of whether services should be performed by its personnel or
contracted to out­side agencies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
the opinion of the Court, that while management has the final say on such
matter, the labor union <span style="">is </span>not
to be completely left out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What <span style="">was </span>done by
Shell Company in informing the Union as to the step it was intending to take on
the proposed dissolution of the security guard section to be replaced by an
outside agency is praise­worthy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
should be mutual consultation even if eventually deference is to be paid to
what management decides.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereby, in the
words of Chief Justice Warren, there is likely to be achieved "peaceful
accommodation of conflicting interests."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
In this particular case though, what was stipulated in an existing collective
bargaining contract <span style="">certainly precluded
Shell Company from carrying out what otherwise would have been within its
prerogative if to do so would be <span class="SpellE">violative</span> thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2. The crucial question thus is whether the then existing collective
bargaining contract running for three years from August 1, 1966 to December 31,
1969 constituted a bar to such a decision reached by management? The answer
must be in the affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As correctly
stressed in the brief for the petitioner, there was specific coverage
concerning the security guard section in the collective bargaining
contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is found not only in the
body thereof but in the two appendices concerning the wage schedules as well as
the premium pay and the night compensation to which the personnel in such
section were entitled.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
It was thus an assurance of security of tenure, at least, during the lifetime
of the agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is it a sufficient
answer, as set forth in the decision of respondent Court, that while such a
section would be abolished, the guards would not be unemployed as they would be
transferred to another position with an increase in pay and with a transfer
bonus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For what is involved is the
integrity of the agreement reached, the terms of which should be binding on
both parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of them may be
released, but only with the consent of the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right to object belongs to the latter,
and if <span style="">exercised,
</span>must be respected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a state
of affairs should continue during the existence of the contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only thus may there be compliance with and
fulfillment of the covenants in a valid subsisting agree­ment.<span style=""> </span></p>

<p class="BODY">What renders the stand of Shell Company even more vulnerable is
the fact that as set forth in its brief and as found by respondent Court <span style="">as far </span>back as 1964, it had already
been studying the matter of <span style="">dissolving </span>the
security guard section and contracting out such service to an outside
agency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, it had reached a
decision to that effect for imple­mentation the next year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In July 1966, there was a joint consultation
between it and the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonethe­less, on <st1:date year="1966" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1966</st1:date>, a collective bargaining contract
was entered into which, as indicated above, did assure the continued existence
of the security guard section.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Shell
Company did not have to agree to such a stipulation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or it could have reserved the right to effect
such a dissolution and reassign the guards.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It did not do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, when
it decided to take such a step resulting in the strike, it would rely primarily
on provisions in the collective bargaining contract couched in general terms,
merely declaratory of certain management prerogatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the circum­stances of record,
there can be no justification then for Shell Company's insistence on pushing
through its project of such dissolution without thereby incurring a violation
of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Shell Company, in
failing to manifest fealty to what was stipulated in an existing collective
bargaining contract, <span style="">was </span>thus
guilty of an unfair labor practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
a doctrine first found expression in Republic Savings Bank v. Court of
Industrial Relations,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
the opinion of the Court being penned by Justice Castro.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a reiteration of such <span style="">a view </span>in
Security Bank Employees Union v. Security Bank and Trust Company.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It being expressly provided
in the Industrial Peace Act that [an] unfair labor practice is committed by a
labor union or its agent by its refusal 'to bargain collectively with the
employer' and this Court having decided in the Republic Savings Bank case that
collective bargaining does not end with the execution of an agreement, being a
continuous process, the duty to bargain necessarily imposing on the parties the
obligation to live up to the terms of such a collective bargaining agreement if
entered into, it is undeniable that non-compliance therewith constitutes an
unfair labor practice."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the unfair
labor practice strike called by the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> did have the
impress of validity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rightly, labor is
justified in making use of such a weapon in its arsenal to counteract what is
clearly outlawed by the Industrial Peace Act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That would be one way to assure that the objectives of unionization and
collective bargaining would not be thwarted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It could, of course, file an unfair labor practice case before the Court
of Industrial Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not
precluded, however, from relying on its own resources to frustrate such an
effort <span style="">on the part of an employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we have consistently held – and for the
soundest of reasons.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is this categorical pronouncement from the present Chief
Justice:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Again, the legality of
the strike follows as a corollary to the finding of fact, made in the decision
appealed from <span style="">–</span> which is
supported by substantial evidence <span style="">–</span>
to the effect that the strike had been triggered by the Company's failure to
abide by the terms and conditions of its collective bargaining agreement with
the Union, by the discrimination, resorted to by the company, with regard to
hire and tenure of employment, and the dismissal of employees due to union
activities, as well as the refusal of the company to bargain <span style="">collectively in good faith,"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">As
a matter of fact, this Court has gone even further, It is not even required
that there be in fact an unfair labor practice committed by the employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It suffices, if such a belief in good faith
is entertained by labor, as the inducing factor for staging a strike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it was clearly stated by the present Chief
Justice while still an Associate Justice of this Court:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"As a consequence, we hold that the
strike in question had been called to offset what petitioners were warranted in
believing in good faith to be unfair labor practices on the part of Management,
that petitioners were not bound, therefore, to wait for the expiration of
thirty (30) days from notice of strike before staging the same, that said
strike was not, accordingly, illegal and that the strikers had not thereby lost
their status as employees of respondents herein."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would thus appear
that the decision now on appeal did not reflect sufficient awareness of
authoritative pronouncements coming from this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is worse, certain portions thereof yield
the impression that an attitude decidedly unsympathetic to labor's resort to
strike is evident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such should not be
the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right to self-organization
so sedulously guarded by the Industrial Peace Act explicitly includes the right

industrial dispute is submitted to the Court of Industrial Relations, subject
to the power of the latter, after hearing when public interest so re­quires or
when the dispute cannot, in its opinion, be promptly decided or settled, to
order them to return, with the consequence that if the strikers fail to return

may not be staged only when, during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of
an industrial dispute, the Court of Industrial Relations has issued the proper
injunction against the laborers (section <span style="">19,
</span>Commonwealth Act No. 103, as amended).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Capital need not, however, be apprehensive about the recurrence of
strikes in view of the system of compulsory arbitration by the Court of
Industrial Relations.”<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A strike then, in the apt phrase of Justice J.B.L. Reyes, is
"an institutionalized factor of democratic growth."<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
This is to foster industrial democracy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Implicit in such <span style="">a </span>concept
is the recognition that concerning the ends which labor considers worthwhile,
its wishes are ordinarily entitled to respect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Necessarily so, the choice as to when such an objective may be attained
by striking likewise belongs to it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is the rejection of the concept that an outside authority, even if
governmental, should make the decisions for it <span style="">as </span>to ends which are desirable and how they may be
achieved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The assumption is that labor
can be trusted to determine for itself when the right to strike may be availed
of in order to attain a successful fruition in their disputes with
management.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that there is a
requirement in the Act that before the employees may do so, they must file with
the Conciliation Service of the Department of Labor a notice of their intention
to strike.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
Such a requisite however, as has been repeatedly declared by this Court, does
not have to be complied with in case of unfair labor practice strike, which
certainly is entitled to greater judicial protection if the Industrial Peace
Act is to be rendered meaningful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
has been said thus far would demon­strate the unwarranted deviation of the
decision now on appeal from what is indicated by the law and authoritative
decisions.</p>

<p class="NUM"><st1:street><st1:address>6. Respondent Court</st1:address></st1:street>
was likewise impelled to consider the strike illegal because of the violence
that attended it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is clearly within
the law is the concerted activity of cessation of work in order that a union's
economic demands may be granted or that an employer cease and desist from an
unfair labor practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the law
recognizes as a right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is though a
disapproval of the utilization of force to attain such an objective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For implicit in the very concept of a legal
order is the maintenance of peaceful ways.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A strike otherwise valid, if violent in character, may be placed beyond
the pale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Care is to be taken, however,
especially where an unfair labor practice is involved, to avoid stamping it
with illegality just because it is tainted by such acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To avoid rendering illusory the recognition
of the right to strike, responsibility in such a case should be individual and
not collective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A different conclusion
would be called for, of course, if the existence of force while the strike
lasts is pervasive and widespread, consistently and deliberately resorted to as
a matter of policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could be
reasonably concluded then that even if justified as to ends, it becomes illegal
because of the means employed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Court must have been unduly impressed by the evidence
submitted by the Shell Company to the effect that the strike was marred by acts
of force, intimidation and violence on the evening of June 14 and twice in the
mornings of June 15 and 16, 1967 in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attention was likewise called to the fact
that even on the following day, with police officials stationed at the strike-bound
area, <span class="SpellE">molotov</span> bombs did explode and the streets were
obstructed with wooden planks containing protruding nails.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, in the branches of the Shell
Company in <st1:place><st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
as well as in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
on dates unspecified, physical injuries appeared to have been inflicted on
management personnel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Court
in the appealed decision did penalize with loss of employment the ten
individuals responsible for such acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor
is it to be lost sight of that before the certification on June 27, 1967, one
month had elapsed during which the Union was on strike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Except on those few days specified then, the
Shell Company could not allege that the strike was conducted in a manner other
than peaceful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances,
it would be going too far to consider that it thereby became illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not by any means to condone the
utilization of force by labor to attain its objectives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only to show awareness that in labor
conflicts, the tension that fills the air as well as the feeling of frustration
and bitterness could break out in sporadic acts of violence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If there be in this case a weighing of
interests in the balance, the ban the law imposes on un­fair labor practices by
management that could provoke a strike and its requirement that it be conducted
peaceably, it would be, to repeat, unjustified, considering all the facts
disclosed, to stamp the strike with illegality.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is enough that individual liability be incurred by those guilty of
such acts of violence that call for loss of employee status.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such an approach is reflected in our recent decisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was realistically observed by the present
Chief Justice, it is usually attended by "the excitement, the heat and the
passion of the direct participants in the labor dispute, at the peak thereof *
*."<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
Barely four months ago, in Insular Life Assurance Co., Ltd. Employees'
Association v. Insular Life Assurance Co., Ltd.,<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
there is the recognition by this Court, speaking through Justice Castro, of
picketing as such being "inherently explosive."<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
It is thus clear that not every form of violence suffices to affix the seal of
illegality on a strike or to cause the loss of employ­ment by the guilty party.</p>

<p class="NUM">7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the light of the
foregoing, there being a valid unfair labor practice strike, the loss of
employment decreed by respondent Court on all the Union officers cannot
stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The premise on which such penalty
was decreed was the illegality of the strike.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We rule differently.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, its
imposition is unwarranted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be
made clear, however, that because of the commission of specific serious acts of
violence, the Union's President, Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Bacsa</span>, as
well as its Assistant Auditor, <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>, did incur such a penalty.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On this point, it may be observed further that even if there was
a mistake in good faith by the Union that an unfair labor practice was
committed by the Shell Company when such was not the case, still the wholesale
termination of employee status of all the officers of the Union, decreed by
respondent Court, hardly commends itself for approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a drastic blow to a labor organization,
leaving it leaderless, has serious reper­cussions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The immediate effect is to weaken the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">New </span>leaders
may of course emerge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would not be
unlikely, under the circumstances, that they would be less than vigorous in the
prosecution of labor's claims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They may
be prone to fall victims to counsels of timidity and apprehension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the forefront of their consciousness must
be an awareness that a mistaken move could well mean their discharge from
employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That would be to render the
right to self-organization illusory.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plain and unqualified constitutional command of protection to
labor should not be lost sight of.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
The State is thus under obligation to lend its aid and its succor to the
efforts of its labor elements to improve their economic condition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is now generally accepted that
unionization <span style="">is </span>a means to such
an end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be encouraged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereby, labor's strength, what there is of
it, becomes solidified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can bargain
as a collectivity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Management then will
not always have the upper hand nor be in <span style="">a
</span>position to ignore its just demands.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That, at any rate, is the policy behind the Industrial Peace Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judiciary and administrative agencies in
construing it must ever be conscious of its implications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only thus may there be fidelity to what is
ordained by the fundamental law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For if
it were otherwise, instead of protection, there would be neglect or
disregard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is to negate the
fundamental principle that the Constitution is the supreme law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of respondent Court of Industrial

along with the afore­said Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Bacsa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> and Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>, were legally penalized with dismissal because

</span>Since; however, it is obvious from the decision itself that the strike
was approved not <span style="">once </span>but twice
by the Union member­ship, its cause being due to the dis­solution of the

Board, 379 <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>
203 (1964).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The relevant portion of
Chief Justice Warren's opinion is well-worth quoting:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The Company was concerned with the high
cost of its maintenance ope­ration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was induced to contract out the work by assurances from independent contractors
that economies could be derived by reducing the work force, decreasing fringe
benefits, and eliminating overtime payments.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These have long been regarded as matters peculiarly suitable for
resolution within the collective bargaining framework, and industrial
experience demonstrates that collective negotiation has been highly successful
in achieving peaceful accommodation of the conflicting inte­rests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, it is <span style="">contended </span>that when an employer can effect cost savings in these
respects by contracting the work out, there <span style="">is </span>no need to attempt to achieve similar economies through
negotiation with existing employees or to provide them with an opportunity to
negotiate <span style="">a </span>mutually acceptable
alternative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The short answer is that,
although it is not possible to say whether a <span style="">satis­</span>factory solution could be
reached, national labor policy is founded upon the congressional determination
that the chances are good enough to warrant subjecting such issues to the
process of collective negotiation." At pp. 212-213.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BARREDO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, a dissent from the opinion ably writ­ten by <span class="GramE">Our</span> learned colleague, Justice Fernando, may not be entirely
without some degree of plausibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
begin with, the basic conclusion of fact of the Court of Industrial Relations
in the appealed decision, which by law and the previously unbroken line of deci­sions
of this Court on the point, <span class="GramE">We</span> cannot lightly set
aside, seem to be logical and supported by evidence not seriously
disputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Withal, when it is considered
that there is nothing in the record to show that in act­ing as it did in this
case, respondent Shell Company, Ltd. was not actuated by any anti-union, much
less anti-labor motive but by purely economic reasons of sound management, and,
in fact, petitioner does not even sug­gest any such purpose, one must have to
hesitate and deliberate long and hard before giving assent to a pro­nouncement
that this respondent is guilty of unfair la­bor practice, such as to legalize
the strike declared by petitioner against it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I take it, however, that in a larger sense this is a policy decision,
and all things considered, particularly the constitutional in­junctions on
social justice and protection to labor, I prefer to err, since the juridical
considerations and equities in this case appear to my mind and cons­cience to
be in equipoise, on the side of labor, who, <span style="">as I see it, </span>acted in the same good faith that manage­ment
did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I must hasten to add though, that
in thus referring to labor, I do not have in mind the union leaders involved in
this case to whom the Court of In­dustrial Relations has attributed personal
reasons for their attitude, but I am thinking more of those security guards who
felt uncertain about the ultimate consequences of their transfer ordered by
respondent and naturally found nothing to hold on was the pro­tection of the
collective bargaining agreement which they had a right to assume insured the
substantial continuance of the terms and conditions of their em­ployment
contemplated in said agreement at the time it was entered into.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to the conclusion of the distinguished writer of the
main opinion, I regret to say that the record amply supports the finding of the
<st1:street><st1:address>Industrial Court</st1:address></st1:street> that the
transfer of the eighteen security guards concerned was not a violation of the
collective bar­gaining agreement between petitioner and said respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The more I go over the considerations of the
appealed decision, the more I am convinced not only that the move was never
tinged by any anti-labor hue but also that respondent had from the very
beginning taken peti­tioner and its duly authorized representatives in <span class="SpellE">in</span> its long study and deliberation of the problem, which
took years, and had, in fact, consulted them on various as­pects thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not denied that the maintenance of
security is not the only aspect of its multifarious departments it has decided
to contract out; petitioner did not object to the previous ones.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it is safe to conjecture that
petitioner has always seen the point of respondent, principally the economy it
would achieve and the consequent benefits labor might gain thereby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, I particularly note that
there is nothing in the record indicating that there is factual basis for petitioner's
claim that the security guards herein involved would surely suffer economic
loss as a result of their questioned transfer; respond­ent made it plain that
overtime and other benefits accruing to them as security guards would likewise
be given to them in their new positions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And in answer to petitioner's almost rhetorical question, why were said
guards being given additional hourly pay and lump sum bonuses, <span class="GramE">if</span> respondent did not feel that their rights were being
violated, it is perhaps not unreason­able to suppose that management simply
felt that as the company was to save money by contracting out its secu­rity
maintenance, it was but proper that the affected sector of labor should share a
part of its savings.</p>

<p class="BODY">All these, however, do not mean, on the other hand, that
petitioner's strike should necessarily be held to be illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is always a wholesome attitude in cases of
this nature to give but secondary import­ance to strict technicalities, whether
of substantive or remedial law, and to constantly bear in mind the human values
involved which are beyond pecuniary esti­mation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a general rule, labor's most potent and
effective weapon is the strike, and it is but natural that when things appear
to be dimming on the negotia­tion tables, labor should almost instinctively
take a striking posture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words,
the determination of the legality or illegality of a strike, particularly in
this enlightened era of progressive thinking on la­bor-management relations is
something that cannot be achieved by mere straight-jacketed legalistic argumen­tation
and rationalization; the process is broader and deeper than that, for to do
justice in deciding such an issue, it is imperative that utmost consideration
should be given to the particular circumstances of each case, with a view to
having the most comprehensive un­derstanding of the motivations of the parties,
in the light of human needs, on the part of labor, and in the perspective of
the orderly and economical conduct of business and industry, on the part of
management.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this particular case, for
instance, I cannot agree that respondent has violated its collective bargaining
agree­ment with petitioner, but, on the other hand, I am not ready to conclude
that for this reason, the strike here in question was consequently
illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hold that the two strike
votes taken by the members of the petition­ing union were both premised on the
sincere and honest belief that there was a legal breach of the said agree­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That now I find, as the <st1:street><st1:address>Industrial
  Court</st1:address></st1:street> did, that technically and in truth, there
was no such in­fringement did not of necessity stamp the said strike with the
stigma of illegality.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may not be amiss to add at this juncture, to allay and
disabuse possible apprehension that the main opinion may conceivably produce in
some <span class="GramE">quarters, that</span> I do not discern in it any
prejudice on the part of Justice Fernando, strictly pro-labor and anti-manage­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precisely, I am giving my concurrence to the
judgment in this case because I am convinced that, fundamentally, he has also
viewed the situation at hand in the light of the above considerations, even if
Our respective approaches and articulation of views have to differ, since I do
not own all the perspectives whence he gives support to his conclusions, because
I person­ally do not find any necessity to resort to other au­thorities, when I
feel that plain reasoning, predicated on commonly accepted principles and
reliance on one's proper sense of justice can suffice for the occasion.</p>

<p class="BODY">I also concur in the sanctions ordered in the main opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court has individualized the respective
re­sponsibilities of the strikers herein involved because such exactly is what
the justice of the situation de­mands.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reinstatement of those relatively innocent cannot be but only fair
and equitable and the approval of the lay-off of those found to have acted
beyond the requirements of the circumstances is founded on sound policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In simple terms, I hold that the mere fact
that a strike <span style="">is </span>not <span class="GramE">illegal,</span> and I want to emphasize here that there <span style="">is, </span>in my opinion, a large shade of
difference between a strike that <span style="">is </span>really
justified and legal and one that is merely held not to be il­legal, cannot be
an excuse for resort to violence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even
picketing which is the sister remedy of strikes is not supposed to be
completely unrestrained and unr<span style="">estr</span>icted,
and unprovoked violence, threats and du­ress of more or less grave nature
employed by strik­ers against person and property are twice removed from what
can be judicially tolerated.</p>
