<p>To guarantee the payment of the principal and interest of the bonds La Orden 
executed on Jan. 1, 1928 a Mortgage-Deed of Trust (Exhibit A) in favor of 
appellee Philippine Trust Co., a domestic corporation, as Trustee for the 
benefit of the bondholders, on certain real properties belonging to it, all 
situated in the City of Manila.</p>
<p>As La Orden defaulted in the payment of the principal and interests due on 
the bonds, fourteen bond-holders—appellants herein amongst them—owning more than 
25% in amount of the bonds then outstanding, thru Atty. Alva J. Hill, took steps 
to collect payment due and further made a written request to the Philippine 
Trust Co. to make a formal demand upon La Orden for the payment of all accrued 
interests. The demand was made but in spite of several extensions granted to La 
Orden the latter was not able to meet its obligation. For this reason Atty. Hill 
requested the Philippine Trust Co. to bring suit. As a result, the 
latter—hereinafter referred to as the Trustee—on behalf of the bondholders and 
pursuant to the authority granted to it in the deed of trust already referred 
to, instituted an action against La Orden (Civil Case No. 58809 of the Court of 
First Instance of Manila) on February 20, 1941 for the payment of the value of 
the outstanding bonds and interests due thereon, praying at the same time for 
the appointment of a Receiver for the mortgaged properties. As in its answer to 
the complaint La Orden agreed to the appointment of a Receiver, the court 
granted the petition on March 13, 1941, and thereafter the Receiver appointed by 
the Court took possession of all the mortgaged properties. All the bondholders 
were notified of this action. Atty. Alva J. Hill acknowledged receipt of the 
notice in behalf of his clients and further expressed hope that the plan of the 
Receiver to make payment to the bondholders would materialize soon, and thanked 
the Trustee for what it had done in the premises.</p>
<p>Upon several orders of the Court dated April 22, and May 6, 1941 and July 24 
and September 11, 1941, the Receiver—with the help of the Trustee and La 
Orden—tried to sell the mortgaged properties but all their efforts were in 
vain.</p>
<p>Upon the outbreak of the last World War, the properties remained in the 
possession of the Receiver. Efforts exerted at that time to sell them also 
failed until June, 1944 when Juan Pellicer Co., Inc. offered to buy them for the 
sum of P900,000.00. This offer having been accepted by the parties, the same was 
approved by the Court. After the Trustee, had received the purchase price—part 
of which, namely, the sum of P475,592.00 in Japanese military notes,—in full 
payment of the outstanding bonds, their interests due and other pending 
obligations, he executed the corresponding deed of cancellation of the mortgage 
on July 21, 1944. Notice of such payment was published in the newspaper 
"Tribune" on July 13, August 1 and August 8, 1944 by the Trustee, informing the 
bondholders that all bonds and interests thereon were due and payable at its 
office any day during office hours, but while some bondholders collected the 
value of, and the interests due on their bonds, appellants failed to do the 
same. On or about August 1, 1944 the Receiver submitted to the Court its report 
relative to the sale of the mortgaged properties, the delivery of the sum of 
P900.000.00 to the Trustee—part of it in payment of the bonds, interests due 
thereon and all other pending obligations—and the discharge or cancellation of 
the mortgage. It was filed together with a petition, with the conformity of all 
the parties to the case, for its approval, and it was so approved by the Court 
on August 8, 1944.</p>
<p>Upon liberation Executive Order No. 49 was promulgated invalidating all 
deposits made during the war in Japanese military notes. Subsequently, Mary McD. 
Bachrach, now substituted by Domingo P. Dizon, Executor of her estate, on the 
one hand, and J. W. Ferrier, Sr., in his capacity as Administrator of the 
Intestate Estate of the deceased Marie B. Stafford, and Harry' E. Stafford (both 
now substituted by M. R. Sotelo and Charles K. Stafford, as administratrix and 
administrator of the estates of the deceased spouses Marie Stafford and Harry E. 
Stafford, respectively), on the other, instituted separate actions against the 
Trustee (Philippine Trust Co.) and La Orden in the Court of First Instance of 
Manila (Civil Cases Nos. 1103 and 11428) to recover from them the value of their 
bonds, plus all interests due thereon etc.</p>
<p>The principal defense interposed by La Orden was that the bonds owned by 
appellants as well as all interests due thereon had been fully paid. On the 
other hand, the principal defense interposed by the Trustee was that, in its 
aforesaid capacity, it was under obligation to receive, as in fact it did 
receive from La Orden, the amount necessary to cover, for purposes of payment, 
the par value of appellants' outstanding bonds, with the accrued interests 
thereon; that because said deposit constituted payment, it was its obligation, 
as Trustee, to execute, as it did execute, the release and cancellation of the 
Mortgage—Deed of Trust mentioned in the complaint; that its only obligation, as 
Trustee, to appellants was to deliver to them the Japanese military notes which 
were deposited with it on July 1, 1944 by La Orden in full payment of 
appellants' bonds and accrued interests thereon, obligation which it has always 
been ready, willing and able to perform.</p>
<p>After a joint trial of the two eases the lower court rendered judgment 
absolving "defendant in both cases * * * from all liability in connection with 
the mortgaged bonds in question, with costs against the plaintiff", from which 
decision the present, appeal was taken.</p>
<p>Laying aside incidental issues unnecessarily raised and extensively discussed 
by appellants in their brief, the fundamental question raised by them—as far as 
La Orden is concerned—is whether the payment or deposit made by the latter 
mentioned heretofore constitutes a valid payment and discharge of its obligation 
to appellants and other bondholders. And, as far as the Trustee is concerned, 
the question to be determined is whether it had committed any breach of trust or 
was guilty of bad faith, negligence and/or imprudence in the performance of its 
duties as Trustee, rendering it liable for damages to appellants as 
bondholders.</p>
<p>There is no question that La Orden defaulted in the payment of the principal 
and interests due on the bonds in question and of others outstanding on or about 
the year 1937, and that as a result, fourteen bondholders, including appellants 
herein, owning more than 25% in amount of the bonds aforesaid, after protracted 
and vain attempts to collect from La Orden, requested the Trustee on February 
27, 1941 to bring the matter to court. This the Trustee did, pursuant to the 
provisions of Section 4, Article III of the Mortgage—Deed of Trust—according to 
which, upon default and upon written request of holders of 25% in amount of the 
bonds then outstanding, the Trustee shall take judicial proceedings by suit or 
otherwise, as the Trustee, with the advice of counsel, shall deem to be to the 
best interests of the holders of the bonds. As already stated, during the 
pendency of said case (Civil Case No. 58809 of the Court of First Instance of 
Manila) a Receiver was appointed; the Receiver took possession of the mortgaged 
properties and was authorized to sell them so that with the proceeds of the sale 
he may have the amount necessary to pay appellants' bonds, such efforts having 
been in vain until the offer made by Juan Pellicer Co., Inc. in the month of 
June, 1944, was accepted by the Receiver and approved by the Court; that the 
purchase price of P900,000.00 was paid by the purchaser to the Receiver and by 
the latter turned over to the Trustee, part of it, in the sum of P475,592.00, in 
full payment of all the outstanding bonds—including those of appellants—together 
with all interests due thereon; that for this reason the Trustee had to execute 
the corresponding deed of cancellation of the mortgage on July 21, 1944. Bearing 
in mind that the action instituted by the Trustee was precisely for the purpose 
of collecting the principal and interests due on the aforesaid bonds—including 
those owned by appellants—it requires no further argument to show that, by means 
of the deposit or payment thus made, the obligation of La Orden in relation to 
its outstanding bonds and interests due thereon was completely satisfied and 
discharged.</p>
<p>But appellants contend that the Trustee, in receiving and accepting the 
deposit aforesaid, was acting as an agent of La Orden and not theirs. This is 
untenable. As already stated, the action for collection was authorized by the 
Deed of Trust and was instituted on behalf and for the benefit of the 
bondholders. Whatever may be the law in other jurisdictions regarding the 
matter, the fact is that under the Deed of Trust Exhibit A the Trustee not only 
had the right but the duty to institute the aforesaid action on behalf and for 
the benefit of the bondholders after default on the part of La Orden and after 
receiving the required request from bondholders who owned at least 25%, in 
amount, of the bonds. Consequently, when the proceeds obtained from the sale of 
the mortgaged properties—duly authorized and approved by the court—was paid to 
the Receiver and forthwith delivered to the Trustee, the inescapable conclusion 
can be no other than that La Orden had fully complied with its obligation to pay 
the bonds. It must be borne in mind furthermore that all the proceedings 
relative to this sale and deposit with the Trustee of the amount necessary to 
effect full payment of all outstanding bonds were approved by the court, with 
the conformity of the parties to the case. The latter, therefore, are now 
precluded from contesting the validity and legal effectiveness thereof. It is 
therefore obvious that the ownership of the money deposited with the Trustee was 
vested in the bondholders from the moment of its deposit, and from this it 
necessarily follows that when the deposit was voided by Executive Order No. 49, 
the loss had to be borne by the bondholders pursuant to the principle of <em>res 
perit domino suo</em>.</p>
<p>With respect to the liability for damages demanded from the Trustee, 
appellants claim that the latter had made no valid tender of payment to them; 
that, by not filing suit earlier; by allowing the constitution on the mortgaged 
properties of a lien superior to that of the bondholders; by improvidently 
executing a deed of cancellation of mortgage, and by its failure to actually 
effect payment to the bondholders with the amount deposited with it, the Trustee 
was guilty of bad faith and/or negligence, and so must be made to suffer the 
damages resulting from the invalidation of the amount deposited. All these 
contentions, in our opinion, are without merits.</p>
<p>Even assuming that a tender of payment to the bondholders was necessary, it 
appears that under the Deed of Trust, the obligation of the Trustee, after the 
deposit had been made, was to hold the same to the credit of the bondholders and 
to deliver the money so deposited to said bondholders upon presentation of the 
bonds and interest-coupons attached thereto. Undoubtedly, to comply with this 
duty, the Trustee in this case published a notice in the "Tribune" of July 13, 
August 1 and August 8, 1944, informing all bondholders that they could come to 
its office any day during office hours to receive payment of the principal and 
interests due on their bonds. In fact, some bondholders did appear and collect, 
but appellants failed to do the same. This notice was published in accordance 
with the procedure laid down in Section 4, Article I of the Deed of Trust, 
albeit it was not required by the provisions of Section 5 of the same 
Article—which were the provisions applicable to the case. This clearly shows 
that the Trustee had practically gone out of its way to protect the interests of 
the bondholders, more specifically, to enable them to collect the amount they 
were entitled to.</p>
<p>The alleged constitution of a lien on the mortgaged properties superior to 
that of the bondholders, as evidenced by the "Agreement for Credit Advances" 
(Exhibits Y &amp; 8) appears to have been approved by the court as shown on page 
3 of the exhibit itself. The advances secured by the alleged, superior lien were 
made by the Trustee in accordance with Section 1, Article V of the Deed of 
Trust, according to which the Trustee was entitled to be reimbursed for all 
proper outlays, liabilities and expenses made in connection with the performance 
of its duties as Trustee and to a reasonable compensation for its services, and 
such expenses or advances shall be deemed secured by the indenture and "shall be 
paid out of any moneys coming into the possession of the Trustee and prior to 
any payment of, or on account of, the interest or principal of the bonds secured 
thereunder and prior to any other claims hereby secured". This provision of the 
Deed of Trust is, of course, binding on all those who purchased the bonds.</p>
<p>In connection with the failure of the Trustee to take prompt court action 
against La Orden, it appears that whatever delay there was in the filing of the 
suit against the latter was due, in great measure, to the bondholders themselves 
who had consented to give La Orden repeated extensions of time within which to 
meet its obligation. Had the Trustee unreasonably delayed the filing of the 
action after it had been requested to bring suit by the bondholders who owned at 
least 25%, in amount, of the outstanding bonds, it could have been different, 
but in this case there is no question that the suit was brought within a 
reasonable time after the request or demand to that effect was made.</p>
<p>As far as the release of the mortgage is concerned, appellant's contention is 
absolutely without merits. It was the duty of the Trustee to give the said 
discharge upon payment of the value of the bonds and interests due thereon at 
the time.</p>
<p>In view of the conclusions we have arrived at regarding the main questions 
involved in ths appeal, we deem it unnecessary to consider the others which, at 
any rate, are already indirectly resolved by what has been said heretofore.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with 
costs.</p><em>Bengzon, Acting C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, 
Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera,</em> and <em>Paredes, JJ.,</em> 
concur.</div>
