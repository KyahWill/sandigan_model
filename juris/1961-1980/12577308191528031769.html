				<BR><BR><div align="justify">A case certified by &nbsp;the Court of Appeals on the ground that the issues &nbsp;involved are purely &nbsp;of law. For &nbsp;the administration of the &nbsp;estate of &nbsp;her &nbsp;deceased husband, &nbsp;Pascual Villanueva, the &nbsp;widow Maurieia G. &nbsp;de Villanueva, on December &nbsp; 19, 1949, petitioned the Court of First Instance &nbsp;of Agusan, &nbsp;for letters of Administration (Sp. Proc. &nbsp;No. &nbsp;67). &nbsp;The &nbsp;petition &nbsp;was set for hearing and Notice thereof was published on February 25, &nbsp;March 4 and &nbsp;11, &nbsp;1950, the Manila Daily &nbsp;Bulletin. &nbsp;At the hearing, the other heirs while agreeing &nbsp;to the placing &nbsp;of the estate &nbsp; under &nbsp;administration, &nbsp;opposed the appointment of the widow. &nbsp;The name of Atty. Teodulo &nbsp;R. Ricaforte, was suggested and &nbsp;all the parties agreed. &nbsp;After the &nbsp;taking of &nbsp;the &nbsp;required &nbsp;oath, &nbsp;Atty. Ricaforte &nbsp;entered into &nbsp;the performance &nbsp;of his duties. &nbsp;Under &nbsp;date of &nbsp;November 9, 1950, the Clerk of the Agusan CFI, issued &nbsp;the following Notice to Creditors: <blockquote> <p>"Letters &nbsp;of &nbsp;administration having been issued &nbsp;in the &nbsp;above entitled &nbsp;case in favor of Teodulo R. Ricaforte &nbsp;for the &nbsp;settlement of the intestate of Pascual Villanueva, &nbsp;deceased; Notice is hereby &nbsp;given to all persons &nbsp;having claims for money against &nbsp;the &nbsp;decedent, the said &nbsp;Pascual &nbsp;Villanueva, arising from contract, express &nbsp;or implied, whether the same be due, not due, or contingent, for funeral expenses and expenses of last sickness of the deceased, and judgment for money against him, requiring them to file their claims with the clerk of court &nbsp;within six but not beyond twelve &nbsp;months &nbsp;after date of the &nbsp;first publication of this notice, serving &nbsp;copies &nbsp;of such &nbsp;&nbsp;claims &nbsp;upon the administrator, the said Teodulo R. Ricaforte."</p> </blockquote> <p>The above notice contained the usual order for &nbsp;publication thereof (once a week for three &nbsp;consecutive weeks), which was effected, thru the &nbsp;Morning Times of&nbsp; Cebu City, a newspaper of general circulation, on November 16, &nbsp;23 and 30, 1950, which &nbsp;expired on November 16, &nbsp;1951.</p> <p>On &nbsp;July &nbsp;20, &nbsp;1953, &nbsp;the &nbsp;defendant-appellant &nbsp;Philippine National &nbsp;Bank filed &nbsp;in the &nbsp;administration &nbsp;proceedings &nbsp;a Creditor's Claim, of the following tenor—</p> <blockquote> <p>"The &nbsp;Philippine &nbsp;National Bank, Creditor of &nbsp;Pascual &nbsp;Villanueva', deceased, respectfully &nbsp;presents its &nbsp;claim against the estate &nbsp;of the said deceased for Approval as&nbsp; follows:<br><table align="center" border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="52%"><div align="justify"> Original amount thru Agusan Agency on Dec. 20, 1939</div></td> <td valign="bottom" width="34%"><div align="justify">.............................................................</div></td> <td valign="bottom" width="14%"><div align="justify">P600.00</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">To int. at 10%: on P600.00 fr. 12-20-39 to &nbsp;5-5-53 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></td> <td valign="top"> <div align="justify"></div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">747.45</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">Total due as of June 5, 1953 &nbsp;(Daily int. of P0.1644 after June 5, 1953)&nbsp;</div></td> <td valign="bottom"> <div align="justify">.............................................................</div></td> <td valign="bottom"><div align="justify">P1.347.45</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></p>That &nbsp;the &nbsp;said &nbsp; obligation &nbsp;has &nbsp;been &nbsp;due and demandable since December 20, 1940; that the same is true and just claim and that it is still unpaid without any set-off." </blockquote> <p>On October 12, 1954, &nbsp;the Philippine National Bank filed a Motion &nbsp;for Admission of Claim, stating—</p> <blockquote> <p>"1. That the &nbsp;Philippine National Bank filed its claim dated July 20, &nbsp;1953; </p> <p>2. That the last &nbsp;action taken on the claim was an &nbsp;order of this Honorable Court issued on March 20, 1954, transferring the hearing of the &nbsp;claim until &nbsp;the next calendar of the court, without objection of the &nbsp;administrator;</p> <p>3. That the administrator has not answered the claim nor denied the same.</p> <p>Wherefore, it is respectfully prayed that &nbsp;an &nbsp;order he &nbsp;issued admitting and approving the &nbsp;claim and &nbsp;ordering the administrator to pay the Bank the amount of the claim."</p> </blockquote> <p>The &nbsp;administrator, on &nbsp;November &nbsp;5, &nbsp;1954, opposed the claim, &nbsp;alleging that &nbsp;he had no knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief &nbsp;as to the truth of the allegations therein. &nbsp;&nbsp;As &nbsp;special defenses, he interposed—</p> <blockquote> <p>"That &nbsp;the same indebtedness; if it existed, has already been paid" That the cause of action for the recovery of the aforesaid amount of P1,347.4o is &nbsp;barred &nbsp;by the statute of limitations, for more than ten (10) years have elapsed &nbsp;since the cause of action &nbsp; accrued up to the &nbsp;present &nbsp;time;</p> <p>That the said claim is barred forever or; the ground that the to &nbsp;creditors having been published in the MORNING TIMES of City, a newspaper of general circulation in the province, on November 10, 23 &nbsp;and 30, 1950, * * * the &nbsp;Philippine National failed to file its claim &nbsp;within &nbsp;the time limited in the notice, * *</p> </blockquote> <p>The appellant PNB, on &nbsp;November &nbsp;11, 1958, more than four (4) years &nbsp; after the opposition of the claim presented by &nbsp;the administrator, filed a pleading captioned &nbsp;"Petition for an Extension of &nbsp;time within &nbsp;which to &nbsp;File &nbsp;the Claim of Philippine &nbsp;National &nbsp;Bank", alleging, among others, that Sec. 2, Rule 87 of the Rules, allows the filing of claims even if the period stated in the notice to &nbsp;creditors had elapsed, upon cause shown and on &nbsp;such terms as are equitable; that &nbsp;its failure &nbsp;to present &nbsp;the claim within the period stated in the notice, was its lack of knowledge of the administration proceedings, for while said bank maintains a branch office in &nbsp;Agusan, &nbsp;the &nbsp;employees &nbsp;there did not &nbsp;come &nbsp;to &nbsp;know of the proceedings, &nbsp;the &nbsp;notice having been published in the Morning Times, &nbsp;a newspaper &nbsp;of a very limited &nbsp;circulation.</p> <p>On &nbsp;January 16, &nbsp;1959, &nbsp;the CFI &nbsp;issued &nbsp;&nbsp;the &nbsp;following Order—</p> <blockquote> <p>"It appearing &nbsp;that the claim of the Philippine National &nbsp;Bank against the &nbsp;estate of the &nbsp;deceased Pascual &nbsp;Villanueva &nbsp;is already barred by the statute of limitations because the claim was due and demandable since December 20, 1940, but was filed on July 20, 1953, after the expiration &nbsp;of ten &nbsp;years, and &nbsp;considering that &nbsp;said filing was furthermore not presented in court within the period &nbsp;fixed by Sec. 2, Rule 87 of the Rules of Court, and no reason having been shown &nbsp;to justify &nbsp;the extension of time &nbsp; for its filing, the Court resolves to deny &nbsp;as it &nbsp;hereby denies the petition for an extension of time for the filing of the claim by the Philippine National &nbsp;Bank. The failure of the Bank to present on time the claim was due to its &nbsp;own fault and can hardly be considered excusable &nbsp;negligence."</p> </blockquote> <p>Appellant Bank moved to reconsider the above Order, arguing that &nbsp;the statute of limitations had been suspended by &nbsp;the Moratorium Law, and that the courts can extend "the &nbsp;period limited in the notice, under &nbsp;special circumstances, and on grounds of equity (Velasquez vs. Teodoro, 46 Phil. 757). &nbsp;The PNB listed &nbsp;five incidents, &nbsp;which it considered special circumstances to warrant the granting the extension to present claim, among which are the lack knowledge of &nbsp;the pendency of &nbsp;the administration proceedings; &nbsp;the &nbsp;legitimacy &nbsp;of the &nbsp;loan secured &nbsp;by &nbsp;the deceased; that &nbsp;when it filed the &nbsp;claim, it &nbsp;did not &nbsp;know that the period stated &nbsp;in the notice had already expired. In &nbsp;disposing &nbsp;of &nbsp;the motion for reconsideration, &nbsp;the lower court, on March &nbsp;3, 1959, &nbsp;said—</p> <blockquote> <p>"The Court believes that the filing of money claim on July 20, 1953 in the Office of the Clerk of Court did not suspend the &nbsp;runing &nbsp;of the period of prescription because said claim &nbsp;was filed out of time and therefore invalid for all &nbsp;legal &nbsp;purposes. &nbsp;A careful revision &nbsp;of &nbsp;the record shows that &nbsp;the &nbsp;Philippine &nbsp;National &nbsp;Bank, contrary to the pretension of &nbsp;its counsel, &nbsp;had knowledge of the present administration &nbsp;proceedings long &nbsp;before July &nbsp;20, 1953, because the second payment of the claim &nbsp;due to the deceased Pascual Villanueva from &nbsp;the &nbsp;Philippine War Damage Commission in the amount of P6,441.30, was deposited in &nbsp;the Agusan Agency of the Bank in June, 1951. &nbsp;And &nbsp;in the inventory filed &nbsp;by the new administrator Francisco S. Conde, on February 27, 1957, the following item appears:</p> <p>Money belonging to the said deceased, which came into the hands of the administrator on December 1, 1951, appearing in the Bank A-1114, &nbsp; Agusan Agency deposited by &nbsp;the late administrator Teodulo &nbsp;R. &nbsp;Ricaforte.— PG.897.52.</p> <p>WHEREFORE, the motion for reconsideration &nbsp;is denied for lack of merits."</p> </blockquote> <p>The order &nbsp;of January 16, &nbsp;1959 &nbsp;was &nbsp;the subject of &nbsp;the appeal &nbsp;to &nbsp;the Court of Appeals which, as &nbsp;stated in &nbsp;the threshold of this opinion, certified the same to this Court. The important issue &nbsp;&nbsp;presented &nbsp;is whether &nbsp;or not &nbsp;the claim in question is already barred. &nbsp;Admittedly, the claim was filed outside &nbsp;of the period provided for in the Order of the lower court, &nbsp;within which to present &nbsp;claims against the estate. &nbsp;The period fixed in the notice lapsed on November 16, 1951 and the claim was filed on July 20, 1053 or about 1 year and 8 months late. &nbsp;This notwithstanding, appellant contends &nbsp;that &nbsp;it did &nbsp;not &nbsp;know of such &nbsp; administration &nbsp;proceedings, &nbsp;not even its &nbsp;employees in the Branch Office in Butuan City, Agusan. &nbsp;It &nbsp;is &nbsp;to be noted that the petition for Letters of Administration &nbsp;and the Notice to Creditors were &nbsp;duly &nbsp;published in the Manila Daily Bulletin and &nbsp;in the Morning &nbsp;Times, &nbsp;respectively, which &nbsp;was &nbsp;a full &nbsp;compliance with &nbsp;the requirements &nbsp;of the Rules. &nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the supposed lack of knowledge &nbsp;of the proceedings &nbsp;on the part of appellant and its employees had &nbsp;been belied by imcontested and eloquent &nbsp;evidence, consisting of a deposit of an amount of money by the administrator of the estate &nbsp;in said Bank (Agusan &nbsp;Agency). The deposit was made on &nbsp; December &nbsp;1, &nbsp;1951, in spite &nbsp;of which &nbsp;the appellant Bank only filed its claim on July 20, 1953. &nbsp;It is quite &nbsp;true &nbsp;that the &nbsp;Courts can extend the period within which to present claims against the estate, even &nbsp;after &nbsp;the &nbsp;period limited has elapsed; but &nbsp;such extension should only be granted &nbsp;under special circumstances. The lower court did not find any justifiable reason to give the extension and &nbsp;for one thing, there was no period to extend, since &nbsp;the same had lapsed.</p> <p>Having reached the above conclusions, We &nbsp;deem it unnecessary to determine the question as to whether or not the Moratorium Law had &nbsp;suspended the prescriptive period for filing of the claim under consideration.</p> <p>Wherefore, the order, &nbsp;subject of the appeal is hereby affirmed, with costs against appellant &nbsp;Philippine National Bank, in both instances.</p> <p><i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Dizon, Regala</i> and <i>Makalintal, JJ., </i>concur.</p> </div>
