Municipal Court of </span><span style="">Rosario,
presided </span><span style="">over by Municipal
Judge, <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Santamaria</span>,

Angeles, Chief of Police of
Rosario, informed the Court that, ac­cording to his own investigation, the
culprits were not the accused, but other persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon his motion and over the objection of Ac­ting
Assistant Fiscal Felix B. <span class="SpellE">Mintu</span>, who invoked his
right to con­trol the prosecution, the continuation of the preliminary
examination was postponed to </span><st1:date year="1967" day="11" month="10"><span style="">October 11, 1967</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in the complaint for the killing of Santos <span class="SpellE">Aprao</span>,
which did not include, however, Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pureza</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pedrito</span> Ramos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1967" day="9" month="10"><span style="">October 9,
 1967</span></st1:date><span style="">, Judge <span class="SpellE">Averia</span> issued an order directing the City Judge of <span class="SpellE">Trece</span> <span class="SpellE">Martires</span>, Ernesto G. <span class="SpellE">Pepa</span>, to conduct the corresponding preliminary
investigation in said cases Nos. 600 to 603.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, Judge <span class="SpellE">Pepa</span>, after, seemingly,
conducting a pre­liminary examination <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>,
issued warrants for the arrest of Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Pureza</span>, <span class="SpellE">Igmidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Abutan</span>, Rogelio Reyes, <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Nati</span>, Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pureza</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pedrito</span> Ramos and <span class="SpellE">Venerando</span> <span class="SpellE">Abueg</span> - herein­after
referred to as petitioners - in all four cases.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Soon thereafter, </span>the
office of <span style="">the </span>P<span style="">rovincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>,
</span>of which <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> Reyes was the
officer-in-charge, acting through the <span class="SpellE">aformentioned</span>
Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Mintu</span>, issued a subpoena, dated October 13,
1967, and addressed to the accused - Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Ibias</span>,
Edo <span class="SpellE">Ibias</span> and Norberto <span class="SpellE">Quinto</span>
- commanding them to ap­pear before said Office, on October 16, 1967, in
connection with the criminal complaint filed with the Municipal Court of
Rosario.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On or about <st1:date year="1967" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1967</st1:date>, said accused, in
turn, filed with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>
Civil Case No. Tm-288 thereof, against Fiscals Reyes and <span class="SpellE">Mintu</span>,
to restrain them from proceeding with the investigation of the offenses charged
in said criminal complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this
civil case, Judge <span class="SpellE">Averia</span> issued, on <st1:date year="1967" day="16" month="10">October 16, 1967</st1:date>, an order
restraining said Fiscals from proceeding with said investigation, until further
orders.</p>

<p class="BODY">Presently, or on November 7, 1967, petitioners commenced, in the
Supreme Court, the present action for certiorari and in­junction, against Judge
<span class="SpellE">Averia</span>, Judge <span class="SpellE">Pepa</span>, the
Municipal Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, the aforesaid widows of
the deceased, and Mrs. Diaz, to prevent the enforcement of the said warrants of
arrest, as well as to nullify the same and the proceedings leading to the
issuance thereof, upon the theory that the Municipal Court of Rosario has a
better right than the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Trece</span> <span class="SpellE">Martires</span> to conduct the preliminary investigation of the
crimes in question and that, at any rate, said warrants of arrest are null and
void, the proceedings before Judge <span class="SpellE">Pepa</span> having been
held <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>, without notice to
petitioners herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition in the case at bar is devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the proceedings in the Municipal
Court of Rosario and those held in the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Trece</span>
<span class="SpellE">Martires</span>, seek to determine the exis­tence of
probable cause against those who, on September 30, 1967, had allegedly killed <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> Victor, Santos <span class="SpellE">Aprao</span> and
Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Horario</span>, and committed the crime of
frustrated murder against Domingo Diaz, the persons charged in one court are <u>different</u>
from those accused in the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are
not aware of and our attention has not been called to any legal provision, rule
or decision that would bar the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>
or the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Trece</span> <span class="SpellE">Martires</span>
from proceeding with the investigation of the charges preferred against
petitioners herein, merely because the crimes imputed to <u>them</u> were,
according to the complaint filed with the Municipal Court of Rosario, committed
by <u>other</u> persons.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, said crimes are
within the original <u>exclusive</u> juris­diction of said Court of First
Instance, which is not and can not be deprived of such jurisdiction </span><span style="">in consequence of
the proceedings be­fore </span><span style="">the
Municipal Court of Rosario.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, also,
the reference of said Criminal Cases Nos. 600 to 603 by the Court of First
Instance </span>of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> to the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Trece</span> <span class="SpellE">Martires</span> is expressly sanc­tioned
in Section <span style="">13, </span>in relation to
Section 2, of Rule 112 of the Rules of Court, which provide that:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 13.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Preliminary
examination and investigation by the judge of the Court of First Instance</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Upon complaint filed directly with the
Court of First Instance, without previous preliminary examination and
investigation conducted by the fiscal, the judge <span style="">thereof shall either refer the complaint to the justice of the peace
referred to in the second paragraph of section 2 hereof for preliminary
examination and investigation, or himself conduct both preliminary examination
and investigation simultaneously in the manner provided in the preceding
sections, and </span><span style="">should he </span><span style="">find reasonable ground to believe that the
defendant has committed the offense charged, he shall issue </span>a <span style="">warrant for his arrest, and thereafter refer
the case to the fiscal for the filing of the cor­responding information."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"SEC. 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Officers
authorized to conduct preliminary examination</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Every justice of the peace, municipal
judge, city or provincial fiscal, shall have authority to conduct preliminary
examination or investigation <span style="">in
accordance with these rules of all of­fenses alleged to have been committed
within his municipality, city or province, cognizable by the Court of First
Instance.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The municipal judge of the provincial capi­tal or of the
municipality in which the provincial jail is located, when directed by an order
of the Court of First Instance, shall have authority to conduct such
preliminary examination or investigation of any offense committed anywhere
within his province at the expense of the municipality wherein the same was
committed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The case of <span class="SpellE">Bacar</span> v. Tordesillas</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a><span style="">, relied upon by the peti­tioners, is not in
point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That case involved a complaint
for adul</span>tery, filed with the justice of the peace court of <u>San Jose</u>,
Antique - where the offense had allegedly been committed - and <span style="">dismissed for </span>insufficiency of the
evidence introduced at the preliminary examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon, thereafter, the same complaint was
filed with the justice of the peace of <span class="SpellE"><u>Sibalon</u></span>,
whose authority was assailed for lack of venue.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The objection <span style="">was </span>overruled
by said justice of the peace, upon the ground<span style=""> </span>that, the Court of <span style="">First
Ins­tance </span>had authorized him to contract the corresponding preliminary
investigation, pursuant to section 211 of the Administrative Code of 1917.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This provision conferred upon the Judge of
First Instance the power to designate the justice of the peace of one
municipality <u>to act as justice of </u><u><span style="">the pe</span>ace of another</u> municipality, <u>when the lat</u><u><span style="">ter is unable to perform the regular</span></u><u><span style=""> duties</span></u><u><span style=""> </span></u><u><span style="">of <span style="">his </span></span><span style="">office</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as no </span>such disability
existed, the Supreme Court declared <span style="">that
the justice of </span>the peace of <span class="SpellE">Sibalon</span> had no
jurisdiction to conduct <span style="">said </span><span style="">preliminary </span>investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Obviously, this precedent is not applicable to
the </span><span style="">case at bar, the complaints
in </span><span style="">Cases </span><span style="">Nos. </span><span style="">600 to 603 having been </span><span style="">filed
with the <u>court of first </u></span><u><span style="">instance</span></u><span style="">, unlike the second complaint in the </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bacar</span></span><span style=""> case </span><span style="">which was </span><span style="">filed with</span><span style=""> the <u>justice
of the peace </u></span><u><span style="">court</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, </span><span style="">the issue in the
<span class="SpellE">Bacar</span> case was <u>whether the </u></span><u><span style="">justice of the peace </span></u><u><span style="">of </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Sibalon</span></span><span style=""> could </span>validly be authorized to act <span style="">as justice of the peace </span></u><u><span style="">of </span></u><st1:city><st1:place><span style=""><u>San Jose</u></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There </span>is no such issue in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As regards the warrants
of arrest issued by Judge <span class="SpellE">Pepa</span>, </span><span style="">peti­tioners </span><span style="">impugn the legality thereof for the reason that </span><span style="">the proceed­ings </span><span style="">before said Judge were held <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">In this connection, it should be </span><span style="">noted that, pursuant to the provisions above </span><span style="">quoted, when </span><span style="">a criminal complaint is filed directly with </span><span style="">the<span style=""> </span>court
of first instance, </span><span style="">as the
complaints in said Cases Nos. 600 to 603 </span><span style="">were, said court may </span><span style="">either
conduct the preliminary investigation or refer the com­plaint to the proper
municipal or city court for preliminary </span><span style="">exami­</span><span style="">nation and
investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the court of first
instance chooses the first alternative, it must "conduct <u>both</u> the
preliminary </span><span style="">examination and the </span><span style="">preliminary investigation <u>simultaneously</u>."
If the </span><span style="">second </span><span style="">alternative is </span>taken, <span style="">the municipal court or the city court to
which the complaint has been referred, shall act in conformity with </span><span style="">sec­tions </span><span style="">5, 6, and 10 of said Rule </span>112, <span style="">reading:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Duty of
judge, fiscal or other officer conducting preliminary examination</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The justice of the peace, the municipal
judge, the fiscal or the <span style="">mu­</span>nicipal
mayor who conducts the preliminary <span style="">examina­</span>tion
as provided in these rules must take under oath, either in the presence <u>or
absence</u> of the accused, the testimony of the complainant and his
witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of the
complainant and his witnesses shall be reduced to writing and signed by
them."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SEC. 6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Warrant of
arrest, when issued</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- If the judge
be satisfied from the preliminary examina­tion conducted by him or by the <span style="">investigating officer that the offense </span>complained
of has been committed and that there is reasonable ground to believe that the
accused has committed it, he must issue a war­rant or order for his
arrest."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SEC. 10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Right of accused
to preliminary inves­tigation after arrest</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- After the arrest of the accused and his delivery to the court, he
shall be informed of the complaint or information filed against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He shall be given access to the testimony and
evidence presented against him at the preliminary examination, and, if he
desires to testify or to present witnesses or evidence in his favor, he shall
be allowed to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of
the witnesses presented at this in­vestigation need not be reduced to writing
but that of the accused shall be taken in writing and subscribed by him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In cases <span class="SpellE">triable</span> in the justice of
the peace or municipal courts, the accused shall not be entitled as a matter of
right to a preliminary investigation in ac­cordance with this section."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is worthy of notice that the preliminary examination by the <span style="">justice of the peace or municipal judge may
be conducted "either in the presence or <u>absence</u> of the
accused;" that </span><span style="">"if </span><span style="">the judge is
satisfied from the preliminary examination conducted by him" - "in
the presence or <u>absence</u> of the accused" - "that the offense
com­plained of has been committed and that there is reasonable ground to
believe that the accused has committed it, he <u>must</u> issue a war­rant or
order for his arrest;" and that, "<u>after</u> the arrest of the
accused, and his delivery to the court," the preliminary investiga­tion
shall take place as provided in section 10.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, the accused need <u>not</u> be present at the
preliminary examination conducted by the justice of the peace or municipal judge,
previous to the is­suance of the warrant of arrest, so that the validity
thereof is not <span style="">and cannot be affected </span>by
the fact that said <span style="">preliminary
examination may have taken </span>place <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

directly with the court of first instance, which, after conducting the sum<span style="">mary </span>investigation prescribed in sections
13 and 14 of General Orders No. 58, as amended, issued the corres­ponding
warrant of arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon their
apprehension and subsequent release on bail, the accused moved that a
preliminary investigation be conducted in their presence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was held that the motion had been properly

preliminary investigation.</p>
