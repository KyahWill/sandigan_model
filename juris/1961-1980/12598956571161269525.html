				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appellee filed his income tax return for the calendar year 1951 wherein he 
reported an annual gross income of P51,725.89 and claimed as deductions the 
aggregate amount of P43,241.07 leaving a taxable net income of P8,484.82. 
However, when this return was investigated by an examiner of the Bureau of 
Internal Revenue, most of the items claimed by appellee as deductions were 
disallowed, as having been improperly made under the law. The examiner also 
found that appellee failed to declare certain taxable income earned during the 
year 1951. Consequently, on December 11, 1953, an assessment was made holding 
appellee liable to pay the sum of P24,588.00 as deficiency income tax.
<p>Appellee protested against the new assessment and requested for a 
reinvestigation. In the reinvestigation made as requested, the Collector of 
Internal Revenue found the new assessment correct and, accordingly, sent a 
letter to appellee reiterating his demand that appellee pay the amount of 
P24,588.00, plus surcharge and interest, as deficiency income tax. Appellee 
neither appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals, nor paid the new tax assessed 
against him, whereupon the Collector filed an action before the Court of First 
Instance of Rizal for the collection of the above deficiency income tax pursuant 
to Section 316 of the National Internal Revenue Code.</p>
<p>Appellee moved for the dismissal of the complaint on the ground that, since 
the establishment of the Court of Tax Appeals by Republic Act No. 1125, an 
ordinary court has no longer jurisdiction to entertain cases involving the 
collection of internal revenue taxes. The trial court, ignoring the opposition 
of the government, dismissed the case acknowledging lack of jurisdiction. The 
Collector now comes before us contending that the trial court erred in holding 
that it lost jurisdiction over actions involving collection of internal revenue 
taxes after the enactment of Republic Act No. 1125 creating the Court of Tax 
Appeals.</p>
<p>There is merit in this appeal. Under Sections 7 and 11 of Republic Act No. 
1125, the Court of Tax Appeals <i>only</i> assumes exclusive appellate 
jurisdiction over a case involving a disputed assessment <i>if and when</i> the 
same is brought before it within the reglerhentary period of 30 days from the 
taxpayer's receipt of the decision of the Collector of Internal Revenue, and 
this only takes place when the appeal is taken by the taxpayer who is adversely 
affected by the decision. Note that under Section 11 the only one who can appeal 
is the taxpayer adversely affected by the decision or ruling of the Collector. 
No such right is given to the Collector, or to the government.</p>
<p>Thus, in the case of Acting Collector of Customs <i>vs</i>. Court of Tax 
Appeals, 102 Phil., 211, this Court gave the following interpretation of said 
Section 11:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Republic Act No. 1125, which was approved on Juna 16, 1954, became very 
specific when it gave an enumeration of those who may appeal from a decision or 
ruling of the Collector of Internal Revenue, the Commissioner of Customs, or 
Board of Assessment Appeals. Under this law, the right to appeal from decision 
or rulings of said officials is allowed only to persons, associations or 
corporation adversely affected by the same, and well knowing the connotation of 
the legal maxim 'inclusio unius est exclusio alterius' <i>the Government is 
certainly not one of them."</i> (Italics supplied)</p></blockquote>
<p>It would therefore appear that Republic Act No. 1125 only provides for a 
remedy to a taxpayer but not to the government, and when a situation arises 
where the taxpayer neither pays the tax assessed against him nor contests its 
validity before the Court of Tax Appeals, the only remedy left to the 
government, aside from distraint and levy, is to enforce its Collection by 
judicial action in the ordinary courts of justice.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> No other interpretation is tenable or 
reasonable, for to hold the contrary would be to deprive the government of its 
remedy to collect the tax by judicial action, which is unfair and 
discriminatory. Such interpretation is absurd and cannot be entertained.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order appealed from is set aside. The case is remanded to the 
trial court for further proceedings. No costs.</p><i>Bengzon, Acting C.J., 
Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera</i> and <i>Dizon, JJ.,</i>
