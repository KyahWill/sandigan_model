<p class="BODY">This case arose under this original provision of sec­tion
51.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last day for filing the income
tax returns of corporations was March 1, 1958,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
but the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Acoje</span> Mining Company was allowed
by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) up to April 30 of that year within
which to file its return "on condition that 50% of the tax due on each
return is paid to the * * * Treasurer of Manila on or before May 15, 1958, with
or without assessment notice(s) from this Office; otherwise, there shall accrue
on the whole tax due on each return the 5% surcharge and the 1% monthly
interest from May 16, 1958, pursuant to section 51(e) of the National Internal
Revenue Code.”<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner filed its return on <st1:date year="1958" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1958</st1:date>, but it failed to pay its tax, which
amounted to P1,148,585, or any amount thereof, on <st1:date year="1958" day="15" month="5">May 15, 1958</st1:date> as demanded in the let­ter of the BIR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On May 24 the petitioner received an as­sessment
notice from the BIR, giving it the option of paying its tax in two equal
installments, the first on or before <st1:date year="1958" day="15" month="6">June
 15, 1958</st1:date> and the second on or before <st1:date year="1958" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1958</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Still the petitioner was not able to pay its obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1959" day="16" month="3">March
 16, 1959</st1:date> it paid P1,303,693.98, representing the amount of the tax,
surcharge, interest and compromise penalty.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In­terest was paid on the whole amount of the
tax from <st1:date year="1958" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1958</st1:date>
and on only one-half of the tax from <st1:date year="1958" day="16" month="5">May
 16,1958</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the respondent
Commissioner of Internal Revenue demanded the pay­ment of the additional sum of
P17,2Z8.77 on the ground that in­terest should be paid on the entire amount of
tax due from <st1:date year="1958" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1958</st1:date>
to <st1:date year="1959" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1959</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner's request for reconsideration
having been denied, the case was elevated to the Court of Tax Appeals on the
issue of whether upon the failure of the petitioner to pay the first
installment of its 1957 in­come tax on May 15, 1958 the whole amount thereof
became liable to the payment of interest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioner contended that with­out notice or demand by the
respondent Commissioner the second installment did not become due until <st1:date year="1958" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1958</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the respondent
Commissioner argued that no such no­tice or demand was necessary as the entire
amount of the tax automatically became due upon the failure of the petitioner
to pay the first installment thereof on <st1:date year="1958" day="15" month="5">May
 15, 1958</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision the respondent Court of Tax Appeals held:</p>

<blockquote>"Apparently, both parties assume that the tax in question was
payable by installment. . . . There is nothing of record [however] to show that
petitioner gave notice to respondent, directly or indirectly, of its desire to
pay, the tax by installment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact,
the whole amount of the tax was paid on <st1:date year="1959" day="13" month="3">March
 13, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the
whole amount of the tax was due and payable on or before <st1:date year="1958" day="15" month="5">May 15, 1958</st1:date>, pursuant to Subsection (b) of
Section 51, and interest at the rate of 1% per month is due on the entire
amount from said date, when it became due, to the date of payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsection (c) of Section 51, prescribing the
dates of payment of income tax by installment, is not applicable as petitioner
did not choose to pay by installment."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner asked for a reconsideration of this deci­sion and,
failing to secure one, came to this Court on a peti­tion for review.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. The petitioner maintains that the only issue in this case is
whether its failure to pay one-half of its tax on or before May 15, 1958 -
without more - <u>ipso</u> <u>facto</u> made its entire obligation due and
demandable, and that in deciding the case instead on the question whether there
was an effective election to pay taxes in installments the respondent CTA de­nied
the petitioner due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">The ground, however, on which the respondent court de­cided this
case is so intimately related to, and is in fact assumed by the issue posed by,
it that it can be said to be properly before the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we once observed,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
the tendency is to accord appellate courts a broad discretionary power to waive
the lack of proper assignment of error and consider errors "closely
related to an error properly assigned, or upon which the determination of the
question raised by the error properly assigned is dependent."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The recent case of <u>Philippine</u> <u>Banking</u>
<u>Corp</u>. <u>v</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Lui</u></span> <u>She</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
illustrates this rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, the issue
on which the parties litigated and on which the trial court decided the case
was whether certain contracts purporting to lease a parcel of land to an alien
for 99 years and giving him an option to buy the land in the event he acquired
Philippine citizenship, were freely entered into by the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>,
an old woman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, after
reviewing the evidence, found nothing that would vitiate consent but
nonetheless invalidated the contracts on its finding that they were prohibited
by the Constitution:</p>

<blockquote>"This is not to say, however, that the contracts (<span class="SpellE">Plffs</span>. 3-7) are valid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For the testimony just quoted, while dispelling doubt as to the
intention of Justine Santos, at the same time gives the clue to what we view as
a scheme to circumvent the Constitutional prohibition against the transfer of
lands to aliens. . . .”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the petitioner was not really deprived of its
opportunity to present evidence on the issue on which the case was
decided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its motion for
reconsideration, it cited the testimony of its assistant corporate secretary
and attached a letter which it claimed indicated that it had elected to pay in
installments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever irregularity,
then, might have been committed in the beginning was cured by the subsequent
pre­sentation of evidence on the supposed new issue.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. Did the petitioner elect to pay its tax in install­ments?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be sure, the law does not specify in what
way the option to pay in installments should be exercised by the tax­payer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, it could be made impliedly as was
in fact done in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
implicit in the letter of February 25, 1958 of the respondent Commissioner is
the understanding that payment of the petitioner's tax was to be made in two
installments, hence, the reference therein that "50% of the tax due on
each return is [to be] paid . . . on or before May 15, 1958 . . .; otherwise,
there shall accrue on the whole tax due on each return the 5% surcharge and the
1% interest from May 16, 1958."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, when the petitioner failed to pay 50% of its tax (or, what
amounts to the same thing, the first installment) on May 15, 1958, the respond­ent
Commissioner gave it the option of paying the first installment on June 15,
1958 and the second on August 15, 1958.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All this shows the parties' understanding that the petitioner's
obligation was to be paid in two installments.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That the petitioner paid the whole amount of its tax when it finally
paid on <st1:date year="1959" day="16" month="3">March 16,1959</st1:date> in no
way warrants the conclusion that it thereby gave evidence of its intention to
pay in lump sum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After <st1:date year="1958" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1958</st1:date>, when the second
install­ment fell due, the petitioner's obligation was to pay the amount of its
tax in full.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. We now come to the principal issue in this case: whe­ther the
petitioner's obligation to pay the whole amount of its tax arose upon its
failure to pay the first installment thereof on <st1:date year="1958" day="15" month="5">May 15, 1958</st1:date>, without need of notice or demand from the
respondent Commissioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 51(c) provided: "If any installment is not paid on
or before the date fixed for its payment, the whole amount of the tax unpaid
shall be paid upon notice and demand from the Collector (now Commissioner) of
Internal Revenue."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obvious­ly, to
follow the petitioner's argument would be to place in the hands of the
respondent Commissioner the power to condone interests, for by simply
neglecting to make a demand, he could effectively prevent the whole obligation
from becoming due.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would result in
uncertainty, let alone in the uneven application of the law, since defaulting
taxpayers would or would not have to pay interest on the entire amount of their
obliga­tion depending on whether or not they have been given notices or demands
have been made upon them by the Commissioner of In­ternal Revenue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even among those required to pay interest on
the whole amount of tax it is evident that there would be dis­crimination since
notices may be sent or demands made at dif­ferent times.</p>

<p class="BODY">Public policy appears to require that no room be left for the
exercise of purely personal discretion in the matter of pay­ment of taxes if we
are, to borrow Learned Hand's felicitous phrase, to prevent "the defeat of
the venture at hand"<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
or "the failure of the undertaking."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
For indeed a taxpayer would al­ways find it to his advantage to elect
installment payment on the chance that the revenue official's neglect to send him
a notice or to make a demand would save him interest on one-half of the tax.</p>

<p class="BODY">In truth, an examination of section 51 in its entirety re­veals a
legislative design to establish a definite date when taxes should be
demandable.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, May 15 (now April 15) of every year was
fixed as the date for the payment of the tax or the first installment thereof
and August 15 (now July 15) for the second installment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What about the obligation for taxes when the
tax­payer fails to pay the first installment?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To say that, in ad­dition to the taxpayer's default, there must as well
be a de­mand from the Government before the obligation could become de­mandable
would be to disregard the line of growth of the statute as thus partly revealed
in section 51.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is more, the general rule expressed in paragraph (b) was
that taxes should be paid on May 15.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
the privilege to pay in installments was granted it was only on the condition
that one-half of the tax was paid on May 15, the date the whole amount should
ordinarily be paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence if that
condition was not fulfilled the privilege of paying in installments could not
be claimed.</p>

<p class="BODY">What then of the requirement of notice and demand in sec­tion
51(c)?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be sure, that section does not
say that the en­tire amount becomes demandable only upon notice from the Gov­ernment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is important because, as Mr. Justice
Felix Frank­furter reminds us, "One more caution is relevant when one is
ad­monished to listen attentively to what a statute says.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One must also listen attentively to what it
does not say."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>For what section 51(c) does say is that the
tax "[should] be paid upon notice and demand from the Collector of
Internal Revenue," from which it could just as rightly be concluded that
the assumption is that the obligation has earlier become due and demandable.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The notice and demand, then, in the original
text could mean no­thing more than a reminder to pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all the statute already provided for a
notice of assessment to be given to the taxpayer on the first of May.</p>

<p class="BODY">What we have just essayed above should dispose of the pe­titioner's
other argument that at the earliest its obligation to pay interest on the whole
amount of the tax should begin only from June 16, 1958 because the assessment
notice of the BIR was in effect a grant of an extension of time to pay.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the decision appealed fro is a affirmed, at
petitioner's cost.</p>
