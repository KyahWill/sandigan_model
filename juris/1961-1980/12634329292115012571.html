someone shouting and screaming at the top of her voice, from the creek about 80
meters east of their houses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> reacted first for he observed that the voice was
that of his 16-year old sister Imelda <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went out of his house immediately, passed
and dropped at the nearby house of his aunt Rosa Lozano, first degree cousin of
his father Vicente <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>, and asked her (Rosa) to
'please go to the creek and see Imelda'.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> did not wait for <st1:place>Rosa</st1:place>
anymore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He rushed to the creek followed
in a short while by Rosa and <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>.</blockquote>

order, they found Imelda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a
pitiful and shocking sight they saw.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Imelda was lying on the ground, face upward, naked and unconscious; her
face and cheeks swollen, lower lips cut and bleeding; her arms scratched and
bruised; <span class="SpellE">hematoma</span> on different parts of her body; and
her clothes about four meters away from her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><st1:place>Rosa</st1:place> took the clothes and they dressed up
Imelda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly later, Imelda regained
her consciousness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span>
asked her:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'<u>Who did this to you?</u>'
Imelda answered:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'<span class="SpellE"><u>Manong</u></span><u>
Victor, <span class="SpellE">manong</span>', referring to Victor Garcia, accused
herein an husband of Juanita <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>, older sister
of Imelda</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
asked what happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Imelda replied that
Victor abused and dishonored her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>When
<span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> inquired how Victor did it, Imelda briefly
recounted what transpired and she said:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'When I was putting on my dress he held me by the neck from behind,
dragged me and upon reaching the deeper part of the creek he submerged me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I shouted he stuffed my mouth with
cloth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he boxed face and I fell
unconscious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I regained my
consciousness, Victor was thumping on my chest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I shouted again, then <span class="SpellE">manong</span> Fred arrived</u>.’<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

bitterly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Weak she could not stand
anymore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> and Rosa carried her in their arms and with
the assistance of Faustino <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> they took her home.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Imelda was laid on a bed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her mother <span class="SpellE">Ignacia</span> <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>
asked her who was the perpetrator.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Imelda answered in the presence of <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>, <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> Lozano, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>, Faustino <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>, <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>, Rene <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>, Juanita
<span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> and her children that Victor Garcia was the
man who maltreated, abused and dishonored her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>Again, Imelda told and recounted briefly to her mother and their
neighbors what transpired, thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'When I
was at the creek, putting on my dress, my brother-in-law held me from behind,
submerged me in the creek several times, boxed me, sat on my chest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I lost consciousness then I did not know what
happened</u>.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The parents, brothers and sisters of Imelda thought of
bringing her to town for immediate medical treatment but they desisted because
of the curfew hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They believed that
they would be overtaken by the curfew on their way. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">Gayong-gayong</span> Norte
is 17 kilometers to town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In going to
the <span class="SpellE">centro</span>, one has to hike first to barrio <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Antonio</st1:place></st1:city>, seven kilometers away, for about two to three
hours, and from there to town by passenger <span class="SpellE">jeepneys</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Imelda died at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">nine
 o'clock</st1:time> that night, three hours after the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following day, September 29, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> went to town and reported the incident to the
police authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three policemen and
the municipal health officer, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> Gabriel,
proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Gayong-gayong</span>, arriving there before
high-noon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctor examined the

morning of <st1:date year="1974" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1974</st1:date>

</span>He further testified that he stayed in the house of his brother's
father-in-law, Domingo <span class="SpellE">Espanto</span>, in said Bo. San
Lorenzo for two months as he received, on September 30, 1974, a letter from his

Lorenzo at 6:00 o'clock in the morning of September 28, 1974 and did not return
in the afternoon of that day; on cross-examination, she testified that her

this, in turn, will depend on the credibility of said witnesses and of their
testimonies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, the trial court
entertained serious doubts on the credibility of the defense witnesses, for, as
it observed -</p>

<blockquote>"The demeanor, attitude and manner of testifying, candid,

<p class="BODY">We are not inclined to dispute such observation of the trial

that when the issue is one of credibility of witnesses, appellate courts will
generally not disturb the findings of the trial court, considering that it is
in a better position to decide the question, having heard the witnesses
themselves and observed their deportment and manner of testifying during the
trial, unless it has plainly overlooked certain facts of substance and value

the commission of the crime in barrio <span class="SpellE">Gayong-gayong</span>
was the testimony of defense witness Domingo <span class="SpellE">Espanto</span>,
the owner of the house in barrio San Lorenzo where defendant allegedly stayed
on September 28, 1974.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But not only does
such testimony suffer the infirmity heretofore adverted to but, more
importantly, it lacks the requisite certainty and <span class="SpellE">positiveness</span>
to prove that the defendant was indeed in the house of the defense witness in barrio

also clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question is what year of
September 28 when Victor Garcia came to your house?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
I can remember is he arrived there on the 28th but <u>I cannot remember the
month or the year</u> because I did not bother to think of the date because you
know as a farmer I am occupied." (Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clear from the foregoing testimony of defense witness
Domingo <span class="SpellE">Espanto</span> that he was uncertain of the date

requirement of a "positive, clear and convincing evidence" for an alibi
has not been complied with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">c.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial court did not predicate its
rejection of defendant's alibi solely on the weakness of the evidence for the
defense, but, primarily, on the strength of the evidence for the prosecution
which clearly belies defendant's claim that he was not, and could not have
been, at the scene of the crime at the time the same was committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a careful scrutiny of the prosecution's
evidence, We accord full concurrence with the trial court's conclusion that
defendant's alibi deserves to be rejected.</p>

</span>Defendant-appellant, through his counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>,
assails the admissibility of the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses re
the circumstances surrounding the victim's death on the ground that the same
were not of their own personal knowledge but were only narrated to them by the

are hearsay, appellant contends that the trial court erred in admitting the
same.</p>

be noted that neither the defendant nor his counsel below objected to the

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses as to the
statements of the victim on the circumstances surrounding her death are
admissible in evidence as her dying declaration, pursuant to Section 31, Rule
130 of the Revised Rules of Court which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 31.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>DYING

death."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's contention that the statements of the victim cannot
assume the character of a dying declaration, for the reason the prosecution
allegedly failed to show that the statements were given by the victim under a
consciousness of an impending death, is untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have held that "it is not necessary to the validity or
admissibility of a dying declaration that the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span>
expressly state that he has lost all hope of recovery; it is sufficient that

which the declaration was made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had
just recovered her consciousness and her physical condition bespeaks the
imminence of her death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was so weak
that she had to be carried by her brothers and Aunt Rosa from the creek to the

inflicted upon her, was the mental anguish and shock brought about by the

face swollen, lower lip cut and bleeding, <span class="SpellE">hematoma</span>
all over the body, broken ribs, right nipple removed and bleeding, hymen

to incriminate the defendant and that the trial court consequently erred in
taking their testimony at their face value.</p>

<p class="BODY">This contention is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The alleged improper motive imputed by the defendant to the prosecution
witnesses does not find support in the evidence on record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Except for <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> who allegedly harbored ill-feeling against the
defendant, no evidence whatsoever was presented to prove that prosecution
witnesses <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Ignacia</span> <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> and Rosa
Lozano had the motive to pervert the truth and to incriminate the
defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the ill-feeling which <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> allegedly had
against the defendant could not have been sufficient for the former to impute
against the latter, a brother-in-law, the heinous crime committed upon his sister
and to allow, in the process, the true culprit to escape liability.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, contrary to the allegation of appellant's counsel <u>de</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>, the trial court did not take the
testimonies of the prosecution witnesses at their face value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did exert effort to ascertain the
credibility of the said witnesses as well as that of their testimonies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the trial court expressly observed in
its decision that "(T)he demeanor, attitude and manner of testifying,
candid, direct and forthright answers of the prosecution witnesses show that
their story and version reflected the truth of the incident."<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
And as to the credibility of their testimonies, the trial court took the pains
of stating in detail the corroborating points between the <u>ante mortem</u>
statements of the victim, as testified to by the prosecution witnesses, and the
medical findings of the Municipal Health Officer, thus -<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">AQUINO, <i>J.</i>:<span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I concur.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Victor Garcia is
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape with homicide, a special complex crime
punished with death in article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">That complex crime was proven by the <span class="SpellE">antemortem</span>
declaration of the victim, who was Garcia's sister-in-law, by the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> that he saw
his brother-in-law, the accused Garcia, leaving the scene of the crime, and by
the indubitable evidence of the <u>corpus</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>delicti</u></span>
or the fact of the commission of the rape with homicide.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">As correctly surmised by the trial court,
Garcia, whose house was about fifty meters away from the creek, must have often
seen his sister-in-law topless or naked, taking a bath in the creek.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>He lusted after her.</p>

<p class="BODY">To overcome her resistance, he inflicted on her blows on the
chest and other parts of the body and he tried to asphyxiate her in the
creek.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim died of internal
hemorrhage due to chest compression and the presence of water in the abdominal
region.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before article 335 was amended, it was held that rape with
homicide was committed in a case where the accused, who was suffering from
gonorrhea, had sexual congress through intimidation with a fourteen-year-old girl
who died because of the venereal infection.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code was applied (People vs. Acosta, 60
Phil. 158).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In People vs. <span class="SpellE">Matela</span>, 58 Phil. 718, the
accused raped his sixteen-year-old niece-in-law and then killed her by
strangulation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was convicted of the <u>separate
offenses</u> of rape and homicide since it was not decisively shown that the
two crimes were complex.</p>

<p class="BODY">In People vs. Lopez, 107 Phil. 1039, the accused, after having
carnal knowledge with a woman by means of intimidation, stabbed her to
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was found guilty of the
complex crime of rape and murder as a "one and single continuous
act".<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Same
holding in People vs. Yu, 110 Phil. 793 where the accused was convicted of the
complex crime of rape and murder.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In People vs. <span class="SpellE">Obaldo</span>, 111 Phil. 838,
the accused confessed that at <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">seven o'clock</st1:time>
in the evening he saw a twelve-year-old girl on the bank of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>
near <st1:place><st1:placetype>Fort</st1:placetype> <st1:placename>McKinley</st1:placename></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As he
was sexually aroused (<span class="SpellE"><u>nalibugan</u></span>), he raped the
girl who lost consciousness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused
placed her in an army duffel bag which he left on the river bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, that same night, a carpenter working
at the construction of <st1:place><st1:placename>Del Pan</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Bridge</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
saw the duffel bag floating near the bridge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He opened the bag, on which was printed the name of the accused, a
Korean <span class="GramE">war</span> veteran, and found the body of the rape
victim who was already dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused
was held to have committed the separate crimes of rape and murder but since
there was no complaint for rape, he was convicted of murder only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Same holding in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Dahino</span>, L-2067, </span><st1:date year="1951" day="26" month="2"><span class="GramE">February 26, 1951</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 88 Phil. 789.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing cases might have prompted the lawmaking body to
enact Republic Acts Nos. 2632 and 4111, which define the special complex crime
of rape with homicide, a capital offense.</p>

he boxed my face</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Witness pointed

neck from behind and submerged me in the creek several times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He boxed me several times and even sat on my
chest for which I lost consciousness and I did not know what he did to me</u>."</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rosa Lozano, the aunt,
likewise testified that the deceased explicitly named appellant as the one who
raped and maltreated her.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is immediately striking in the foregoing testimonies is that
the direct quotations purportedly from the deceased do not refer at all to the
alleged rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>References thereto are all
in the form of conclusions, such as, “She said that he (Victor) dishonored her”;
“She repeatedly reported what Victor Garcia did to her, that she was raped by
him,” “she answered me that she was abused by Victor – in <span class="SpellE">Ilocano</span>,
<span class="SpellE"><u>niramas</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">nac</span> <span class="SpellE">ni</span> Victor Garcia</u>,” “I did not like what happened to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do not blame me.”<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, no particulars whatsoever of
the rape, if rape it was, were testified to have been related by the
deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is worse, the direct <span class="GramE">quotation from the deceased go</span> no further than the
following.</p>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>She
told me this, sir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I was in the
creek about to put on my dress, my brother-in-law came from behind but I did
not notice him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He placed his hand on my
neck from behind and submerged me in the creek several times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He boxed me several times and even sat on my
chest for which I lost consciousness and I did not know what he did to me</u>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This version which makes no mention at all of rape was repeated
practically word for word or verbatim by all the witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But from said version, one would be at a loss
as to when the supposed sexual act took place, whether before or after the
deceased was maltreated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This particular
point is not clear, considering that from what the deceased herself is alleged
to have said, the impression is given that she was naked and about to put on or
was putting on her dress when the appellant first took hold of her, not for the
purpose of having intercourse with her but only to box and maltreat her,
submerge her in the creek, stuff her mouth with a piece of cloth and sit on and
thump her chest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In brief, I do not find
in the record sufficient direct evidence of rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, I am morally convinced that the circumstantial evidence
amply proves that appellant had sexually assaulted the deceased on the same
occasion testified by the witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
he used force on her in committing the act is to me clear enough from the
findings of Dr. Gabriel quoted in the main opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her swollen face, her lower lip cut and
bleeding, the <span class="SpellE">hematoma</span> all over her body, her broken
ribs, her right nipple removed and bleeding, and her abdomen filled with water
constitute mute but irrefutable proof of such violence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the fact that the <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">nine o'clock</st1:time> laceration of her hymen was still
fresh at the time the medical examination the day after, and there were streaks
of blood found in her vaginal wall prove that someone had sexual intercourse
with her.</p>

<p class="BODY">Viewing the complaint or charge of the deceased variously
testified to by the witnesses, that she had been "abused",
"raped", "dishonored" and "<span class="SpellE">niramas</span>
<span class="SpellE">nac</span> <span class="SpellE">ni</span> Victor", to be
of less evidentiary value, the same being in the nature of conclusions, there
is one particular statement made by her which to my mind is of vital
importance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to her mother, <span class="SpellE">Ignacia</span> <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>, when she asked
Imelda "what happened to you my daughter -- she answered, 'I did not like
what <span class="GramE">happened</span> to me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Do not blame me.'" In other words, as I understand such testimony,
the deceased was actually saying the laceration of her hymen was against her
will; and neither her mother nor her sister, the wife of Victor, should hold it
against her, from which it follows that it could not have happened if no
violence had been used on her.</p>

<p class="BODY">If this be inference or deduction, it is certainly inexorable and
inevitable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And considered against the
background of the other relevant circumstances proven in the record, one cannot
entertain any reasonable doubt as to its correctness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, in the physical and emotional state
in which Imelda was at the time the witnesses talked to her, just after the
assault upon her had happened and hardly three hours before she died, she could
not have been expected to be fully explicit in her narration of what was done
to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such a situation, the duty of
the judge is to apply the standards of human experience and common sense in
deciphering what might appear as a telegraphic message of the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">gestae</span></u> itself,
considering the startling nature of the occurrence.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the foregoing observations which have served to dispel my
misgivings regarding the seeming insufficiency of the evidence of rape in the
record, I join in the judgment finding appellant Victor Garcia guilty as
charged in the information and imposing upon him the extreme penalty of death.</p>
