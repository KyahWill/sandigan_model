will and testament of Christian Harris.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1954" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1954</st1:date>,
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Butiong</span> commenced Special Proceedings No. 737
of said Court for the probate of a document -attached to his petition, and
later marked as Exhibit G - purporting to have been executed by Christian
Harris as his last will and testament.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Paragraph IV of said Exhibit G reads:</p>

<blockquote>“I hereby make, appoint and constitute Pedro <span class="SpellE">Butiong</span>,
who is my adopted son and whom I have reared and brought up since he was still
about two (2) yeas old, as my sole and universal heir of all my properties
located in the Philippines, consisting of shares of stock and interest in the
Mindanao Mo­ther Lode Mining Co., Inc., located at <span class="SpellE">Mabuhay</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>, and of
shares of stock, interest and one (1%) per cent royalty in the <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> Consoli­dated Mining Co located at <span class="SpellE">Siano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>.” </blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> Consolidated Mining Go.,
Inc. opposed the probate of said Exhibit G upon the ground of forgery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After ap­propriate proceedings, the lower
court issued an order, dated <st1:date year="1957" day="15" month="6">June 15,
 1957</st1:date>, admitting the disputed document to probate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this appeal by said Company
hereinafter referred to as appellant - upon the ground that the lower court
erred:</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">In allowing Exhibit G to probate,
instead of declaring that the alleged signature of Harris thereon is a
"forgery.”</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Butiong</span> maintains
that the lower court erred in entertaining appellant's opposition and in not
dismissing its appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is obvious that <span class="SpellE">Butiong's</span> contention
is well taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it is
well-settled that one who has or can have no interest in succeed <span class="SpellE">ing</span> a decedent cannot oppose the probate of his alleged
will.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant herein does not claim to have such interest in the succession to
Christian Harris.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the lower
court should not have con­sidered its opposition to the probate of Exhibit G,
much less given due course to the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Independently of the foregoing, appellant's assignment of errors
are devoid of merit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the notice
of hearing issued by the Justice of the Peace of the provincial capital,
"for and in the absence of the District Judge, " states that the
"<span class="SpellE">Semana</span>," in which said notice was ordered
and was in fact published, is of general cir­culation in the Province of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>, and there is no evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, the question whether or not <span class="SpellE">Butiong</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Sykimte</span> are related to the deceased, and whether
the latter really owns the property and interests sought to be disposed of in
Exhibit G,<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> are immaterial to the
probate thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the testi­mony
of <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Sykimte</span>, who
used to act as the secretary of Harris, during his lifetime, and that of appellant's
general superintendent of operations, J. B. Harrison, have established the fact
that Harris had in, his name four (4) mining claims, two (2) of which were
operated by the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact;
appellant's Articles of Incorporation show, also, that Harris was one of its
incorporators, with a subscription of 900, 000 shares of stock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition thereto, he had 75, 000 shares of
stock in the Mindanao Mother Lode Mining Co., <span style="">Inc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that, testifying as appellant's witness, Martin S.
Ramos, an alleged handwriting expert, expressed the opinion that the supposed
signature of Harris on Exhibit G is forged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This ne­gative evidence was more than offset, however, by the testimony
of Vicente C. Fernandez, Bernardino O. <span class="SpellE">Almeda</span> and
Mateo Peña fiel, to the effect that, after reading Exhibit G aloud and
announcing that it was the true expression of his will, Harris who was of sound
mind and spoke, as well as understood, both English and Spanish signed thereon
in their presence, and they, in turn, signed on said instrument, in the
presence of each other and that of Harris, in ac­cordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, their testimony on the genuineness
of the signature of Harris on Exhibit 0 was corroborated by the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Butiong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sykimte</span>, as well as
by handwriting expert, Dr. Paul R. <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span>, aside,
from having been confirmed by his Honor the trial Judge, who compared said
signature with the admittedly genuine signatures of Harris, used as standards
in the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is thus apparent
that <span class="SpellE">Butiong's</span> evidence is much weightier than that
of appellant herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the delay in the filing of Exhibit G for probate, <span class="SpellE">Butiong</span> explained it as follows; Harris died in <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>, on <st1:date year="1941" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1941</st1:date> or on the eve of the
outbreak of war in the Pacific. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Inasmuch
as, soon thereafter, the Japanese forces occupied the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Surigao</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Butiong</span> evacuated from <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Suri­gao</span>, and transferred Exhibit G, from a wooden
trunk he had in his house, to a valise belonging to his uncle, Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Butiong</span>, with whom he lived, in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Alegria</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Mainit</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After liberation, neither he (Pedro <span class="SpellE">Butiong</span>) nor Bernardino could, however, find Exhibit G,
until <st1:date year="1954" day="20" month="8">August 20, 1954</st1:date>, when
Bernardino located it accidentally while looking for other papers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon Exhibit G was filed in court for
probate.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records before us do not furnish sufficient data to war­rant
denying credence to the testimony of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Butiong</span>
and Bernar­dino <span class="SpellE">Butiong</span>, to this effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, since the authenticity of the
signature of Harris in Exhibit 0 and the due execution thereof, as his last
will and testament, have been satisfactorily established, the explanation for
the delay in its presentation for probate has be­come of minimal importance.</p>
