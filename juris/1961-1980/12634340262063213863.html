<p class="BODY">In arriving at the judgment of conviction, respondent Judge gave
full credence to the positive identification of the accused <span class="SpellE">Calanza</span>
by Elizabeth <span class="SpellE">Soliven</span>, the deceased's companion, and
former paramour of <span class="SpellE">Calanza</span>, and by another

not present as a witness Ofelia <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>, who was

<p class="BODY">Briefly, <st1:city><st1:place>Elizabeth</st1:place></st1:city>'s
testimony was to the effect that when they were leaving the theatre, <span class="SpellE">Calanza</span> accosted them at the aisle, held <st1:city><st1:place>Elizabeth</st1:place></st1:city>'s
hand, and when the deceased inquired for the reason, <span class="SpellE">Calanza</span>
struck him with a revolver and ultimately shot him (deceased) as the latter was
trying to stand, hitting him near the ear.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Affidavit of Ofelia <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>, sought

Office at <st1:place><st1:city>Iloilo City</st1:city>, <st1:country-region>Philippines</st1:country-region></st1:place>,

to be a businessman for more than ten (10) years before <st1:date year="1970" day="17" month="4">April 17, 1970</st1:date> because we often met in the law
office when he has some legal consultations and notarization to be done, thus I
know him very well;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That prior to the year 1970, Elizabeth <span class="SpellE">Soliven</span>
worked as clerk in the same law office where I was working;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That on <st1:date year="1970" day="17" month="4">April 17,

<blockquote>"That we were watching the movie at the balcony when a certain

and sat on my extreme right seat next to Elizabeth <span class="SpellE">Soliven</span>

open and execute this affidavit because my conscience cannot keep me at peace
that a man who was not the assailant of <span class="SpellE">Ponciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Sonalan</span> will go to jail for a crime he did not commit
because of my failure to testify.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The errors of law or irregularities claimed by <span class="SpellE">Calanza</span> to have been committed by the trial Court refer to
its having given credence to the testimony of Elizabeth <span class="SpellE">Soliven</span>,
an allegedly scorned paramour of <span class="SpellE">Calanza</span>, and to the so-called
fabricated testimony of David <span class="SpellE">Sustento</span>, specially
considering that respondent Judge did not himself hear the evidence and was
unable to observe their demeanor on the stand.</p>

<p class="BODY">Required by the appellate Court to file a Comment on the Motion
for New Trial, the Solicitor General averred that the Affidavit of Ofelia <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> aims merely to impeach the testimonies of Elizabeth <span class="SpellE">Soliven</span> and David <span class="SpellE">Sustento</span>, and
the settled rule is that "evidence which merely seeks to impeach the
evidence upon which conviction was based would not constitute a ground for new
trial;"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
that even if the testimony of Ofelia <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> were to
be introduced or admitted, the same would not probably alter the decision as it
comes from a person "whose credibility is subject to suspicion having
maintained her silence for an incredibly long period of six (6) years; that if
threats on her life were really made, it is surprising that Ofelia did not
report them to the authorities; and finally, the record does not show that
diligent efforts were exerted to produce said witness or even to secure her
appearance by compulsory process.</p>

<p class="BODY">In private respondent's Reply to Comment he maintains that
Ofelia's Affidavit is not merely to impeach but is of independent probative
value showing as it does a state of facts different from that presented by
prosecution witnesses, Elizabeth <span class="SpellE">Soliven</span> and David <span class="SpellE">Sustento</span>, and which would probably alter the judgment
appealed from; that despite diligent search, Ofelia <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>
could not be traced as she went into hiding for fear of her life and that of
her family; that "in the highest interest of justice" she must be
heard, and the question of her credibility left to the discretion of the trial
Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1976</st1:date>,
respondent appellate Court prom­ulgated a Resolution quoted hereunder:</p>

<blockquote>"Before <span class="GramE">Us</span> is a motion for new trial
on the ground of newly discovered evidence to which the Solicitor General filed
an opposition stating that the proposed tes­timony of Ofelia <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> is not newly discovered evidence and that it merely tend
to impeach or discredit prosecution witnesses.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Considering that the motion can only be properly and
adequately determined after all the transcripts of the proceedings are on hand
and the briefs duly filed, let the resolution thereof be held in abeyance and
the motion be referred to the division to which the case may ultimately be
raffled for decision."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> Resolution, <span class="SpellE">Calanza</span> filed a Motion for Reconsideration contending that
there is no necessity for submission of Briefs to resolve the Motion for New
Trial based on new evidence of independent probative value and showing facts
different from what prosecution witnesses presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent also sought a liberal
interpretation of the legal provisions on new trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting thereon, on <st1:date year="1976" day="19" month="11">November
 19, 1976</st1:date>, respondent Court of Appeals set aside its previous
Resolution and allowed new trial in this wise:</p>

<blockquote>"It is not denied and in fact it was submitted by the
prosecution, more particularly Elizabeth <span class="SpellE">Soliven</span>,
"the star witness" for the prosecution that on April 17, 1970 at 5:30
p.m., she was with Ofelia <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> inside the Cinema
Theatre at <span class="SpellE">Plazoleta</span> Gay, Iloilo City, watching the
movie "John and Mary" when the shooting incident happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is apparent therefore, that Elizabeth <span class="SpellE">Soliven</span> and Ofelia <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> are the
possible witnesses to the shooting incident in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, it appears, as sufficiently
established by appellant that Ofelia <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> could not
be located to testify during the trial des­pite reasonable diligence to that
effect because she went into hiding due to threats on her life and that of her
family from an unidentified person. </blockquote>

<blockquote>"While it is true that the new trial will not be granted upon
ground of newly discovered evidence when it appears that such new evidence can
have no other effect than to contradict the testimony of a witness at the
original trial, we believe however, that the materiality of the evidence sought
to be presented for the defense may probably give the appellant a chance to
gain an acquittal, and if he is not given that chance to adduce the same in
court, his conviction stands.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A case in point is CA-<span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. No.
17088-CR, People vs. <span class="SpellE">Morando</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without waiting for the records of the case
to be forwarded to the Court of Appeals, this Court <span class="SpellE">outrightly</span>
resolved to remand the case for new trial in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1976" day="16" month="4">16 April 1976</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thus, in the interest of justice, our Resolution of <st1:date year="1976" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1976</st1:date> is SET ASIDE and
appellant's motion for New Trial is hereby granted."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Copies of the Resolution were served on counsel for private
respondent on <st1:date year="1976" day="22" month="11">November 22, 1976</st1:date>
and on the Solicitor General on <st1:date year="1976" day="23" month="11">November

The latter two-mentioned came to know of the aforesaid Resolution only when
they received copies of the Entry of Judgment thereof on January 3 and 4, 1977,
respectively, accompanied by copy of a letter of transmit­tal of the records
from the Court of Appeals to the Court below.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1976" day="9" month="12">December 9, 1976</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> Resolution became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Private respondent then filed before the trial Court an Urgent Motion to Set
the Case for Hearing originally on <st1:date year="1977" day="18" month="1">January
 18, 1977</st1:date>, and subsequently advanced to January 12 and 13, 1977.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower Court, presided by respondent Judge, and over the
objection of private petitioner, conducted hearings on the said dates wherein
Ofelia <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> testified and was cross-examined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The continuation of new trial was set for <st1:date year="1977" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1977</st1:date> for the presentation
of rebuttal evidence but was cancelled due to the Re­straining Order issued by
this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, on January 11, 1977, private petitioner, Atty.
Nicolas P. <span class="SpellE">Sonalan</span>, filed with this Court this
special civil action for <i>Certiorari</i> with Preliminary Injunction with a
request for permission to file the same without prior conformity of the
Solicitor General or of the City Fiscal of Iloilo on the ground that said
officials respectively believed that the other should file the same<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
and there was not much material time left for him to secure said
conformity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On January 18, 1977, the
City Fiscal of Iloilo also filed a separate Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> with
Prelimi­nary Injunction after then Chief State Prosecutor Rodolfo A. <span class="SpellE">Nocon</span> (now a Court of Appeals Associate Justice) called
attention "to the view expressed by Solicitor <span class="SpellE">Farolan</span>
that the conformity of the Solicitor General's Office is not proper owing to
the fact that the case has been remanded for new trial to the Iloilo CFI in
view of which, he believes that the proper party to file the petition for <i>certiorari</i>
should be the City Fiscal of Iloilo City who represented the state in the trial
court."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1977</st1:date>,
this Court resolved to consolidate the two Petitions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same Resolution and without giving due
course thereto, we required the Solicitor General and the private respondent to
submit their Comment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We likewise
ordered the issuance of a Restraining Order enjoining respondent Judge from

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1977</st1:date>,

<p class="BODY">The principal issue to resolve is whether or not respondent
appellate Court acted with grave abuse of discretion in granting the Motion for
New Trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence based on Ofelia <span class="SpellE">Ticzon's</span> Affidavit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Prescinding</span> from this substantive issue
to consider the purely procedural aspect, we are constrained to find that the
herein Petitions for <i>Certiorari</i> were <span class="GramE">filed</span> out
of time.</p>

<p class="BODY">There should be no question that in a criminal case, when a
Decision or Resolution of the Court of Appeals becomes <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>
to this Court by the People, it is the Solicitor General who represents the
State.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
And where the period of appeal has expired, neither a private prosecutor (on
the assumption that he has the authority) nor a City Fiscal can file a petition
for review on <i>certiorari</i> since the Office of the Solicitor General itself
could not have done so.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the Resolution of the Court of Appeals
granting new trial was served on the Solicitor General on <st1:date year="1976" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1976</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>

No action having been seasonably taken to seek reconsideration, nor review by a
higher Court, before the finality of said Resolution, it has to be held that
appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> has been foreclosed and the present
Petitions for <span class="GramE"><i>Certiorari</i>,</span> may not be utilized
to obtain re­view of that Resolution after the time of appeal has elapsed.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The remedy of <i>Certiorari</i> cannot be used as a substitute for appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent appellate Court, having acted within its jurisdiction when it issued
the Resolution in question, the same cannot be corrected by <i>Certiorari</i> but
is more properly the subject of appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It will also have to be noted that when the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>
was filed by the private prosecutor on January 11, 1977 and by the City Fiscal on
January 18, 1977, new trial had already commenced on January 12 and 13, 1977 in
the Court of First Instance of Iloilo and at the time our Restraining Order was
issued only the prosecution had to present rebuttal evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can it be successfully argued that an Order granting or
denying new trial is an interlocutory order and cannot be the subject of appeal
or of a special civil action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
enunciated in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Bocar</span>, et al.,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
that rule does not apply in a criminal case because in deciding the case anew
the trial Court may acquit the defendant and thereafter "the prosecution
would have no more opportunity of bringing before the appellate Court the
question of the legality or illegality of the order granting a new trial
because the defendant acquitted may plead double jeopardy."</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering all the foregoing facts, dismissal is called
for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ends of justice will not be
subverted by the re-opening for if the newly discovered evidence consisting of
the testimony of Ofelia <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> is, as contended by
the Solicitor General, merely impeaching and not persuasive enough to secure a
reversal of the judgment, the accused will still stand convicted and his appeal
will take its course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But if the trial
Court should find that the testimony of this witness is sufficient to overthrow
the evidence submitted during the trial, then the accused would be entitled to
