<p class="BODY">Three sets of plaintiffs filed the complaint on December 1, 1959,
namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the <span class="SpellE">Bicomongs</span>,
children of <span class="SpellE">Perpetua</span> <span class="SpellE">Bagsic</span>;
(b) the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span>, children of <span class="SpellE">Igmedia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bagsic</span>; and (c) Francisca <span class="SpellE">Bagsic</span>,
daughter of Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Bagsic</span>, in the Court of First
Instance of Laguna and San Pablo City against the defendants Geronimo <span class="SpellE">Almanza</span> and <span class="SpellE">Engracio</span> <span class="SpellE">Manese</span> for the recovery of their lawful shares in the
properties left by Maura <span class="SpellE">Bagsic</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the death of Maura <span class="SpellE">Bagsic</span>, the
above-described properties passed on to <span class="SpellE">Cristeta</span> <span class="SpellE">Almanza</span> who took charge of the administration of the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There­upon, the plaintiffs
approached her and requested for the partition of their aunt's properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, they were prevailed upon by <span class="SpellE">Cristeta</span> <span class="SpellE">Almanza</span> not to divide the
properties yet as the expenses for the last illness and burial of Maura <span class="SpellE">Bagsic</span> had not yet been paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having agreed to defer the partition of the
same, the plaintiffs brought out the subject again sometime in 1959 only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time <span class="SpellE">Cristeta</span> <span class="SpellE">Almanza</span> acceded to the request as the debts, accordingly,
had already been paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately,
she died without the division of the properties having been effected, thereby
leaving the possession and administration of the same to the defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the court rendered judgment, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the
plaintiffs who are hereby declared to be entitled to <st1:time minute="24" hour="10">ten twenty-fourth</st1:time> (10/24) share on the five parcels of

July 23, 1959 the sum of P625.00 per annum until the ten-twenty fourth (10/24)

<p class="BODY">From the aforesaid decision of the trial court, <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartena</span>, the

to the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other
defendant, <span class="SpellE">Engracio</span> <span class="SpellE">Manese</span>,
did not appeal and execution was issued with respect to the parcels of land in
his possession, that is, those described under Letters D and E in the
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the subject matter of
the case on appeal was limited to the one-half undivided portion of only three
of the five parcels of land des­cribed under letters A, B and C in the
complaint which defendant <span class="SpellE">Cartena</span> admitted to be only
in his posses­sion.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, defendant-appellant <span class="SpellE">Cartena</span>
contends that the provisions of Arts. 995, 1006 and 1008 of the New Civil Code,
applied by the trial court in allowing plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
to succeed to the properties left by Maura <span class="SpellE">Bagsic</span>
were not the applicable provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
asserts that in the course of the trial of the case in the lower court,
plaintiffs requested defendants to admit that <span class="SpellE">Felipa</span> <span class="SpellE">Bagsic</span>, the sole sister of full blood of Maura <span class="SpellE">Bagsic</span>, died on <st1:date year="1955" day="9" month="5">May
 9, 1955</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since Maura <span class="SpellE">Bagsic</span> died on <st1:date year="1952" day="14" month="4">April
 14, 1952</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Felipa</span> succeeded to Maura's
estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support thereof, he cites
Art. 1004 of the New Civil Code which provides that "should the only
survivors be brothers and sisters of the full blood, they shall inherit in
equal shares," and he concludes with the rule that the relatives nearest
in degree excludes the more distant ones.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Art. 962, New Civil Code)</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
claim that the date of death of <span class="SpellE">Felipa</span> <span class="SpellE">Bagsic</span> was not raised as an issue in the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was even the subject of stipulation of the
parties as clearly shown in the transcript of the stenographic notes that <span class="SpellE">Felipa</span> <span class="SpellE">Bagsic</span> died on <st1:date year="1945" day="9" month="5">May 9, 1945</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals ruled that the facts of the case have been
duly established in the trial court and that the only issue left for
determination is a purely legal question involving the correct application of
the law and jurisprudence on the matter, hence the appellate court certified
this case to Us.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the provisions of Art. 975, 1006 and 1008 of the New
Civil Code are applicable to the admitted facts of the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These Articles provide:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 975.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
children of one or more brothers or sisters of the deceased survive, they shall
inherit from the latter by representation, if they survive with their uncles or
aunts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But if they alone survive, they
shall inherit in equal portions."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Art. 1006.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should
brothers and sisters of the full blood survive together with brothers and
sisters of the half blood, the former shall be entitled to a share double that
of the latter."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Art. 1008.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Children of
brothers and sisters of the half blood shall succeed per capita or per stripes,
in accordance with the rules laid down for brothers and sisters of the full
blood."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the absence of descendants, ascendants, illegitimate children,
or a surviving spouse, Article 1003 of the New Civil Code provides that
collateral relatives shall succeed to the entire estate of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appearing that Maura <span class="SpellE">Bagsic</span>
died intestate without an issue, and her husband and all her ascendants had
died ahead of her, she is succeeded by the surviving colla­teral relatives,
namely the daughter of her sister of full blood and the ten (10) children of
her brother and two (2) sisters of half blood, in accordance with the provision
of Art. 975 of the New Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">By virtue of said provision, the aforementioned nephews and
nieces are entitled to inherit in their own right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Abellana-Bacayo</u></span><u>
vs. Ferraris-<span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>, L-19382, </u><st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="8"><u>August 31, 1965</u></st1:date><u>, 14 SCRA
986</u>, this Court held that "nephews and nieces alone do not inherit by
right of representation (that is per <span class="SpellE">stirpes</span>) unless
concurring with brothers or sisters of the deceased."</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the same provision, Art. 975, which makes no qualification
as to whether the nephews or nieces are on the maternal or paternal line and
without preference as to whether their relationship to the deceased is by whole
or half blood, the sole niece of whole blood of the deceased does not exclude
the ten nephews and nieces of half blood.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The only difference in their right of succession is provided in Art.
1008, N.C.C., in relation to Article 1006 of the New Civil Code (supra), which
provisions, in effect, entitle the sole niece of full blood to a share double
that of the nephews and nieces of half blood.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such distinction between whole and half blood relationships with the
deceased has been recognized in <span class="SpellE"><u>Dionisia</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">Padura</span>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Melania</span> <span class="SpellE">Baldovino</span>, et al., No. L-11960, </u><st1:date year="1958" day="27" month="12"><u>December 27, 1958</u></st1:date><u>, 104 Phil. 1065</u>
(unrepor­ted) and in <span class="SpellE"><u>Alviar</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span>, No. L-22402, </u><st1:date year="1969" day="30" month="6"><u>June 30, 1969</u></st1:date><u>, 28 SCRA 610</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of the appellant that Maura <span class="SpellE">Bagsic</span>
should be succeeded by <span class="SpellE">Felipa</span> <span class="SpellE">Bagsic</span>,
her sister of full blood, to the exclusion of the nephews and nieces of half
blood citing Art. 1004, N.C.C., is unmeritorious and erroneous for it is based
on an erroneous factual assumption, that is, that <span class="SpellE">Felipa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bagsic</span> died in 1955, which as indicated here before,
is not true as she died on May 9, 1945, thus she predeceased her sister Maura <span class="SpellE">Bagsic</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the judgment of the trial court to be in consonance with
law and jurisprudence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment of the trial court is hereby
affirmed.</p>
