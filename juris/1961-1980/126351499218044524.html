P. del Rosario and <span class="SpellE">Amado</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>from a decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, dismissing their petition for certiorari,

of Republic Act 2260", by the <span style="">Provincial Treasurer, said appointment was forwarded
to </span>the Commissioner, who, however, returned it, without his approval, to
the Provincial Treasurer, for <span style="">lack of certain </span>papers required <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1963</st1:date>,
Mayor <span class="SpellE">Ilano</span> extended, in favor of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Hidpion</span> <span style="">P. </span>del <span style="">Rosario, a </span>"permanent" appointment as Chief of Police of
<span class="SpellE">Imus</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
effective on <st1:date year="1963" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Attested pursuant to section 24(b) of
Republic Act No. 2260," by the Provin­cial Treasurer, it was <span style="">subsequently
"approved </span>under section 24(c) of Republic Act No. 2260", by
the Commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both Del Rosario and <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Sañez</span></span><span style="">, who </span>had
merely the civil service eligibility for "patrol­man", assumed office
on the dates of their respective appointments.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On
January 9, 1964, <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Camerino</span>,
as new Mayor </span>of <span class="SpellE">Imus</span>, notified Del Rosario, in
writing, that his "services and provisional appointment <span style="">as Chief of
Police" were </span>thereby "terminat­ed", effective "at
the close of office hours" of said date, upon the ground of "lack of
appropriate civil <span style="">service eligibility </span>as Chief of Police", and "lack of
confidence", at the same time "offering" him the position of <span style="">"patrolman",
</span>for <span style="">which
he was eligible, </span>with the warning that he would be deemed to have turned
down the offer,, un­less he otherwise advised the writer before the close of
office hours <span style="">on
January 10, 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon later, Del
Rosario received a letter of </span>Mayor <span class="SpellE">Camerino</span>,
dated <span style="">January
14, </span><span style="">1960, </span>inviting
attention to a first <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> of the Commissioner,
of January 13, 1960, stating that Del Rosario's appointment as <span style="">Chief of Police </span>had
been "approved under <u><span style="">provisional</span></u><span style=""> status </span>pursuant to section 24(c) of Republic Act 2260, his <span style="">eligibility </span><u>not
being appropriate</u> for the position involved"; that "the records <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>fail to show"
that he had taken "the Chief of <span style="">Police (Municipalities) examination"; and that
"in view thereof, the </span>termination" of his services "as
Chief of Police is deemed in order." A similar notice of termination of
services and offer of appointment as <span style="">"patrolman" were served upon and made to <span class="SpellE">Sañez</span>, on </span>January 14, 1964, except that the only
ground stated for said termination of hi, <span style="">"services </span><span style="">and provisional appointment" was his "lack of <span class="SpellE">appror</span> <span class="SpellE">i<span style="">ate</span></span></span> civil <span style="">service eligibility
as Police Lieutenant", and that his </span>deadline for acceptance of the
offer was January 15, 1964.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Despite
these notices, Del Rosario and <span class="SpellE">Sañez</span> </span>refused
to rel<span style="">inquish
their respective positions as Chief of Police and Police </span>Lieut­enant <span style="">of <span class="SpellE">Imus</span>; </span>but payment of <span style="">their-salaries as </span>such was withheld
since January 7 and 16, <span style="">19</span>6<span style="">4, </span>respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, on January 20, they commenced the
present action, in the Court of First instance of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>, against the Commissioner,
the Provincial Treasurer, Mayor <span class="SpellE">Camerino</span>, and the
Municipal Treasurer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the filing of
a Pl, 00U bond, said<span style=""> </span>court
issued, on the same date, a writ of pre­liminary injunction restraining the
Commissioner and Mayor <span class="SpellE">Came<span style="">r</span>ino</span> "from enforcing their orders for the
termination" of petitioners' services.</p>

<p class="BODY">Soon thereafter, or on January 24, 1964, the Civil Service
Commission certified that "there are Chief of Police <span class="SpellE">eligibles</span>
who are residents of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> available from the
register established from the Chief of Police (Municipalities) examination held
in Manila on November 23, 1963," Then, or on February 16, 1964, Mayor <span class="SpellE">Came­rino</span> extended a "permanent" appointment, in
favor of one <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Candalla</span>
- a member of the police force of Manila, who had passed "the Chief of
Police (Municipalities) entrance examination held on November 23, 1963, with a
rating of 79.9" - as Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Imus</span>,
"to take effect upon approval by the Commissioner of Civil Service."</p>

<p class="BODY">After appropriate proceedings, the lower court rendered judgment
holding that, being, at best "provisional" in nature, peti­tioners'
appointments were subject to termination at any time and, consequently,
dismissed the petition, with costs against the petitioners, as well as
dissolved the writ of preliminary injunction issued on Jan­uary 20, 1964, and
ordered the payment of petitioners' respective salaries, up to and including
the date of notice of said decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
motion for reconsideration thereof having been denied, petitioners appealed
directly to the Supreme Court "on pure questions of law."</p>

<p class="BODY">They now alleged <span style="">that </span>the
lower court erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1) in not hold­ing
that their appointments are permanent; 2) in holding that provisional
appointees may, like temporary appointees, be summarily removed from office,
even without cause; and 3) <span style="">in </span>"not ordering the payment of the salaries of
petitioners-appellants."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that Mayor <span class="SpellE">Ilano</span> had
extended "permanent" appoint­ments to petitioners herein; that Del
Rosario’s<span style=""> </span>appointment was at­tested,
also, as permanent by the provincial treasurer; and that the latter, likewise,
attested the appointment of <span class="SpellE">Sañez</span>, without specify­ing
the nature of the attestation they; given - whether "permanent",
"provisional", or "temporary".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is no less true, however, that, in this
connection, the Provincial Treasurer had acted as "deputy" of the Commissioner
of Civil Service, "for the purpose of attesting, <u><span style="">in accordance </span>with Civil Service Law
and rules</u>, appointments made <span style="">by </span>provincial
governors and municipal mayors; " that, consequently, said appointments,
as thus attested, which shall be "forwarded within ten days to the
Commissioner of Civil Service, <u>for review</u> pursuant to Civil Service Law
and rules, " are subject to "correction or re­vision, " by the
Commissioner of Civil Service within "one hundred eighty days after
receipt" thereof;<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> that in
the exercise of this au­thority, the Commissioner had corrected or revised the
action of the provincial treasurer and attested Del Rosario's
"permanent" appointment as a "provisional" one, for he had
not qualified in an examination "appropriate" for Chiefs of Police,
but otherwise met "the requirements for appointment to a regular position
in the com­petitive service, " for he possessed the civil service
eligibility for "patrolman"; and that the appointment of <span class="SpellE">Sañez</span> was, <u>not</u> only not attested by the Commissioner,
but <u>returned</u>, for non-compliance with certain requirements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, also worthy of notice that peti­tioners
have not appealed from the action thus taken by the Commis­sioner,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> so that the correctness thereof cannot now be
assailed by them; that Del Rosario cannot deny the provisional" nature of
his appointment, which is in line with the letter and spirit of section 24(c)
of Republic Act 22603;<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a> and that,
for the <span style="">same reason, <span class="SpellE">Sañez</span> cannot claim </span>a better status than that of a
provisional appointee.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is argued that pursuant to section 2Z66 of the Revised
Administrative Code,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a> only <u>one</u>
examination for admission to the police service shall be held and that Del
Rosario's civil service eligibility as "patrolman" is, therefore,
sufficient to qualify him for a permanent appointment <span style="">as </span>chief of police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
provision does not prohibit, however, the holding of different examinations for
dif­ferent ranks in the police force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
merely requires that there be, at <u>least</u>, one <span style="">qualifying examination </span>for said force.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the provisions of the Administrative Code con­cerning
police forces, including said section 2266, should now be interpreted in
harmony with, if not considered amended or repealed by the Civil Service Act of
1959,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> the provisions of which "embrace all branches,
subdivisions and instrumentalities of the Government",<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a>
including, accordingly, local governments.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said Act classifies of­ficers and employees of the Government into three
(3) categories, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">1) </span>those "exempt" from the
provisions of <span style="">said
</span>Act; 2) those in the "competitive or classified service"; and
3) those in the "non?competitive or unclassified service".</p>

<p class="BODY">The competitive or classified service is said to "include <span style="">positions for
appointment to which prior qualification in </span>an <u>appropriate</u> examination
is required."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a> Under his authority, <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, "to enforce, execute, and carry out
the constitutional and statutory provisions on the merit system",
underlying the Civil Service Law; to "supervise the preparation and
rating" and "control all civil service examinations in the
Philippines", <span style="">as </span>well as,
"with the approval of the President, to prescribe, amend and enforce
suitable rules and regulations for carrying into effect the provisions" of
said Act; and to exercise "<u>exclusive</u> jurisdiction over the approval
under the Civil Service Law and rules of <u>all appointments</u> including
promotions to positions in the competitive service,"<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a> the
Commissioner has prescribed special examinations for chiefs of police of cities
and municipalities, distinct from that prescribed for, patrolmen thereof or
from that required for police lieutenants, and one who has passed the civil
service examination for "patrolman" is <u>not</u> eligible for <span style="">permanent
appointment as "police lieutenant", much less for </span>"chief
of police", for, <span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>qualification in
an<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>appropriate </u>examination shall
be required for appointment to positions in the competitive <span style="">or classified </span>service in accordance
with the civil service rules.”<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, <span style="">"<span class="SpellE">x.x</span> x </span>except as otherwise provided by law, eligi­bility
in a certain examination shall serve as qualification for appointment <u>only</u>
to the position or positions <u>for which the examination was held</u> and no
horizontal or vertical conversion of the eligibility or examination rating
shall be allowed x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>,
"<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> and "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> a perma­nent appointment shall be issued to a person who
has met <u>all</u> the re­quirements of the position to which he seeks
appointment in accor­dance with the provisions of this Act and the rules and
standards promulgated in pursuance thereto x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
x."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In short, the "permanent" appointments, made by Mayor <span class="SpellE">Ilano</span>, of Del Rosario, as Chief of Police, and, of <span class="SpellE">Sañez</span>; as "Police Lieutenant", could not be
attested to except, at best, as "provision­al" appointments.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners insist that, unlike "temporary" appointees,
"provisional" appointees may not be removed except for cause; but, it
is not necessary for us to pass upon this question, inasmuch as "a pro­visional
appointment shall, in no case extend beyond thirty (30) days from receipt by
the appointing officer of the certification of eligi­bles,"<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a> and such certification not merely of the
availability of <span class="SpellE">eligibles</span> for appointment as Chief of
Police, in general, but, also, of <span class="SpellE">eligibles</span> <u>residing
in <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></u>, in particular - was received by Mayor <span class="SpellE">Camerino</span> on June 24, 1964, thus confirming the first <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> of the Civil Service-Commission dated January
13, 1964, de­claring that the termination of Del Rosario's services as Chief of
Police is "in order".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact,
it is not disputed that <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Candalla</span>, whom Mayor <span class="SpellE">Camerino</span>
appointed as Chief of Police, on <st1:date year="1964" day="16" month="2">February
 16, 1964</st1:date>, had "qualified in the Chief of Police (Municipal­ities)
entrance examination held on <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="11">November
 23, 1963</st1:date> with a rating <span style="">of </span><span style="">79.9%".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, even if a provisional appointee were not removable except for
cause, petitioner Del Rosario would not be entitled to the writ prayed for,
because his right to hold office as chief of police expired on January 14,
1964, when he received the Commissioner's <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>
of January 13, 1964, or, at the latest, on February 24, 1964, the thirtieth day
after receipt by Mayor <span class="SpellE">Carnerino</span> of the above
mentioned certification of availability of <span class="SpellE">eligibles</span>
for appointment as Chief of Police.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards petitioner <span class="SpellE">Sañez</span>, his
appointment as Police Lieutenant had not been even attested by the
Commissioner, who returned it for non-compliance with applicable
requirements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, it is not
claimed that such act of the Commissioner is con­trary to law or that said
requirements had been complied with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is thus clear that <span class="SpellE">Sañez</span> has no cause of action
against respondents herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Being a mere consequence of the first two (2) assignments of
error, which have been disposed of, petitioners' third assignment of error
needs no further discussion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed,
with costs against petitioners, <span class="SpellE">Hidpion</span> P. del
