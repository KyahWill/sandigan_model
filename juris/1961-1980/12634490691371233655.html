				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt;">In <span class="GramE">an
information</span> filed with the Court of First Instance </span>of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, Felipe Cruz, Jr. and Vicente <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
y Perez were <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">charged with having violated
Section 174 of Commonwealth Act </span>446, otherwise known as the National
Internal Revenue Code, as amended, as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="letter-spacing: 0.35pt;">"That on or about the 28th
day of June, 1960, </span>in the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Hagonoy</span>,
Province of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, Philippines, and within the
jurisdiction of this <span style="letter-spacing: 0.3pt;">Honorable Court, the
said accused Felipe Cruz, Jr. </span>and Vicente <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
y Perez did then, and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and
feloniously have in their <span style="letter-spacing: 0.6pt;">possession
articles, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>39 cases and 38 car</span>toons
of Union Blue Seal cigarettes, which were subject to the payment of specific
taxes in the amount of no less than P10,444.00 and without the said taxes
thereon having been paid in accordance with law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accused Felipe Cruz, Jr., - after pleading not guilty - moved for
the reinvestigation of his case and, no opposition having been interposed by
the prosecution, the Court granted the same.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt;">On the other hand, after
entering a plea of not guilty, </span><span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, through
counsel, moved that he be allowed to withdraw <span style="letter-spacing: 0.9pt;">his
plea of not guilty and to substitute it with that of guilty </span>of the crime
charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion was granted and upon
being arraigned anew, <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> pleaded guilty and was
forthwith <span style="letter-spacing: 0.35pt;">sentenced to suffer imprisonment
of six (6) months and to pay </span>a fine of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>,
with subsidiary imprisonment in case of <span style="letter-spacing: 0.45pt;">insolvency
at the rate of one day for each P2.50 but not to </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.5pt;">exceed 1/3 of the term of the sentence, and to pay 1/2 of the </span>costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this decision <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
appealed claiming that the penalty of six months imprisonment and P5,000.00
fine with <span style="letter-spacing: 0.15pt;">subsidiary imprisonment in case of
insolvency imposed upon him </span>by the Court is excessive and not in
accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His <span style="letter-spacing: 1.1pt;">argument is that, having pleaded guilty, only a
fine of not </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">more than P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> should have been imposed upon him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This </span>contention is entirely without
merit because - even giving <span style="letter-spacing: 0.75pt;">appellant the
benefit of the mitigating circumstance of plea </span>of guilt - the penalty
imposed is still within the range of the penalty provided for by Section 174 of
the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Any person who is found in possession of <span style="letter-spacing: 0.85pt;">articles subject to specific tax, the tax on </span>which
has not been paid in accordance with law, or any person who is found in
possession of articles which are exempt from specific tax other than those to
whom the same is lawfully issued excepting persons in possession of an <span style="letter-spacing: 0.9pt;">article resulting from a single isolated tran</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.65pt;">saction done in good faith shall be punished by a
fine of not less than three times the </span>amount of the specific tax due on
the articles found but not less than two hundred pesos nor more than five
thousand pesos or by imprisonment of from four months and one day to four years
and two months, or both."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with </span>costs.</p>
