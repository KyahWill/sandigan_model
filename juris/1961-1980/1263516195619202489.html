				<BR><STRONG>SANCHEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this, a petition for certiorari and prohibition with prayer
for preliminary injunction, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Uso</span> Dan <span class="SpellE">Aguam</span> seeks to annul the resolution of the respondent
Commission on Elections (<span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>) of April 27, 1968
declaring that it has jurisdiction to open the ballot box in Precinct 8 of the
municipality of <span class="SpellE">Ganassi</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, and to conduct an investigation into the
authentic electoral return <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, upon petition
of respondent <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner levels a major attack on the
jurisdiction of <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> to inquire into the matters
set forth in private respondent's petition therein, hereinafter to be
recited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner reasons out that
that petition was filed out of time, and that after proclamation <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> is bereft of power to order the opening of the
ballot box to determine the genuineness of an election return.</p>

<p class="BODY">But first to the controlling facts.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the November, 1967 elections, amongst the aspirants for Mayor
of <span class="SpellE">Ganassi</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, were:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>petitioner <span class="SpellE">Uso</span> Dan <span class="SpellE">Aguam</span>,
official Liberal Party candidate; respondent <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span>, an independent Liberal; and Ali <span class="SpellE">Daud</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Marohombsar</span>, official
candidate of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalistas</span>. 2</p>

<p class="BODY">It would appear that at the canvassing held in <span class="SpellE">Marawi</span> City on November 20, 1967, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Uso</span> Dan <span class="SpellE">Aguam</span> was proclaimed
Mayor-elect of <span class="SpellE">Ganassi</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The minutes thereof reveal a close contest
between petitioner and respondent:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Uso</span> Dan <span class="SpellE">Aguam</span>
received 575 votes; respondent <span class="SpellE">Datu</span> <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span>, 572 votes.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 21, 1967, apparently unaware of the canvassing held
at <span class="SpellE">Marawi</span> City the day before, respondent <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span> went to the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
to restrain the board of canvassers from canvassing the votes for mayoral,
candidates and from proclaiming the results thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bases of the petition are that 43 voters were
permitted to cast their votes in Precinct 5 by virtue of an unlawful order of
the municipal judge and that the election returns in Precinct 8 were tampered
with to favor petitioner herein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner there intervened and, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
challenged the jurisdiction <span style="">of the
Court of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case ended
up with the court's order of December 21, 1967 dismissing the petition upon a
no-jurisdiction ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Allegedly, copy
of this order was served on respondent <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span> on January 4, 1968.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on December 30, 1967, petitioner took his oath and
thereafter assumed office as Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Ganassi</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was on January 6, 1968 when respondent <span class="SpellE">Alim</span>
<span class="SpellE">Balindong</span> went to <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
with a petition for the annulment of the November 20, 1967 canvass and
proclamation, and for the opening of the ballot box in Precinct 8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The November 20 canvass and proclamation were
there assailed by respondent <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span>
from different directions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Averment was
there made that the board of canvassers was illegally constituted; that fraud
and irregularities, which were made in con­nivance between the municipal
treasurer and petitioner <span class="SpellE">Uso</span> Dan <span class="SpellE">Aguam</span>,
attended the canvassing; that no notice thereof was given to said re­spondent
and other candidates; that the canvassing and proclamation were kept under
wraps; that the election return for Precinct 8 <span style="">was </span>tampered with by making it appear that <span class="SpellE">Alim</span>
<span class="SpellE">Balindong</span> obtained 8 votes in said precinct when in
fact he obtained 13 votes; and that as a result of such tampering, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Uso</span> Dan <span class="SpellE">Aguam</span> herein was made to
win against respondent <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span>
by a margin of 3 votes.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing petition was met by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Uso</span>
Dan <span class="SpellE">Aguam</span> with an answer and a motion to
dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After making certain denials <span style="">and admissions, petitioner herein raised in <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> the issues, amongst others, of jurisdiction and
time-bar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It was while the case was
pending in <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, after the parties have been
heard, that the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> order of April 27, 1968
was issued.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Hence, the present
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To maintain the status quo, we
issued a cease-and-desist order on May 10, 1968, upon a cash bond of
P1,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the petition,
respondents' returns, and the oral arguments, the case is now before us for
decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By constitutional
mandate, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> "shall have exclusive charge of
the enforcement and administration of all laws relative to the conduct of
elections and shall exercise all other functions which may be conferred upon it
by law." The Constitution enjoins <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> to
"decide, save those involving the right to vote, all administrative
questions, affecting elections." And, all of these are aimed at achieving
an ideal:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"free, orderly, and
honest elections."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Implementing the constitutional precept, Congress legislated in Section 3 of
the Revised Election Code that, in addition to the powers and functions
conferred by the Constitution, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> has
"direct and immediate supervision over the provincial, municipal, and city
officials designated by law to perform duties relative to the conduct of
elections."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The great breadth of the
constitutional and statutory powers granted <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
has brought to the fore judicial pronouncements which have long become
guidelines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Time and again, this Court
has given its imprimatur on the principle that <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
is with authority to annul any canvass and proclamation which was illegally
made.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The fact that a candidate proclaimed has
assumed office, we have said, is no bar to the exercise of such power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It of course may not be availed of where
there has been "a valid proclamation."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Since private re­spondent's petition before <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> is precisely directed at the annul­ment of the
canvass and proclamation, we perceive that inquiry into this issue is within
the area allocated by the Constitution and law to <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not that the view expressed herein is without
reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">We </span><span style="">draw from past
experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A pattern of conduct
observed in past elections has been the "pernicious
'grab-the-proclamation-prolong-the?</span>protest' slogan of some
candidates or parties."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Really, were a victim of a proclamation to be precluded from challenging the
validity thereof after that proclamation and the assumption of office <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>, baneful effects may easily supervene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may not be out of place to state that in
the long history of election contests in this country, as observed in <span class="SpellE"><u>Lagumbay</u></span> <u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Climaco</u></span>,
<u>supra</u>, a successful contestant in an election protest often wins but
"a mere pyrrhic victory, i.e., a vindication when the term of office <span style="">is </span>about to
expire or has expired." Protests, counter-protests, revisions of ballots,
appeals, dilatory tactics, may well frustrate the will of the electorate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And what if the protestant may not have the
resources and an unwavering determination with which to sustain a long
drawn-out election contest?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this
context therefore all efforts should be strained - <span style="">as far as </span>is humanly possible -to
take election returns out of the reach of the unscrupulous; and to prevent
illegal or fraudulent proclamation from ripening into illegal assumption of
office.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the foregoing are not all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the course of oral arguments before this Court, we observed that in
the minutes of the canvassing at <span class="SpellE">Marawi</span> on <st1:date year="1967" day="20" month="11">November 20, 1967</st1:date>, the following
appear:</p>

<blockquote>"The Treasurer/Secretary then presented <u>all</u> <u>the</u> <u>Advanced</u>
<u>Election</u> <u>Returns</u> to the members of the Board for inspection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was done in the presence of
representatives of the Commission on Elections and the Philippine Army.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Then the Municipal Board of Canvassers proceeded and began opening
the election returns consecutively in accordance with the numbers of the
precincts."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Advanced copies of election returns cannot be the basis of proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proclamation should be based on the copies of
the returns for the municipal treasurer, or if unserviceable, on three other
authentic copies of the returns, namely:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that for the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> (Annex 2 of <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> answer), or for the provincial treasurer, or that
in the ballot box.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing in the same
minutes would show that anyone of those four returns was used.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor do the minutes mention the presence of
candidates or their representatives in the canvassing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A probe into these facts is important.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We have but to reiterate
the oft-cited rule that the validity of a proclamation may be challenged even
after the irregularly proclaimed candidate has assumed office.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We now grapple with
the problem of the alleged nullity of <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span>
resolution of <st1:date year="1968" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will be recalled that re­spondent <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span> has complained of
the tampering of the return in Precinct 8 before the Court of First Instance
and before <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> copy of the return of Precinct 8
(Annex 2 of <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> answer to the petition before
this Court) gives <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> a good starting point upon
which to look into the authenticity of the return from said precinct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, so <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
alleges, the entries of votes therein for respondent <span class="SpellE">Alim</span>
<span class="SpellE">Balindong</span> are crossed out by heavy pencil marks and
written thereon is the word "eight" and figure "8".<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> also
underscores the fact that this runs counter to the certificate of votes signed
by <u>all</u> the members of the board of inspectors of Precinct 8 where it
appears that Mini <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span> obtained
"thirteen" votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Decisive of
the political fortunes of petitioner and respondent <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span>
is the difference of 5 votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Heretofore adverted to is that petitioner herein upon the disputed
canvass won by 3 votes.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
these, the probability that respondent Mira <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span>
is rightfully entitled to proclamation may not easily be shrugged off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If only for the fact that proclamation should
be made within the limits of accepted notions of justice, and also because a
candidate is not to be turned away upon a proclamation allegedly riddled with
irregularities in various forms that affect its validity, investigation of the
tampering here charged, is proper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
power of <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> to do this is now beyond debate.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
And, we have specifically declared in <span class="SpellE"><u>Cauton</u></span> <u>vs</u>.
<u>Commission</u> <u>on</u> <u>Elections</u>, 19 Supreme Court Reports <span class="SpellE">Anno</span>. 911, 923, that “in ordering the opening of the ballot
boxes the purpose of the Commission is not to help a particular candidate win
an election but to properly administer and enforce the laws relative to the
conduct of elections."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We, therefore, rule that
certiorari and prohibition will not lie against the challenged <span class="GramE">resolution</span> of April 27, 1968.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>3. The stress of petitioner's argument is that respondent <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span> filed his petition
on January 6, 1968, i.e., long after the proclamation of November 20,
1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is petitioner's trenchant claim
that since the two-week period from proclamation, allowed for protests, had
long elapsed,' <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> is without power to entertain
the same - it had no jurisdiction.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner draws our
attention to the cases of <u>De</u> <u>Leon</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Imperial</u>, 94
Phil. 680, and <span class="SpellE"><u>Abes</u></span> <u>vs</u>. <u>Commission</u>
<u>on</u> <u>Elections</u>, </span><span style="">L-28348,
<span class="GramE">December</span> 15, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These cases, however, are not to be read as throwing overboard <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> authority to inquire into whether or not a
proclamation is null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For,
these cases merely emphasize the rule that where a proclamation is validly
made, errors in the proclamation may only be raised in a full-dress election
protest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The ratiocination advanced by petitioner fails to take stock of
the fact that where a proclamation is null and void, that proclamation is no
proclamation at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
axiomatic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be remembered is <span class="SpellE"><u>Mutuc</u></span> <u>vs</u>. <u>Commission</u> <u>on</u> <u>Elections</u>,
<u>supra</u>, citing <span class="SpellE"><u>Demafiles</u></span> <u>vs</u>. <u>Commission</u>
<u>on</u> <u>Elections</u>, <u>supra.</u><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Our ruling there is this:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"It is indeed true that after proclamation the usual remedy of any
party aggrieved in an election is to be found in an election protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But <span style="">that
is so only on the assumption that there has been a valid proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where as in the case at bar the proclamation
itself is illegal, the assumption of office cannot in any way affect the basic
issues."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">And then, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> has yet to determine
when respondent <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span>
<u>actually</u> had knowledge of the proclamation of November 20, 1967.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The election law does not
provide for a time limit within which a candidate may challenge the validity of
a proclamation before <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are unprepared to say that inaction for an
unreasonable period may not block him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even then, considering the steps taken </span>by respondent, <span style="">first, in the Court of First Instance, the
second, in the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, the time gap between the
alleged illegal proclamation of </span><st1:date year="1967" day="20" month="11"><span style="">November 20, 1967</span></st1:date><span style=""> and the petition before <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
of </span><st1:date year="1968" day="6" month="1"><span style="">January 6, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">
does not authorize this Court to say that respondent <span class="SpellE">Alim</span>
<span class="SpellE">Balindong</span> is guilty of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that <span class="SpellE">Balindong's</span> petition
before <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> was timely filed; and that <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> has jurisdiction to inquire into the nullity of the
November 20, 1967 proclamation, and consequently to inquire into the tampering
of the election return in Precinct 8.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>FOR THE REASONS GIVEN</b>, the petition for certiorari and prohibition
is hereby denied; and the preliminary injunction heretofore issued is hereby
set aside.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Costs against petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
