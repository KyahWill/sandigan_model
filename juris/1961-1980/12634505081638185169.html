				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by the Government from a decision of the Court of Tax Appeals,
setting aside the assessments made by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, in
the sums of P14,128.00 and P8,439.00, as deficiency income taxes alleged­ly due
from respondent Goodrich International Rubber Company — hereinafter referred to
as Goodrich — for the years 1951 and 1952, respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">These assessments were based on disallowed deductions, claimed by
Goodrich, consisting of several alleged bad debts, in the aggregate sum of
P50,455.41, for the year 1951, and the sum of P30,138.88, as representation
expenses allegedly incurred in the year 1952.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Goodrich had appealed from said as­sessments to the Court of Tax
Appeals, which, after appropriate proceedings, rendered, on <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="6">June 8, 1963</st1:date>, a decision allowing the
deduction for bad debts, but disallowing the alleged representa­tion
expenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On motion for reconsideration
and new trial, filed by Goodrich, on <st1:date year="1963" day="19" month="11">November
 19, 1963</st1:date>, the Court of Tax Ap­peals amended its aforementioned
decision and allowed said deductions for representation expenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this appeal by the Government.</p>

<p class="BODY">The claim for deduction of these ten (10) debts should be

either that the debts are actually worthless or that it had reasonable grounds
to believe them to be so in 1951.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our
statute permits the de­duction of debts "actually ascertained to be
worthless within the taxable year," obviously to prevent arbitrary action
by the taxpayer, to unduly avoid tax liability.</p>

<p class="BODY">The requirement of ascertainment of worthlessness requires proof
of two facts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the taxpayer did
in fact as­certain the debt to be worthless, in the year for which the de­duction
is sought; and (2) that, in so doing, he acted in good faith.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Good faith on the part of the taxpayer is not enough.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He must show, also, that he had reasonably
investigated the relevant facts and had drawn a reasonable inference from the
information thus obtained by him.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent herein has not adequately made such showing.</p>

<p class="BODY">The payments made, some in full, after some of the foregoing
accounts had been characterized as bad debts, mere­ly stresses the undue haste
with which the same had been writ­ten off.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At any rate, respondent has not proven that said debts were
worthless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no evidence that the
debtors can not pay them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be
noted also that, in violation of Revenue Regulations No. 2, Section 102,
respondent had not attached to its income tax returns a statement showing the
propriety of the deductions therein made for alleged bad debts.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, we find that the following accounts were
properly written off:</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>San Juan Auto Supply</u> (P4,530.64):</p>

<p class="BODY">This account was contracted in 1950.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Referred, for collection, to respondent's

</span>In November, 1950, the corresponding suit for collection was filed (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
debtor's counsel was al­lowed to withdraw, as such, the debtor having failed to
meet him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the debtor did not

<p class="BODY">These three (3) accounts were among those referred to counsel for
Goodrich for collection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Up to 1951, when
they were written off, counsel had sent 17 letters of demand to Lion Shoe Store
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B); 16 demand letters to Ruiz Highway Transit (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B-1); and 6 letters of demand to Esquire Auto Seat
Cover (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B-5).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In 1951, Lion Shoe Store, Ruiz Highway Transit, and Esquire Auto Seat
Cover had made partial payments in the sums of P1,050.00, P400.00, and P300.00,
respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sub­sequent to the
write-off, additional small payments were made and accounted for as income of
Goodrich.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel interviewed the debtors,
investigated their ability to pay and threatened law suits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He found that the debtors were in strained
financial con­dition and had no attachable or <span class="SpellE">leviable</span>
property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, Lion Shoe Store was
burned twice, in 1948 and 1949.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There­after,
it continued to do business on limited scale.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Later, it went out of business.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ruiz Highway Transit, had more debts than assets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel, therefore, advised respondent to
write off these accounts as bad debts without going to court, for it would be
"foolish to spend good money after bad."</p>

<p class="BODY">The deduction of these eight (8) accounts, aggregating
P22,627.35, as bad debts should be allowed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from should be, as it is
hereby, modified, in the sense that respondent's alleged representation
expenses are totally disallowed, and its claim for bad debts allowed up to the
sum of P22,627.35 only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without special
pronouncement as to costs.</p>
