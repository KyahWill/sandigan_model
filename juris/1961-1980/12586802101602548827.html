<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In this <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">petition for certiorari </span></em>with 
preliminary injunction, the petitioners ask this Court to review a three-to-two 
decision rendered by a special division of the Court of Appeals on March 26, 
1965 in C.A. 35019-R, sustaining the validity of the proceedings had and taken 
by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> in election 
case 7924 before it (<span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Argana</span>, protestant vs. Francisco De Mesa, <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>). The issue of nullity of the judgment promulgated 
in the said election case was elevated to the Court of Appeals on a petition for 
certiorari and mandamus, upon the contention that the said court of first 
instance illegally and incorrectly did not allow the substitution of the present 
petitioners as parties for De Mesa, after the latter's death, and thereafter 
denied due course to their appeal from the said judgment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The antecedent facts are not 
complicated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Opponents for the mayoralty of 
<span class="SpellE">Muntinlupa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> in the 
1963 elections were Francisco De Mesa and <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> A. 
<span class="SpellE">Argana</span>. The electorate's choice, as tallied by the 
local board of canvassers, was De Mesa. Elected vice-mayor with him was <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Loresca</span>. Duly 
proclaimed elected, these two qualified and assumed their respective positions 
upon the commencement of their term of office.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Meanwhile and in due season, 
defeated candidate <span class="SpellE">Argana</span>, charging the perpetration 
of frauds, terrorism and other irregularities in certain precincts, protested 
the election of De Mesa, which protest was docketed as election case 
7924,<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> supra</span></em>, in the Court of 
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, the Honorable <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Eulogio</span></span><span class="GramE"> <span class="SpellE">Mencias</span> presiding.</span> In his return to the protest, De 
Mesa traversed the charges, and, in a counter-protest incorporated therein, 
sought to shift responsibility for irregularities to the protestant and his 
followers, impugning in view thereof the results in some thirteen 
precincts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="3" day="18" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 
18, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
however, an assassin's bullet felled De Mesa, and, forthwith, vice-mayor <span class="SpellE">Loresca</span> was, by operation of law, duly installed as his 
successor. Notice of De Mesa's demise was given on </span><st1:date month="4" day="22" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 
22, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
to the court <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">a quo </span></em>thru a 
"<span class="SpellE">Constancia</span>" filed by the decedent's counsel of 
record, in which they also indicated their belief that, by reason of said death, 
their authority as such counsel was terminated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the election case, meanwhile, 
the protest ant <span class="SpellE">Argana</span> moved for the constitution of 
committees on revision of ballots. Expressly to hear <span class="SpellE">protestee’s</span> view thereon and to afford him a chance to 
propose his commissioners, this motion was set for hearing but, quite 
understandably, no appearance was entered for the deceased <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>. Accordingly, on May 6, 1964, the court a quo 
required the <span class="SpellE">protestee’s</span> widow and children to appear 
within fifteen days from notice in order to be substituted for said <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>, if they so desired. They did not, however, 
comply. Taking no further action in the premises, the trial court left the 
matter at that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Then proceeding <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span>,</span></em> on 
</span><st1:date month="6" day="11" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 11, 
1964</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
protestant <span class="SpellE">Argana</span> reiterated his move for the 
appointment of commissioners on revision of ballots, but this time without 
proposing any provision for representation for the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> whose widow and children he sought to be declared 
"non-suited”. On </span><st1:date month="6" day="23" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 23, 
1964</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
without notice to the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> and/or his legal 
representative - as indeed none had thus far been named - the trial court 
granted the motion aforesaid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">With the constitution of the 
committee on revision of ballots in which, incidentally, Ramon <span class="SpellE">Antilon</span>, Jr. was <span class="SpellE">motu</span> <span class="SpellE">proprio</span> named and then served as commissioner for the 
deceased <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>, the completion of the proceedings 
on revision, and the submission of the report thereon, the trial court, in its 
decision of August 10, 1964, adjudged the protestant <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Argana</span> as the duly 
elected mayor of <span class="SpellE">Muntinlupa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> in the 1963 elections, and taxed the costs and 
expenses of the protest against the estate of the deceased <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> Francisco De Mesa.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="8" day="17" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 
17, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period for the finality of the 
decision aforesaid, a three-pronged move was taken by De Mesa's widow, Magdalena 
<span class="SpellE">Sibulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">De</span> Mesa, and the local chapter 
of the Liberal Party of which the deceased <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> 
was a member, thru its president and secretary. First, they sought leave to 
represent the deceased <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>, invoking 
specifically said <span class="SpellE">protestee’s</span> interest to keep his 
political opponent out of the contested office in order to maintain his 
successor therein, which interest was not abated by his death; second, they 
moved for the reconsideration of the August 10, 1964 decision and/or for new 
trial based, <i>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></i>, upon the ground that, 
for failure to order the protestant to procure the appointment of a legal 
representative of the deceased <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> after his 
widow and children had failed to appear, pursuant to the applicable provisions 
of the Rules of Court, it was legally improper for the trial court to have 
proceeded ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> with the election case; and third, 
they filed a "Cautionary Notice of Appeal” in anticipation of the possible 
denial of their said motion for reconsideration and new 
trial.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Pleading lack of personality both 
of De Mesa's widow and the local Liberal Party Chapter to intervene in the case, 
as well as the absence of any ground for a new trial, the protestant opposed the 
foregoing moves. To the opposition, the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> below 
filed their reply. <span class="GramE">On </span></span><st1:date month="9" day="25" year="1964"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 25, 
1964</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> the court a quo, subscribing to 
the position taken by the protestant, denied the <span class="SpellE">movants</span>’ petition for leave to represent the deceased <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> and ordered stricken from the record their motion 
for reconsideration and new trial and their cautionary notice of 
appeal.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="10" day="6" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 
6, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
<span class="SpellE">Argana</span> qualified as mayor and assumed 
office.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Forthwith, on </span><st1:date month="10" day="7" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 7, 
1964</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> the 
<span class="SpellE">movants</span> aforesaid gave notice of their intention to 
take the matter on appeal to the Court of Appeals. This was met with the 
protestant's motion to strike out their notice of appeal, grounded on the trial 
court's finding of <span class="SpellE">movants</span>’ want of personality to 
appear in the case, and consequently to appeal the decision a 
quo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the meantime, <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Loresca</span> made common 
cause with Be Mesa's widow and the local Liberal Party Chapter, and moved for 
leave to be added to and/or substituted as party-<span class="SpellE">protestee</span>, claiming a legal and continuing interest in the 
outcome of the election protest as successor to De Mesa.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="11" day="10" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 10, 
1964</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> the 
trial court dictated twin orders: (1) granting the protestant's motion to strike 
out the notice of <span class="GramE">appeal</span> heretofore adverted to; and 
(2) denying <span class="SpellE">Loresca’s</span> motion to be substituted as 
party-<span class="SpellE">protestee</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This development sent the herein 
petitioners to the Court of Appeals on a petition for certiorari and mandamus, 
with preliminary injunction (CA 35019-R), to nullify for lack of jurisdiction 
the proceedings taken by the trial court in the election case aforesaid without 
allowing the intervention and/or the inclusion of a legal representative of the 
deceased <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>; or, in the alternative, to compel 
the trial court to give due course to the petitioners’ appeal from the decision 
in said case. Upon bond duly filed and approved, the Court of Appeals issued the 
writ of preliminary injunction prayed for. However, upon respondents’ motion and 
over the opposition of the petitioners, the effect of said writ was temporarily 
suspended until the case was finally decided by the Court of 
Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appropriate proceedings having 
been had in the case, the latter court, besides finding the inapplicability to 
election cases of the provisions of Section 17, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court on 
substitution of parties in case of death, opined that the petitioners likewise 
lacked the legal standing and/or capacity to appear in election case 7924 
aforesaid and/or to appeal from the decision rendered therein, and that 
furthermore while the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Loresca</span> may have had 
such personality he nevertheless failed to timely invoke the same to protect his 
interests. Accordingly, it denied the <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">petition for certiorari </span></em>and mandamus 
and consequently permanently dissolved the writ of preliminary injunction 
theretofore issued.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Hence, the 
present recourse.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The vital issue, to which all 
other issues appear to be subsidiary, is the determination of the legal effect 
of the proceedings taken by the trial court in the election contest before it 
subsequent to the demise of the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> De 
Mesa.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As we approach this question, 
certain postulates project themselves to the fore. It is axiomatic that an 
election contest, involving as it does not only the adjudication and settlement 
of the private interests of the rival candidates but also the paramount need of 
dispelling once and for all the uncertainty that beclouds the real choice of the 
electorate with respect to who shall discharge the prerogatives of the offices 
within their gift, is a proceeding imbued with public interest which raises it 
onto a plane over and above ordinary civil actions. For this reason, broad 
perspectives of public policy impose upon courts the imperative duty to 
ascertain by all means within their command who is the real candidate elected in 
as expeditious a manner as possible, out being fettered by technicalities and 
procedural barriers to the end that the will of the people may not be frustrated 
(<span class="SpellE">Ibasco</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Ilao</span>, et al., 
G.R.L-17512, December 29, 1960; <span class="SpellE">Reforma</span> vs. De Luna, 
G.R. L-13242, July 31, 1958). So inextricably intertwined are the interests of 
the contestants and those of the public that there can be no gainsaying the 
logic of the proposition that even the voluntary cessation in office of the 
<span class="SpellE">protestee</span> not only does not<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> ipso facto </span></em>divest him of the character 
of an adversary in the contest inasmuch as he retains a party interest to keep 
his political opponent out of the office and maintain therein his successor, but 
also does not in any manner impair or detract from the jurisdiction of the court 
to pursue the proceeding to its final conclusion (De Los Angeles vs. Rodriguez, 
46 Phil., 595, 597; <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> vs. Hernandez, 62 Phil. 
584, 587; <span class="SpellE">Galves</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>, G.R. L-13206).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Upon the same principle, the 
death of the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> De Mesa did not abate the 
proceedings in the election protest filed against him, and it may be stated as a 
rule that an election contest survives and must be prosecuted to final judgment 
despite the death of the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">With the death of De Mesa, 
however, a contingency not expressly provided for by the Revised Election Code 
was ushered in. Nevertheless, the hiatus in the special law posed no impediment 
to the course of the proceedings because, precisely by express mandate of Rule 
134 of the Rules of Court, said rules, though not generally applicable to 
election cases, may however be applied "by analogy or in a <span class="SpellE">suppletory</span> character and whenever practicable and 
convenient". For the eventuality here involved, the Rules specifically plot the 
course of action to be taken, in the following language:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Sec. 
17.</span></span><em><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> Death 
of party<span class="GramE">.<span style="font-style: normal;">-</span></span></span></em><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> After a party dies and the claim 
is not thereby extinguished, the court shall order, upon proper notice, the 
legal representative of the deceased to appear and to be substituted for the 
deceased, within a period of thirty (30) days, or within such time as may be 
granted. If the legal representative fails to appear within said time, the court 
may order the opposing party to procure the appointment of a legal 
representative of the deceased within a time to be specified by the court, and 
the representative shall immediately appear for and on behalf of the interest of 
the deceased, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>". <span class="GramE">(Rule 3).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">That the applicability of the 
foregoing precept to the election contest below was initially conceded is borne 
out by the proceedings on record. The trial court, it will be recalled, in its 
order of </span><st1:date month="5" day="6" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">May 6, 
1964</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
required the widow and children of the deceased <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> to appear and be substituted for and on his behalf 
and to protect his interest in the case. But when they failed to comply - mainly 
because of the shock and agony that followed in the wake of the violent death of 
the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> the trial court took no further steps in 
the premises and, instead, at the instance of the protestant, declared said 
widow and children non-suited, proceeded with the case ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> and effectively blocked all attempts at intervention 
and/or substitution in behalf of the deceased <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>. In these moves, the trial court did not only 
merit the unqualified sanction of the Court of Appeals but the latter, taking an 
even more radical view of the matter, actually held that the rule relied upon 
has no application to election cases.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We cannot give our imprimatur to 
the foregoing view. All reasonable intendments deducible from the law and the 
essential nature of the case involved, to our mind, unerringly tend to the 
contrary. At the very least, nothing extant in the Revised Election Code either 
expressly or by implication renders inappropriate the application of said 
principle of substitution in case of death to proceedings <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>. On the contrary, because of its clear failure to 
meet the contingency in question, the need to supplement the deficiency becomes 
imperative. Then, the exertion of judicial power to hear and determine a cause 
implicitly presupposes in the trial court, amongst other essentials, 
jurisdiction over the persons of the parties. That jurisdiction was inevitably 
impaired upon the death of the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> pending the 
proceedings below such that unless and until a legal representative is for him 
duly named and within the jurisdiction of the trial court, no adjudication in 
the cause could have been accorded any validity or binding effect upon any 
party, in representation of the deceased, without trenching upon the fundamental 
right to a day in court which is the very essence of the constitutionally 
enshrined guarantee of due process. As cogently synthesized in <span class="SpellE">Cupples</span> vs. Castro, 137 P. <span class="GramE">2d.,</span> 755 
– <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Where contestant was declared 
elected and <span class="SpellE">contestee</span> appealed after which contestant 
died, rights of parties could not be determined in absence of contestant and his 
legal representative and submission would be set aside and cause taken from 
calendar to b e heard only after representative of contestant should have been 
substituted." <span class="GramE">(Francisco, The Revised Election Code, 1957 ed., 
p. 583).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">If this be the case with the 
contestant, <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">a fortiori</span></em> no 
less can be said of the <span class="SpellE">contestee</span> whose rights as well 
as those of his successor by operation of law would be at hazard in an <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span></span></em> 
proceeding. Further still, the fundamental purpose of the Revised Election Code, 
it has been recognized, is to protect the integrity of elections and suppress 
all evils that may vitiate their purity and defeat the popular will. Judicial 
experience teaches that more often than not frauds and irregularities committed 
during the voting come to light only when the ballot boxes are opened and their 
contents examined. At no time then in the course of an election contest is the 
need for vigilance more to be insisted upon than during that critical stage when 
the ballot boxes are opened and the ballots themselves are revised. To deny a 
party to the contest the representation that the law allows him at this juncture 
is virtually to take away one of the most effective measures designed for the 
approximation of the primordial objective election laws are intended to 
achieve.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the light of the foregoing, it 
is our considered view that Section 17, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court applies to 
election contests to the same extent and with the same force and effect as it 
does in ordinary civil actions. And we declare that unless and until the 
procedure therein detailed is strictly adhered to, proceedings taken by a court 
in the absence of a duly appointed legal representative of the deceased <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> must be stricken down as null and void. 
Considering that, in the case at bar, the trial court failed to order the 
protestant to procure the appointment of a legal representative of the deceased 
<span class="SpellE">protestee</span> after the latter’s widow and children had 
failed to comply with the court order requiring their appearance to be 
substituted in lieu of their predecessor, but instead - in derogation of the 
precepts of the Rule in question and in the total absence of a legal 
representative of the deceased <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> - proceeded 
ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> with the election case, said court not only 
acted with grave abuse of discretion but actually committed a clear 
extra-limitation of its lawful jurisdiction which, perforce, tainted all its

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is no argument against this 
conclusion to contend that the requirement for the procurement of a legal 
representative of a deceased litigant is couched in the permissive term "may" 
instead of the mandatory word "shall". While the ordinary acceptations of these 
terms may indeed be resorted to as guides in the ascertainment of the mandatory 
or directory character of statutory provisions, they are in no wise absolute and 
inflexible criteria in the vast areas of law and equity. Depending upon a 
consideration of the entire provision, its nature, its object and the 
consequences that would follow from construing it one way or the other, the 
convertibility of said terms either as mandatory or permissive is a standard 
recourse in statutory construction. Thus, Black is authority for the rule that 
"Where the statute provides for the doing of some act which is required by 
justice or public duty, or where it invests a public body, municipality or 
public officer with power and authority to take some action which concerns the 
public interest or rights of individuals, the permissive language will be 
construed as mandatory and the execution of the power may be insisted upon as a 
duty" (Black, Interpretation of Laws, pp. 540-543). The matter here involved not 
only concerns public interest but also goes into the jurisdiction of the trial 
court and is of the essence of the proceedings taken thereon. On this point, 
there is authority to the effect that in statutes relating to procedure, as is 
the one now under consideration, every act which is jurisdictional, or of the 
essence of the proceedings, or is prescribed for the protection or benefit of 
the party affected, is mandatory (<span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>, Statutes 
and their Construction, p. 98, citing; Estate of Naval, G. R. No. L-6736, 
</span><st1:date month="5" day="4" year="1954"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">May 4, 
1954</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">). 
The present case is well within the purview of this 
doctrine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Nor may the<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="SpellE">motu</span> <span class="SpellE">proprio</span> </span></em>appointment by the trial court of Ramon 
<span class="SpellE">AntiIon</span>, Jr. as commissioner for the deceased <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> in the revision proceedings be deemed a 
substantial compliance with the legal requirement. As aptly observed in the 
dissent to the decision under review, said commissioner was not the legal 
representative contemplated by the Rules to be substituted for the deceased 
<span class="SpellE">protestee</span>. Said commissioner was not supposed to 
represent the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> as a party litigant. His 
appointment as such was made exclusively upon the initiative of the trial court 
and is authorized by the law, Section 175, Revised Election Code, merely as a 
time-saving device for the convenience of the court and the parties in the 
purely mechanical operation of opening the ballots and tabulating the count and 
in the interest of a speedy and expeditious revision and recount of the 
contested ballots (<span class="SpellE">Hontiveros</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Altavas</span>, 24 Phil., 632, 649-650; <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> vs. Gonzales, 80 Phil., 719, 721). For all legal 
intents and purposes, while said commissioner's appointment may be proposed by 
the contestants themselves, he is nevertheless exclusively an officer or an 
agent of the court under its direct control and 
supervision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Equally unacceptable is the 
proposition that, because time is of the essence in an election contest, 
recourse to the appointment of a legal representative of a deceased <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> which can only protract and delay the progress of 
the case is but a finical matter of procedure which can justifiably be dispensed 
with. The validity of the injunction for the prompt disposal of election 
controversies as repeatedly postulated in a consistent array of jurisprudence is 
not open to debate. The terms of office of elective officials are relatively 
brief. To dissipate within the shortest time possible any aura of doubt upon the 
true result of elections is a much sought-after desideratum. But, salutary 
though the precept may be, it is no justification for cutting procedural corners 
or taking legal short-cut not warranted in a system of procedure where the rule 
of law is still held paramount over and above all considerations of mere 
convenience and expediency. We would be the last to advocate a departure from 
the policy of early settlement of electoral disputes, but we are not prepared to 
lend our approval to a course of action which would tend to achieve one object 
of desire at the expense of the orderly administration of justice and with the 
sacrifice of the fundamental right of litigants to due process of law. 
Otherwise, the speedy trial required by the law would be converted into a denial 
of justice (<span class="SpellE">Querubin</span> vs. Court of Appeals, 82 Phil., 
226, 230). In law - as in any other sphere of human / relations - the end very 
seldom, if at all, justifies the means. And, in the case at bar, the admittedly 
imperative demand for a speedy disposition of the controversy cannot deter our 
hand from striking down illegality in the proceedings therein and remanding the 
case for new trial, despite the concomitant delay that may be occasioned 
thereby, since that is the only course open if the ends of justice are to be 
<span class="SpellE">subserved</span> (<span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> vs. 
Hernandez, 62 Phil., 584, 587).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Consequent to the conclusion we 
have just reached, we confront the issue of who is the legal representative of 
the deceased <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> entitled to be substituted in 
his stead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As the record of the case 
reveals, three different aspirants vied for that legal representation: <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Loresca</span>, the 
vice-mayor who succeeded to the position of mayor upon the <span class="SpellE">protestee’s</span> demise; Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Sibulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">De</span> Mesa, the <span class="SpellE">protestee’s</span> widow: and the local chapter of the Liberal 
Party at <span class="SpellE">Muntinlupa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, 
to which the deceased <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> belonged, as 
represented by its officers who are co-petitioners herein. An examination of the 
countervailing interests of these parties seems in order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">By virtue of Section 7 of the 
Local Autonomy Act, Republic Act 2264, the vice-mayor stands next in line of 
succession to the mayor in case of a permanent vacancy in the latter’s position. 
Upon the death of the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> mayor in the case at 
bar, <span class="SpellE">Loresca</span> as then incumbent vice-mayor succeeded by 
operation of law to the vacated office and, as a matter of right, is entitled to 
occupy the same for the unexpired term thereof or until the protest against his 
predecessor is decided adversely against the latter. The outcome of that contest 
thus bears directly upon his right to his present position and, amongst all, he 
is the person most keenly concerned and interested in the fair and regular 
conduct thereof in order that the true will of the electorate will be upheld. 
His status as a real party in interest in the continuation of the proceedings - 
a fact conceded by the decision under review itself - cannot thus be 
disputed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is not correct to subject 
<span class="SpellE">Loresca</span>, as the Court of Appeals did, respecting his 
interest in the controversy, to the operation of the equitable principle of 
<span class="SpellE">laches</span>. The initiative to cause his substitution in 
lieu of the deceased <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> was not <span class="SpellE">Loresca’s</span>. It was the trial court's as well as the 
protestant's duty, upon being apprised of the <span class="SpellE">protestee’s</span> death, to cause the appointment of his legal 
representative according to the procedure delineated in the Rules, Failing in 
this duty, it never became the obligation of <span class="SpellE">Loresca</span> 
to take it upon himself to be appointed as such legal representative, as in 
fact, he was not even duly and seasonably notified, much less ordered, to appear 
and be so substituted. In this posture, and particularly because, as above held, 
the trial court did not even acquire jurisdiction over him, no room exists for 
the operation of the rule on <span class="SpellE">laches</span> against him. His 
intervention should not have been denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The same cannot, however, be said 
of the <span class="SpellE">protestee’s</span> widow or of the local Liberal Party 
chapter of <span class="SpellE">Muntinlupa</span>. The <span class="SpellE">protestee’s</span> claim to the contested office is not in any 
sense a right transmissible to his widow or heirs. Said <span class="GramE">widow's</span> only remaining interest in the outcome of the case is 
limited to no more than the possible award of costs against the deceased <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>. Besides not being such an interest as would 
justify her substitution for her deceased husband as an indispensable legal 
representative, the right to such an award if eventually made has already been 
waived by the protestant <span class="SpellE">Argana</span>. This effectively 
withdraws the widow from the picture altogether. Much less has the local Liberal 
Party Chapter any claim to substitution. Not being duly incorporated as a 
juridical person, it can have no personality to sue or be sued as such. And 
while it conceivably may derive some indirect benefit consequent to the 
resolution of the contest in favor of the deceased <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>, neither the chapter itself nor the officers 
thereof would become entitled thereby to any right to the contested office in 
case of a favorable judgment, nor, for that matter, do they stand to sustain any 
direct prejudice in case of an adverse one. No basis therefore exists upon which 
to predicate their claim to substitution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The foregoing views render 
academic the alternative issue raised by the petitioners regarding the propriety 
of their appeal from the trial court's decision in the main 
case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">ACCORDINGLY, the judgment under 
review is reversed and, in lieu thereof, another is rendered ‘ 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(1) Declaring null and void the 
judgment of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> in 
election case 7924 thereof, dated August 10, 1964, which proclaimed the

legal representative of the deceased <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> 
Francisco De Mesa and allow his appearance as such in substitution of the said 
deceased for purposes of said election case 7924 of said court, to conduct a new 
trial in said election case, and thereafter to render judgment therein as the
