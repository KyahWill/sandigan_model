				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On October 16, 1958, Marcial Ama y Perez, Ernesto de Jesus and Alejandro 
Ramos were charged with murder before the Court of First Instance of Rizal in an 
information the pertinent portions of which read:
<blockquote>
<p>"That on or about the 27th day of August, 1958, in the New Bilibid Prison, 
municipality of Muntinlupa, province of Rizal, Philippines and within the 
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the abovenamed accused, conspiring and 
confederating together and mutually helping one another, armed with deadly 
weapons to wit: sharp-pointed instruments, with intent to kill and with 
treachery and evident premeditation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully 
and feloniously attack, assault and stab one Almario Bautista, thereby 
inflicting upon the latter stab wounds on the different parts of his body, and 
as a result of which, said Almario Bautista died instantaneously.</p><p>"That the 
accused are quasi-recidivist having committed the abovementioned felony while 
serving their respective sentences after having been convicted of final 
judgment.</p><p>"That the crime was committed in the presence of public authorities 
who were then engaged in the discharge of their duties."</p></blockquote>
<p>After the accused pleaded not guilty, upon arraignment, the trial court set 
the case for hearing on November 25, 1958. On the same date, however, De Jesus 
and Ramos moved for postponement on the ground that they were asking the fiscal 
to reinvestigate their case, which motion was granted. Marcial Ama y Perez, on 
the other hand, moved that he be permitted to withdraw his former plea of not 
guilty and substitute it for that of guilty. Granting said motion, the court 
directed that the information be read and explained again to him, after which 
Marcial Ama, with the assistance of his counsel <i>de oficio</i>, spontaneously 
and voluntarily pleaded guilty as charged.</p>
<p>Then, counsel for the accused moved that the minimum penalty be imposed in 
view of his plea of guilty, which motion was objected to by the prosecution, 
contending that since the special aggravating circumstance of quasi-recidivism 
is present which cannot be offset by the mitigating circumstance of plea of 
guilty, the imposable penalty should be the maximum or death. And after the 
fiscal had submitted proof relative to the presence of the aggravating 
circumstances alleged in the information, the court rendered decision sentencing 
Marcial Ama y Perez to death penalty, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in 
the amount of P6,000.00, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, 
and to pay the costs. Whereupon, the case was elevated to this Court for review 
pursuant to Section 9, Rule 119 of the Rules of Court.</p>
<p>The main error assigned by counsel is that the lower court erred in allowing 
appellant to change his plea of not guilty to that of guilty without informing 
him that his plea cannot offset the aggravating circumstance of quasi-recidivism 
alleged in the information as to obviate the imposition of death penalty. 
According to defense counsel, had the trial court informed appellant that 
despite his plea of guilty he would still be sentenced to death, he would have 
chosen to go to trial no matter how slim might be his chance of being acquitted. 
Counsel further avers that the attorney who assisted appellant in the lower 
court committed an oversight in advising him to plead guilty overlooking the 
provisions of Article 160 of the Revised Penal Code on quasi-recidivism, while 
the lower court erred in sentencing him to death relying merely on his plea of 
guilty.</p>
<p>There is no merit in this appeal. When an accused is arraigned in connection 
with a criminal charge the only duty of the court is to inform him of its nature 
and cause so that he may be able to comprehend it, as well as the circumstances 
attendant thereto.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> And when the charge 
is of a serious nature it becomes the imperative duty of his counsel not only to 
assist him during the reading of the information but also to explain to him the 
real import of the charge so "that he may fully realize the gravity and 
consequences of his plea. But there is nothing in the law that imposes upon the 
court the duty to apprise him of what the nature of the penalty to be meted out 
to him might be if he would plead guilty to the charge, its duty being limited 
to have him informed of the nature and cause thereof. In the instant case, the 
lower court did just that. In fact, it did even more. Considering the gravity of 
the charge it asked the fiscal to produce the evidence in his possession 
relative to the aggravating circumstance alleged in the information so that 
appellant's counsel may peruse it, and this was done without any objection on 
his part, and thereafter, the court rendered its decision. The error that 
counsel now imputes to the lower court is, therefore, untenable. Indeed, if 
appellant expressed his desire to plead guilty it is for no other reason than 
that his conscience persuaded him to do so, and so he has to suffer its 
consequences.</p>
<p>With regard to counsel's contention that the lower court erred in convicting 
appellant merely on his plea of guilty without requiring the fiscal to produce 
evidence in support of the charge, suffice it to quote hereunder what we said in 
a recent case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We are fully convinced that before the appellants entered their plea of 
guilty, they were apprised of the import and consequences thereof. They did not 
plead, without the assistance of counsel. Counsel <i>de oficio</i> was all the 
time at hand. The presumption of regularity and faithfulness in the performance 
of official functions, on the part of counsel <i>de oficio</i>, has not been 
overcome. No evidence appear on record that he had failed in his duty to advice 
the appellants of what to do. It would be creating a dangerous precedent to say 
now that the advice to plead guilty by the appointed counsel <i>de oficio</i> 
was improvident. * * *</p><p>"The issues raised by counsel in his brief were 
already answered by us in a number of cases. In U.S. <i>vs</i>. Barba, 29 Phil., 
206, and U.S. <i>vs</i>. Santiago, 35 Phil., 20, it was held that a plea of 
guilty is an admission of all the material facts alleged in the complaint or 
information. Tn subsequent cases, we ruled that a plea of goiilty when formally 
entered in arraignment, is sufficient to sustain a conviction for any offense 
charged in the information, without the 'necessity of requiring1 additional 
evidence, since by so pleading, the defendant himself has supplied the necessary 
proof (People <i>vs</i>. Valencia, 59 Phil., 42; People <i>vs</i>. Palupe, fi9 
Phil., 702.) It matters not even if the offense is capital, for the admission 
(plea of guilty), covers both the crime as well as its attendant circumstances 
(People <i>vs</i>. Acosta, 98 Phil., 642, 52 Off. Gaz., 1930). The allegation 
that the defendants did not get any practical benefit in pleading guilty to the 
crime charged, is not a plausible argument to dub the plea of guilty, as 
improvidently made. As well observed by the Solicitor General, 'The matter of 
pleading guilty to a charge is not a game. An accused pleads guilty because he 
believes that he is guilty. The advantages that he may get by so pleading are 
mere secondary considerations. Using the very argument of appellants that their 
plea of guilty did not improve their situation, we ask, what advantage would 
appellant achieve by undergoing a trial?'</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly, * * * the trial judge must have been fully satisfied that the 
appellants entered the plea of guilty, with full knowledge of the meaning and 
consequences of their act, more so when, as in this ease, the lives of the 
appellants were involved. The record does not reveal that appellants or counsel 
ever complained or protested at the time of arraignment that they did not 
understand the information and the effect of their plea of guilty." (People 
<i>vs</i>. Yamson and Romero 109 Phil. 793).</p></blockquote>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed, without pronouncement as 
to costs.</p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes,
