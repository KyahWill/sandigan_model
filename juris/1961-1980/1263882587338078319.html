<blockquote>"The only issue we are called upon to determine in this
proceedings, is the import of the Order of <st1:date year="1959" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It will be noted that the lower court made a clear interpretation of the
Order, when it said: 'x x.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first
sentence of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of the order in
question refers to the dismissal of the complaint, which is '<i>without any
condition at all</i>, and under Section <span style="">3,
</span>Rule 30 of the Rules of Court, it is understood to be with prejudice,
and shall have the effect <span style="">of </span>an
adjudication on the merits.’ We share the view of the court <i>a quo</i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>No
other reasonable interpretation could have been meant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And considering the fact that the judge who
issued the controversial order, was also the one who interpreted or clarified
the same, it becomes apparent that what the court really ordered when it
dismissed the complaint was a dismissal <i style="">with
prejudice</i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>If he had meant what the appellants
want Us to understand, his Honor could have likewise suffixed the dismissal of
the complaint with the phrase 'without prejudice, in the same way he did with
the dismissal of the defendant's counterclaim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The argument of appellants that the word 'likewise' refers or modified
both the complaint and counter­claim, is, to Our mind, untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even under ordinary rules of grammar, the
phrase 'without prejudice' appearing on the second sentence of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision, should modify or refer
only to the counterclaim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had the two
sentences been separated by a comma, there would have been no doubt that the
phrase <i>without pre­judice</i> had modified and/or referred to the dis­missal
of both the complaint and the counterclaim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But there were two different and distinct senten­ces, containing
different subjects, predicates and modifiers."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In their answer to the

action against them as they are the legitimate heirs of <span class="SpellE">Isidoro</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bayeta</span> and that Agustin <span class="SpellE">Bayeta</span>
is a successor-in-interest of <span class="SpellE">Isidoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayeta</span> and a purchaser in good faith and for value of a
property sold under auction sale from a registered owner, which is the Province
of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental, and that title to </span>the <span style="">lot in question was transferred to him by the
Province of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental upon payment of taxes

</span>Appellants further alleged that Lot No. 2636 in question had been </span>acquired
by their father, <span class="SpellE">Isidoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayeta</span>,
by homestead which was approved and patented on August 28, 1925 and was
inscribed in the registration book of the Register of Deeds for the Prov­ince

the application (homestead) and for a term of five (5) years from and after the
date of issuance of the patent or grant, lands ac­quired under free patent or
homestead cannot be subject to encumbrances or alienations nor shall they
become liable to the satisfaction of any debt contracted prior<span style=""> </span>to the expiration of said period,
plaintiff's contention under paragraph 7 of his complaint to the effect that
his ownership proceeded from a sale purportedly dating back to the year 1928,
is without legal basis and is unenforceable being contrary to law.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1965</st1:date>,
the lower court rendered judgment in favor <span style="">of </span>the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> and against
the defendants-appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to
the trial court, the question of ownership over the said property (Lot No.

Supreme Court in G. R. No. L-19249.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The

<p class="BODY">Thus, the lower court stated:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The question of ownership of this property, as indicated
above, at the time of the sale at public auction is the crux of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This question was ventilated in Civil Cases
Nos. 4666 and 5557 in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental which dismissed both and affirmed by the Supreme Court in G. R. No.
L-19249.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decisions in the two cases
were already final and an adjudication on the merits * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the complaint in Civil Case No. 5557 * *
*, the plaintiffs alleged ownership and prayed the Court to be declared as
such.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This case, having been disposed of
by a final decision, the issues involved there­in cannot be passed upon in the
present case as the same have already been barred by prior judg­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effect the defendants in said cases Nos.
4666 and 5557 were declared the owners of the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conclusion, therefore, is inesca­pable
and clear that as of <st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1963</st1:date>
(date of decision in G. R. No. L-19249), Fernando <span class="SpellE">Mapa</span>,
Jr. was declared the owner of the property and this decision retroacts as of
the date the same was sold by <span class="SpellE">Isidoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayeta</span> to <span class="SpellE">Mr</span> Roemer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, Mr. Fernando <span class="SpellE">Mapa</span>,
Jr. had the better right than the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Isidoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayeta</span> to repurchase the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The certificate of repurchase issued by the
Assistant Provincial Treasurer cannot affect or divest him of his right to
repurchase the pro­perty as it was done during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the <i>mandamus</i> case and after the notice of <span class="SpellE"><i>lis</i></span><i>
<span class="SpellE">pendens</span></i> was sent to the Register of Deeds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, Agustin <span class="SpellE">Bayeta</span>
cannot be considered as a buyer in good faith and for value.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"However, this Court is of the opinion and so holds that the
then Assistant Provincial Treasurer, Mr. A. S. <span class="SpellE">Narboneta</span>,
cannot be held guilty of bad faith as he acted upon the opinion of the
provincial fiscal and upon his honest belief that the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Isidoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayeta</span> were entitled to
re­purchase the property, considering that the ques­tion of ownership was
finally resolved only in 1963."<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Consequently, the lower court declared
the Certifi­cate of Repurchase, dated <st1:date year="1961" day="23" month="3">March
 23, 1961</st1:date>, in <span style="">favor of </span>Agustin
<span class="SpellE">Bayeta</span> and Transfer Certificate <span style="">of Title No. T-29483 in his name as null and

</span>Plaintiff, </span>however, was ordered to pay, by way of <span style="">reimbursement, Agustin <span class="SpellE">Bayeta</span>
the </span>sum <span style="">of P816.41, as well as
the </span>payments he made for taxes, both with interest at the <span style="">legal rate until the amounts were paid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Believing that the decision of, <span style="">the lower court </span>was contrary to law, the defendants appealed to
this Court, assigning the following errors, to wit:</p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">1. </span>We agree with
the lower court that the basic question is the ownership over Lot No. 2636
which cannot be litigated anew in this case, in view of the dismissal of the
complaint in Civil Case No. 4666 which, in <span class="SpellE"><i>Guanzon</i></span><i>,
et al. v. <span class="SpellE">Mapa</span>,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></i></span></a>
this Court declared to be a dismissal with prejudice and had the effect of an
adjudication of the case on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
this Court sustained the order of the trial court in Civil Case No 5557,
dismissing the complaint therein for the recovery of the ownership and
possession of Lot No. 2636, on the ground that <span style="">such action is already barred by the prior judgment of the Court in
Civil Case No. 4666.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We have examined the
answer of defendants-appellants in the case at bar (Civil Case No. 279 [6616])
and found that its special and affirmative defenses are substantially the same
as the allega</span>tions of the complaint filed by the same parties in the
prior case (Civil Case No. 5557).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
subject matter, the cause of action in the first and the special and
affirmative defenses in the case at bar, as well as the parties are <span style="">the </span>same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in both the complaint in Civil Case No.
5557 and in their answer in this case, the defendants-appellants pre­dicated
their right to recover the ownership and possession of Lot No. 2636 on the
alleged nullity of the conveyance made by <span class="SpellE">Isidoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayeta</span>, their predecessor-in-interest, in favor of Spouses
John <span style="">C. </span>Roemer and Julia Roemer
and, therefore plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> being the
successor-in-interest of the <span class="SpellE">Roemers</span> could not have
acquired any title over said property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In both pleadings, defendants-appellants claim that the sale is not
valid because it was made within the prohibited period of five (5) years pro­vided
by the Public Land Law.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
Since in <span class="SpellE"><i>Guanzon</i></span><i>, et </i><i><span style="">al. </span>v. <span class="SpellE">Mapa</span>,
supra</i>, this Court ruled that the action of the herein
defendants-appellants, who were then the plaintiffs-appellants in said Civil
Case No. 5557, to recover the ownership and possession of Lot No. 2636, is
barred by the prior and final judgment in Civil Case No. 4666, there is no
question now that their attempt to recover the ownership and possession of the
same property from plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is equally
barred under the principle of <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under
the doctrine of <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></i>,
an "adjudication is final and conclusive not only as to the matter
actually determined, but as to every other matter which the parties might have
litigated and have had decided as incident to <span style="">or </span>essentially connected with the subject matter of the
litigation, and every matter coming within the legitimate pur­view of the
original action, both in respect to matters of claim and of defense,"<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
It cannot be denied that the title and possession over the pro­perty was a
matter in issue in the previous case.</p>

<p class="BODY">By virtue of the previous judgment, the defen­dants-appellants
are now precluded not only from questioning in this action the validity of the
sale of Lot No. 2636 from <span class="SpellE">Isidoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayeta</span>
to the Roemer spouses but also the right of ownership and possess­ion of
plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> over the said property.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. But Agustin <span class="SpellE">Bayeta</span>, one of the
defendants-appellants, insists that when the Province of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental acquired the property on December 28, 1956 at the tax auction sale,
a certificate of title was issued to the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
province "free from all liens and encumbrances", subject only to two
(2) years period of redemption in accordance with the assessment law, and,
therefore, when he purchased the lot in question from the Province of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental and said sale was registered with the
Register of Deeds of said province and Transfer Certificate of Title No.
T-29483 issued to him, he was a purchaser in good faith and for value and
entitled to the ownership and possession of the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He argues that it is the act of registration
that operates to convey or affect this registered property.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be remembered, however, that when Agustin <span class="SpellE">Bayeta</span> repurchased the property from the provincial
government of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental on March <span style="">23, 1961, the action of Agustin </span><span class="SpellE">Bayeta</span> and his co?<span style="">heirs to recover the ownership and possession of the same property from
Fernando <span class="SpellE">Mapa</span>, Jr. </span><span style="">in Civil Case No. </span><span style="">5557

must be noted also that plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> and his

land since 1928 until 1958 under claim of ownership adverse to all others,
without defendants, appellants or their predecessors questioning the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> adverse possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result of their inaction, the property

no title to registered land in derogation to that of the registered owner shall
be acquired by prescription or adverse possession, this legal guarantee may in
