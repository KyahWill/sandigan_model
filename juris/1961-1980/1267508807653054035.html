				<BR><BR><div align=""><div class="Section1"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"></span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On November 3, 1958, workers in 
the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> Bicycle Manufacturing Co., Inc. formed the 
<span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> Bicycle Employees and Workers Union (VIBEMWU). 
Pedro Evangelista was its president. On November 14, 1958, VIBEMWU and the 
company signed a collective bargaining agreement. Among other things it provided 
for union <span class="GramE">security,</span> check off, wage increases, fifteen 
days vacation leave and fifteen days sick leave.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On February 21, 3959, Pedro 
Evangelista was again elected president, for 1959. <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Rodiel</span> was elected 
board member. For the year 1960 VIBEMWU, on December 12, 1959, re-elected Pedro 
Evangelista president and elected <span class="SpellE">Fulgencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Besana</span> and <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Rodiel</span>, vice-president and secretary, 
respectively.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On February 27<span class="GramE">,1960</span>, through its executive board headed by <span class="SpellE">Besana</span>, acting as president, VIBEMWU affiliated with the 
National Labor Union (NLU). Subsequently, on March 4, 1960, the Constitution and 
By-laws of VIBEMWU were amended. On March 9, 1960, another election was held and 
<span class="SpellE">Besana</span> was chosen president thereby replacing 
Evangelista.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On March 17, I960, the national 
secretary of NLU, by a letter, informed the company of <span class="SpellE">VIBEMWU's</span> affiliation to NLU, and demanded enforcement of 
the collective bar- gaining agreement. The company, however, did not accede to 
the demand. Consequently, on April 5, 1960, VIBEMWU filed a notice to 
strike.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Department of Labor's 
Conciliation Service held several hearings on the union's demands and strike 
notice, but the company still refused.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On April 25, 1960, the company 
dismissed <span class="SpellE">Besana</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rodiel</span> 
after they figured, on the same day, in a fight with two other employees, within 
the premises and during working hours. Alleging unfair labor practice, NLU, on 
behalf of VIBEMWU, as well as of <span class="SpellE">Besana</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rodiel</span>, filed on May 6, 1960 a complaint against the company 
in the Court of Industrial Relations. The company answered it on May 23, 1960. 
It stated that the dismissal of <span class="SpellE">Besana</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rodiel</span> was due to violation of a company rule that penalizes 
"Inciting or provoking a fight or fighting during working hours or on company 
premises."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The presiding Judge of the Court 
of Industrial Relations, after trying the case, rendered a decision on March 3, 
1962 in favor of the complainant union. An unfair labor practice, according to 
said decision, was committed by the company in dismissing <span class="SpellE">Besana</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rodiel</span> due to their 
union activities. The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion 
reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"This Court finds substantial 
evidence to sustain the charge against respondent Company in violation of 
Section 4 (a), paragraphs 1 and 4 of the Industrial Peace Act, and, therefore, 
orders respondent Company, its official and/or agents to:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"(1) Cease and desist from

1960, up to the time of their actual reinstatements and with the rights and 
privileges formerly appertaining thereto, including 
seniority;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"To facilitate the proper payment 
of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> due them, the Chief of the Examining 
Division of this Court and/or his duly designated assistant is hereby directed 
to examine the payrolls daily time records and other pertinent documents 
relative to complainants <span class="SpellE">Besana's</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rodiel's</span> services with respondent Company, and to submit a 
corresponding report for further disposition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"So 
ordered."</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After receipt of copy of the 
decision on March 13, 1962, the company filed on March 15, 1962 a motion for 
reconsideration. It contained no argument but reserved the "right" to file 
supporting memorandum within ten days from March 18, 1962. A motion, however, 
was filed on March 27, 1962, requesting for 15-day extension of time to file the 
memorandum.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Adhering to a "no-extension‚Äù 
policy thereon, the Court of Industrial Relations <i>en banc</i> denied, on 
March 28, 1962 the aforesaid motion for extension to file 
memorandum<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Accordingly, on April 6, 1962, it 
further denied the motion for reconsideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Following its receipt on 
</span><st1:date month="7" day="6" year="1962"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 6, 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> of 
the last resolution, the company filed this petition for review on 
</span><st1:date month="7" day="16" year="1962"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 16<span class="GramE">,1962</span></span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner has raised two issues: 
First, did the Court of Industrial Relations abuse its discretion in denying the 
motion for extension of time to file memorandum in support of the motion for 
reconsideration? Second, did the company's dismissal of <span class="SpellE">Besana</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rodiel</span> constitute 
unfair labor practice?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The first issue has already been 
settled. The denial by the Court of Industrial Relations of a motion to extend 
the 10-day period to file arguments in support of a motion for reconsideration, 
pursuant to its standing rule against such extension, does not constitute abuse 
of discretion.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style11"><sup>[1]</sup></span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Regarding the second issue, the 
record shows that on April 25, 1960, <span class="SpellE">Besana</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rodiel</span> were provoked by <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> 
Reyes and Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Pacia</span> into a pre-arranged fight 
pursuant to a strategy of the company designed to provide an apparently lawful 
cause for their dismissal. Reyes and <span class="SpellE">Pacia</span> were hired 
only within that week<span class="GramE">.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style11"><sup>[</sup></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style11"><sup>2]</sup></span> 
<span class="SpellE">Besana</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rodiel</span> were not 
shown to have previously figured in similar incidents before or to have violated 
company rules and regulations in their many years with the company.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style11"><sup>[3]</sup></span> The company did not investigate the 
incident, and its manager, Co <span class="SpellE">Hing</span>, admitted that 
<span class="SpellE">Besana</span> was dismissed because he was a "hard-headed 
leader of the union". It was this manager who had warned <span class="SpellE">VIBEMWU's</span> officers responsible for the affiliation that if 
they will not withdraw VIBEMWU from the NLU, he would "take steps in order to 
dismiss them from work".<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The findings of the Court of 
Industrial Relations to the foregoing effect are supported by substantial 
evidence. No reason obtains to alter the conclusion that <span class="SpellE">Besana</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rodiel</span> were in reality 
dismissed because of their union activities and not because of their violation 
of a company rule against fight in the premises or during working hours. 
Furthermore, the so-called violation of company rules having been brought about 
by the company itself, thru the recent employment of <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> Reyes and Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Pacia</span> who provoked the fight as above indicated, the same 
cannot be regarded as a ground to punish the aforementioned 
employees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Such being the case, the 
dismissal of <span class="SpellE">Besana</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rodiel</span> constituted unfair labor practice under Section 4 (a) 
(1) and (4) of Republic Act 873:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

*"<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Rothenberg has this to 
say:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">* * * If it can he established 
that the true and basic inspiration for the employer's act is derived from the 
employee's union affiliations or activities, the assignment by the employer of 
another reason, whatever its semblance or validity, is unavailing. Thus, it has 
been held that the facts disclosed that the employer's acts in discharging 
employees were actually prompted by the employer's improper interest in the 
affected employee's union affiliations and activities, even though the employer 
urged that his acts were predicated on economic necessity, desire to give 
employment to more needy persons, lack of work, cessation of operations, refusal 
to work overtime, refusal of non-union employees to work with union employees, 
seasonal lay-off, libelous remarks against management, <i>violation of company 
rules</i> (Rothenberg on Labor Relations, pp. 400-401; italics 
supplied.)<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Since the only reason or basis 
for <span class="SpellE">Besana</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rodiel's</span> 
dismissal was in fact their actuation as officers of VIBEMWU, the dismissal is 
clearly discriminatory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is this inconsiderate act of 
power that makes a subordinate a rebel; it is this malicious tactic that forces 
labor to dislike management; this unjustifiable conduct that creates a gap 
between management and labor; and this attitude that makes the laborer hate the 
officials of the company to the detriment of all efforts to harmonize management 
and labor for the benefit of both as envisioned by the Industrial Peace Act. So 
plain from the record is the bad faith that attended the company's deliberate 
and calculated act of unfair labor practice that we find in the present appeal 
an obvious attempt to delay and carry on a pretense which this Court can ill 
afford to let go without stern disapproval.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
