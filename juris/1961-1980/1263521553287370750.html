				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition <u>in</u> <u>forma</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>pauperis</u></span> questioning the jurisdiction of the
Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
in an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case against petitioners, which case
was subsequently appealed to the Court of First Instance, where it was shown
that another case had been filed ahead in the Court of Agrarian Rela­tions
wherein petitioners asked that they be declared the lawful tenants of the
disputed landholding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon motion of
petitioners, alleging that private respondent had moved in the Court of First
Instance for the execution of its decision affirming an order of the Municipal
Court which found them guilty of contempt of court and ordering them to vacate
the landholding in question, We ordered the issuance of a writ of preliminary
injunction upon the filing of a bond in the sum of P200.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">The said landholding consists of two hectares, more or less,
included in a larger tract owned by <span class="SpellE">Felizardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Lipana</span> and tenanted by <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span>
Marcelo until his death on <st1:date year="1962" day="3" month="12">December 3,
 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two cases involving
the land were pend­ing in the Court of Agrarian Relations at the time of his
death, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>CAR Case No. 750-Bulacan
'62, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> Marcelo vs. <span class="SpellE">Felizardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Lipana</span>"; and CAR
Case No. 827-Bulacan ‘62, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Felizardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Lipana</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> Marcelo."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
In both cases the deceased was subsequently substituted by <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span>
Marcelo and <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabol</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> Marcelo, surviving son and
wife, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A third case - CAR
Case No. 895 - was filed on December 20, 1962 by <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span>
Marcelo against <span class="SpellE">Felizardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Lipana</span>
and Magdalena <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz (the latter having been the
alleged common-law wife of <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> Marcelo), praying
that he, <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span>, be de­clared as entitled to succeed
to the tenancy right and status of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the allegations of <span class="SpellE">Lipana</span>
in his answer to the complaint was that he "signified his intention to
recognize as his tenant <st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place> <span class="SpellE">dela</span>
Cruz, who is the widow of <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> Marcelo." This
is an admission that as far as <span class="SpellE">Lipana</span> was concerned
it was <st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place> who had the right to succeed the
deceased <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> as tenant.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1963</st1:date>,
acting on a motion of <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> Marcelo to enjoin <st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place>
<span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz from interfering with his peaceful
cultivation of the landholding, as well as on an urgent motion of <span class="SpellE">Felizardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Lipana</span> for leave to
cultivate the same land, the CAR issued the following order:</p>

<blockquote>"For this Court to be able to resolve the above prayer and
motion intelligently and <span class="GramE">judiciously,</span> there is
necessity for formal hearing to determine the following questions of fact:</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(1)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Since the demise of the former tenant, <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> Marcelo, who has been and is in actual possession
and cultivation of the holding in question?</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(2)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Did the deceased voluntarily surrender the
holding to respondent in November 1962?</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(3)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Is <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> Marcelo the
natural son of the late <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> Marcelo?</blockquote>

<blockquote>It appears, however, that these are the factual issues directly
involved in CAR Case No. 895-Bulacan '62 where petitioner therein has already
presented three (3) witnesses and several exhibits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents have not yet presented any
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cause of action indicated,
therefore, is for this Court to withhold action on <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span>
Marcelo's prayer for interlocutory order and <span class="SpellE">Felizardo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lipana's</span> urgent motion for leave to cultivate the
holding.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the meanwhile, to forestall any untoward incidents and in order
not to disturb the productivity of the land, this Court shall undertake the
cultivation thereof by admin­istration through an impartial third-party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the parties in the above-entitled cases
shall be restricted from doing any act of cultivation or planting on the land
and reap­ing, harvesting or threshing of crops thereon.</blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> Marcelo, <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabol</span> de Marcelo,
Magdalena <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Felizardo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lipana</span> and/or their agents are directed to desist
from performing any act of cultivation or planting on the landholding formerly
tenanted by <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> Marcelo at <span class="SpellE">Lalangan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, with a
seedling capacity of 30 <span class="SpellE">gantas</span> of <span class="SpellE">palay</span>,
or from reaping, harvesting or thresh­ing any crops thereon until further
orders from this court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Pursuant to:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 9, Rep.
Act No. 1267, as amended, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> <span class="SpellE">Madronio</span>, Agricultural Extension Officer, Bureau of
Agricultural Extension, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, is hereby directed
to repair to the landholding in question, take possession of the same and
undertake the cultivation thereof and/or planting thereon according to his best
judgment and to proven farm practices.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the hiring of laborers for the purpose of complying with this Order
is called for, the afore-named Agricultural Extension Officer shall give
preference of employment to <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> Marcelo and
Magdalena <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz at the prevailing wage for
agricultural laborers in the locality but in no case shall the wage be less
than P2.50 per day, with no allowance for board and lodging."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, a compromise agreement in the three CAR cases was
entered into by <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> Marcelo and <span class="SpellE">Felizardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Lipana</span>, wherein the
former surrendered all his rights over the landholding in favor of the
latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A judgment in accordance with
the terms and conditions of said compro­mise was thereupon rendered by the
trial Judge on <st1:date year="1964" day="5" month="11">Novem­ber 5, 1964</st1:date>,
declaring that CAR Cases Nos. 750, 895 and 827 were deemed closed and
terminated as between <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> Marcelo and <span class="SpellE">Felizardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Lipana</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="1">January 27, 1965</st1:date>
the CAR ordered the issuance of a writ of execution in the three cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same date another order was issued,
discharging the administration of the landholding by the Agricultural Extension
Officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February 5, 1965 the
corresponding writ of execution was issued, commanding the provincial sheriff
of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> to place <span class="SpellE">Felizardo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lipana</span> in possession; and on the following February
25 the provincial sheriff sub­mitted to the court his return of service.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 15, 1965 Magdalena <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz
filed a complaint against <span class="SpellE">Lipana</span> (Case No. 1221),
asking the CAR to declare her the lawful tenant of the landholding, to fix the
annual rentals thereof during the past three years and to award damages in her
favor by way of attorney's fees and consequential expenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In her complaint she alleged that <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> Marcelo, the former tenant, surrendered the
landholding to <span class="SpellE">Lipana</span> on November 21, 1962, whereupon
she succeeded as such tenant upon agreement with the latter; that on November
13, 1964 the CAR issued an order stating that the dismissal of CAR Case No. 895
was without preju­dice to her right to file an independent action to assert her
claim against <span class="SpellE">Lipana</span>, her co-defendant therein; that
together with her husband<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
she continued to work on the land during the agricultural year 1964-65, but
that after they had plowed the land in preparation for the agricul­tural year
1965-66 defendant's henchmen created some dis­turbance at the place for the
purpose of ejecting her forcibly <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff was allowed to litigate as pauper,
and notice of the filing of the complaint was served upon <span class="SpellE">Lipana</span>
on <st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 29, 1965 <span class="SpellE">Lipana</span> in turn went to
the Muni­cipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>
on an action for "<span class="SpellE">Eject­ment</span> and Forcible
Entry" (Civil Case No. 235), with a prayer for the issuance of a writ of
preliminary injunction against Magdalena <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz
and her husband Lorenzo Ignacio, alleging that he, <span class="SpellE">Lipana</span>,
had been placed in possession of the landholding by the provincial sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> by virtue of the order of the CAR dated January 27,
1965 in CAR Cases Nos. 750, 827 and 895.</p>

<p class="BODY"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants filed their answer with counterclaim on <st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1965</st1:date>, denying the
substantial averments of the complaint and alleging as affirmative defense the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of CAR Case No. 1221.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their counterclaim for damages, defendants
alleged that <st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place> <span class="SpellE">dela</span>
Cruz was the tenant of <span class="SpellE">Felizardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Lipana</span>
but that the latter wanted to eject her because she married her co-defendant
Lorenzo Ignacio, who was a member of a farmers' organization in the locality.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1965</st1:date>
the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> ordered defendants,
pending the hearing of the case on the merits, to desist from plowing,
harrowing, and/or planting the land in question upon the filing by plain­tiff
of a bond of P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="7" month="10">October 7, 1965</st1:date>
plaintiff filed a motion to declare defendants in contempt of court for having
plowed, harrowed and planted the land in question in spite of the existence of
the injunctive order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their
opposition dated <st1:date year="1965" day="18" month="10">October 18, 1965</st1:date>
defendants pointed out that they did so as tenants of the land subject of CAR
Case No. 1221 and that if they observed the injunctive order of the Mu­nicipal
Court they would in effect be violating their rights and obligations in said
CAR case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1965</st1:date>
the Municipal Court found defen­dants guilty of contempt and sentenced them to
pay a fine of P50.00 each or suffer imprisonment for ten days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This order was appealed by defendants, <u>in</u>
<u>forma</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>pauperis</u></span>, to the Court of First
Instance, where the case was docketed as Civil Case No. 3280-M.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1966</st1:date>
a decision in Civil Case No. 235 was rendered by the Municipal Court, ordering
defendants to vacate the land and to remove their house <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This decision was likewise appealed to the
Court of First In­stance, where the case was docketed as Civil Case No.
3363-M.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, defendants were allowed
to appeal as pau­pers.</p>

<p class="BODY">In due time the trial in CAR Case No. 1221 was terminated and the
trial Judge, in an order dated Septem­ber 13, 1966, gave both parties fifteen
days from notice that the stenographic notes had been transcribed within which
to submit their memoranda, after which period the case would be deemed
submitted for decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The CAR,
however, held its decision in abeyance for the reason that "it is
powerless to modify or set aside the decision rendered by the Municipal Court
in Civil Case No. 235, now on appeal with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">In Civil Cases Nos. 3280-M and 3363-M before the Court of First
Instance, defendants (petitioners herein), in a motion dated April 28, 1967,
asked for the postpone­ment of the hearing scheduled on May 2, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court denied the motion on <st1:date year="1967" day="2" month="5">May 2, 1967</st1:date> and allowed plaintiff to
present his evidence <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> before
the Deputy Clerk of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1967</st1:date>
defendants filed a motion for recon­sideration, pleading that the evidence
presented by plain­tiff be disregarded and the hearing of the case reset for
another date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was also
denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="7">July 27, 1967</st1:date>
the Court of First Instance rendered judgment in Civil Cases Nos. 3280-M and
3363-M, which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Wherefore, judgment is hereby rendered:</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->With respect to Civil Case No. 3280, finding the
defendants guilty of contempt of court and sentencing them each to pay a fine
in the sum of P50.00 or to suffer an imprisonment of 10 days;</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->With respect to Civil Case No. 3363, ordering
the defendants and/or anybody acting under them, to vacate the premises in
question and remove their house <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> within 30
days from notice hereof."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The facts show clearly that these cases proceed from and involve
essentially a tenancy dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before
Civil Case No. 235 was filed in the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span>,
three cases involving the same landholding had already been filed with the
Court of Agrarian Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue
as to who had been in actual possession of the land since the death of the
tenant <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> Marcelo was before the CAR in Case No.
895, a suit brought by <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> Marcelo against <span class="SpellE">Lipana</span> and Magdalena <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz,
wherein he sought to be declared as the tenant by right of succes­sion to <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> Marcelo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
case, however, was dismissed together with CAR Cases Nos. 725 and 827
originally brought by <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> Marcelo, without the
issue of actual possession having been resolved, by virtue of the compromise
agreement entered into between <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lipana</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place>
<span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz thereafter filed her complaint - CAR Case
No. 1221 - to have herself declared the lawful tenant of the landholding.</p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that the jurisdiction of the court in a suit for
<span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> or forcible entry is determined by the
allegations in the complaint, yet where tenancy is averred as a defense and,
upon hearing, is shown to be the real issue, the court should dismiss the case
for want of jurisdiction.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The decision of the CAR, it should be remembered, was rendered upon a
compromise agreement between <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> Marcelo and <span class="SpellE">Felizardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Lipana</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right of <st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place>
<span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, who was a co-defendant in CAR Case No.
895, was not touched upon in said agreement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There the decision simply stated that CAR Cases Nos. 750, 827 and 895
were "deemed closed and terminated as between <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span>
Marcelo and <span class="SpellE">Felizardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Lipana</span>;"
and the writ of execution was limited to "placing Mr. <span class="SpellE">Felizardo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lipana</span> immediately in possession of the landholding
formerly cultivated by <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> Marcelo or any person,
agent, and/or representative acting in behalf of <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span>
Marcelo."</p>

<p class="BODY">It was therefore incorrect for respondent court to conclude from
the decision and writ of execution in the CAR cases that <span class="SpellE">Lipana</span>
had actual possession, as against <st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, over the landholding prior to the alleged
unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> and/or forcible entry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While both <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span>
and <st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place> asserted the right to succeed to the
tenancy of the same landholding after the death of <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span>
Marcelo, the CAR did not adjudicate that right to either of them nor did it
resolve the question as to who had actual possession of the landholding after
the death of <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What it did, in order to prevent further trouble between <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> and <st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place> was to place
the land­holding under the administration of the Agricultural Ex­tension
Officer, with instruction that <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> and <st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place>
should be given preference in working on the land as laborers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The allegations in the complaint in CAR Case
No. 1221 reveal that they worked on different portions of the land in
accordance with the <span class="SpellE">CAR's</span> order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was how things stood when <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> entered into a compromise agreement with <span class="SpellE">Lipana</span> surrendering his rights over the landholding in
favor of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For all intents and
purposes, there­fore, the decision and writ of execution affected only the
claim of <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> Marcelo as tenant and his actual
posses­sion of the portion of the land on which he was working by virtue of the
provisional arrangement ordered by the CAR.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since the tenancy dispute remained unresolved with respect to <st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place>
<span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz and was actually the subject of litigation
in CAR Case No. 1221, the filing of the <span class="SpellE">eject­ment</span>
case was an intrusion upon the jurisdiction of said court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the writ prayed for is granted and the decision
of respondent court in Civil Cases Nos. 3280-M and 3363-M is set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
