				<H3>INTESTATE ESTATE OF THE LATE DON GIL MONTILLA. MERCEDES MONTILLA, ADMINISTRATRIX AND APPELLEE, VS. GERTRUDES MONTILLA INTERVENOR AND APPELLANT.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>DE LEON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On January 24, 1947, Gil Montilla, Jr. filed with the Court of First Instance 
of Negros Occidental a petition for the appointment of his mother, Doña Mercedes 
Montilla, as judicial administratrix of the estate left by his father, Gil 
Montilla, who died on July 20, 1946 . The petition alleged that at the time of 
his death the deceased had real and personal properties with an estimated value 
of P30,000 and the following heirs: his child by the first marriage, Enriqueta 
Montilla de Esteban; his children by the second marriage, Gil Montilla, Jr., 
Jacinto Montilla, Jayme Montilla, Mercedes Montilla de Alvarez, Cesar Montilla, 
and Aida Montilla; and his surviving spouse Doña Mercedes Montilla.
<p>No opposition having been registered to the petition, an order for letters of 
administration in favor of the surviving spouse was issued by the court on 
February 21, 1947 . Eight years later, however, or on March 18, 1955 , one 
Gertrudes Montilla filed a motion asking leave to intervene in the intestate 
proceedings. The motion was accompanied by a petition in intervention, alleging 
that the said Gertrudes Montilla is an acknowledged natural child of the late 
Don Gil Montilla and thus entitled as forced heir to inherit part of the 
properties left by the deceased.</p>
<p>Acting on the motion to intervene, the lower court, on December 15, 1956 , 
ordered the setting of a date for the reception of evidence on the petition in 
intervention. Upon the joining of the issues, the case was duly heard and the 
intervenor was allowed to present evidence to prove that she is, as she claims, 
an acknowledged natural child of the deceased. After hearing, the court, 
applying the provisions of the old Civil Code on the matter, and declaring that 
the evidence adduced by the intervenor is not sufficient to entitle her to be 
declared an acknowledged natural child of the deceased, issued an order denying 
the the petition. From the order of denial, the intervenor has appealed directly 
to Us raising only questions of law.</p>
<p>The pivotal issue is as to what law should be made to apply to the 
appellant's petition in intervention.</p>
<p>There is a transitional provision in our new Civil Code (Article 2263) which 
provides that the "rights to the inheritance of a person who died, with or 
without will, before the effectivity of this Code, shall be governed by the 
Civil Code of 1889, by other previous laws, and by the Rules of Court. 
Accordingly, since it appears that Gil Montilla, whose estate is now subject of 
intestate proceedings, died on July 20, 1946 , long before August 30, 1950 , 
when the new Civil Code took effect (See Lara <em>vs</em>. del Rosario, 94 
Phil., 778; 50 Off. Gaz., 1975; Velayo <em>vs</em>. Shell Co. P.I. Ltd., 100 
Phil., 186; 54 Off. Gaz., 63; Estayo <em>vs</em>. de Guzman, 104 Phil., 1038; 55 
Off. Gaz., [36] 7653; and Laperal, et al. <em>vs</em>. Katigbak, et al., 104 
Phil., 999) the old Code must be made to apply to the instant case. And the 
provisions thereof which are determinative of the issues raised in this appeal 
are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ART. 129. A natural child may be acknowledged by the father and mother 
jointly or by either of them alone."</p>
<p>"ART. 131. An acknowledgment of a natural child must be made to the record of 
birth, in a will, or in some other public document."</p></blockquote>
<p>In the application of the above articles to the case at bar, an examination 
of the evidence adduced by the intervenor-appellant, in her attempt to qualify 
as one of the heirs of the deceased is necessary. This will require, for our 
purposes, a piece-by-piece description of the exhibits introduced during the 
hearing, to wit:</p>
<p>Exhibit "A" appears to be an entry in the marriage book of the parish priest 
of Isabela, Negros Occidental, reciting that Gertrudes Montilla, daughter of Gil 
Montilla and Ines Serrano, was married to Horacio L. Ramos on June 23, 1933;</p>
<p>Exhibit "B" appears to be a will of the deceased Petronila Montilla, sister 
of Gil Montilla in which (par. 9, Exh. "B-1") the said Gertrudes is referred to 
as the daughter of Gil Montilla;</p>
<p>Exhibit "C" is purportedly a letter of Gil Montilla dated September 19, 1933 
and addressed to "Horacio and Gertrudes" containing the complimentary ending 
"Vuestro Padre"; and</p>
<p>Exhibit "D" is supposed to be another letter of Gil Montilla dated May 
14,1942 containing the salutation "Querida Gertrudes" and the complimentary 
ending "Tu padre".</p>
<p>It is quite apparent that Exhibits "A" "C" and "D" are mere private writings 
and not one of them is a record of birth, a will, or a public document. They 
are, therefore, not the evidence of acknowledgment recognized in Article [3] of 
the old Civil Code.</p>
<p>While, admittedly, Exhibit "B" is a will, it is not that of the deceased Gil 
Montilla and cannot be considered evidence of acknowledgment for, according to 
the aforequoted Article 129, it is only the parents, jointly or separately, who 
can recognize a natural child as their own. In the case of Canales <em>vs</em>. 
Arrogante, et al. (91 Phil., 6), it has been held that a statement as to 
paternity is insufficient, if made without the intervention of the alleged 
parents and still in another case (Pareja <em>vs</em>. Pareja, et al., 95 Phil., 
167), the doctrine was emphasized that under the old Civil Code, recognition 
must be precise, express and solemn.</p>
<p>The intervenor-appellant, in claiming that the provisions of the new Civil 
Code, where the old Code's rigid rules on recognition or acknowledgment of 
natural children seem to have been relaxed are applicable to her case, relies 
upon the portion of Article 2253 of the new Code, which states that "* * * if a 
right should be declared for the first time in this Code, it shall be effective 
at once, even though the act or event which gives rise thereto may have been 
done or may have occurred under the prior legislation * * *" There is nothing to 
this citation. Acknowledgment or recognition of a natural child is not a new 
right declared for the first time in the new Civil Code, and this very article 
cited provides also that "the Civil Code of 1889 shall govern rights originating 
from said Code even though the new Civil Code may regulate it in a different 
manner." Furthermore, as correctly stated by the learned trial judge, the 
intervenor-appellant cannot invoke in her favor Article 2253 of the new Code, 
which is concerned with nights, in general, because Article 2263, which we have 
heretofore discussed, is a particular provision specially designed for cases 
like the one at bar and which should, therefore, prevail over the general 
transitional provisions.</p>
<p>Premises considered, the order appealed from should be, as it is hereby, 
affirmed in all respects, at appellant's costs,</p><em>Padilla, Labrador, 
Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes, Dizon,</em> and <em>Natividad, 
JJ.,</em> concur.</div>
