the plaintiffs prayed for P100,000.00 by way of damages, both material and 
moral, and costs. 

<p>Defendant Madrigal and Company on May 9, 1953, moved to Dismiss the complaint 
on three (3) grounds, to wit—</p>
<p>(1) Allegations inherently sufficient to constitute cause of action against 
the defendant Madrigal Company, Inc.; </p>
<p>(2) Lack of jurisdiction of the trial court over the claim of the nineteen 
(19) plaintiffs whose claims do not exceed two thousand (P2,000.00) pesos; </p>
<p>(3) Prescription of action.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs presented an opposition to the above motion to dismiss and said 
motion was denied on May 30, 1953. A motion for reconsideration filed on July 3, 
1953 was denied on July 15, 1953, and on August 4, 1953, defendant answered the 
complaint. Several pleadings were subsequently presented to the Court by the 
parties. Defendant filed no less than four (4) more Motions to Dismiss, on 
various and several grounds, alleged in the first motion and the additional 
ground of non-liability for being not the proper party. Trial was had and the 
parties presented their evidence, both testimonial and documentary after the 
reception and consideration of which the lower court rendered judgment, the 
pertinent portions of which read— </p>
<p>
</p><center>* * * * * * * </center>

<blockquote>
<p>"Pursuant to the evidence of the plaintiffs and not denied by the defendant, 
all of the foregoing plaintiffs that composed the crew of the vessels had signed 
'shipping articles' before their departure for Hongkong in November, 1941. These 
'shipping articles' by law and by custom constituted the employment contracts of 
the individual seaman with employer. They contained the terms and conditions 
agreed upon between them. These 'Shipping Articles' were not produced and 
presented in the evidence by the plaintiffs claiming that they had been 
destroyed or lost, by the war. For non-presentation of these important 
documents, this Court is at a loss to determine the terms and conditions and who 
were the parties with certainty who had signed said maritime agreements. * * * 
</p>
<p>
</p><center>* * * * * * *</center>

<p>It is to be noted in this connection that from the outset, defendant had 
consistently pleaded for the outright dismissal of this case with respect to 
plaintiffs Salvador Miranda, Florentino Domactoy, Hermogenes Camacho, Amado 
Villanueva, Maralitico Palomata, Juan Tupas, Pedro Bugallon, Gerardo Gaboy, 
Carmelo Alalin, Alfonso Pavila, Juan Mutia, Matias Marabe, Simon Largo, Epifanio 
Dumangas, Meliton Orias, Espiridion Cajilig, Ricardo Pador, Jose Monsalle, 
Apolonio Ondoy, for their claims for wages were only P2,000.00 and less than 
that amount on the ground of lack of jurisdiction on the part of this Court 
following the provisions of our present Judiciary Act, and the Honorable Judge 
Demetrio Encarnacion and subsequent rulings of this Court had denied the pleas 
of the defendant believing that their claim were based on a single written 
contract of 'shipping articles'. After the complete presentation of the evidence 
of the plaintiffs, it became evident that each seaman before the start of the 
voyage had individually signed with alleged defendant the said contract of 
'shipping articles'. </p>
<p>
</p><center>* * * * * * * </center>

<p>So, it is clear that each seaman has an individual cause of action pursuant 
to his individual 'shipping articles' that he and defendant had executed. Such 
being the case, the demands for payment of wages by the preceding plaintiffs 
should have been filed before the Municipal Court of Manila or before any 
justice of the peace who has jurisdiction to try and sentence the defendant and 
not before this Court which has no jurisdiction, based on the amounts claimed. 
Consequently, this Court dismisses this case with respect to the above-mentioned 
plaintiffs for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action. </p>
<p>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, the Court is of the opinion and so 
holds that this complaint, should be, as it is hereby, dismissed for lack of 
merits with costs against the plaintiffs."</p></blockquote>
<p>On May 31, 1958, plaintiffs presented a pleading styled "Motion for 
Reconsideration and Alternative Motion for New Trial," which was opposed by 
defendant and denied on September 6, 1958. Only the plaintiffs appealed directly 
to this Court, and in their appeal they contend that the lower court erred: </p>
<ol><li>In finding, contrary to the evidence, that Madrigal &amp; Company was not 
the one that employed plaintiffs to man its vessels 'Argus', 'Hirondelle' and 
'Churruca' for the voyage to Hongkong for dry-docking and repairs; <br><br>
</li><li>In holding that defendant-appellee did not waive its defense of 
non-liability or was not estopped from denying its liability by its admission in 
its motions to Dismiss and Answer of the existence of employer-employee 
relationship; <br><br>
</li><li>In holding that, even admitting defendant-appellee employed the 
plaintiffs-appellants as crew of its vessels to undertake the voyage to Hongkong 
for Dry-docking and repairs, its obligation to pay them their wages for the 
voyage was extinguished by the occurence of war; and <br><br>
</li><li>In holding that it has no jurisdiction over the claims of 
plaintiffs-appellants amounting to less than two thousand pesos, when the 
plaintiffs-appellants collectively signed only one shipping articles for each 
vessel. </li></ol>
<p>In view of the fact that the trial court made a sweeping dismissal of the 
entire complaint ov action, on the ground of jurisdiction, it seems pertinent 
that one group of the plaintiffs-claimants should be given a separate 
consideration from the other. From the factual findings recited in the decision, 
which We are not authorized to review, because the case was appealed to Us 
directly, on questions of law (the appellant is deemed to have waived the 
questions of facts involved), it would seem that the trial court was correct in 
dismissing the case with respect to the plaintiffs whose claims did not exceed 
P2,000.00, exclusive of interest and costs, but not Mauricio Mirano (Chief 
Engineer), whose claim is P15,615.00. The case of those plaintiffs having claims 
not exceeding P5,000.00 should also be dismissed, in view of the amendment of 
the Judicial Act of 1948 (sec. 88, Judiciary Act of 1948, as amended by Rep. Act 
No. 2613, Aug. 1, 1959). It was found by the court that each seaman signed with 
the defendant a contract, or shipping article; each had an individual cause of 
action, and had to collect different amounts separately owned by them, depending 
upon the period and length of service of each, and the way each had complied 
with the terms and conditions of the shipping article and that the plaintiffs 
were not all employed in one vessel but in three (3) separate vessels. This 
being the case, as it is the case, their claims are not of joint nature, and 
each separate claim furnishes the jurisdictional test. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The point wherein the parties are not in agreement is whether the claim of 
each plaintiff or the aggregate claims of all 18 the measure of jurisdiction. 
This question has been the subject of decisions by American Courts, In Hackner 
<i>vs.</i> Guaranty Trust Co. of New York, 4 Fed. Rules, Serv. 278, W. S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, Jan. 13, 1941; 117 F. (2nd) 95, it was 
held that, 'When two or more plaintiffs, each having a separate and distinct 
demand, join an a single suit, the demand of each must be of the requisite 
jurisdictional amount. Aggregation of the claims to make up the jurisdictional 
amount is permitted only if the claims are of joint nature, as * * *. As 
American Jurisprudence, Vol. 14, p. 413, puts it, 'Where several claims have 
separate and distinct demands against a defendant or defendants, which may 
properly be joined in a single suit, the claims can not be added together to 
make up the required jurisdictional amount; each separate claim furnishes the 
jurisdictional test." </p>
<p>
</p><center>* * * * * * *</center>

<p>'* * * In other words, the court takes into account what one party would 
recover and not what is adjudged to all the parties or some of them. </p>
<p>It is in effect argued that plaintiff's could, through collusion, shift the 
court's jurisdiction if individmial demands rather than their aggregate were 
used as the criterion. It is the other way around; it is the adoption of the 
opposite theory, as we see it, which would open the door to manipulation. 
Several plaintiffs wishing to avoid trial in the justice of the peace court 
could combine their demands in one complaint so as to put the action beyond the 
jurisdiction of the inferior court." (A. Soriano y. Cia <i>vs.</i> Jose, et al., 
86 Phil., 523; 47 Off. Gaz. 12 Supp. p. 156). </p>
<p>"While some doubt had arisen in the past as to whether the jurisdiction of a 
court depends, in cases where claims or causes of action between the same 
parties are embodied in a single com plaint, on the amount of each single, claim 
or upon the totality of the demand in all the causes of action, we have finally 
held in the eases of Soriano <i>vs.</i> Omila, 97 Phil., .62; 51 Off. Gaz., No. 
7, p. 3465, and Campos Rueda Corporation <i>vs.</i> Sta. Cruz Lumber Co., Inc. 
98 Phil., 627; 52 Off. Gaz. No. 3, p. 1387, that the jurisdiction of the court 
depends upon the totality of the demand in all the causes of action irrespective 
of whether the plural causes constituting the total claim arose out of the same 
of different transaction. The only <i>exceptions</i> to this rule are (1) where 
the claims joined under the same complaint are separably owned by, or due to, 
different parties, in which case each separate claim furnished the 
jurisdictional test (Arganza, et al. <i>vs.</i> International Colleges, 90 
Phil., 470; Soriano y Cia <i>vs.</i> Jose, <i>supra</i>; and (2) where not all 
the causes of action joined are demands or claims for money." (Teresa Felix Vda. 
de Rosario <i>vs.</i> Justice of the Peace of Camiling, Tarlac, et al. 99 Phil., 
693; 52 Off. Gaz. 5153).</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Section 88 of the Judiciary Act, as amended by Rep. Act No. 
2613, Aug. 1, 1959, heretofore cited, now provides— </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sec. 88. <em>Original jurisdiction in civil cases</em>.—In all civil 
actions, including those mentioned in Rules fifty-mine and sixty-two of the 
Rules of Court, arising in his municipality or city, and not exclusively 
cognizable by the Court of First Instance, the justice of the peace and the 
judge of a municipal court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction where the 
value of the subject matter or amount of the demand does not exceed five 
thousand pesos, exclusive of interests and costs. Where there are several claims 
or causes of action between the same parties embodied in the same complaint, the 
amount of the demand shall be the totality of the demand in all the causes of 
action, irrespective of whether the causes of action arose out of the same or 
different transactions; but where the claims or causes of action joined dn a 
single complaint are separately owned by or due to different parties, each 
separate claim shall furnish the jurisdictional test. * * *"</p></blockquote>
<p>In view hereof, the judgment appealed from, in so far as the appellant 
Salvador Miranda, Florentino Domactoy, Hermogenes Camacho, Amado Villanueva, 
Maralitico Pa-lomata, Eduardo C. Quimpo, Juan Tupas, Pedro Bugallon, Gerardo 
Gaboy, Camilo Alalin, Alfonso Pavila, Juan Mutia, Matias Marabe, Simon Largo, 
Epifanio Dumanggas, Meliton Arias, Felipe Lorarania, Basilio Baybayon, 
Espiridion Cajilig, Ricardo Pador," Jose Monsalle, Olegario Samson, Luis 
Agrandez and Apolonio Ondoy are concerned, is AFFIRMED. The appealed judgment 
with, respect to plaintiff Mauricio Mirano (Chief Engineer), is SET ASIDE, and 
the Court of origin is hereby directed to render a decision on the merits, as 
the evidence and the law on the matter may warrant. With costs against the 
plaintiffs-appellants. </p>
