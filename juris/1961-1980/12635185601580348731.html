Company and R. F. Navarro and Company from (a) the decision of the Court of
Appeals CA-G. R No. 30920-R promulgated on <st1:date year="1964" day="16" month="4">April 16, 1964</st1:date>, affirming that of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> in LRC-GLRO Record No.138,
Cadastral Case No. 8, and from (b) the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
resolution of June 8 of the same year denying petitioners' motion for
reconsider action.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts found by the Court of Appeals - which are now beyond
review - are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The Metropolitan Theater Co. plaintiff, brought action against
Union Surety and Insurance Co., and R. F. Navarro and Co. defendants the
collection of rentals in the amounts in the amount of P26,716.45, being a Civil
Case No. 38295 of the Municipal Court of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By virtue of a writ of attachment issued in
said Civil case, on July 5, 1955, the Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
levied attachment on certain properties of R. F. Navarro and Company, among
which being ?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A parcel of land (Lot
No. 1849, Ca­dastral Survey of San Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>)
covered by TCT No. 11407-R, and</blockquote>

<blockquote>A parcel of land (Lot
No. 14, Block No. 6, subdivision plan Psd-28187, being portion of Lot No. 1849,
Ca­dastral Survey of San Fernando, G.L.R.O. Cad. Rec. No. 138) covered by TCT
No. 11408-R.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Judgment was rendered in favor of the plain­tiff
in accordance with confession of judg­ment submitted by the defendants wherein
it was stated among other things that?</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Defendants, with this confes­sion of judgment, also manifest that
they hereby abide by the Order of Preliminary Attachment on the properties of
said defendants and issued by this Honorable Court on July 2, 1955 at the
instance of plaintiff, for the satisfaction of judgment x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>’.</p>

<blockquote>Upon application of the plaintiff, the
corresponding writ of execution was issued, and in compliance therewith, the
Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> levied execution on
the attached properties above mentioned, duly re­gistered in the Office of the
Register of Deeds, and issued a notice of sale at public auction of said
properties to take place on November 11, 1959, which was posted and
published.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the public auction sale,
the plaintiff, Metropolitan Theater Co., as judgment creditor was the highest
bidder, and the Provincial Sheriff issued to it a certificate of sale, dated <st1:date year="1959" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1959</st1:date>, which was
registered in the Office of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The period of redemption having expired
without anyone exercising such right, on <st1:date year="1960" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1960</st1:date>, final certificate of sale was executed
by the Sheriff in fa­vor of said plaintiff.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It appears that on September 9, 1955, while the
abovementioned attachment in favor of plaintiff was in force, the
aforementioned title certificates, TCT No. 11407-R and TCT No. 11408-R, were
cancelled and in lieu thereof TCT No. 12902 and TCT No. 12903, respectively,
were issued in the name of the Union Surety and Insurance Co., Inc., on the
strength of a deed of sale pur­porting to have been executed on August 20,
1954, by the R. F. Navarro and Company.<span style="">&nbsp;

to set aside the order of January 28, 1961 declaring TCT Nos. 12902 and 12903
null and void, and to declare null and void the new titles issued in favor of
the Metro­politan Theater Company, an the alleged grounds of 'fraud committed

against, and by reason of which the Union Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc., and

<p class="2Q">‘The Metropolitan Theater Co. and its counsel are notified in open
court of this order.’</p>

<blockquote>"On June 7, 1961, Attorney for the Union Surety and Ins.
Company, Inc., filed a motion for reconsideration of the aforesaid Order of May
20, 1961, so as to allow R. F. Navarro and Company to present evidence on any
day designat­ed by the Court, alleging that 'the absence of the undersigned
counsel was due to the assurance of Atty. Guerrero (for the Metropolitan
Theater Co.) thru Mr. R.F. Navarro that the case will be postponed as he did
not interpose any objection to the same but which he vio­lated'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What happened after the filing of this motion
is related in the order of <st1:date year="1961" day="4" month="12">December 4,
 1961</st1:date>, which denied the same for being untenable, as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'On June 7, 1961, the Union Surety and Insurance Co., Inc. and R. F.
Navarro and Company filed a motion and asked for the reconsider­ation of the
court's order of May 20, said year, denying their peti­tion for relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the hearing of this motion on <st1:date year="1961" day="13" month="6">June 13, 1961</st1:date>, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> F. Navarro, chairman of the board of the said
companies, appeared, and moved that said hearing be postponed to another
date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In spite of the objection of the
Metropolitan Theater Company, the said hearing set for <st1:date year="1961" day="13" month="6">June 13, 1961</st1:date>, was postponed to June 20, said
year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the reason of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> F. Navarro in asking for the said postponement was
that there was a settlement in progress, the court granted the parties a period
of twenty (20) days within which to inform the court whether there was, in
fact, such settlement or not, otherwise, the mo­tion for reconsideration would
be over­ruled.</p>

<p class="2Q">'On June 23, 1961, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> F.
Navarro sent an offer to the Metropoli­tan Theater Company to redeem or repur­chase
the properties covered by the certificates of title aforementioned, and in
reply thereto, Mr. Ramon F. Fernandez, the managing director of the
Metropolitan Theater Company informed the former in the letter dated July 10,
1961, that the disputed properties were not for sale, as similar offers were
already made.</p>

<p class="2Q">'As the proposed settlement could not be carried out, the court
reset the hearing of the motion for reconsidera­tion for <st1:date year="1961" day="12" month="8">August 12, 1961</st1:date>, which was again postponed to
September 13, said year, at the request of the same <span class="SpellE">movants</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the presiding judge was confined in the
hospital on <st1:date year="1961" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1961</st1:date>
and operated on the day following, such hearing was post­poned until further
assignment.</p>

<p class="2Q">'When the said Judge resumed holding court on October 9, 1961, the
clerk of court, upon his order, reset the hearing of the said motion for
October 31, same year, which was again postponed to Novem­ber 4, 1961 upon
motion of the Union Surety and Insurance Co., Inc. and R. F. Navarro and
Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this hearing the court found
attached to the record an urgent (motion) for postponement filed by another
counsel, the <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> Law Office, and a ma­nifestation
of the prior counsel for the <span class="SpellE">movants</span>, wherein a copy
of a telegram of the Solicitor General was copied, asking that the
consideration of the oft-repeated motion be postponed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the motion for reconsideration
was again post­poned to <st1:date year="1961" day="11" month="11">November 11,
 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this date, the
Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
filed, through the Solicitor General, its motion to intervene dated November
10, said year, which was set for hearing on <st1:date year="1961" day="18" month="11">November 18, 1961</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="2Q">'This hearing was postponed to De­cember 2, this year, for the
reason that, as already stated in the beginning, there was no showing that the
Metropolitan Theater Company has been notified thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></p>

<blockquote>And then the court said:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'In view of the foregoing facts the intervention sought by the
Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
only concerns the aforesaid motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></p>

<p class="2Q">'There is likewise no controversy that, after the issuance of these
new titles (TCT Nos. 12902 and 12903), it was when the notice of levy in favor
of the Republic of the Philippines was annotated therein on September 28, 1955
in connection with criminal cases Nos. 13923, 24864 and others of the Court of
First Instance of Manila under entry No. 38018.<span style="">&nbsp;

the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
cannot be considered proper.</p>

<p class="2Q">'At any rate, the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is not precluded from en­forcing its right, if it has any, in a separate civil
action for the annulment of all processes which transpired in the sale of the
disputed properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With regard to the
motion for reconsideration, in which the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
wishes to intervene, the court finds the ground upon which it is predicated to
be untenable'.</p>

<blockquote>"A copy of the aforesaid order of December 4, 1961 was
received by the Union Surety and In­surance Co., Inc., and R. F. Navarro and
Company on December 16, 1961, and on January 10, 1962, they filed a Notice of
Appeal and Appeal Bond manifesting their intention to appeal from the said
Order, on the alleged ground that 'the same is contrary to evidence and to
law'."</blockquote>

said Court to reverse the order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> ordering the cancellation of TCT Nos. 12902 and

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals did not sustain petitioners' appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this instance they limit themselves to the
following contentions:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>firstly, that the
ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> hearing held in the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> on the petition to cancel Transfer
Certificates of Title Nos. 12902 and 12903 "was a denial of the
petitioners' right to be heard"; secondly, that the levy made by the Pro­vincial
Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> upon petitioners' properties
violated "the provisions of levy and execution as provided by the Rules of
Court".</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' first contention is clearly without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">As found by the Court of Appeals, petitioners filed an opposition
to the petition filed by herein respondent in LRC (GLRO) Record No. 138,
Cadastral Case No. 8, for the cancellation of TCT Nos. 12902 and 12903 etc., in
which pleading were alleged facts constituting a counterclaim - manifestly
beyond the jurisdiction of the Court in said land case where it was acting in
the exercise of limited jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners do not deny that on <st1:date year="1961" day="3" month="1">January
 3, 1961</st1:date> they received a copy of respondent's petition and that,
upon their motion, the hearing to be held thereon was postponed and reset for <st1:date year="1961" day="14" month="1">January 14, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not denied either that when
respondent's petition was called for hearing on the latter date, petitioners
failed to appear, and that, in view thereof, after receiving the evidence
presented by respondent in support of its petition, the Court issued its order
of January 23, 1961 whose <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion reads
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, finding the petitioner's petition to be supported
by evidence, the court hereby directs the Register of Deeds for the province of
<span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> to cancel Trans­fer Certificate of Title No.
12902, formerly 11407-R and 12903 formerly 11408-R, of the land records for the
province of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, and to issue, in lieu thereof,
new certifi­cates of title in the name of the said petitioner, as well as to
cancel junior encum­brances appearing in said titles, principally Entry No.
38018, upon payment of the legal fees of his office."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It appears further that on March 24, 1961 peti­tioners filed a
petition for relief from judgment pray­ing therein, inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>,
that the order declaring Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 12902 and 12903
null and void be set aside upon the ground of "fraud committed by counsel
for Metropolitan Theater Company", and "excusable negli­gence which
ordinary prudence could not have guarded against by reason of which the Union
Surety and Insurance Company, Inc. and the R. F. Navarro and Company have been
impaired in their right to defend themselves in Court (Section 2, Rule 38,
Rules of Court)".</p>

<p class="BODY">After a hearing held in connection with said peti­tion and
respondent's opposition thereto, the Court, on <st1:date year="1961" day="20" month="5">May 20, 1961</st1:date>, issued an order of denial.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The above shows beyond peradventure of doubt
that petitioners were given full opportunity to be heard below not only in
connection with respondent's motion for cancellation of certificates of title
but also in con­nection with their own petition for relief.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Neither do We find merit in petitioners' second contention to the
effect that the levy made by the Pro­vincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
upon the properties mentioned heretofore was in violation of the provisions of
the Rules of Court on levy and execution because while the judgment in favor of
respondent was only for a little over P26<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, the
properties levied upon and sold at public auction were worth more than half a
million pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be borne in mind is
the fact that the present is an appeal by certiorari from the decision of the Court
of Appeals in CA-G. R. No. 30920-R, promulgated on <st1:date year="1964" day="16" month="4">April 16, 1964</st1:date> and from its resolution of June 8
of the same year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That case, in turn,
was an appeal by herein petitioners from the order issued by the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> in <span class="GramE">LRC(</span>GLRO)
Record 138, Cadastral Case No. 8 on December 4, 1961 overruling or denying
their motion of June 7 of said year seeking reconsideration of the Court's
order of May 20, 1961 denying their petition for relief from judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is obvious, therefore, that the issue
raised in the Court of Appeals was simply whether or not the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> erred in issuing said order of
denial notwithstanding the grounds relied upon by herein petitioners in their
aforesaid motion for relief from judgment, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that fraud was committed by counsel for the
Metropolitan Theater Company resulting in the failure of their counsel to
appear at the hearing on the motion of said Company for the cancellation of the
Transfer Certificates of Title 12902 and 12903, and that their counsel's
failure to appear was due to an excusable negligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear, therefore, that the question of
the alleged great excess of the value of the properties levied upon and sold at
public auction over the money payable under the judgment to be satisfied was
not in­volved in the case resolved by the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the judgment debtors had one full year within which to
redeem said properties, but they not only failed to do so but they did nothing
to raise this question before the lower court during that period of redemption.</p>

<p class="BODY">This appeal does not involve the order of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> denying the motion for
intervention filed by the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
from which the latter did not appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
should be noted, how­ever, that the order of denial said the following:</p>

<blockquote>"At any rate, the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is not precluded from en­forcing its right, if it has any, in a separate civil
action for the annulment of all processes which transpired in the sale of the
disputed properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With regard to the
motion for reconsideration, in which the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE">,</span> wishes to intervene, the court finds the ground upon which
it is predicated to be untenable."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding no error in the appealed decision, the
same is hereby affirmed, with costs.</p>
