motion for reconsideration to be <u>pro</u> </span><u>forma</u> and declining
to hold that its decision on the merits had thereby become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the elections of <st1:date year="1963" day="12" month="11">November
 12, 1963</st1:date>, the Municipal Board of Canvassers proclaimed <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Manuel <span class="SpellE">Tuguinay</span> to have
been elected Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Banaue</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype><span class="SpellE">subprovince</span></st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ifugao</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, with a plurality over
the other candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the latter,
appellant Andres <span class="GramE">Morales,</span> filed a petition of protest
on <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="11">November 22, 1963</st1:date>, alleging
frauds and irregularities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After trial
the court declared protestant Morales elected over <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tuguinay</span>, by 642 votes for the protestant against 639
for his rival.</p>

<p class="BODY">Within two days from receipt of the decision, <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>
filed, on January 29, 1965, a motion for reconsideration, on the alleged ground
of "Consistency and Delicacy" in the epigraph, and setting forth
reasons why the Court should not have rejected certain ballots that had been
accepted as valid for <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> by the Board of
Inspectors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court refused
reconsideration on February 9, and on the same day the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>
filed notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals and appeal bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">The protestant moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that it <span style="">was filed </span>beyond the 5-day appeal
period fixed in section 178 of the Revised Election Code, arguing that, the
motion for reconsideration not being predicated on any of the grounds specified
in Rules 37 and 38 of the Rules of Court (old), said motion did not interrupt
the time for appealing the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court below, on February 12, refused to dismiss the appeal of
the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>, whereupon protestant Morales, in turn,
resorted directly to this Court on points of law, and in his brief as appellant
reiterated the arguments he had urged upon the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the appeal to be without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that the epigraph prefacing the body of <span class="SpellE">protestee's</span> motion for reconsideration in the Court of
First Instance states his grounds to be "Consistency and Delicacy",
in the succeeding paragraphs <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> expounds at
length upon his contention that ballots with the letter H should not have been
rejected, the Board of Election Inspectors having accepted the same as valid
for bearing the initials of the <span class="SpellE">protestee's</span> native
name "<span class="SpellE">Hucka</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Protestee</span> quoted at
length from the transcript, as supporting the fact that his nickname or native
name was <span class="SpellE">Hucka</span> and that he was generally known by
that appellation, though his Christian name is Manuel (Rec., pp. 11-19).</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus the text of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> motion for
reconsideration clearly demonstrates that in reality the ground advanced <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> <span style="">was </span>that
the decision was not justified by the evidence [Rule 37, section 1,
subparagraph (c)].<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The epigraph should
yield to the contents of the motion (cf. <span class="SpellE">Jornales</span> vs.
Central de <span class="SpellE">Bais</span>, G.R. <span class="GramE">No</span>. L-15287,
September 30, 1963) as substance should prevail over <span class="GramE">form,</span>
and the court below committed no error in refusing to dismiss the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed order of <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="2">February 12, 1965</st1:date> is hereby sustained and
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs
against appellant Andres Morales.</span></p>
