				<BR><STRONG>GUERRERO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This original petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span> seeks to nullify the Order dated August 20, 1975 issued by District Judge Ulpiano Sarmiento in Criminal Case No. Q-3781 which stalled the prosecution of respondents Sgt. Jessie C. Hope and Monina Medina for the alleged violation of Section 3601<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Tariff and Customs Code.&nbsp; The order declared as inadmissible in evidence the allegedly smuggled articles obtained by apprehending agents in the course of a warrantless search and seizure.&nbsp; Dispositively, the order decreed:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in accordance with Article IV, Sec. 4, paragraph 2 of the present Constitution, the boxes and the watches and bracelets contained therein seized from the car of the accused Sgt. Jessie C. Hope, are hereby declared inadmissible in evidence in this case; likewise, the pictures taken of said items attempted to be presented as evidence in the instant case is hereby declared inadmissible as evidence against the accused.<br><br>"SO ORDERED."</blockquote>The records disclose that one week before February 9, 1974, the Regional Anti-Smuggling Action Center (RASAC) was informed by an undisclosed Informer that a shipment of highly dutiable goods would be transported to Manila from Angeles City on a blue Dodge car.&nbsp; Spurred by such lead, RASAC Agents Arthur Manuel and Macario Sabado, on the aforesaid date and upon order of the Chief of Intelligence and Operations Branch, RASAC-MBA, Col. Antonio Abad, Jr., stationed themselves in the vicinity of the toll gate of the North Diversion Road at Balintawak, Quezon City.<br><br>At about 6:45 A.M. of the same day, a light blue Dodge car with Plate No. 21-87-73, driven by Sgt. Jessie Hope who was accompanied by Monina Medina approached the exit gate and after giving the toll receipt sped away towards Manila.&nbsp; The RASAC agents gave a chase and overtook Sgt. Hope's car.&nbsp; Agent Sabado blew his whistle and signaled Sgt. Hope to stop but the latter instead of heeding, made a U-turn back to the North Diversion Road, but he could not go through because of the buses in front of his car.&nbsp; At this point, the agents succeeded in blocking Sgt. Hope's car and the latter stopped.&nbsp; Manuel and Sabado who were in civilian clothes showed their identification cards to respondents and introduced themselves as RASAC agents.<br><br>The Agents saw four (4) boxes on the back seat of the Dodge and upon inquiry as to what those boxes were, Sgt. Hope answered "I do not know." Further, respondents were asked where they were bringing the boxes, to which respondent Medina replied that they were bringing them (boxes) to the Tropical Hut at Epifanio de los Santos.&nbsp; Agent Sabado boarded the Dodge car with respondents while Agent Manuel took their own car and both cars drove towards Tropical Hut making a brief stop at the Bonanza where Agent Manuel called up Col. Abad by telephone.<br><br>Arriving at the Tropical Hut, the party, together with Col. Abad who had joined them waited for the man who according to Monina Medina was supposed to receive the boxes.&nbsp; As the man did not appear, Col. Abad "called off the mission" and brought respondents and their car to Camp Aguinaldo arriving there at about 9:00 A.M. (Respondents' Memorandum, records, pp. 180-183).<br><br>An inspection of Sgt. Hope's car at Camp Aguinaldo yielded eleven (11) sealed boxes, four (4) on the rear seat and seven (7) more in the baggage compartment which was opened on orders of Col. Abad.&nbsp; On the same order of the intelligence officer, the boxes were opened before the presence of respondents Hope and Medina, representatives of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, Bureau of Customs, P.C., COSAC and photographers of the Department of National Defense.&nbsp; The contents of the boxes revealed some "4,441 more or less wrist watches of assorted brands; 1,075 more or less watch bracelets of assorted brands" (based on a later inventory), supposedly untaxed.<br><br>As consequence thereof, ASAC Chairman General Pelagio Cruz requested the Bureau of Customs to issue a Warrant of Seizure and Detention against the articles including the Dodge car.&nbsp; The Collector of Customs did issue the same on February 12, 1974.&nbsp; It was admitted, however, that when the apprehending agents arrested respondents and brought them together with the seized articles to the ASAC Office in Camp Aguinaldo, the former were not armed with a warrant of arrest and seizure.<br><br>In conjunction with the Warrant of Seizure and Detention issued by the Collector of Customs, seizure proceedings were instituted and docketed as Seizure Identification No. 14281 against the wrist watches and watch bracelets pursuant to Section 2530 (m)-1 of the Tariff and Customs Code, and Seizure Identification No. 14281-A against the Dodge car pursuant to Section 2530(k) of the same Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>During the hearing of the aforesaid cases, respondents disclaimed ownership of the seized articles.&nbsp; Ownership was instead claimed by one Antonio del Rosario who intervened in the proceedings.&nbsp; The claimant-intervenor testified that he bought the watches and bracelets from Buenafe Trading as evidenced by a sales invoice certified to be authentic by the BIR Revenue Regional Office No. 6 of Quezon City, which transaction was entered in the book of accounts of aforesaid claimant; that the same articles were brought to a buyer in Angeles City, but when the sale failed to materialize, claimant contracted respondent Monina Medina to trans­port back the boxes to Manila for a consideration of P1,000.00 without disclosing the contents thereof which claimant simply represented as PX goods; that when he bought the watches from Buenafe, he presumed that the corresponding duties have already been paid, only to be surprised later on when he was informed that the same were seized for non-payment of taxes.<br><br>On the other hand, respondent Hope testified to the effect that at the time of apprehension, he had no knowledge of the contents of the boxes, and granting that he had such knowledge, he never knew that these are untaxed commodities; that he consented to transport said boxes from Angeles City to Manila in his car upon request of his girl friend Monina Medina as a personal favor; that he was not present when the boxes were loaded in his car nor was he ever told of their contents on the way.&nbsp; On the part of respondent Monina Medina, she testified that what she did was only in compliance with the agreement with Mr. Del Rosario to transport the boxes and deliver them to a certain Mr. Peter at the Tropical Hut who will in turn give her the contracted price; that Mr. Del Rosario did not reveal the contents of the boxes which she came to know of only when the boxes were opened at Camp Aguinaldo.<br><br>As there was not enough evidence to controvert the testimonies of respondents and the narration of claimant Antonio del Rosario, the Collector of Customs issued his decision in the seizure cases on April 1, 1975 declaring that the seized articles including the car are not subject of forfeiture.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of this decision reads:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, by virtue of Section 2312 of the Tariff and Customs Code, it is hereby ordered and decreed that the subject motor vehicle, one (1) Dodge, Model 1965, Motor No. 33859, Serial No. W357348361, File No. 2B-1884, with Plate No. EH 21-87, '73 covered by Seizure Identification No. 14281-A be, as it is hereby declared released to its registered owner, Jessie C. Hope, upon proper identification.&nbsp; Relative to Seizure Identification No. 14281, it is further ordered and decreed that the subject matter thereof to wit:&nbsp; 4,606 pcs. of assorted brands of wrist watches, 1,399 pieces of assorted brands of wrist bracelets and 100 pcs. of tools be, as they are hereby likewise declared released to the rightful owner thereof, Antonio del Rosario, upon payment of the levitable duties, taxes and other charges due thereon plus a fine equivalent to 100% of the duties and taxes thereof.&nbsp; Furthermore, should claimant-intervenor fail to pay the assessable duties, taxes and other charges owing from the aforestated articles within 30 days from the time this decision becomes final and un­appealable, the same shall be deemed abandoned in favor of the government to be disposed of in the manner provided for by law."</blockquote>Meanwhile, on March 14, 1974, after the requisite preliminary investigation, the City Fiscal of Quezon City, finding the existence of a <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> case against respondents Hope and Medina, filed Criminal Case No. Q-3781 in the Court of First Instance of Rizal (Quezon City).&nbsp; Upon arraignment on April 23, 1974, respondents pleaded not guilty.&nbsp; Trial commenced on January 28, 1975 and while the prosecution through its first witness, Agent Macario Sabado, was adducing as evidence the pictures of the eleven (11) boxes containing the assorted watches and watch bracelets, counsel for respondents objected to the presentation of the pictures and the subject articles on the ground that they were seized without the benefit of warrant, and therefore inadmissible in evidence under Section 4(2), Article IV of the New Constitution.&nbsp; After the parties have argued their grounds in their respective memoranda, respondent trial court issued the questioned order of August 20, 1975 as cited earlier.&nbsp; The prosecution's motion for reconsideration was denied on September 30, 1975.&nbsp; Hence, this petition which was treated as a special civil action in Our Resolution of May 5, 1976.<br><br>The substantive issue as urged in the petition is whether or not the seizure of the merchandise in a moving vehicle by authorized agents commissioned to enforce customs laws without warrant of seizure breaches the constitutional immunity against unreasonable search and seizure and therefore, such merchandise are inadmissible in evidence.&nbsp; Corollary to the issue is, has the trial court gravely abused its discretion in finding the affirmative?<br><br>The State holds on the proposition that the rules governing search and seizure had been liberalized when a moving vehicle is the object of the search and the necessity of a prior warrant has been relaxed on the ground of practicality, considering that before a war­rant could be obtained, the place, things and persons to be searched must be described to the satisfaction of the issuing judge - a requirement which borders on impossibility in the case of smuggling effected by the use of a moving vehicle that can transport contraband from one place to another with impunity.&nbsp; Petitioner vigorously contends that contraband may be seized without necessity of a search warrant since the Constitution does not guaranty immunity to smugglers and that a warrantless seizure of contraband in a moving vehicle is justified by the traditional exception attached to the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and such exception Must be adopted in interpreting the relevant provision in the new Philippine Constitution.<br><br>As counter argument, respondents maintain that the decision of the Collector of Customs in the seizure cases which has now become final and unappealable has made no pronouncement that the subject articles are smuggled items.&nbsp; More so, the decision has entirely cleared respondents of any liability or responsibility in the alleged smuggling activity and as a consequence, the decision has the direct effect of deciding finally that the watches and bracelets are not smuggled and that respondents have not violated the customs and tariff laws as charged in the criminal complaint.&nbsp; Respondents argue further that the interception of accused Jessie Hope's car by RASAC Agents while in the course of a normal trip without any order of the court and without having shown that the interception was necessary in the interest of national security, public safety or public health, is an impairment of the liberty of travel under section 5, Article IV of the 1973 Constitution.&nbsp; Finally, they claim that the agents had one week's time before the date of apprehension to secure the necessary warrant but since they failed to get this court order, the search of Hope's car and the spontaneous seizure of the boxes loaded therein and the contents thereof is a violation of the constitutional guarantee against "unreasonable searches and seizure of whatever nature and for any purpose" under section 3, Article IV of the fundamental law.<br><br>We find for petitioner.&nbsp; The opposing counsel's attempt to draw an identity between the seizure cases and the present criminal action to the ultimate end that the decision in the former should be made decisive of the issue of criminal liability must be overruled.&nbsp; It is not accurate to say that the Collector of Customs made no findings that the articles were smuggled.&nbsp; In fact, what the Collector stated was that the prosecution failed to present the quantum of evidence sufficient to warrant the forfeiture of the subject articles (Pages 128 and 130 of Annex "E", Records, p. 109).&nbsp; In a general sense, this does not necessarily exclude the possibility of smuggling.&nbsp; But if the aim of a confirmation that the goods are indeed smuggled, is to draw an inference to tie up respondents' criminal liability, the Collector is not duty bound, nor is there any need for him to arrive at such a conclusion.&nbsp; It is quite clear that seizure and forfeiture proceedings under the tariff and customs laws are not criminal in nature as they do not result in the conviction of the offender nor in the imposition of the penalty provided for in section 3601 of the Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> As can be gleaned from Section 2533 of the code, seizure proceedings, such as those instituted in this case, are purely civil and administrative in character, the main purpose of which is to enforce the administrative fines or forfeiture incident to unlawful importation of goods or their deliberate possession.&nbsp; The penalty in seizure cases is distinct and separate from the criminal liability that might be imposed against the indicted importer or possessor and both kinds of penalties may be imposed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the decision of the Collector of Customs, as in other seizure proceedings, concerns the <span style="font-style: italic;">res</span> rather than the <span style="font-style: italic;">persona</span>.&nbsp; The proceeding is a probe on contraband or illegally imported goods.&nbsp; These merchandise violated the revenue law of the country, and as such, have been prevented from being assimilated in lawful commerce until corresponding duties are paid thereon and the penalties imposed and satisfied either in the form of fines or of forfeiture in favor of the government who will dispose of them in accordance with law.&nbsp; The importer or possessor is treated differently.&nbsp; The fact that the administrative penalty befalls on him is an inconsequential incidence to criminal liability.&nbsp; By the same token, the probable guilt cannot be negated simply because he was not held administratively liable.&nbsp; The Collector's final declaration that the articles are not subject to forfeiture does not detract his findings that untaxed goods were transported in respondents' car and seized from their possession by agents of the law.&nbsp; Whether criminal liability lurks on the strength of the provision of the Tariff and Customs Code adduced in the information can only be determined in a separate criminal action.&nbsp; Respondents' exoneration in the administrative cases cannot deprive the State of its right to prosecute.&nbsp; But under our penal laws, criminal responsibility, if any, must be proven not by preponderance of evidence but by proof beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>Considering now the critical area of the dispute, under the law, the authority of persons duly commissioned to enforce tariff and customs laws is quite exceptional when it pertains to the domain of searches and seizures of goods suspected to have been introduced in the country in violation of the customs laws.&nbsp; This Court had occasion to recognize this power granted to persons having police authority under Section 2203 of the Code, who in order to discharge their official duties more effectively --<br><blockquote>"x x x may at anytime enter, pass through, or search any land or inclosure of any warehouse, store or other building <span style="font-style: italic;">not being a dwelling</span> house." (Section 2208, italics supplied)<br><br>"x x x (to) go aboard any vessel or aircraft within the limits of any collection district, and to inspect, search and examine said vessel or aircraft and any trunk package, box or envelope on board, and search any person on board the said vessel or aircraft and to this end to hail and stop such vessel or aircraft if under way, to use all necessary force to compel compliance; and if it shall appear that any breach or violation of the customs and tariff laws of the Philippines has been committed, whereby or in consequence of which such vessels or aircrafts, or the article, or any part thereof, on board of or imported by such vessel or aircraft, is liable to forfeiture to make seizure of the same or any part thereof.<br><br>"The power of search herein above given shall extend to the removal of any false bottom, partition, bulkhead or other obstruction, so far as may be necessary to enable the officer to discover whether any dutiable or forfeitable articles may be concealed." (Section 2210)</blockquote>or,<br><blockquote>"x x x (to) <span style="font-style: italic;">open and examine any box, trunk, envelope or other container wherever found when he has reasonable cause to suspect the presence therein of dutiable or prohibited article or articles</span> introduced into the Philippines contrary to law, <span style="font-style: italic;">and likewise to stop, search and examine any vehicle, beast or person reasonably suspected of holding or conveying such article as aforesaid</span>." (Section 2211, italics supplied)</blockquote>As enunciated in the leading case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Papa v. Mago</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> in the exercise of the specific functions aforecited, the Code does not mention the need of a search warrant unlike Section 2209 which explicitly provides that a "dwelling house may be entered and searched only upon warrant issued by a judge (or justice of the peace), upon sworn application showing probable cause and particularly describing the place to be searched and person or thing to be seized." Aware of this delineation, the Court in that case expressed the considered view that "except in the case of the search of a dwelling house, persons exercising police authority under the customs law may effect search and seizure without a search warrant in the enforcement of customs laws."<br><br>The rationale of the <u>Mago</u> ruling was nurtured by the traditional doctrine in <span style="font-style: italic;">Carroll v. United States</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> wherein an imprimatur against constitutional infirmity was stamped in favor of a warrantless search and seizure of such nature as in the case at bar.&nbsp; On this stable foundation We refute the constitutional charge of respondents that the warrantless seizure violated Article IV, Section 3 of the 1973 Constitution, which finds origin in the Fourth Amendment of the American Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The <span style="font-style: italic;">Carroll</span> doctrine arose from the indictment and conviction of George Carroll and partner for transporting in an automobile intoxicating liquor in violation of the National Prohibition Act.&nbsp; They assailed the conviction on the ground that the trial court admitted in evidence two of the sixty-eight bottles found by searching the automobile and eventual seizure of the same allegedly in violation of the 4th Amendment, and therefore that the use of the liquor as evidence was improper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> To paraphrase the significant views of Mr. Chief Justice Taft, the legislative history of the Act clearly established the intent of Congress to make a distinction between the necessity for a search warrant in the search of private dwellings and that of automobiles and other road vehicles in the enforcement of the Act.&nbsp; This distinction is consistent with the 4th Amendment since the latter does not denounce all searches or seizures, but only such as are unreasonable.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Searches and seizures without warrant are valid if made upon probable cause, that is, upon a belief, reasonably arising out of circumstances known to the seizing officer, that an automobile or other vehicle contains that which by law is subject to seizure and destruction</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Similarly, other statutes of the Union such as the Act of 1789, Act of August 4, 1790, and Act of March 3, 1815, among others, construed in the light of the 4th Amendment had recognized the distinctive feature of a warrantless search of a ship, motorboat, wagon, or automobile for contraband goods where it is not practicable to secure a warrant because the vehicle can be quickly moved out of the locality or jurisdiction in which the warrant must be sought.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> In such a situation, what appears to be the measure of legality of the seizure was formulated in this sense:&nbsp; "that the seizing officer shall have reasonable or probable cause for believing that the automobile which he stops and seizes has contraband liquor therein which is being illegally transported." Therein the guarantee of the 4th Amendment was fulfilled.&nbsp; Where seizure is impossible except without warrant, the seizing officer acts unlawfully and at his peril unless he can show the court probable cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The counsel for the State is candid enough to admit that the Anti-Smuggling Action Center tries its best to follow-up the more promising tips and information from informers, but very often, the information proves false or the smugglers are forewarned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> It is quite true the ASAC received one such information several days or a week before the encounter; but the fact that its agents failed to obtain a warrant in spite of the time allowance is not a sign that they have been remiss in their duty.&nbsp; The records hardly reveal anything certain and confirmatory of the report during the said period except the general knowledge that some highly dutiable goods would be transported from Angeles City to Manila in a blue Dodge automobile.&nbsp; Not even the trial court has made any findings that ASAC has established with exactitude the place to be searched and the person or thing to be seized.&nbsp; Lacking this essential determination, the agents could not have possibly secured a valid warrant even if they had foreseen its compelling necessity.&nbsp; For one thing, the information could have been just another false alarm.&nbsp; Providentially, however, things turned out differently when in the morning of February 9, 1974, the undisclosed Informer himself went along with the agents to the rendezvous point where at the appointed time he positively identified an approaching car as the one described by him a week earlier to be the suspected carrier of untaxed merchandise.&nbsp; Clearly therefore, the agents acted not on the basis of a mere hearsay but on a confirmed information worthy of belief and probable cause enough for them to adopt measures to freeze the fleeting event.<br><br>We need not argue that the subjective phase of the police action taken by the ASAC Agents to effect the apprehension of the suspected violators can be anything less than the ensuing interception and stoppage of respondents' vehicle after a short chase.&nbsp; Neither can We sustain the argument that in doing so, the agents violated respondents' constitutional "liberty of travel".&nbsp; To recall again Mr. Chief Justice Taft:&nbsp; "(B)ut those lawfully within the country, entitled to use the public highways, have a right to free passage without interruption or search unless there is known to a competent official authorized to search, probable cause for believing that their vehicles are carrying contraband or illegal merchandise."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> What followed next in the scene was a simple inquiry as to the contents of the boxes seen inside the car.&nbsp; Respondents' baffled denial of knowledge thereof could not but only heighten the suspicion of a reasonable and inquisitive mind.&nbsp; Thus, the probable cause has not been any less mitigated.<br><br>The purpose of the constitutional guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures is to prevent violations of private security in person and property and unlawful invasion of the sanctity of the home by officers of the law acting under legislative or judicial sanction and to give remedy against such usurpation when attempted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The right to privacy is an essential condition to the dignity and happiness and to the peace and security of every individual, whether it be of home or of persons and correspondence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The constitutional inviolability of this great fundamental right against <span style="font-style: italic;">unreasonable</span> searches and seizures must be deemed absolute as nothing is more closer to a man's soul than the serenity of his privacy and the assurance of his personal security.&nbsp; Any interference allowable can only be for the best of causes and reasons.&nbsp; We draw from the context of the Constitution that an intended search or seizure attains a high degree of propriety only when a probable cause duly determined is branded on a warrant duly issued by a judge or other responsible person as may be authorized by law.&nbsp; Not invariably, however, the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the interference is not wholly dependent on the presence of a warrant or the lack of it.&nbsp; In the ordinary cases where warrant is indispensably necessary, the mechanics prescribed by the Constitution and reiterated in the Rules of Court must be followed and satisfied.&nbsp; But We need not argue that there are exceptions.&nbsp; Thus, in the extraordinary events where warrant is not necessary to effect a valid search or seizure, or when the latter cannot be performed except without warrant, what constitutes a reasonable or unreasonable search or seizure becomes purely a judicial question, determinable from the uniqueness of the circumstances involved, including the purpose of the search or seizure, the presence or absence of probable cause, the manner in which the search and seizure was made, the place or thing searched and the character of the articles procured.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The ultimate question then, if any, that should confront the actuations of the ASAC Agents in this case is whether the warrantless search and seizure conducted by them is lawful or not.&nbsp; We have already seen that what they did was a faithful performance of a duty authorized under the Tariff and Customs Code directing them as authorized agents to retrieve articles reasonably suspected of having been possessed, issued or procured in violation of the tariff laws for which the government has a direct interest.&nbsp; The official capacity of the agents has never been questioned by respondents.&nbsp; Neither did respondents raise an issue on the constitutionality of the law giving the agents the power to act as mandated.&nbsp; There is no question that the Agents have not exceeded their authority nor have they acted so licentiously to bear upon respondents moral embarrassment or substantial prejudice beyond what is necessary.&nbsp; The purpose of the search and seizure is more than clear to Us, hence, We rule out the suspicion that the intention is only to elicit evidence to be used against respondents.<br><br>We do not see strong justification for the trial court's failure to recognize the circumstances at bar as among the "rare cases" which it admittedly conceded to be exempted from the requirement of a warrant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The lapse lies on the dismal gap in the trial court's developmental treatment of the law on arrest, search and seizure.&nbsp; It missed the vital distinction emphatically laid down in <span style="font-style: italic;">Boyd v. United States</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> which was cited in <span style="font-style: italic;">Carroll</span> with "particular significance and applicability." Thus, We quote Mr. Justice Bradley in <span style="font-style: italic;">Boyd</span>:<br><blockquote>"x x x The search and seizure of stolen or forfeited goods, <span style="font-style: italic;">or goods liable to duties and concealed to avoid the payment thereof</span>, are totally different things from a search for and seizure of a man's private books and papers for the purpose of obtaining information therein contained, or of using them as evidence against him.&nbsp; The two things differ in <span style="font-style: italic;">toto coelo</span>.&nbsp; In the one case, the government is entitled to the possession of the property; in the other it is not.&nbsp; The seizure of stolen goods is authorized by the common law; and the seizure of goods forfeited for a breach of the revenue laws or concealed to avoid the duties payable on them, has been authorized by English statutes for at least two centuries past; and the like seizure have been authorized by our revenue acts from the commencement of the government.&nbsp; The first statute passed by Congress to regulate the collection of duties, the Act of July 31, 1789, 1 Stat. at L. 29, 43, chap. 5, contains provisions to this effect.&nbsp; As this act was passed by the same Congress which proposed for adoption the original Amendments to the Constitution, it is clear that the members of that body did not regard searches and seizures of this kind as 'unreasonable' and they are not embraced within the prohibition of the Amendment.&nbsp; So also the supervision authorized to be exercised by officers of the revenue over the manufacture or custody of excisable articles, and the entries thereof in books required by law to be kept for their inspection, are necessarily excepted out of the category of unreasonable searches and seizures.&nbsp; So also the laws which provide for the search and seizure of articles and things which it is unlawful for a person to have in his possession for the purpose of issue or disposition, such as counterfeit coin, lottery tickets, implements of gambling, <span style="font-style: italic;">etc</span>. are not within this category.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Commonwealth v. Dana</span>, 2 Met. 329.&nbsp; Many other things of this character might be enumerated." (Italics supplied).</blockquote>Recently, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Viduya v. Berdiago</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> this Court reiterated the controlling force of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Papa v.

The agents found, stashed inside the upholstered seats, sixty-eight bottles of whiskey and gin.&nbsp; Thereafter, the state officer and another took Carroll and Kiro, the liquor and the car to Grand Rapids.<br><br>As could readily be seen, the "exigent circumstances"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> which exist in connection with the ambulatory character of the automobile provided the basic factor in the justification for the warrantless search and seizure in <span style="font-style: italic;">Carroll</span>. <span style="font-style: italic;">Absent, thus, these "exigent circumstances," notwithstanding the presence of probable cause, a warrant must be secured and used</span>.<br><br>The U.S. Supreme Court took this jurisprudential direction in the much later case of <span style="font-style: italic;">United States v. Joseph V. Chadwick, et al.</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> decided on June 21, 1977.&nbsp; The facts of the case were summarized as follows:<br><blockquote>"When respondents arrived by train in Boston from San Diego, they were arrested at their waiting automobile by federal narcotics agents, who had been alerted that respondents were possible drug traffickers.&nbsp; A double-locked footlocker, which respondents had transported on the train and which the agents had probable cause to believe contained narcotics, had been loaded in the trunk of the automobile.&nbsp; Respondents, together with the automobile and footlocker, which was admittedly under the agents' exclusive control, were then taken to the Federal Building in Boston.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">An hour and a half after the arrests</span> the agents opened the footlocker without respondents' consent or a search warrant and found large amounts of marihuana in it.&nbsp; Respondents were subsequently indicted for possession of marihuana with intent to distribute it.&nbsp; The District Court granted their pretrial motion to suppress the marihuana obtained from the footlocker, holding that <span style="font-style: italic;">warrantless searches are per se unreasonable</span> under the Fourth Amendment <span style="font-style: italic;">unless</span> they fall within some <span style="font-style: italic;">established exception</span> to the warrant requirement, and that the footlocker search was not justified under either the <u>'</u><span style="font-style: italic;">automobile exception</span><u>'</u> or as a <span style="font-style: italic;">search incident to a lawful arrest</span>; the Court of Appeals affirmed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote>The U.S. Supreme Court, speaking through Mr. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, responding to the Governments argument that the rationale of the Court's automobile search cases applied as well to <span style="font-style: italic;">Chadwick</span>, ruled that the footlocker's mobility does not "justify dispensing with the added protections of the Warrant Clause" for, "[o]nce the federal agents had seized it at the rail road station and had <span style="font-style: italic;">safely transferred</span> it to the Boston Federal Building under their exclusive control, there was not the slightest danger that the foot­locker or its contents could have been removed before a valid search warrant could be obtained."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>As to the contention of the Government that the search fell within the search-incident-to-a-lawful-arrest exception, the U.

Furthermore, if subjective good faith alone was the test, the protection afforded the Filipino people by our present Constitution against unreasonable arrest, search and seizure would evaporate and rendered its provision nugatory, and our people 'would be secured in their persons, houses, papers and effects only in the discretion of the police'.&nbsp; And besides, what would they have lost if they secured a warrant first?&nbsp; Would it have frustrated their efforts in enforcing the provisions of the Customs and Tariff Code if they secured the necessary warrant before making the apprehension and search? Would it have thwarted the purposes of the Customs and Tariff Code and would the results have been different if they had taken the trouble of securing the necessary warrants, and made the apprehension and search in accordance with the Constitution?&nbsp; It would have hardly made any difference.&nbsp; These over earnestness and zealousness on the part of the officers in the discharge of their function, is what we should guard against.&nbsp; We might impress on them the importance to our well ordered society of the 'rule of law' - which necessarily imply respect for and obedience to the Constitution and the laws of the land.&nbsp; This we can do by making it clear to them that the fruits of such unreasonable searches and seizures, are 'forbidden fruits' - inadmissible in evidence." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote>Granting <span style="font-style: italic;">arguendo</span> that the RASAC agents had no opportunity after they apprehended respondents to secure the necessary search and seizure warrant during the period prior to their arrival at Camp Aguinaldo, they certainly could have delayed the actual search and seizure until the necessary warrant had been obtained, which would not have taken them beyond mid-afternoon of the same day.&nbsp; The inconvenience which could be caused by the delay to respondents Hope and Medina would at least be tolerable, for such inconvenience could be quantifiable only in terms of hours spent while waiting, rather than the transgression of their rights through the warrantless search and seizure which could be measured only in terms of fundamental constitutional values violated.<br><br>The case at bar offers no situation "where it is not practicable to secure a warrant because the vehicle can be quickly moved out of the locality or jurisdiction in which the warrant must be sought. " As previously stated, after the interception, "Agent Sabado boarded the Dodge car with the respondents" and directed Sgt. Hope the route he should take.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Agent Sabado had, in effect, taken custody or control of Sgt. Hope's Dodge sedan, for, being in there, on hand at all times from the moment he boarded it through the trip to Bonanza Restaurant, Tropical Hut Foodmart and, finally, Camp Aguinaldo to guard against any deviation by Sgt. Hope from the route he had been directed to take or against any attempt to run off with the car and its contents, his presence had neutralized, if not eliminated, the said car's mobility.&nbsp; Moreover, the RASAC agents, by directing the Dodge sedan to Camp Aguinaldo and retaining it within the premises of the said Camp, had effected its complete immobilization as well as of its contents.&nbsp; Definitely, under all these circumstances, there could not have been the slightest possibility that Sgt. Hope and Medina could have either moved the car or removed its contents - all securely within the custody of the RASAC agents and the premi­ses of Camp Aguinaldo - before the necessary search and seizure warrant could be secured.<br><br>Neither can the warrantless search in the case at bar be viewed as a search incident to a valid arrest so as to fall within another recognized exception from the warrant requirement.&nbsp; In <span style="font-style: italic;">Preston v.

If their evidence in the seizure proceedings established that respondents had no part whatever in the importation or purchase by the claimant-intervenor of the goods, the very same evidence cannot possibly lead to their being found guilty <span style="font-style: italic;">beyond reasonable doubt</span> of the smuggling charge nor overcome their fundamental right of presumption of innocence.<br><br>The main issue at bar as to the non-admissibility in evidence of the boxes and their photographs as ruled in respondent judge's questioned order (which according to the petition has "the effect of acquitting the accused [respondents] from the charges" in the criminal case below) has thus been rendered moot by respondents customs authorities' decision and findings.&nbsp; The disposition of this case by the majority opinion of setting aside respondent judge's order and ordering the case "remanded for further trial and reception of evidence without excluding the articles subject of the seizure" has likewise been thus rendered moot.&nbsp; The admission in evidence of the said boxes or their photographs whose contents have been found to be lawfully owned and purchased in good faith by the claimant-intervenor Antonio del Rosario would in no way establish any criminal liability on the part of respondents.<br><br>Stated in another way, assuming that the seized goods or photos thereof are admissible in evidence notwithstanding the warrantless search and seizure (justified on the doctrine of "hot pursuit"), as held in the majority opinion, still the People's petition should be dismissed since the admission in evidence of the said goods which have been <span style="font-style: italic;">determined by the Customs authorities themselves</span> to have been <span style="font-style: italic;">lawfully purchased in good faith by the claimant-intervenor</span> would in no way establish any criminal liability for the importation or transitory possession by respondents, who were found by said authorities to be merely bringing them back to Manila on behalf of the owner.&nbsp; If the prosecution's evidence in the seizure proceedings established that respondents had no part whatever in the importation or purchase by the claimant-intervenor of the goods, the <span style="font-style: italic;">very same evidence cannot</span> possibly lead to their being found <span style="font-style: italic;">guilty beyond reasonable doubt</span> of the smuggling charge in the case before us nor overcome their fundamental right of presumption of innocence.<br><br>The majority opinion penned by Mr. Justice Guerrero, however, reaches the conclusion that despite respondents' exoneration in the ad­ministrative cases, the criminal responsibility can be determined only in the separate criminal action while conceding that such criminal responsibility "must be proven not by preponderance of evidence but by <span style="font-style: italic;">proof beyond reasonable doubt</span>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>This posture of the majority that any dismissal of the criminal case should not be ordered outright by this Court but by the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span>, whether <span style="font-style: italic;">motu proprio</span> or at the prosecution's instance, is nonetheless understandable.<br><br>I join the Court's directive in its judgment that in consonance with the respondents-accused's right to speedy trial and justice that the prosecution forthwith "reassess and reevaluate the evidence at its disposal" and thereafter "promptly take the necessary action in the premises for the protection of the rights and interests of all concerned."<br><br>This means, as indicated above, that if the prosecution's evidence (as supplied by the customs authorities) is totally devoid of "any evidence circumstantial or otherwise" that would establish any complicity on the part of respondents "to a reasonable degree of certainty", as determined in the very Collector's decision of April 1, 1975 itself as affirmed by the Commissioner of Customs, then the prosecution must as a simple matter of fairness and justice move for the dismissal of the criminal case below.&nbsp;
