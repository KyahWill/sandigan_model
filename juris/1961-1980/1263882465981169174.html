				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission
in RO4-WC Case No. 160990.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner is the mother of the late Hernando S. <span class="SpellE">Mulingtapang</span>, who, during his lifetime, was employed by
respondent Marcelo Steel Corporation <span style="">as
<span class="GramE">maintenance</span> lubricator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hernando S. <span class="SpellE">Mulingtapang</span>
died on </span><st1:date month="10" day="26" year="1974"><span style="">October 26, 1974</span></st1:date><span style="">, after a bout with pneumonia which he
contracted or began to feel on </span><st1:date month="9" day="3" year="1974"><span style="">September 3, 1974</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, a claim for death benefits was filed on <st1:date month="11" day="29" year="1974">November 29, 1974</st1:date> with the
Department of Labor, Regional Office No. IV<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attached</span> to, and made an integral part
of, the claim was a physician's <span style="">report
dated </span><st1:date month="11" day="25" year="1974"><span style="">November 25, 1974</span></st1:date><span style=""> with a diagnostic </span>finding that the deceased died of
"pneumonia, sec. acute leukemia" (p. 7, WCC rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 23, 1975, an acting referee of the Department of
Labor's Workmen's Compensation Unit rendered a decision ordering respondent
Marcelo Steel Corporation to pay petitioner the sum of Four Thousand One
Hundred Sixty (P4<span class="GramE">,160.00</span>) Pesos as death benefits plus
Two Hundred (P200.00) Pesos as burial expenses; and to this Office, the amount
of Forty-Two (P42.00) Pesos as administrative fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The basic facts of the claim are:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the deceased Hernando S. <span class="SpellE">Mulingtapang</span> during
his lifetime was employed by the respondent Marcelo Steel Corporation as maintenance
lubricator with an annual salary of P3,428.24; that on September 3, 1974, he
got sick while on du<span style="">t</span>y and was
advised to seek hospitalization by Miss <span class="SpellE">Quinida</span> P. de
Vera, company nurse; that on September 10, 1974, the respondent corporation
filed its <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> on the ground that Hernando's
illness which it claimed as fever, leukemia was not work-connected (p. 43, WCC
rec.); that on October 14, 22 and 26, 1974, he was treated for his illness
diagnosed <span style="">as
</span>pneumonia, secondary acute leukemia by Dr. Jose E. <span class="SpellE">Abjelina</span>
at the Don Juan <span class="SpellE">Mayuga</span> Memorial Hospital, <span class="SpellE">Lemery</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, where he died
on October 26, 1974 (p. 7, WCC rec.); and at the time of his death, he was
survived by his dependent father and mother, namely, <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span>
M. <span class="SpellE">Mulingtapang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> S.
<span class="SpellE">Mulingtapang</span>, but the father subsequently died on
January 30, 1975 (p. 16, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">In so awarding death benefits in favor of herein petitioner, the
acting referee brushed aside as unmeri­torious the defense interposed by the
respondent corpora­tion that the "ailment that caused the death of the
deceased was not work-connected nor aggravated and therefore, not
compensable" as supported by the affi­davit of three doctors, namely, Dr.
Leonardo C. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, Dr. Nestor A. <span class="SpellE">Laceda</span>
and Dr. Rodolfo Ramirez, that the illness of leukemia is not an occupational
disease, nor work-caused nor work-aggravated, and could be contracted by any
person, irrespective of age, work or station in life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, the acting referee relied on the
legal presumption of compensability that arose from its undisputed finding that
"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <u>the ailment which caused the death of
the deceased supervened in the course of employment</u>" (emphasis
supplied) as well as on the <span style="">certification
of the attending physician, Dr. Jose <span class="SpellE">Abjelina</span>, to the
effect that the illness that caused the death of subject was aggravated by the
nature of his work and that strenuous activity of an acute leukemia patient may
be a cause of pneumonia (p. 7, WCC rec.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">But upon a motion for reconsideration filed by the respondent
corporation, the respondent Commission, although maintaining the basic facts of
the case as found by the acting referee, reversed the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
decision, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"At the threshold, it may be stated that acute leukemia or
pneu­monia is not an occupational disease, hence, the same is not compensable <u><span style="">per</span></u><span style=""> <u>se</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be argued,
however, that having supervened in the course of employment, it is presumed
that the illness also arose out of the deceased's employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no quarrel here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, it should be pointed out
that the statutory presumption of compensability is a <span class="SpellE">rebuttable</span>
one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The burden of proof is on the
respondent-employer to show that while the illness, subject to the claim,
supervened in the course of employment, it does not neces­sarily follow that it
also arose from the employment or at least aggravated by it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, it should be admitted
that the illness of the deceased supervened in the course of his employment,
hence, inevitably from the start, the claimant enjoys the pro­tective shelter
of the statutory presump­tion that herein claim is compensable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>But after carefully examining the records
of the case and weighing the evidence of the parties, we find and so hold that
the respondent has adduced substantial evi­dence to overcome the presumption of
compensability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it was shown that
the deceased was employed as a lubricator maintenance worker which does not
require strenuous work.<o:p></o:p></u></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the light of the foregoing, we are inclined to hold that
the illness <span style="">of the deceased, which
caused his death, was not the result of his work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The illness is not peculiar or inherent in
the nature and char­acteristic and condition of his work as a lubricator
maintenance laborer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="GramE">sic</span>)"
[</span><span style="">pp.</span><span style=""> 74-75, WCC <span class="SpellE">rec</span>;
emphasis supplied].<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The main thrust of the present petition is that respondent
Commission gravely abused its dis­cretion in finding and concluding that the
evidence presented by <span class="GramE">respondent corporation</span> was
substantial enough to overcome the presumption of compensability.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">WE find the petition
meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, </span><span class="GramE"><span style="">We</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">reverse the questioned decision of the respondent Commission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><u>I</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The conclusion
of the respondent Commission that the work of the deceased Hernando S. <span class="SpellE">Mulingtapang</span> as lubricator maintenance worker did "x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> </span>not require strenuous work,"
finds no support in the records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>WE find
in the records no evidence, and the respondent corporation does not claim to
have presented any, on the nature of the deceased's work with the respondent
corporation which would indeed show that the actual work of the deceased was
not strenuous.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><u>II</u>. Because the only evidence presented <span style="">by </span>the respondent corporation before
the acting referee consisted of the affidavits of the three doctors earlier
mentioned, it is thus safe to conclude that the respondent Commission anchored
its express finding of substantial evidence of respondent corporation as having
overcome the presumption of compensability on the said affidavits, ail of
which, as earlier stated, merely opined that the illness of leukemia is not an
occupational disease; nor work-connected or -aggravated and which could <span style="">be contracted </span>by any person
irrespective of age, work or station in life.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In so basing its aforesaid conclusion of subst<span style="">a</span>ntial evidence, the <span style="">re</span><span style="">spondent Commission </span><span style="">commit</span><span style="">t</span><span style="">ed a patent error </span><span style="">amounting to a grave abuse of
discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">For the </span><span style="">evidence neces­sary to </span><span style="">destroy
the </span><span style="">aforesaid legal presumption
of com­pensability must do </span><span style="">more
than create a doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">It must be such as a reasonable mind must
accept as adequate to support a conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, We have repeatedly ruled that the mere opinions of doctors on the
non-causal </span>connection between illness and/or death and the nature of
claimant's work, presented as evidence by the employer, do not meet the
required quantum of evidence as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>; and
therefore, such opinions cannot prevail over the pre­sumption of compensability
established by law (Simon vs. Republic, 71 SCRA 646 [1977]; Maria Cristina
Fertilizer Corporation vs. WCC, 60 SCRA 228 [1974]; <span class="SpellE">Abana</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Quisum­bing</span>, 22 SCRA 1282-1283 [1968]; and <span class="SpellE">Magalona</span> vs. WCC, 21 SCRA 1203 [1967]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, WE have applied with pedantic rigor the aforesaid
legal presumption of compensability even in the absence of a definite finding
or knowledge of the precise medical cause of the claimant's illness as long as
the illness and/or death supervened in the course of employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">For precisely, the vital
function of legal presumptions is to dispense with the need for proof.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in Castro vs. WCC (75 SCRA 179-180 [1977]), WE reiterated
that WE stated in ITEMCOP vs. <span class="SpellE">Florzo</span> (16 SCRA 2104 [1966])
that:</p>

<blockquote>"At any rate, the law presumes, in the absence of substantial
evidence to the contrary, that the claim is com­pensable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The burden to disconnect by substantial
evidence the injury or sickness from <span class="GramE">employment,</span> is
laid at the employer's door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So rigid is
the rule <span style="">that even where the cause of
the employee's death is unknown -- as petitioners claim -- ­the right to
compensation subsists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reason for this
is that the Workmen's Compensation Act is a social legislation; it is designed
to give relief to the workmen; therefore, to effectuate its purpose, it must be
liberally construed x <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><u>III</u>. The records likewise show that petitioner's <u>claim
for death benefits filed on November 29, 1974</u> was not effectively <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>; because it did not dispute that it had
knowledge of the death of its deceased employee, through its company physician,
as of the very date of his death or on <u>October 26, 1974</u> (pp. 13-14,
rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Employer's Report filed only
on <st1:date month="12" day="9" year="1974"><u>December 9, 1974</u></st1:date> was
too late and therefore did not constitute a timely compliance with the
requirement<span style=""> </span>that the same should
be filed within ten days from <span style="">knowledge
of the disability or within 14 days from the disability or death (Section 45 of
the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent corpora­tion cannot avail of the <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>
it filed on September </span><span style="">10, 1974
(p. 43, </span><span style="">WCC rec.) on the ground
of non-work connection, because the same was filed in connection with the
illness (which it claimed as high fever, leukemia) contracted on September 3,
1974 by Hernando which it acquired knowledge of on even date through its
foreman (p. 15, WCC rec.); and not his death on October </span><span style="">26, 1974 by </span><span style="">reason of pneumonia, secondary acute leukemia (p. </span><span style="">7, </span><span style="">WCC rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the records stand,
the claim for death benefits of peti­tioner was not timely <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being an <span class="SpellE">uncontro­verted</span>
claim, its disposition must therefore proceed from the premises that the
respondent corporation has renounced its right to challenge the validity of the
claim as it was thereby barred by such failure from interposing
non-jurisdictional defenses, such as non-­compensability of the claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, respondent Commission likewise erred
in ignoring the aforesaid effects of non-<span class="SpellE">controversion</span>
in disposing the peti­tioner's claim for death benefits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><u><span style="">IV</span></u><span style="">. </span>It appearing that petitioner was
represented by counsel only before this Court, a corresponding award of
attorney's fees should be made equivalent to five (5) percent of the total
benefits herein awarded.<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
