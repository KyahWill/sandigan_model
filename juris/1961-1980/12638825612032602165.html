decision dated <st1:date year="1972" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1972</st1:date>
of the Court of First Instance of Manila in Civil Case No. 83962 which
dismissed his complaint for declaratory relief and reinstatement in the
government service.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The incidents which led to this suit are set forth in the
decision of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The plaintiff was formerly employed as a private secretary in
the President's Private Office, <span class="SpellE">Malacañan</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
having been appointed to that position on <st1:date year="1961" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1961</st1:date> with a salary of P4,188.00 per annum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is a third grade civil service
eligible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On or about the second week of
January, 1962, the then Executive Secretary <span class="SpellE">Amelito</span>
R. <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span>, by means of a letter dated <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1962</st1:date>, informed the
plaintiff that his services as private secretary in the President's Private
Office were 'terminated effective today'.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A similar letter was addressed by Secretary <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span>
to some other employees in the Office of the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dismissed employees appealed to the
President by means of letters dated <st1:date year="1962" day="3" month="1">January
 3, 1962</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1962" day="26" month="1">January 26,
 1962</st1:date> for a reconsideration of their separation from the
service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a letter dated <st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1962</st1:date>, their request for
reconsideration was denied by Secretary <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span>, acting
'by authority of the President'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On March 24, 1962, five of the employees who were separated
(not including the herein plaintiff) filed a civil action before the Court of
First Instance of Manila against Secretary <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> and
the cash-disbursing officer of the Office of the President praying for
reinstatement and the payment of their salaries effective as of January 1,
1962, entitled 'Raul R. Ingles, et <span class="SpellE">als</span>. vs. <span class="SpellE">Amelito</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span>, et <span class="SpellE">als</span>.' Civil Case No. 49965.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From <span style="">a judgment dismissing their
complaint, the said employees appealed to the Supreme Court which rendered a
decision promulgated on November 29, 1968 reversing the dismissal of their
complaint and declaring their removal from office as illegal and contrary to
law, and ordering their reinstatement and the payment of their salaries from
January 1, 1962 up to the date of their actual reinstatement (G.R. No. L-20390).</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sometime in May, 1962, when the civil action filed by Raul R.
Ingles, et <span class="SpellE">als</span>. was still pending in the Court of
First Instance of Manila, the dismissed employees who filed said action were
recalled to their positions in the Office of the President, without prejudice
to the continuation of their civil action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With respect to the other employees who were not reinstated, efforts
were exerted by Secretary <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> to look for
placements outside of <span class="SpellE">Malacañan</span> so that they may be
reemployed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The herein plaintiff was one
of those who had not been fortunate enough to be reappointed to any position as
befits his qualifications.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"He waited for Secretary <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> to
make good his assurance that he would be recalled to the service, until
Secretary <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> was replaced by other executive
secretaries who likewise assured the plaintiff of assistance to be reemployed
at 'the opportune time'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After the decision of the Supreme Court in G.R. No. L-20390
was promulgated on <st1:date year="1968" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1968</st1:date>,
the plaintiff addressed a letter to the Office of the President dated <st1:date year="1969" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1969</st1:date>, requesting
reinstatement to his former position and the payment of salary from <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1962</st1:date> up to the time of
actual reinstatement, supposedly in accordance with the decision of the Supreme
Court in the aforementioned case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
request was denied repeatedly by the Office of the President in successive
letters addressed to the plaintiff dated September 1, 1969, January 19, 1970,
April 23, 1970, May 23, 1970 and May 19, 1971, the last of which dec<span style="">lared the matter 'definitely closed'."

<p class="BODY">Having received the letter of <st1:date year="1971" day="19" month="5">May 19, 1971</st1:date>, from the Office of the President, Jose <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> filed on <st1:date year="1971" day="10" month="8">August
 10, 1971</st1:date>, with the Court of First Instance of Manila a complaint
naming then Executive Secretary Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> and
Federico <span class="SpellE">Arcala</span>, cash disbursing officer, Office of
the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
as defendants, and praying for the following:</p>

Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> to certify the name of plaintiff in

illegally dismissed from the service;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ordering defendant Federico <span class="SpellE">Arcala</span> to pay all the emoluments and/or salary to which the
plaintiff is entitled effective as of January 1, 1962, the date of his illegal
termination from the service; and</blockquote>

continue with the performance of his duties in the Secretary Office Staff,
Office of the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Plaintiff prays for such other relief or remedy as this
Honorable Court may deem just and equitable under the premises." (pp. 1-3,
ibid.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Answering the complaint, the defendants represented by the Office
of the Solicitor General alleged that plaintiff Jose <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>
had no cause of action as he is deemed to have abandoned his office for failure
to institute the proper proceedings to assert his right within one year from
the date of separation pursuant to Sec. 16, Rule 66 of the Rules of Court, he
having come to court only after the lapse of more than nine years, thereby in
effect acquiescing to his separation, and therefore he is not entitled to any
salary from termination of his employment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(pp. 38-40, ibid.)</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1971" day="16" month="10">October 16, 1971</st1:date>,
an amended complaint was submitted to the trial court to include as additional
defendants Leticia B. <span class="SpellE">Nonato</span> who was allegedly
appointed to the position of Jose <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Nonato</span>, husband of
Leticia B. <span class="SpellE">Nonato</span>, and to invoke the additional
relief for reinstatement to the position occupied by defendant Leticia B. <span class="SpellE">Nonato</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 55-58,
ibid.)</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Nonatos</span> were served with summons
but did not file an answer to the complaint, hence, on motion of the plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>, they were declared in default in an order dated <st1:date year="1972" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1972</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(p. 94, ibid.)</p>

<p class="BODY">A pre-trial was held after which parties submitted "a
partial stipulation of facts" dated <st1:date year="1976" day="26" month="2">February 26, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(pp. 102-104, ibid.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Trial on the merits was held during which plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> submitted his documentary evidence marked
respectively as Exhibits "A" to "P" inclusive all of which
were admitted by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Counsel for the defendants then manifested that no evidence was being
presented for the government.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1972</st1:date>,
as already adverted to above, the trial court then presided by the Honorable <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> Vasquez, now Justice of the Court of Appeals,
rendered its decision dismissing the complaint reasoning in the following
manner:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 16 of Rule 66 of the Rules of Court expressly
provides that an action against a public office or employee may not be filed
for the plaintiff's ouster from office unless the same is commenced within one
year after the cause of the ouster, or the right of the plaintiff to hold such
office or position arose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This period of
one year is a condition precedent for the existence of the cause of action for
quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> (<span class="SpellE">Bumanlag</span> vs.
Fernandez, G.R. No. L-11482, <st1:date year="1960" day="29" month="11">November
 29, 1960</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rationale of
this doctrine is that the Government must be immediately informed or advised if
any person claims to be entitled to an office or position in the civil service,
as against another actually holding it, so that the Government may not be faced
with the predicament of having to pay two salaries, <span style="">one for the person actually holding the office although illegally, and
another for one not actually rendering service although entitled to do so
(Madrid vs. Auditor General, G.R. No. L-12523, </span><st1:date year="1960" day="31" month="5"><span style="">May 31, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
fact that the petitioner sought to pursue administrative remedies to secure his
reinstatement does not excuse the failure to file the action within the one
year period.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of administrative remedies
does not operate to suspend the period of one year within which a petition for
quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> should be filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it may be desirable that administrative
remedies be first resorted to, no one is compelled or bound to do so, and as
said remedies neither are pre-requisite to nor bar the institution of quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> proceedings, they should not be allowed to suspend
the period of one year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Public interest
requires that the right to a public office should be determined as speedily as
practi­cable' (3 Moran, 1963 Ed., p. 207, citing Torres vs. <span class="SpellE">Quintos</span>,
G.R. No. L-3304, <st1:date year="1951" day="5" month="4">April 5, 1951</st1:date>)."
(pp. 154-155, ibid.)</p>

<p class="BODY">We are now confronted with the following assignment of errors in
appellant <span class="SpellE">Cristobal's</span> brief, to wit:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">"I</p>

<blockquote>"THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER COURT</st1:address></st1:street>

THAT HAS BEEN DECLARED BY THE SUPREME COURT AS ILLEGAL AND CONTRARY TO LAW
SHOULD BE GOVERNED BY THE SUBSTANTIVE LAW ON PRESCRIPTION OF ACTION." (p.
26, <span class="SpellE">rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="">The primary question to be resolved in
this appeal is whether or not appellant <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>
lost his right to seek judicial relief for not having filed his complaint
within the one-year period provided for in Section 16, Rule 66 of the Rules of
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, is the principle of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> or non-compliance with the "Statute of
Limitations" applicable against appellant?</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">The Government holds fast to Section
16, Rule 66 of the Rules of Court and so did the court <u>a quo</u> in
upholding the dismissal of appellant's complaint which according to both is
essentially a <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span> proceeding.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">We agree with defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> that in this jurisdiction the consistent doctrine
followed by this Court is that in actions of <u>quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span></u>
involving right to an office, the action must be instituted within the period
of one year from the time the cause of action arose.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="">Verily, this Court has stated in <span class="SpellE"><u>Unabia</u></span><u> vs. City Mayor, et al.,</u> 99 Phil. 253,
257:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
This has been the law in the <st1:place>Island</st1:place> since 1901, the
period having been originally fixed in section 216 of the Code of Civil
Procedure (Act No. 190).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find this
provision to be an expression of policy on the part of the State that persons
claiming a right to an office of which they are illegally dispossessed should
immediately take steps to recover said office and that if they do not do so
within a period of one year, they shall be considered as having lost their
right thereto by abandonment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are
weighty reasons of public policy and convenience that demand the adoption of a
similar period for persons claiming rights to positions in the civil
service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There must be stability in the
service so that public business may not be unduly retarded; <span style="">delays in the statement of the right to
positions in the service must be discouraged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>xx <span class="SpellE">xx</span> <span class="SpellE">xx</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Further, the Government must be immediately informed or
advised if any person claims to be entitled to an office or a position in the
civil service as against another actually holding it, so that the Government
may not be faced with the predicament of having <span style="">to pay two salaries, one, for the person actually holding the office,
although illegally, and another, for one not actually rendering service
although entitled to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold that
in view of the policy of the State contained in the law fixing the period of
one year within which actions for <u>quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span></u>
may be instituted, any person claiming right to a position in the civil service
should also be required to file his petition for reinstatement with the period
of one year, otherwise he is thereby considered as having abandoned his
office."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In effect, it is the doctrine of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>
which is invoked to defeat Jose <span class="SpellE">Cristobal's</span> suit, for
not only did <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> fail to file his complaint
within one year from the date of separation but, it is claimed, he allowed
almost nine years to pass before coming to court by reason of which he is
deemed to have acquiesced to his removal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Tijam</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Sibonghanoy</span>,</u> this Court stated that in a general sense,
<span class="SpellE"><u>laches</u></span> is failure or neglect, for an
unreasonable and unexplained length of time, to do that which, by exercising
due diligence, could or should have been done earlier; it is negligence or
omission to assert a right within a reasonable time, warranting a presumption
that the party entitled to assert it either has abandoned it or declined to
assert it.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">However, as will be indicated below, there are certain
exceptional circumstances attending which take this case out of the rule
enunciated above and lead Us to grant relief to appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus --</p>

<p class="NUM">1. There was <u>no</u> acquiescence to or inaction on the part of
Jose <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> amounting to abandonment of his right
to reinstatement in office.</p>

<p class="BODY">We lay stress on the findings of the trial court based on <u>the <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span> evidence of plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span></u>
that upon receipt of the letter of January 1, 1962, advising him of his
separation from the service, <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>, with the
other dismissed employees, sought reconsideration in a letter dated January 3,
1962, calling <u>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></u> the attention of then
Executive Secretary <span class="SpellE">Amelito</span> <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span>
that he (<span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>) was a civil service eligible
employee with eight years of service in the government and consequently
entitled to security of tenure under the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was followed by another letter of <st1:date year="1962" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1962</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Reconsideration having been denied, a complaint was filed on <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="3">March 24, 1962</st1:date>, with the Court of

<st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court dismissed this complaint but
upon appeal to the Supreme Court the judgment was reversed in a Decision
promulgated on <u>November 29, 1968,</u> in G.R. L-20390, the Court holding
that the removal of the plaintiff-employees was illegal and contrary to law and
that they were entitled to be reinstated with payment of their salaries from
January 1, 1962 up to the date of their actual reinstatement.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> was not one of the plaintiffs
in the civil case, it is true, but his non-participation is not fatal to his
cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the civil case <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>
continued to press his request for reinstatement together with the other
employees who had filed the complaint and was in fact promised reinstatement as
will be shown more in detail later.</p>

<p class="BODY">More importantly, <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> could be
expected - without necessarily spending time and money by going to court - to <span class="SpellE">relie</span> upon the outcome of the case filed by his co-employees
to protect his interests considering the similarity of his situation to that of
the plaintiffs therein and the identical relief being sought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this point, We find a statement of Justice
Louis Brandeis of the United States Supreme Court in <u>Southern Pacific vs. <span class="SpellE">Bogert</span></u>, relevant and persuasive, and We quote:</p>

<blockquote>"The essence of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> is not merely

<p class="BODY">The evidence of <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> establish the

continuation of the civil action, he would work for their reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, some of the dismissed employees
were recalled to their respective positions in the Office of the President
among whom were the plaintiffs in the civil case and several others who were

<p class="BODY">It was this continued promise of the government officials concerned
which led Cristobal to bide his time and wait for the Office of the President
to comply with its commitment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, he had behind him the decision of the Supreme Court in <u>Ingles
vs. <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span></u> which he believed should be applied in
his favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>,
in answer to his various letters, received the letter of May 19, 1971 from the
Office of the President denying his reinstatement and declaring the matter
"definitely closed" because of his failure to file an action in court
within one year from his separation,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
it was only then that he saw the necessity of seeking redress from the courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">Surely, it would now be the height of inequity and cutting a deep
wound in Our sense of justice, if after <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>
relied and reposed his faith and trust on the word and promises of the former
Executive Secretaries who dealt with him and who preceded the herein respondent
Executive Secretary <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>, We were to hold that he
lost his right to seek relief because of lapse of time.</p>

<p class="BODY">The doctrine of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> is an equitable
principle applied to promote but never to defeat justice.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, where <span class="SpellE">laches</span> is invoked against a plaintiff by
reason of the latter's failure to come to court within the statutory period
provided in the law, the doctrine of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> will not
be taken against him where the defendant is shown to have promised from time to
time to grant the relief sought for.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Again, We have jurisprudence that where a defendant or those claiming under him
recognized or directly or impliedly acknowledged existence of the right
asserted by a plaintiff, such recognition may be invoked as a valid excuse for
a plaintiff's delay in seeking to enforce such right.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
In brief, it is indeed the better rule that courts, under the principle of
equity, will not be guided or bound strictly by the statute of limitations or
the doctrine of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> when to do so, <u>manifest
wrong and injustice would result.</u><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3. The dismissal of appellant <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>
was contrary to law on the strength of this Court's Decision in <u>Ingles vs. <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span>. <o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Ingles</u> the defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
maintained before this Court that the principal issue in the case was whether
or not the plaintiffs-employees were occupying positions primarily confidential
in nature and therefore subject to removal at the pleasure of the appointing
power, and that this issue was to be resolved in the affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court speaking through then Justice,
later Chief Justice, Roberto <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, held <u>inter
<span class="SpellE">alia</span></u> that one holding in the government a
primarily confidential position is "in the Civil Service" and that
"officers or employees in the unclassified" as well as "those in
the classified service" are protected by the provision in the organic law
that "no officer or employee in the Civil Service shall be removed or
suspended except for cause as provided by law" (Section 4, Article XII,
1935 Constitution); that while the incumbent of a primarily confidential
position holds office at the pleasure only of the appointing power and such
pleasure turns into displeasure, the incumbent is not "removed" or
"dismissed" but that his term merely "expires"; that there
was no evidence to indicate that the respective positions of the dismissed plaintiffs
were "primarily confidential" in nature and on the contrary the
compensation attached and the designation given thereto suggest the purely or
at least mainly clerical nature of their work; and consequently, considering
that the plaintiffs were admittedly civil service <span class="SpellE">eligibles</span>
with several years of service in the Government, their removal from office was
"illegal and contrary to law".<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court's Decision in <u>Ingles vs. <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span></u>
constitutes <u>the law of the case</u> now before Us.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant herein, Jose <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>, is a
civil service eligible with eight (8) years of service in the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was holding "Item 9” - "Private
Secretary I" - in the Budget for the "President's Private
Office" with annual compensation of P4,188.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No evidence was adduced by the government to
show that <span class="SpellE">Cristobal's</span> position was "primarily
confidential".<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
On the contrary as stated by this Court in <u>Ingles vs. <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span></u>
the compensation attached to this item and the other items except for one and
the designation of the position <u>indicate the purely clerical nature</u> of
the functions of the employees dismissed from the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, none of the letters sent to the
herein appellant from the Office of the President ever indicated that he was
holding his position at the pleasure of the appointing power or that his
services were terminated because his term of office had
"expired".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only reason
given - and this appears in the letter of September 1, 1969 from the Office of
the President - was that he failed to institute the proper proceeding to assert
his right, if any, to the position within the period of one year from the date
of termination and under settled jurisprudence he is deemed to have abandoned
his right to said office or acquiesced in his removal.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To summarize, with the circumstances thus surrounding this
particular case, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) Jose <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>
consistently pressed for a reconsideration of his separation from the service;
(b) he was given assurance that he would be recalled at the opportune time; and
(c) that the sudden termination of his employment without cause after eight
years of service in the government <u>is contrary to law</u> following the
ruling in <u>Ingles vs. <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span></u> which inures to the
benefit of <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> who is similarly situated as the
plaintiffs in said case and who merely desisted from joining the suit because
of the assurance given him that he would be recalled to the service - with all
these factors, We repeat, there is justification for not applying existing
jurisprudence to his case.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court, applying the principle of equity, need not be bound
to a rigid application of the law, but rather its action should conform to the
conditions or exigencies of a given problem or situation in order to grant a
relief that will serve the ends of justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">To paraphrase then Chief Justice John Edwin Marshall of the
United States Supreme Court, let us do complete justice and not do justice by
halves.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Just as in <u>Ingles vs. <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span></u> this Court gave
justice to plaintiffs, so shall We do justice to Jose <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In granting relief to the herein appellant on the matter of back
salaries We note, however, that there is no proof to show that during all these
years from <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1962</st1:date>,
to the present, appellant at no time worked or was employed at some other
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fairness to the Government We
cannot ignore the probability of <span class="SpellE">Cristobal's</span> having sought
employment elsewhere during that period to support himself and his family.</p>

<p class="BODY">Applying by analogy the rulings of this Court in the matter of
fixing back wages to employees who were victims of unfair labor practices of
their employers so as to obviate the necessity of a hearing on the point and
avoid further delay, and considering the lapse of almost nine years before
appellant filed this suit, We resolve, to grant back salaries at the rate last
received by him <u>only for a period of five (5) years without qualification
and deduction</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>
