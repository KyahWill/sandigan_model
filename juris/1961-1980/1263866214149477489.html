<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The facts of this case are not 
disputed: In connection with the proceeding for the settlement of the intestate 
estate of the deceased Beatriz <span class="SpellE">Cosio</span> de <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>, and pursuant to the order of the Court of First 
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> before which the proceeding is 
pending, a notice to all persons with money claims against the deceased to file 
their said claims within six months, was duly published, and first notice 
appearing in the August 13, 1958 issue of the Manila Chronicle. On 
</span><st1:date month="1" day="27" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 27, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
administrator filed an inventory of the estate, showing assets amounting to 
P139,596.77 and liabilities in the sum of P33,012.95. The period provided in the 
published notice having expired without anybody filing any claim against the 
deceased, the administrator, upon order of the court, submitted a final account 
of the estate and a project of partition, which were approved on 
</span><st1:date month="5" day="12" year="1960"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">May 12, 
1960</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
Under date of </span><st1:date month="6" day="7" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 7, 
1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
however, Cherie <span class="SpellE">Palileo</span> petitioned the court for 
permission to file a claim in the proceeding, alleging that in the decision of 
the Court of Appeals in CA-G. R. No. 22556-B, promulgated on May 6, 1961, she 
obtained a money judgment against the deceased Beatriz C. de <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>; that although the lower court decided in her favor the 
question of ownership and possession of a real property involved in the case, it 
was only the Court of Appeals that granted money judgment, when the case was 
decided on appeal. The administrator opposed this petition on the ground that 
the claim was filed beyond the period provided in the notice to 
creditor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">By order of </span><st1:date month="8" day="3" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 3, 
1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
lower court sustained the claimant and allowed her to file her claim within one 
month from receipt of said order, it appearing that no final decree of 
distribution has as yet been entered in the case. This appeal from the aforesaid 
order, brought by the administrator, raises the issue of when money claims 
against a deceased person may be filed in the proceeding for the settlement of 
the estate of such deceased person. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Section 2 of Rule 87 of the old 
Rules of Court (now Rule 86) provides: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"SEC. 2. <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Time within which claims shall be 
filed</span></em>.-In the notice provided in section 1, the court shall state 
the time for the filing of claims against the estate, which shall not be more 
than twelve nor loss than six months after the date of the first publication, of 
the notice. However, at any time before an order of distribution is entered, on 
application of a creditor who has failed to file his claim within the time 
previously limited, the court may, for cause shown and on such terms as arc 
equitable, allow such claim to be filed within a time not exceeding one month." 
<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is clear from the foregoing 
that the period prescribed in the notice to creditors is not exclusive; money 
claims against the estate may be allowed any time before an order of 
distribution is entered, at the discretion of the court, for cause and upon such 
terms as are equitable. This extension of the period shall not exceed one 
month,<sup><span style="color: red;">[1]</span></sup> from the issuance of the 
order authorizing such extension.<sup><span style="color: red;">[2]</span></sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> in the instant case that no order of 
distribution of the estate has as yet been made. Appellant, however, charges 
that the lower court committed an abuse of discretion in issuing the disputed 
order without sufficient ground or cause <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>. The 
petition of claimant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, for permission to file 
a claim in the proceeding, was based on the fact that the award of damages in 
her favor, against the deceased Beatriz C. de <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>, 
was contained in the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G1. R. No. 22556-R 
which was promulgated on </span><st1:date month="5" day="6" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">May 6, 
1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> or 
after the 6-month period provided in the notice to creditors had already 
elapsed. It is her contention that she could not have failed a money claim 
against the estate before the promulgation of said decision because although the 
lower court in that case upheld her right to the ownership and possession of the 
building subject thereof, no damages were adjudged in her favor. Considering 
this argument, the lower court found it sufficient to justify the relaxation of 
the rule and extension of the period within which to file her claim. In the 
circumstances, the action taken by the lower court cannot be considered an abuse 
of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction to justify its 
reversal by this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, finding no reversible error in 
the order appealed from, the same is hereby affirmed, with costs against the 
appellant. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">SO ORDERED</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
