				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">At about five-thirty o'clock <span style="">in </span>the afternoon of <st1:date year="1961" day="14" month="2">Feb­ruary <span style="">14, </span>1961</st1:date>, <span style="">a </span>cockfight
jointly sponsored<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Regino</span>
Muril<span style="">lo </span>and <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tividad</span> was held in the <span class="SpellE"><u>sitio</u></span>
of <span class="SpellE">Calumpit</span>, barrio of <span class="SpellE">Calantas</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Calaca</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Batangas</span></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the course of the sport, a heated argument
arose between two bettors brought about by the refusal of one of them to make
good a bet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As co-sponsor of the event, <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Tividad</span> tried to settle
the dispute, to no avail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> Murillo have any success.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In apparent disgust, the latter blurted out, <span style="">"if </span>we
could not agree, we better stop the cockfight”, and then stalked out of the
arena.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tividad</span>, an older bro­ther of <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span>,
<span class="GramE">followed</span> <span class="SpellE">Regino</span>, and, as the
latter stood by the door of the cockpit, gave him a first blow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">two thereupon grappled </span>until <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>, the smaller of the two, fell to the ground with <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> bending over him, firmly holding his shoulders and
trying to pin him down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this <span style="">juncture, <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span>
came running out of the arena and with </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">knife stabbed <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> in the back, </span><span style="">causing the latter
to </span><span style="">fall
on his </span><span style="">buttocks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> then stabbed
him in the neck and breast, causing him to fall on his back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> was
sprawled on the ground, <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> hacked him with a
bolo drawn from the scabbard on <span class="SpellE">Regino'<span style="">s</span></span> <span style="">side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then <span class="SpellE">Fulgencio</span>
</span></span><span style="">came
and, with </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">piece of </span><span style="">bamboo picked up from among those scattered
in the ground, hit <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> on the head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was </span><span style="">followed </span><span style="">by <span class="SpellE">Fructuoso</span> who, with </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">bamboo pole, swung at the prostrate figure of <span class="SpellE">Regino</span>,
hitting the latter on the left arm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
<span class="SpellE">Regino</span> bleeding profusely from his <span style="">wounds, the <span class="SpellE">Tividad</span>
brothers left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> died.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1961" day="28" month="3">March 28, 1961</st1:date> the four brothers were
charged with murder before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due trial, the lower court rendered
judgment, the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">disposi</span><span style="">tive</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">portion of which reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds all the four ac­cused <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>, <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Fulgencio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Fructuoso</span>, all
surnamed <span class="SpellE">Tividad</span>, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of
murder, the killing being qualified by treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being no other modifying cir­cumstance
to consider, the penalty provided for by law for the offense (<u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>
in its maximum period to death) should be imposed in its medium period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, all four accused are hereby sentenced
to life imprisonment, to jointly and severally indemnify the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Re­gino</span> Murillo in the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>,
without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay 1/4 of the
costs each.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">From this decision, the defendants have
appealed to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> <span class="SpellE">Tividad</span> withdrew his
appeal which was accordingly dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants denied complicity in the killing of <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> Murillo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> declared that when he arrived at the cockpit, the
fight was already over and <st1:city><st1:place>Regina</st1:place></st1:city>
was on the ground dying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fulgencio</span> testified similarly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Fructuoso</span>
<span style="">asserted </span><span style="">that when he arrived at the scene of the
fight, his brother <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> had already obtained
possession </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the bolo of the deceased for which reason he
saw no more necessity in <span style="">going to his
brother's aid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>
admitted killing Murillo but only in self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, as he has already with­drawn his</span>
<span style="">appeal, it </span>is no longer
necessary to consider the <span style="">merits of his
defense.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is the theory of the defense that only <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tividad</span> fought with Regina Murillo, and that <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Fulgencio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Fruc­tuoso</span> did not participate therein in any manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only wit­ness presented by the defense
counsel other than the accused themselves was <span class="SpellE">Doroteo</span>
Sara, a resident of barrio <span class="SpellE">Calantas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sara testified that in the afternoon of February
14, 1961, he saw <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> and <span class="SpellE">Regino</span>
fighting with one another; that <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> had a bolo
with which he tried to hack <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>; that the lat­ter
was able to wrest the bolo from <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> and with it
hacked the latter, several times in the chest; that <span class="SpellE">Regino</span>
fell on his back and remained in that position until <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>
desisted <span style="">from </span>the attack; that <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Fulgencio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Fructuoso</span> were present during the fight but did not
intervene therein; that they left <span style="">the cockpit together after the fight; and that he
himself left after the fight had ended.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We have exhaustively examined the record and nowhere do we find
any support for the theory proffered by the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The nature and location of the wounds
sustained by the de­ceased, and the declarations of the prosecution witnesses,
create a different picture of the incident. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="GramE">In the autopsy report (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>.</span> A) <span class="GramE">of</span> the municipal
health officer, Dr. Antonio E. <span class="SpellE">Platon</span>, the eleven
wounds sustained by the deceased are described as follows:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. Stab wound on the left side of the neck cutting the left
carotid artery and vein;</p>

<p class="NUM">2. Cut wound on the mouth cutting all teeth affect­ing also both <span class="SpellE">commissures</span>;</p>

<p class="NUM">3. Cut wound above the right clavicle;</p>

<p class="NUM">4. Stab wound in front right side near the sternum on the third <span class="SpellE">intercostal</span> space down deep into the thoracic cavity about
6 inches deep;</p>

<p class="NUM">5. Cut wound on the left shoulder;</p>

<p class="NUM">6. Stab wound on the left shoulder joint deep about <span style="">5 </span>inches;</p>

<p class="NUM">7. Cut wound on the right thumb;</p>

<p class="NUM">8. Cut wound on the dorsum of the left hand;</p>

<p class="NUM">9. At the back stab wound near the spinal column below the angle
of the right scapula down deep into the thoracic cavity of about <span style="">6 </span>inches deep;</p>

<p class="NUM">10. Cut wound on the left <span class="SpellE">occipito</span>-parietal
junc­tion affecting the skull just reaching the gray matter only;</p>

<p class="NUM">11. Linear longitudinal erosion of the skin from the left ear lobe
to the cheek of same side of about 4 inches in length.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Of these wounds, those described in
paragraphs (1), (4) and (9) were fatal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Any one of them, according to Dr. <span class="SpellE">Platon</span>,
could have caused the death of Murillo.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. <span class="SpellE">Platon</span> classified the wounds into
three groups: (a) cut wounds or those caused by a sharp instrument like a bolo,
(b) stab wounds or those caused by a sharp and pointed instru­ment like a
knife, and (c) the wound described in paragraph 11 of the autopsy report which
was caused by a blunt instrument like a bamboo pole or the handle of an
ordinary knife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From a careful scrutiny
of the autopsy report and the testimony of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Platon</span>,
only one compelling inference presents itself, which is, that the wounds on the
body of the deceased were caused by <span style="">different
weapons and not solely by the bolo allegedly wrested <span style="">by <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> from <span class="SpellE">Regino</span>
as </span>the defense would have us</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">believe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">If
</span><span style="">the latter were the case, the
wounds would have exhibited much <span style="">the
same </span>appearance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No evidence was</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">presented
by the </span><span style="">defense </span><span style="">to show that <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> </span><span style="">used
some other weapon in killing Murillo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Moreover, the wounds on </span>the back,
head, shoulder and mouth </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the deceased disprove Sara's statement that
he saw <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> hack Murillo only in the chest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering Sara<span style="">’s</span> <span style="">testimony that the
deceased never changed his position after falling to the ground as to expose
his back </span>to <span class="SpellE">Melchor's</span> onslaught, <span style="">we can only conclude </span>that he had
misrepresented the truth as to the actual sequence of the events.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The failure of </span>the
appellants' evidence to tally with the autopsy findings of the municipal health
officer considerably weakens their case and correspondingly strengthens the
testi­monies of the prosecution witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In their brief, the ap­pellants belabor the alleged bias of the
prosecution witnes<span style="">ses Fabian <span class="SpellE">Salanguit</span> and <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> Ma. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Katigbak</span></span><span class="GramE">,
growing out of their <span style="">relationship
with the deceased, they being the half-brother and father-in-law </span>of
Murillo, respectively.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span><span style="">ap­<span style="">pellants
</span></span><span style="">likewise assail </span>the
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Panaligan</span>,
husband of the mistress of <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Tividad</span>,
one of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While witnesses may
be said to be interested by reason of their relationship <span style="">with </span>one of the parties, their
declarations should not be disregarded or rejected <span style="">capriciously on </span>the ground <span style="">of
</span>apparent bias alone where they are reasonable, consistent <span style="">and </span><span style="">supported </span>by other facts and <span style="">circumstances (U.S. vs. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pagaduan</span></span><span style=""> 37 Phil.
90, 92).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>This is the situation
obtaining in this <span style="">case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">The autopsy report (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>. A) not only gives credence
to the </span><span style="">testimonies
</span><span style="">of <span class="SpellE">Salanguit</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Katigbak</span> and <span class="SpellE">Panaligan</span> and
bolsters </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">prosecution's theory </span>that
Murillo was stabbed by <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> in <span style="">the </span>back, neck and chest, hacked <span style="">by <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> </span>in
<span style="">the </span><span style="">breast, </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">struck by <span class="SpellE">Fulgencio</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Fructuoso</span> in the head </span>and arm with <span style="">pieces of bamboo, but as well utterly
destroys the pretensions of the defense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Despite the number of people who witnessed the affray and the
alleged notoriety of the deceased in the community, it is strange that the
appellants were able to present only the hardly credible testimony of <span class="SpellE">Doroteo</span> Sara.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not
only does such testimony fail to dovetail with the medical find­ings, but as
well it disputes a material point in the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Fulgencio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While the latter categorically denied their presence during the fight
between <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> and <span class="SpellE">Regino</span>,
Sara asserted that they were present although they did not intervene
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither in the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u><span style=""> </span>nor in their brief did the appellants
explain this patent contradiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution has taken the position that the appellants acted
in common accord, with the same criminal purpose and mur­derous intent, as to
render each one as well liable for the acts of the others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As proof of this fraternal conspiracy, <span style="">reliance </span><span style="">is placed on the apparent simultaneity of<span style=""> the attack on </span>the </span>de­<span style="">ceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That there was a prior agreement among the <span class="SpellE">Tividad</span> brothers to kill Murillo has not been averred, much
less proven, by <span style="">the </span>prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it may be true that direct proof is not
essential to prove conspiracy and that it may be shown by acts and
circumstances from which may logically be inferred <span style="">the existence of a common design among the accused to commit the</span>
offense charged (People vs. Cabrera, 43 Phil. 64, </span>96; <span style="">Peo­ple vs. <span class="SpellE">Carbonel</span>,
</span><span style="">48 </span><span style="">Phil. </span>868, <span style="">875-876) nonetheless the evi­dence to prove the same must be positive
and convincing (Peo­ple vs. <span class="SpellE">Aplegido</span>, </span>43 O<span style="">.G. </span><span style="">114, 117).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">As </span>a facile device by
which an accused may be ensnared and kept within the penal fold, conspiracy
requires conclusive proof </span><span style="">if </span><span style="">we
are to maintain in full strength the substance of the time-honored principle of
criminal law requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt before con­viction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is with this guidepost in</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">mind
that we have exam­ined the <span style="">evidence on
record and </span>consequently arrived at the con­clusion that the facts of the
case do not support the position of the prosecution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The record <span style="">is </span>bereft
of any fact or circumstance, whether anterior to the commission of the offense
or subsequent thereto, indicative of <span style="">conspiracy
among </span>the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although all
the <span class="SpellE">Tividad</span> brothers were present during the
cockfight, this fact <span style="">does not give rise
to any inference of unity </span>of criminal pur­pose as their attendance
therein may be explained by the facts that in the rural areas, cockfighting is a
communal activity, especially among the <span class="SpellE">menfolk</span>, and
that, <span style="">in </span><span style="">this </span>case, one of them (<span class="SpellE">Delfin</span>) is a co-sponsor of the event.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither is their departure together and in
the same direction after the affray a positive manifestation of conspiratorial
unity as it was merely an <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span> fact that they were neighbors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There <span style="">is </span>no proof that the <span class="SpellE">Tividad</span>
brothers bore the deceased any grudge previous to the assault on the
latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, they were even seen
together in conversation before <span style="">the
cockfight by <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Panaligan</span>,
one of the prosecution witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>If
the parties had differences, the joint sponsorship of the cockfight by <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Tividad</span> and the deceased
would not have been possible.</p>

<p class="BODY">This leads us to a consideration of the fight itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is indubitably clear from the record that
the accused did not attack the <span style="">deceased
simultaneously.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even </span><span style="">if </span>they
did, this would not of itself indicate the existence of a conspiracy among <span style="">them </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">simultaneity <u>per</u></span><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">se</span></u><span style=""> </span>is not <span style="">a </span>badge
of conspiracy,<span style=""> absent the requisite
concurrence of wills.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not
sufficient that </span>the attack is joint and simultaneous; it <span style="">is </span>necessary that <span style="">the assailants are animated </span>by one and
the same purpose (<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
<span style="">vs. <span class="SpellE">M<span style="">agcomot</span></span></span>, 13 Phil. 386,
389; People <span style="">vs.
</span>Caballero, 53 Phil. <span style="">595-596).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Evidently, in a
situation where the assaults </span><span style="">were
</span><span style="">not simultaneous but successive,
greater proof is demanded to establish </span><span style="">concert of criminal design.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
evidence for the prosecution shows that the assaults on the deceased were
carried out by the accused successively.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Panaligan</span> even testified that </span>while <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> and <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> were grappling
in the early stages of the fight, <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> and <span class="SpellE">Fructuoso</span> stayed inside the arena some five meters away
from the protagonists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fulgencio</span>, although outside the arena, was also about five
meters distant from the two.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, later,
they seemingly went to the aid of their brother, it was out of strong fraternal
instincts and not on<span style=""> </span>account of
a conspiracy, <span class="GramE">express</span> or implied, to take the life of
the deceased or inflict upon him bodily injury.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With the exception of <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span>, none of the
accused was armed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bamboo poles used
by <span class="SpellE">Fulgencio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Fructuoso</span>
were simply picked up by them from the many pieces lying on the ground near the
cockpit. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>If it were their intention to
kill Murillo, they would have <span class="SpellE">priorly</span> armed
themselves with <span style="">more lethal </span>wea­pons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of
considerable significance is the circumstance that <span class="SpellE">Mel­chor</span>,
who started the fracas, was unarmed and smaller in build than the deceased while
the latter was not only bigger but also carried a bolo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the appellants themselves asserted, the
deceased was reputed in the locality to be a "<span class="SpellE">siga-siga</span>
or "<span class="SpellE">barako</span>" and was, presumably, more than
familiar with the ways of street fighting.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Would the accused have carel<span style="">e</span>ssly
<span style="">risked </span>the
life of their unarmed brother if they really had <span style="">the intention of doing away with
Murillo?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it was, the brothers did not
intervene in </span>the fight until after <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> <span style="">had </span>been
thrown to the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In brief, then,
the facts do not disclose that the accused had previously <span style="">conspired to kill
the deceased.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the absence of conspiracy, each of the accused is responsible
only for the consequences of <span style="">his </span>own acts (<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Abiog</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abiog</span>, 37 <span style="">mil. 137, 140</span><span style="">; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span>,
44</span> Phil. 38, <span class="GramE">47</span>-49).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">As to the remaining appellants, the qualifying
circumstance of treachery should be appreciated only against <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Tividad</span> who was positively
identified as the one who treacherously stabbed </span>the deceased in the back
while the latter <span style="">was trying </span>to pin down <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The injury caused, described in paragraph (9)
of the autopsy report <span style="">as about</span> <span style="">six </span>inches deep, was one of <span style="">the three fatal wounds sustained by Murillo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fulgencio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Fructuoso</span>, whose community of interest with the other
accused has not been shown, should be held liable only for the consequences of
their own acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the evidence </span>shows
that each of them hit the <span style="">deceased once with </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">piece of bamboo, it is silent as to the extent of
the injuries </span><span style="">caused, </span><span style="">in which case they
should be held guilty only of slight physical injuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>As to <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tividad</span>, with the withdrawal and subsequent dismissal
of his appeal, the judgment <u>a</u> <u>quo</u><span style=""> against him has </span>long become final.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">ACCORDINGLY</span></b><span style="">, the </span>judgment appealed from is
