				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">Direct appeal, on
questions purely of law, from </span>a <span style="">deci­sion
of the Court of First Instance of Manila, dismissing plaintiff's complaint,
without costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The pertinent facts have
been stipulated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff, Raul
Cipriano, was first employed, on September 1, 1953, as an apprentice salesman
of San Miguel Corporation, with a monthly salary of P215.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 1, 1954, he became a regular sales­man,
with a monthly salary of P240.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Owing to
regular promotions given from time to time to defendant's employees, plain­tiff's
salary was subsequently increased until it reached, on January 1, 1963, to P290
a month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the date last mentioned to
April 17, 1964, he, moreover, got an average commission of P367.11 a month.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On April 21, 1964,
plaintiff received a notice to the effect that, the medical department having
certified that he could no longer continue performing his functions as a
salesman, the defendant was constrained to retire him at the close of business
on April 17, 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff was then,
as he, had been for some </span>time prior thereto, a member in good standing
of the San Miguel Brewery Sales Force Union, which had with the defendant, an
agreement, dated February 20, 1963, establishing a "Health, Welfare and
Retirement Plan," which was in force.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Section 2 of Article VIII of said plan<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
provided for retirement benefits at the rate of "one (1) month's
guaranteed basic compensation for each year of service." Pursuant to this
provision, plaintiff got the total sum of P2,292.28, computed on the basis of
the compensation for one (1) month for each year of service rendered to the
defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, however,
plaintiff demanded payment of the separation pay prescribed in the Termination
Pay Law<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and, upon failure of the defendant to heed the demand,<span style=""> or on December 1, 1964, he filed this action to recover said pay, as
well as moral damages, exemplary damages and attorney's fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After appropriate
proceedings, the lower court rendered the appealed decision, dismissing
plaintiff's complaint, upon </span>the ground that the retirement benefits,
received by plaintiff under the aforementioned "Health, Welfare and
Retirement Plan", are in lieu of the termination pay provided by law,
contrary to plaintiff' s claim to the effect that this pay is not <span style="">ex</span><span style="">cluded by said benefits.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff's contention is manifestly devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His right to the benefits of the
aforementioned plan came into existence by virtue of the agreement between the
defendant and the labor union, of which plaintiff is a member.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Admit­tedly, said right is subject to the
limitations prescribed in the agreement, Article X of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Regular employees who are separated from the service of the
company for any reason other than misconduct or voluntary resignation shall be
entitled to <u>either</u> 100% of the benefits provided in Section Article VIII
hereof, regardless of their length of service in the company <u>or</u> to the
severance pay provided by law, <u>whichever is the greater amount.</u>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant thereto, plaintiff was entitled to "<u>either</u>"
the amount prescribed <span style="">in </span>the
plan "<u>or</u>" the "severance pay pro­vided by law, whichever
is the greater amount." In other words, he had a right <span style="">to </span><u>one</u> of the two benefits, not
to <u>both</u>, at the same time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
exclusion of one by the other is clearly deducible, not only from the terms
"either" and "or" used in the agreement, but, also, by the
qualifying phrase "<u>whichever</u> is the greater amount." Indeed,
"whichever is the greater amount" would be immaterial, if the
retiring employee were entitled to both.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Needless to say, the benefits under said <span style="">plan - </span>compensation for <u>one</u> (1) month for each year of
service - is bigger than the termination pay provided by law, which is limited
to <u>one-half</u> of the monthly compensation for every year of service.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed,
with costs against plaintiff-appellant.</p>
