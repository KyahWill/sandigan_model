				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal by<i> certiorari</i> on questions of law from the judgment of the 
Court of Industrial Relations, rendered on 28 February 1961 in favor of farm 
laborers Lorenzo Ti-ayon and Salvador Vicente, both members of respondent union. 
The complaint for unfair labor practice, docketed as Case No. ULP-Iloilo, 
originally involved about 120 laborers. The industrial court found that unfair 
labor practice had been committed against Lorenzo Ti-ayon and ordered his 
reinstatement, with back wages. It was also held that there was no proof that 
laborer Salvador Vicente was dismissed on account of union activities; 
nevertheless, Vicente's heirs were declared entitled, to his separation pay "for 
reasons of equity". The case with respect to the others was dismissed by the 
court <i>a quo</i> "for failure to adduce substantial proof".
<p>Motions to reconsider having been, denied by the court <i>en banc</i> (Judge 
Bugayong dissenting for lack of jurisdiction), the Haciendas appealed to this 
Court. The appeal with respect to Lorenzo Ti-ayon subsequently became a moot 
question because of an amicable settlement between the parties, registered and 
noted in the records of this case. The only problem, therefore, to be resolved 
herein is the appeal with regards to Salvador Vicente, who died while the case 
was being tried in the lower court. The pertinent portions of the findings of 
fact, and of law, of the Court of Industrial Relations are quoted hereunder;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"During the hearing of the case Salvador Vicente testified that he was an 
employee of the Hacienda Cammisana with more than three decades of service 
behind him, with a weekly salary of P13.80. He joined the complainant union in 
May 1954 and was dismissed by management in May 1956. During the course of the 
hearing of this case Salvador Vicente died."</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>"Concerning the death of Vicente it must be stated that the death of an 
individual will not preclude the Court from granting relief, aside from 
reinstatement, to effectuate the policies of the Industrial Peace Act should the 
same be warranted.</p>
<p>There is no sufficient ground for a finding that the dismissal of Salvador 
Vicente would constitute an unfair labor practice. The supposed attributed act 
of discrimination was committed way back in 1954. Such acts could not have been 
the cause of his dismissal in May 1956, two years after the said incident. Such 
a dismissal, therefore, cannot be considered by this Court as unfair labor 
practice, and full relief cannot be given by this Court."</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p></blockquote>
<p>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the court hereby orders:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *<br></p>
<p>"2. For reasons of equity based on the fact that although there has been no 
unfair labor practice committed against the deceased Salvador Vicente, yet the 
respondents have shown no valid cause of discharge, separation pay should be 
awarded to his heirs in accordance with existing laws."</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
<p>"In this connection, the Chief of the Examining Division or his duly 
authorized representative is hereby directed to proceed to the premises of the 
respondent and go over the records * * * to compute the separation pay due the 
heirs of the deceased Vicente in accordance with law, and thereafter to submit a 
report to the Court on such matters for further disposition."</p></blockquote>
<p>The first issue raised by the petitioners in this appeal is that since the 
case involved agricultural laborers, and the petitioners themselves are engaged 
in agricultural pursuits, the case was not within the jurisdiction of the Court 
of Industrial Relations.</p>
<p>In upholding jurisdiction, reference was made below to Republic Act No. 2263, 
amending section 27 paragraph 5, of the Agricultural Tenancy Act (R.A. No. 
1199), which has expressly forbidden landholders to discourage maintenance or 
growth of unions or organizations of tenants in their landholdings. But the 
legal provision does not appear applicable to the present case, since there is 
no finding that the respondent laborers are tenants or lessees, and, in fact, 
the original complaint averred that they "never had a share in the crops as 
their wages".</p>
<p>The foregoing circumstance notwithstanding, since one of the parties works 
agricultural land, and, in the absence of any showing or express finding in the 
appealed decision, that the tasks assigned to respondent laborers were totally 
unconnected with agricultural operations, we are constrained to hold that the 
conflict was not within the jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations 
but in that of the Court of Agrarian Relations created by Republic Act No. 1267 
(sec. 7). This issue was considered and decided in Santos vs. Court of 
Industrial Relations, et al., 113 Phil., 725, wherein it was said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The question to be determined is: considering that complainants are 
agricultural laborers in the legal sense can their claim relative to, an unfair 
labor practice committed by petitioner be filed with the Court of Industrial 
Relations? In other words, can the latter court take cognizance of this claim 
under Republic Act No. 875 considering that the complainants are agricultural 
laborers?</p>
<p>We are inclined to uphold the negative view not only because an agricultural 
laborer does not come within the purview of the word employee defined in Section 
2 (d) of Republic Act No. 875 but also because any matter that may pertain to 
the relation of tenant and landlord comes under the Agricultural Tenancy Act 
(Republic Act No. 1199, as amended by Republic Act No. 2263), and any 
controversy that may arise between them as an incident of their relationship 
comes under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations 
created by Republic Act No. 1267.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *<br></p>
<p>"With regard to our conclusion that the present controversy comes under the 
exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations, suffice it to state 
that the latter court was created for '<i>the enforcement of all laws and 
regulations governing the relation of capital and labor on all agricultural 
lands under any system of cultivation</i>' (Section 1, Republic Act 1267, and 
amended by Republic Act 1409), and was given exclusive jurisdiction over the 
entire Philippines <i>'to consider, investigate, decide, and settle all 
questions, matters, controversies, or disputes involving all those 
relationships, established by law which determine the varying rights of persons 
in the cultivation or and use of agricultural land where one of the parties 
works the land</i>' (Section 7, Ibid.). <i>Complainants, therefore, should have 
lodged their eomplaint with the agrarian court for the redress of their 
grievance considering this broad power given to it by law even if nothing is 
said therein relative to unfair labor practice. The subsequent enactment of 
Republic Act No. 2263 which grants to agricultural workers the right to file an 
action of this nature merely serves to confirm this jurisdiction of the agrarian 
court. The conclusion is, therefore, inescapable that the industrial court has 
improperly assumed jurisdiction over the present case for it comes under the 
exclusive jurisdiction of the agrarian court</i>." (Italics 
supplied)</p></blockquote>
<p>In resume, we reiterate that in the absence of adequate showing that the 
complaining laborers of an agricultural enterprise "do no agricultural work of 
any kind at all" (cf. Pampanga Sugar Mills vs. Pasumil Workers' Union, 98 Phil., 
558; 52 Off. Gaz. [16] 6924), their conflicts with the employers lie within the 
jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations and not in that of the Court of 
Industrial Relations. It becomes thus unnecessary to pass upon the other points 
raised by appellants.</p>
<p>The decision of the Court of Industrial Relations herein appealed from is, 
therefore, vacated and set aside for lack of jurisdiction, and the case ordered 
dismissed. No costs.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, 
Paredes, Dizon, Regala,</i> and <i>Makalintal, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
