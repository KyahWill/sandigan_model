Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, Special Proceeding No. 6824,
Testate Estate of the Late Don Alfonso de <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>,
denying the petition for "<span class="SpellE">señalamiento</span> de vista"
filed by appellants Jose <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span> and Consuelo <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>, which in effect was a motion to reopen for a
"vista <u>de novo</u>" of the proceedings for the probate of will of
the decedent Don Alfonso de <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span> which had
already been terminated by an order of December 11, 1940, to enable appellants
to continue with their opposition to said probate on the ground that the
testator "did not have a sound <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> mind
when his last will and testament was executed" and to prove that they are
duly acknowledged natural children of said decedent.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that in the above-mentioned probate proceedings,
appellants filed an opposition to the admission of the will of the deceased Don
Alfonso.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The will named as heirs only <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span> de <span class="SpellE">Raquiza</span>, his judicially adopted daughter to the extent of
2/3 of his estate and his collateral relatives for the balance of 1/3, omitting
any mention of appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Raquiza</span> who was then a minor had <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span>
A. <span class="SpellE">Trono</span> as her guardian <u>ad-<span class="SpellE">litem</span></u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The other material facts are stated in the decision of this Court
in Testate Estate of the late Don Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>
etc. vs. Jose <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span> et al., 9 SCRA 395, and are
not disputed by the parties in this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To quote from that decision:</p>

<blockquote>"Alleging that they are the acknowledged natural children of
the decedent and that the latter 'did not have a sound <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>

probate on <st1:date month="12" day="11" year="1940">December 11, 1940</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same date, <span class="SpellE">Trono</span>
was appointed <u>guardian-ad-<span class="SpellE">litem</span></u> of the present
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Raquiza</span> and, purporting to act on behalf of the
latter, as party of the first part, she (<span class="SpellE">Trono</span>)
entered into an agreement with the herein appellants, as party of the second
part, stipulating, <u>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></u>:</blockquote>

the Party of the Second Part from his last will and testament, unduly depriving

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">'5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That in the said last will and testament, the
probate of which is now pending in the Hon. Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, the deceased had left two-thirds (2/3) of his
entire estate to the Party of the First Part, and the remaining one-third (1/3)
to his brother D. Juan de <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>;</p>

carry out the just and spirit of this agreement <u>the Party of the First Part

submitted to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
to form part of the records of the case therein pending.'</span> (Italics
supplied.)</p>

<blockquote>"After taking the testimony of one of the attesting witnesses
to the will of the decedent, the Court, by an order dated December 11, 1940,
admitted said will to probate, directed the 'petitioner' to propose the name of
a person for appointment as judicial administrator of the estate of the
decedent and approved the agreement above referred to.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Ten (10) months later, or on September 18, 1941, <span class="SpellE">Trono</span> sought a reconsideration of said order, insofar as it
approved the agreement, upon the ground that the same is null and void for the
reason that she had allegedly signed it without knowing its contents, that it
was devoid of consideration, and that, as Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Raquiza's</span>
<u>guardian-ad-litem</u>, she (<span class="SpellE">Trono</span>) had no
authority to enter into said agreement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The motion for reconsideration was denied, although the order to this
effect and the date on which it was issued do not appear in the records,
because so much thereof as existed at the time had been destroyed during the
liberation of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in 1945.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span>
maintains, however, that, pursuant to said order, <span class="SpellE">Trono</span>
was <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from assailing the agreement in
question, she having signed the same, and its annulment could be secured at the
instance only of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Raquiza</span>, through another
guardian, and that, accordingly, the order contained a proviso 'reserving' to
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Raquiza</span> 'the right x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> to annul the agreement x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> upon reaching' the age of majority 'or upon having
another legal guardian'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1946" day="14" month="7">July 14, 1946</st1:date>,
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Raquiza</span>, represented by her husband, Atty.
Antonio V. <span class="SpellE">Raquiza</span>, filed a motion praying that said
order of <st1:date year="1940" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1940</st1:date>,
<span class="GramE">be</span> set aside and that the agreement adverted to above
be declared null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion
was denied on <st1:date month="8" day="8" year="1946">August 8, 1946</st1:date>,
upon the ground that the order sought to be reconsidered had 'already acquired
finality'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thereupon, or on October 18, 1946, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Raquiza</span>,
assisted by her aforementioned husband <span style="">and
</span>then <u>guardian-ad-<span class="SpellE">litem</span></u>, filed
complaint, docketed as Civil Case No. 47 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, against the appellants herein, for the purpose, <u>inter
<span class="SpellE">alia</span></u>, of securing a declaration of nullity of the
agreement of December 11, 1940 and of the order of the same date approving
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the filing of appellants of
answer to said complaint, the case was set for hearing on <st1:date month="8" day="6" year="1947">August 6, 1947</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Two days prior thereto, the Court received a telegram of counsel for
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Raquiza</span>, praying for postponement of the hearing
and stating that the corresponding motion was 'coming'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No such motion, however, had been filed when
the case was called for hearing on <st1:date month="8" day="6" year="1947">August
 6, 1947</st1:date>, and neither Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Raquiza</span> nor her
counsel appeared before the court on that date.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, counsel for appellants 'explained to the Court that the parties
have practically come into a tentative amicable agreement of the case x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x' and that the non-appearance of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Raquiza</span> 'and her attorney may possibly be due to this
circumstance'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, by an order
dated <st1:date year="1947" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1947</st1:date>, said
case was dismissed 'without prejudice and without pronouncement as to costs.' <span class="GramE">(Exhibit N, Stipulation.)</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the meantime, the proceedings in the present case continued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Decedent's brother, Juan, had been appointed
administrator of the estate, which, upon the death of Juan, was placed under
the administration of his widow, Carmen de <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the performance by the latter of the
usual acts of administration, and feeling, evidently, that the time had come
for the distribution of the net assets of the estate among the heirs of the
decedent, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Raquiza</span> filed, on March 11, 1958, a
motion praying that appellants be excluded from any share in said estate and
from further participating in the proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, or on <st1:date month="8" day="5" year="1959">August 5,
 1959</st1:date>, said <span class="SpellE">Administratrix</span> filed a motion
praying that the following be declared heirs of the decedent, in the proportion
stated after their respective names, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Raquiza</span>, one-third of the estate;
appellants, one-third of the estate; and the collateral heirs, one-third of the
estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Passing upon these two (2)
motions, the lower court issued, on November 11, 1959, the order mentioned at the
beginning of this decision, holding that the records do not show that
appellants are the acknowledged natural children of the decedent; that
appellants have not introduced any evidence on their alleged relationship with
the deceased; and that appellants merely rely upon the agreement of December
11, 1940 -- signed by <span class="SpellE">Trono</span> as <u>guardian-ad-<span class="SpellE">litem</span></u> of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Raquiza</span> --
which is null and void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">initio</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
reconsideration of this order having been denied, appellants interposed the
present appeal." (<span class="GramE">at</span> pp. 398-401.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the foregoing facts, this Court stated the issue in that
case to be "whether lower court has authority to pass, in the order
appealed from, upon the question of whether or not appellants (in that case and
here) are related to the decedent and entitled to share in his estate, as well
as to intervene in this case, considering that the agreement entered into on
December 11, 1940, had been approved by an order of the Court of the same date,
which had allegedly become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, no
appeal having been taken <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>." (<span class="GramE">at</span> p. 401.)</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court then proceeded to examine the circumstances leading to
the compromise agreement referred to and arrived at the conclusion that said
agreement was null and void for being "within the purview of Article 1814
of the Civil Code of Spain (Art. 2035 of the Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>)
reading:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"No compromise can be made
with respect to the civil status of persons, or with regard to matrimonial
matters, or future support."</p>

<p class="BODY">After the finality of the aforesaid decision, the "<span class="SpellE">Peticion</span> de <span class="SpellE">Señalamiento</span> de <st1:place>Vista</st1:place>"
here in issue was filed by appellants.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">This motion was opposed by the heirs of
Juan <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>, the collateral relatives referred to
in the will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as already stated,
after due hearing, the court <u>a quo</u> denied appellants' motion, hence,
this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main burden of appellants' theory in this appeal is that
inasmuch as the above-mentioned and partly quoted decision declared the
compromise agreement of December 11, 1940 void, and considering that their
opposition to the probate of the will of the deceased was withdrawn by them in
consideration of the acknowledgment made in said agreement by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Raquiza</span> of their status as "duly acknowledged natural
children of the deceased Don Alfonso de <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>
during his lifetime, as his own children", and that they desisted from
presenting proof as to their status as such acknowledged natural children
because of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Raquiza's</span> admission, which she in
turn made to make them refrain from questioning the legality of her adoption,
which according to them was legally defective, it should follow, upon the
nullification of that agreement, that the admission of Don Alfonso's will made
on the basis agreement should also be set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants contend that were it not for the
withdrawal of their opposition, which they did because of the considerations
stated in the agreement, that will could not have been probated on the basis of
the testimony of only one attesting witness, it being the law that all the
three attesting witnesses must indispensably be presented and must testify,
when there is an opposition to the admission thereof, citing Section 11 of Rule
77 <span style="">(Rules of 1940) and cases applying
the same, Fernandez vs. <span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span>, 49 Phil. 380, <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> vs. Francisco, 57 Phil. 742 and <span class="SpellE">Unson</span> vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Abella</span>, 43 Phil.
496).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, appellants
maintain that because of the annulment of the compromise agreement, "it
becomes ineluctable that the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>' opposition
to the probate of the will be deemed reinstated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this were not the effect, the rights of
your appellants would surely be prejudiced, not to mention the fact that the
opposing parties would benefit from an act which this Honorable Court declared
to be illegal from its inception.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, it behooves upon this Honorable Court, as a Court of last
resort, to remedy the situation by allowing your <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
to prove the allegations of their opposition to the probate of the subject last
will and testament." (<span class="GramE">at</span> p. 13, Brief of
Appellants.)</p>

<p class="BODY">At first blush, appellants' contention would appear cogent and
persuasive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon further reflection,
however, a fundamental flaw therein readily becomes apparent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As We see the situation of appellants, the
decisive question as far as they are concerned is, since they have voluntarily
entered into a compromise agreement "expressly prohibited or declared void
by law" (Article 1409, Civil Code), may they recall, withdraw or otherwise
render ineffective what they have already done in performance of their part in
the illegal bargain?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe that
they cannot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, having withdrawn
their opposition to the will in question by virtue of that agreement,
subsequently voided by this Court for being contrary to law, can they now ask
that the approval of said will be set aside in order that on account of their
contemplated revival of their opposition, the proponents may be compelled to
comply with the requirements of the aforementioned provision of the Rules
making the presentation of all of the three attesting witnesses to the will
indispensable for its probate?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not
think they can.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True it is that a
compromise agreement on the civil status of persons is not a criminal offense
in which the partie<span style="">s</span> to the
contract, being in <span class="SpellE"><u>pari</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">delicto</span></u>,
are left where they are found, but there is Article 1412 of the Civil Code
(formerly Article 1306 of the Civil Code of Spain in force in 1940) which
provides similarly as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 1412.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the act
in which the unlawful or forbidden cause consists does not constitute a
criminal offense, the following rules shall be observed:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the fault is on the part of both
contracting parties, neither may recover what he has given by virtue of the
contract, or demand the performance of the other's undertaking;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When only one of the contracting parties is at
fault, he cannot recover what he has given by reason of the contract, or ask
for the fulfillment of what has been promised him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other, who is not at fault, may demand
the return of what he has given without any obligation to comply with his promise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1306)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In effect, in compliance with the compromise agreement,
appellants agreed that the probate of the will be made on the basis of the
testimony of only one of the attesting witnesses thereto, and because there was
no other opposition, the court proceeded to act pursuant to Sec. 5 of Rule 77
allowing probate upon the testimony of only one attesting witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, since the agreement has been declared
contrary to law and void, under the foregoing provision of the Civil Code, they
may no longer continue with their opposition.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is not to mention anymore the point stressed by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> that in the decision of this Court referred to
earlier, appellants have been declared as having "no right to take
part" in the subject probate proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As stated in the said decision, the appeal of appellants in that case
was "from an order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
declaring that Jose <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span> y <span class="SpellE">Bundalian</span>
and his sister Consuelo <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span> y <span class="SpellE">Bundalian</span> -- hereafter referred to as the appellants --
have no right either to share in the estate of the deceased Alfonso de <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span> y <span class="SpellE">Hortega</span> -- hereafter
referred to as the decedent -- or to take part in the present case, and that <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span> de <span class="SpellE">Raquiza</span> -- hereafter referred to as Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Raquiza</span> -- and the Heirs of Juan de <span class="SpellE">Castellvi</span>
y <span class="SpellE">Hortega</span> -- hereafter referred to as the collateral
heirs -- are the heirs of said decedent and, as such, entitled to divide his
estate as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>two-thirds (2/3) for
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Raquiza</span> and one-third (1/3) for the collateral
heirs." (<span class="GramE">at</span> p. 397) And in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion, it is adjudged, "Wherefore, the
order appealed from is hereby affirmed." Clearly, there was indeed a
ruling in that decision against allowing appellants to take part in the
proceedings below and to assert and prove their alleged relationship to the
deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With this consideration in
mind, <span class="GramE">We</span> cannot see our way clear to practically
reversing that decision and holding now that appellants may still intervene in
the proceedings below.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, in the same decision, the Court already indicated
more or less how the quest of appellants for recognition their supposed right
as acknowledged natural children of the deceased will more or less be
frustrated because of inherent weakness of evidentiary support.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent portion of the decision states:</p>

<blockquote>"Again, the records indicate that appellants had very slim
chances, if any, of establishing their aforementioned allegation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To begin with, the will of the decedent
explicitly states that he had neither surviving ascendants nor descendants,
except herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> as his judicially adopted
daughter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the statement in the
agreement in question to the effect 'that the deceased had inadvertently
omitted' appellants herein, cannot be true, for the decedent declared in said
instrument:</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">And so, even if in strict sense, the most that We can decide here
is that appellants are already precluded from taking part or intervening in the
proceedings below in so far as the probate of the will is concerned, which
naturally does not comprehend any ruling as to whether or not said appellants
may still be entitled to attack the substantive validity of the provisions and
dispositions of that will, the appellants would be well advised to <span class="SpellE">reasses</span> their chances more carefully, if only to avoid
further useless judicial litigation that would occupy the time and effort of
the courts which can be better utilized for the adjudication of more
meritorious cases.</p>
