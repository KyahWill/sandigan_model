				G.R. No. L-15543, September 29, 1961</h4>
				<H3>LAO LIAN SU ALIAS LORENZO TING, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR AND APPELLEE.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from a decree of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, denying the application of petitioner-appellant Lao Lian Su<em> alias</em>
Lorenzo Ting for admission to Philippine citizenship, because of
applicant's failure to observe irreproachable conduct in his relations
with constituted authorities during the entire period of his residence
in the Philippines.<p></p>
<p>We see no merit in the appeal. In his sworn petition for
naturalization as well as in his testimony, petitioner stated that he
has only three children with his wife Chua Kim Tia, namely:</p>
<blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td width="10%">&nbsp;</td>
    <td valign="top" width="40%">Besie Ting, born</td>
    <td valign="top" width="40%"><div align="right">11/25/39</div></td>
    <td width="10%">&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td valign="top">Esteban Ting, born</td>
    <td valign="top"><div align="right">4/11/46</div></td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td valign="top">Betty Ting, born</td>
    <td valign="top"><div align="right">8/16/51</div></td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table></blockquote>
<p>Yet in the verified income tax returns filed in his name and that of
his wife for the years from 1951 to 11957, the contents of which he
ratified under oath while on the witness stand, the spouses appear to
have claim exemption; for a <em>fourth</em> child by the name of Ting
Kock King, supposedly born on 10 October 1948. Of the inconsistency
between the sworn statements, petitioner proferred no explanation
whatsoever, although counsel for appellant insinuates in the brief that
Ting Kock King could be an adopted child of the spouses; but the
insinuation is totally devoid of proof, which the applicant was
duty-bound to submit to the Court. As the record now stands, the
contradictory statements under oath can only lead to the conclusion
either that the petitioner tried to evade lawful taxes due from him or
that he has concealed the truth in his application. Either alternative
would be sufficient to disqualify him for admission to Philippine
citizenship.</p>
<p>For all the foregoing considerations, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Paredes,</em> and <em>De Leon, JJ.</em>, concur.<br>
  <em>Bautista Angelo, J</em>., did not take part. </p>
