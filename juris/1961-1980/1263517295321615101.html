came into the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
under four importations - while in the possession of the Manila Port Service,
judgment was rendered by the City Court of Manila against defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter appealed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the Court of First Instance of Manila, the
case came up for decision upon a stipulation of facts.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Judgment was thereafter rendered
sentencing defendants to pay plaintiff "the sum of in, P1447.51 with legal

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="30" month="11">November 30, 1961</st1:date>,
Pacific Electrical Supply, Inc. imported from the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> a shipment of 342 cartons and two
crates of electrical surface raceways and fittings. This was placed on board
the SS "Pioneer Ming".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1961</st1:date>, the "Pioneer
Ming" arrived at the <st1:place><st1:placetype>port</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename></st1:place>
and discharged the shipment into the custody of the Manila Port Service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One carton was pilfered <span style="">of </span>its contents while <span style="">six </span>cartons were not delivered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff's loss arising <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
is the subject of the first cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 29, 1961, Brunette Shoe Factory imported from the
United States three cases upper leather carried on board the same SS
"Pioneer Ming" in that same voyage.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>SS "Pioneer <span style="">Ming" </span>discharged
the cargo into the custody of the Manila Port Service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The leather delivered <span style="">was </span>short of 111-3/4 square feet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">This
is </span>covered by plaintiff's second cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the third cause of action, plaintiff's case is predicated
upon the facts following: On November 27, 1961, <span class="SpellE">Dupro</span>
(Philippines), Inc. imported from the United States 18 <span style="">cases </span>of auto <span style="">parts </span>shipped
on board the SS "Pioneer Ming".<span style="">&nbsp;

on <st1:date year="1961" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The shipment was discharged into the custody
of the Manila Port Service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One case of
that shipment was pilfered of its contents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Loss was occasioned to plaintiff.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fourth cause of action refers to a shipment of 15 cases black
umbrella cloth imported by Chua Luan and Co., Inc. from <st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Japan</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> </span>on <st1:date year="1962" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1962</st1:date>, per <span style="">SS </span>"<span class="SpellE">Narra</span>" which arrived in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
on <st1:date year="1982" day="15" month="9">September 15, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The shipment was discharged into the custody
of the Manila Port Service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It turned out,
however, that two cases of the shipment were pilfered of contents resulting in
loss to the consignee.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having paid for the losses to the different importers upon
covering insurance policies, plaintiff became the <span class="SpellE">subrogee</span>
of the consignees.</p>

<p class="BODY">1. It is now futile for defendants to pass on liability to the
carriers which are not parties to this action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Paragraph 7 of the Stipulation of Facts will stop them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It reads: "VII. That the goods were
discharged complete into the custody of the defendant." Not that the
stipulation stands alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants in
their brief<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
cate­gorically state that the opinion of the lower court "that the
shipments in question were discharged into the custody of the defendant Manila
Port Service <u>complete</u> <u>with</u> <u>respect</u> <u>to</u> <u>quantity</u>,
is not disputed."</p>

<p class="BODY">But defendants argue that the fact that the shipments were
received by defendant Manila Port Service complete, does not mean that the
goods were received in "good order".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Defendants <span style="">miss </span>the
point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is immaterial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because plaintiff's claim is for short
delivery and pilferage.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, liability cannot be shifted to the carriers.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seizing upon the trial
court's finding that there is "no proof that said shortages or damages with
respect to the said goods were due to the negligence of the defendant, Manila
Port Service",<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
defendants now put forth disclaimer of liability.</p>

<p class="BODY">We start with the presumption in Article 1265 of the Civil Code
that whenever "the thing is lost in the possession of the debtor, it shall
be presumed that the loss was due to his fault, unless there is proof to the
contrary." As early <span style="">as </span>1907,
this Court held that under Article 1183 of the Spanish Civil Code (Article 1265
of the new Code), "the burden of explanation of the loss rested upon the
depositary and under article 1769 [of the Spanish Civil Code - now Article 1981
of the new Civil Code], the fault is presumed to be his."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
It has been said that the legal relationship <span style="">created </span>between the consignee and the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operator "is sufficiently akin to that existing between the consignee or
owner of shipped goods and the common carrier or that between a depositor and
the warehouseman."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
And <span style="">as </span>custodian of the goods
discharged from the vessel, it is the duty of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operator to take good care of the goods and turn them over to the party
entitled to their possession.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
It would seem quite elemen­tary that since the care to be used in the
safekeeping of the goods rests peculiarly within the knowledge of the Manila
Port Service, it <span style="">is </span>incumbent
upon said defendant to prove that the losses were not due to its negligence or
that of its employees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because there is no proof that the losses occurred either without
defendants' fault or by reason of <span class="SpellE"><u>caso</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>fortuito</u></span>, defendants are liable.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">3. Nor will defendants escape liability by pleading that no claim
was filed within 15 days from "the date of discharge of the <span style="">last </span>package from the carrying
vessel",<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> a
condition precedent to recovery, <span style="">as </span>set
forth in the said Section 15 of the Management Contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is correct to say that there is no proof
of the date of discharge of each of the four shipments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But then, there <span style="">is </span>no necessity for such proof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is the fact that provisional claims on each of the shipments were filed
well within the 15-day period following the arrival of each of the
vessels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Naturally, those claims were
presented within 15 days from the date of delivery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sufficiency of these provisional claims
is not challenged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And although the
provisional claims do not specify the value of the goods lost and were not
accompanied by supporting papers, the jurisprudence is that such claims
substantially fulfill the requirements.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">4. Defendants' next point is that they are not liable for the sum
of P1,447.51 adjudged in the decision below.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They say that their admission in paragraph VI of the Stipulation of
Facts <span style="">was </span>delimited by the
words "<u>if</u> <u>any</u>" recoverable,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Paragraph VI of the Stipulation of Facts reads:</p>

<blockquote>"VI.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the value of
the alleged claims recoverable, if any, by the plaintiff from the defendants is
as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P 355.00-First cause of
action</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. P 66.92-Second cause of action</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P 25.59-Third cause of
action</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P1, 000.00-Fourth cause
of action."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Since the value of each claim <span style="">is </span>admitted and considering that plaintiff <span style="">is </span>entitled thereto as earlier
expressed in this opinion and upon the terms of the stipulation just quoted,
the lower court was correct in sentencing defendants to pay the total amount
therein stated.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">5. Defendants next question the award of legal interest from the
date the complaint was filed until full payment is made.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also object to the award, of attorneys'
fees.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Interest upon an obligation which calls for the payment of money,
absent a stipulation, is the legal rate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such interest normally <span style="">is </span>allowable
from the date of demand, judicial or extra-­judicial.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The trial court opted for judicial demand as the starting point.</p>

<p class="BODY">But then upon the provisions of Article 2213 of the Civil Code,
interest "cannot be recovered upon <span class="SpellE"><u>unliquidated</u></span>
<u>claims</u> or damages, except when the demand can be established with reason­able
certainty," And as was held by this Court in <u>Rivera</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Perez</u>,
L-6998, February 29, 1956, <span style="">if </span>the
suit were for damages, "<span class="SpellE">unliquidated</span> and not
known until definitely ascertained, assessed and determined by the courts after
proof (<span class="SpellE">Montilla</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Corporacion</span>
de P.P. <span class="SpellE">Agustinos</span>, 25 Phil. 447; <span class="SpellE">Lichauco</span>
v. De Guzman, 38 Phil. 302)"„ then, interest "should be from, the
date of the decision."</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants are correct in that Article 2213 of the Civil Code and
the ruling in <u>Rivera</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Perez</u> should govern the present
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>total</u> of plaintiff’s <span class="SpellE">unliquidated</span> claim for the value of the undelivered goods,
as set forth in its complaint, amounted to P3,947.20.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <u>demand</u> was not established in its
totality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not definitely
ascertained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, plaintiff settled
for an amount (P1,447.51) very much less than that demanded - in fact less than
fifty percent (50%) of the claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
amount of P1,447.51 was not known until definitely agreed upon in the
stipulation of facts, Said stipulation was entered into in lieu of proof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are the facts which place the present
case within the coverage of the rule set forth in Article 2213 of the Civil Code
and elaborated in <u>Rivera</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Perez</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For which reason, interest should start from
the date of the decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">No reason exists why we should disturb the award of attorneys'
fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court's authority to <span style="">grant </span>such attorneys' fees is well
within the compass of Article 2208(11) of the Civil Code providing that
attorneys' fees may be recovered in "any other case where the court deems
it just and equitable."</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>For the reasons given</b>, the judgment under review is hereby
modified in the sense that the amount of P1,447.51 shall bear legal interest
from the date of the decision below.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus modified, the judgment under review <span style="">is </span>affirmed in all other respects.</p>

<p class="BODY">Without <span style="">costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
