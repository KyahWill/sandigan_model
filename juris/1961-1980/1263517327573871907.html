				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal, taken by petitioner Pastor Escalante, from a deci­sion,
of the Court of First Instance of Manila, denying the writ prayed for in his
amended petition herein and dismissing this case, without special pronouncement
as to costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said petitioner was Division Superintendent of Schools for <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> from July 16, 1956 to June 30, 1962 and, thereafter,
for <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a letter, dated November 25, 1959, the
Direc­tor of Public Schools advised the petitioner that, according to a report
of the Chief Supervising Auditor on detail in the Department of Education, an
inspection of the industrial arts shop in his (peti­tioner's) Division had
disclosed certain irregularities therein in relation to the purchase of
carpentry tools.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After quoting portions
of said report, the Director of Public Schools required the peti­tioner to
explain "why no administrative disciplinary action should be taken"
against him for:</p>

<blockquote>"(1) Not
utilizing the services of industrial arts supervisors in processing
requisitions for tools needed by industrial arts classes in violation of
General Letter No. 24, s. 1951;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(2) Circumventing
Department Order No. 4, s. 1951, by splitting requisitions to less than P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Purchasing tools and equipment at exorbitant
prices without consulting the local school officials in violation of paragraph
2-e of the aforementioned Department Order; and</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“(4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Keeping these tools in bodegas where they are
gathering dust, thus wasting government funds."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner seasonably explained:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) that he had always sought the advice of the industrial arts
supervisor, concerning requisitions of tools for industrial arts classes; (2)
that his office files do not show any splitting of requisitions to less than
P2,000.00; (3) that he has no control over the prices of the articles
purchased, the same having been approved by the Bureau of Supply; (4) that
tools were kept in the Division office bodega "only pending their being
checked by the office of the Provincial Auditor and payment"; and (5) that
he had moreover issued a confidential memorandum to district supervisors and
principals urging the immediate distribution of tools to schools in need
thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due notice, a formal investigation was conducted by spe­cial
investigators of the Bureau of Public Schools, who submitted their report,
dated September 29, 1960, to the Director thereof, in effect finding that
petitioner had substantially, although not strictly, complied with applicable
rules and regulations, and recommending that the charges be "dropped"
and that petitioner be admonished, however, "to comply more faithfully
with existing regulations, par­ticularly with General Letter No. 24, s.
1951," and "likewise, to check with extreme care his requisitions so
that only the best articles available will be bought." In a 1st <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> of October 5, 1960, this report was forwarded
to the Secretary of Education by the Director of Public Schools, who concurred
in the foregoing recommendation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So did
the Acting Secretary of Education, in his second <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>,
dated <st1:date year="1960" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1960</st1:date>,
transmitting, to the Commissioner of Civil Service, said report of the
investigators and the 1st <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> of the Director
of Public Schools.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 18, 1962, G. G. de Jesus, Department Legal Coun­sel of
the Civil Service Commission, rendered, "for the Commis­sioner" of
Civil Service, a "decision" adopting the aforementioned findings and
dropping the charges against petitioner herein, but, admonishing him "to
comply more faithfully with existing regula­tions particularly with General
Letter No. 24, series of 1951, and further to check much more carefully the
requisitions so that only the best articles available will be purchased."
Notice and copy of this decision were received by the petitioner on the same
date.</p>

<p class="BODY">Over nine (9) months later, or on February 8, 1963, respon­dent <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Subido</span>, as Acting
Commissioner of Civil Service, issued an "order", addressed to the
Secretary of Education, stating that "the authority to discipline
subordinate officers and employees in the civil service is inherently a
quasi-judicial power involving the exercise of discretion which cannot legally
be delegated"; that the delegation of such authority to the Department
Legal Counsel, by an office order, dated April 12, 1962, "is void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span>";
that the decision rendered by said Counsel, on April 18, 1962, is, there­fore,
"void" and "of no effect"; that, upon a review of the
evidence, herein petitioner was "found guilty as charged" and
"dismissed from the service effective on his last day of office with
pay"; and that "in the public interest", it was ordered that
such "decision is exe­cuted immediately."</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereupon, or on February 12, 1963, petitioner commenced, with
the Court of First Instance of Manila, the present action against respondents <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Subido</span>, as Commissioner
of Civil Service, Hon. Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Roces</span>, as Secretary
of Education, and <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Aldana</span>,
as Director of Public Schools, with the prayer that, pending the determination
of this case, a writ of preliminary injunction be issued <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> "ordering the respondents to desist and
refrain from dismissing and separating the petitioner from his present
position", and "that, after due notice and hearing, a writ of
prohibition issue commanding the respondents to desist absolutely and
perpetually from removing the petitioner from office, with costs." Soon
later, the Court of First Instance of Manila issued a restraining order enjoining
respondents to abstain from performing the acts above mentioned during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the present case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Duly summoned, respondents filed their joint answer reiterat­ing
the view of respondent <span class="SpellE">Subido</span>, in his order
complained of, re­garding the alleged illegality of the delegation of power
made in favor of the Department Legal Counsel of the Civil Service Commission,
and the nullity of his decision of April 18, 1962, as well as setting up the
defense of failure to exhaust administrative remedies, peti­tioner not having
appealed from said order, either to the Civil Ser­vice Board of Appeals, or to
the President of the Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY">After appropriate proceedings, the trial court rendered the
decision appealed from, sustaining the aforementioned defense and dismissing
the case, as well as denying the writ prayed for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A reconsideration of said decision having
been denied, petitioner interposed the present appeal, which is well taken.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although it is well-settled that, in general, courts of justice
will not interfere with or review decisions of administrative officers or
organs, unless the aggrieved party shall have first exhausted the
administrative remedies available to him, this rule is subject to exceptions,
among which are those cases involving purely legal questions<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> -
particularly when the contested act is patently ille­gal or has been performed
without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> -
and those calling for urgent action.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="GramE">The case at bar falls under these exceptions.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the order complained of directed the
immediate execution of the decision dismissing pe­titioner from office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, again, said order hinges upon two (2)
questions, which are purely legal in nature, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) whether the authority to render the
decision of April 18, 1962 could be va­lidly delegated to the Department Legal
Counsel of the Civil Service Commission; and (2) whether said decision was
subject to review by the Commissioner of Civil Service on February 8, 1963.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated in the order complained of, "in an Office order dated
<st1:date year="1962" day="12" month="4">April 12, <span class="GramE">1962</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">,</span> the former Commissioner of Civil Service delegated to the
Department Legal Counsel the authority to sign, among others, decisions in
Administrative Cases where the re­spondent shall be exonerated or where the
recommended penalty is reprimand and warning." Respondents maintain that
said office order was an absolute nullity because the power to discipline sub­ordinate
officers and employees in the civil service is inherently a quasi-judicial
power involving the exercise of discretion which cannot be delegated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This pretense would be correct, in the ab­sence
of a law authorizing such delegation, but, the same is sanc­tioned by the Civil
Service Act of 1959 (Republic Act No. 2260), Section 20 of which reads:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">"Sec. 20.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Delegation in the Civil
Service Com­mission and to the Agencies</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The Commissioner <u>may</u>, at his
discretion and in the interest of the public service, <u>delegate to Chiefs of
Divisions or other heads of primary units in the Civil Service Commission</u>,
or to the Heads of Departments and agencies of the National Government,
provinces, chartered cities, municipalities and other instrumentalities of the
Republic <u>authority to act on personnel matters</u> and to enforce the
provisions of this law in accordance with standards, guidelines and regulations
set by the Commissioner:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Periodic review of ac­tions
in the discharge of delegated authority shall be made by the Commissioner to
insure compliance with standards or regulations, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.”<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents argue that the delegation contemplated in the
foregoing provision must be understood to refer exclusively to ministerial
functions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is, however, a mere
assertion, de­void of any legal or other justification, apart from the fact
that it cannot be accepted without reducing the enactment of said Section 20 to
an exercise in futility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, without
said pro­vision, the Commissioner of Civil Service could delegate the power to
exercise ministerial acts to any of his subordinate of­ficers or employees, as
provided in Section 4 of the Revised Ad­ministrative Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, respondents' theory would have the effect of amending
this section, insofar as it applies to the Civil Service Commission, without
any reason <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">therefor</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> and, worse still, with absurd consequences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, under such theory, the Civil Service
Commissioner would have to discharge personally all functions requiring the
exercise of judgment or discretion, and, although he is authorized to delegate
those which are ministerial in nature, he may do so in favor <u>only</u> of
"Chiefs of Divisions or other heads of primary units in the Civil Service
Commission," apart from the "Heads of Departments and agencies of the
Na­tional Government, provinces, chartered cities, municipalities and other
instrumentalities of the Republic." The result would be that all other
officers and employees of the Civil Service Com­mission - and this means the
bulk of its personnel - would thereby be left <u>without any duties whatsoever</u>
to discharge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely, the framers of
Republic Act No. 2260 could not have intended, and did not intend, to create
such a ridiculous situation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the contrary, the pre-existence of said section 4 of the
Revised Administrative Code, conferring upon public officers the general
authority to delegate ministerial functions, indicates that the only possible
reason for the insertion of the above-quoted Section 20 in Republic Act No.
2260 was to permit the delegation of non-ministerial duties or functions, such
as those involving the exercise of discretion or judgment in connection with "personnel
matters", within the limits prescribed in appropriate "standards,
guidelines and regulations." Indeed, it is humanly impossible to expect
the Commissioner of Civil Service to attend personally to the matter of
appointment, promotion and discipline of hundreds of thousands of officers and
employees in the Civil Service.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that, pursuant to Section 16(<span class="SpellE">i</span>)
of the said Act:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It shall be among
the powers and duties of the Commissioner of Civil Service - x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> (<span class="SpellE">i</span>)
Except as otherwise provided by law, to have <u>final</u> authority to pass
upon the removal, separation and suspension of all permanent officers and
employees in the competitive or clas­sified service x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>." It should be noted, however, that this
"<u>final</u> authority to pass upon the removal, separation and suspen­sion"
of said officers and employees, is subject to the qualifica­tion "except
as otherwise provided by law", and that <span class="GramE">the of</span>
aforementioned Section 20 partakes of the nature of such exception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the delegation authorized in Section
20 does not neces­sarily detract from the "final authority" of the
Commissioner of Civil Service to seasonably review the acts of his
delegates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the
"final" character of his aforementioned authority is in itself an
indication that others may, also, have the same authority, although subordinate
to that of the former, who has the <u>last</u> say on the subject-matter
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the term
"final" would be meaningless, if not improperly used.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, in an opi­nion of the Secretary of Justice,
rendered on February 17, 1961, upon the request of the very Commissioner of
Civil Service, the former expressed the view that:</p>

<blockquote>"Under the law adverted to, the Commissioner of Civil Service 'may,
at his discretion and in the in­terest of the public service, <u>delegate to</u>
Chiefs of Divisions or other heads of primary units in the Civil Service
Commission, or to the Heads of Departments and agencies of the National
Government, provinces, chartered cities, municipalities and other instrumen­talities
of the Republic <u>authority to act on personnel matters</u>,' including '<u>transfer,
demotion, separation and reinstatement</u>,’ or somewhat broadly expressed,
matters involving the imposition of disciplinary mea­sures upon erring civil
servants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See Section 20 in connection
with Section 24).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, what used to be
the 'exclusive jurisdiction' of the Civil Service Com­missioner over the
imposition of administrative pe­nalties under Section 695 of the Revised Administra­tive
Code has been reduced to 'final authority' to pass upon the removal, separation
and suspension of pub­lic officers and employees, but with the accompanying
obligation 'to prescribe standards, guidelines and re­gulations governing the
administration of discipline.' (<st1:place><st1:placename>See</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Republic</st1:placetype></st1:place>
Act No. 2260, Section 16(<span class="SpellE">i</span>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This being so, I fail to see any reason why similar
delegation of power may not be made in favor of the Deputy Commissioner of
Civil Service, the next ranking official in the Civil Service Commis­sion who,
aside from enjoying the rank of a depart­ment undersecretary, is appointed in
the same manner and required to have the same qualifications as the
Commissioner himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="GramE">Ibid.,</span> Section 7, 14).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Incidentally, I must state that this conclusion is con­sistent with the
underlying policy of the law to enable the Civil Service Commissioner to farm
out his mul­tifarious functions among responsible subordinates in the interest
of efficiency and dispatch."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, even if said Commissioner has the
"final authority" to pass upon matters of discipline of officers and
employees in the competitive and classified service, and, consequently, the
power to review and revise the acts of his delegates in connection therewith,
it does not follow that he can do so at any time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When rendering a decision, in pursuance of an
authority lawfully delegated to him, the Department Legal Counsel acts for and
on behalf of the Commissioner of Civil Service, and the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
decision is, in legal contemplation, that of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to Section 36 of Republic Act No.
2260, such decision "may be appealed by the respondent to the Civil
Service Board of Appeals within thirty (30) days after receipt by him of the
decision." That rendered by the Department Legal Counsel, on April 18,
1962, was served upon petitioner herein on the same date, so that it became
final on May 18, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1963</st1:date>, the Commissioner of
Civil Service had no more authority to revise or modify said decision and his
order of that date, in effect reviewing and reversing it, is, accordingly, null
and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">We note that Honorable Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Roces</span>,
Jr. and <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Aldana</span> are
still named as respondents in this case, in their re­spective capacities as
Secretary of Education and Director of Public Schools, at the time of the
institution of the present case, although, since then, they have long ceased to
hold said offices, the incumbents of which are now <span class="SpellE">Honorables</span>
<span class="SpellE">Onofre</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> and Juan
L. Manuel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter should therefore,
be deemed to have substituted their respective predecessors in office as
respondents herein, in their aforementioned official capacities.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby reversed,
and another one shall be entered perpetually prohibiting respondents herein
from enforcing said order of <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="2">February
