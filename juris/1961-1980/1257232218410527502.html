				<H3>CIRIACO NOBEL, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. VICENTE CABIJE, ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On October 6, 1956, Ciriaco Nobel filed before the Municipal Court of
Cebu City a complaint against Vicente Cabije, et al., to recover the
sum of P908.80, plus damages and attorney's fees, in the form of
underpayment, overtime and separation pay. <br>
  <br>
After trial on the merits, the municipal .court rendered decision, in
favor of the plaintiff, whereupon the defendants, with the exception of
the Manila Sawmill Co., appealed to the court of first instance. On
September 12, 1957, tlie defendants filed their answer setting up some
affirmative defenses, and as the Manila Sawmill Co. did not appeal from
the decision of the municipal court, nor file its answer as required by
the rules, plaintiff moved that it be declared in default; but the
court <em>a quo</em> denied the motion Holding that the answer interposed by its&nbsp; co-defendants redounded to its benefit. <br>
  <br>
  After the pre-trial held by the court <i>a quo</i>,
the defendants filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the court
had no jurisdiction over the case but the Court of Industrial Relations
to which it properly belongs, and notwithstanding the opposition of the
plaintiff, the court <i>a quo</i> found the motion well-taken and dismissed the case. Plaintiff took the present appeal. <br>
  <br>
We believe that the appeal is well-taken, it appearing that, though the
complaint is for recovery of a sum of money representing underpayment,
overtime and separation pay, there is nothing alleged therein that
plaintiff was still in the employ of the defendants, or that he is
seeking his reinstatement to his former employment. Such being the
case, the action is merely for recovery of a monetary obligation which
comes under the jurisdiction of the regular courts: <br>
<blockquote>"Under the law and jurisprudence pertaining to labor
disputes, the Court of Industrial Relations, jurisdiction extends only
to cases involving (<i>a</i>) labor disputes affecting an industry
which is Indispensable to national interest and is so certified by the
President to the Court (Section 10, Republic Act 875); (<i>b</i>) controversy about the Minimum Wage Law (Republic Act No. 602); (<i>c</i>) hours of employment under the Eight-Hour Labor Law (Commonwealth Act Ho. 144), and (<i>d</i>)
unfair labor practice (Section 5 [a], Republic Act 875). And such
disputes, to fall under the jurisdiction of the CIR, must arise while
the employer-employee relationship between the parties exists, or the
employee seeks reinstatement. When such relationship is over and the
employee: does not seeks reinstatement, all claims become monev minims
that fall under the jurisdiction of the regular courts. (Sy Huan <i>vs.</i> Judge Bautista, et al., G. R. No. L-16115, August 29, 1961; <i>See also</i> the cases cited therein)." (Campos, et al. <i>vs.</i> Manila Railroad Company, et al, G. R. No. L-17905, May 25, 1962)</blockquote>
  Wherefore, the order appealed from is set aside. The case Is remanded to the court <i>a quo</i> for further proceedings. Costs against appellees. <br>
  <i><br>
  Bengzon, C, J., Padilla, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Parades, Dizon, Regala,</i> and <i>Makalintal, JJ.,</i> concur. </div>
