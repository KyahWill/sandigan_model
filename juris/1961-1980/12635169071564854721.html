<st1:date year="1964" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1964</st1:date> and from
its resolution of <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="3">March 3, 1965</st1:date>
denying petitioner's motion for recon­sideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts, as gathered from the findings of the Court of Appeals,
follow:</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Mackay Radio and Telegraph Co., Inc., (hereinafter
referred to as Mackay) is an American cor­poration, engaged in the business of
world-wide wireless and radio communications, with a branch office in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime in April, 1952, in <st1:city><st1:place>Tokyo</st1:place></st1:city>,
Mackay engaged the services of respondent John W. Rich (hereinafter referred to
as Rich), an American citizen and a resident of <st1:place><st1:city>San
  Francisco</st1:city>, <st1:state>California</st1:state></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few months later, Mackay assign­ed Rich to
its <st1:place>Manila</st1:place> office as commercial supervisor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rich arrived in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
on <st1:date year="1952" day="7" month="7">July 7, 1952</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On October 21, 1952, a contract of employment
was executed between Mackay and Rich, providing that the employment was for a
three-year period from May 1, 1952 to April 30, 1955, at a salary of U.S. $400
a month; that "upon the satisfactory completion of the term of service x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>, the Company will grant to
the Employee a furlough of three months on full pay with free passage" to
San Francisco, California, U.S.A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
having satisfactorily com­pleted the terms of the contract in May 1955, Rich
went on furlough to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
with the cost of his transportation to <st1:city><st1:place>San Francisco</st1:place></st1:city>,
round trip, paid for by Mackay.</p>

<p class="BODY">While on furlough, Rich was made to report to <span class="SpellE">Mackay's</span>
main offices in <st1:state><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:state> and he
was sent to the <st1:city><st1:place>New Or­leans</st1:place></st1:city> branch
on company business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This work of Rich,
at a time when he was supposed to be on vacation, lasted for 21 days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <st1:state><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:state>,
Rich's new assignment was taken up, and in due time he was again sent to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
arriving in the latter place for his second assignment on <st1:date year="1955" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1955</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second tour of duty of Rich in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
lasted only until <st1:date year="1956" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1956</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1956" day="16" month="2">February
 16, 1956</st1:date>, Rich boarded the SS <span class="SpellE">Tungus</span> for <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>, and after staying in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>
for a few days he took the SS President Cleve­land for <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Francisco</st1:place></st1:city> where he arrived in March 1956.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rich paid for his transportation from <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
to <st1:city><st1:place>San Fran­cisco</st1:place></st1:city> because Mackay
refused to so pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">In June or July, 1957, Rich returned to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He came this time on his own as a temporary
visitor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Short­ly afterwards, Rich
obtained employment with the local office of the RCA Communications, married a
Filipino woman, and became a permanent Philippine resident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was then that Rich pursued his claim
against Mackay for breach of contract of employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His claims having been denied by Mackay, Rich
brought suit against Mackay before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, for damages arising from wrongful dismissal from
employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After trial, the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> rendered a decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, this Court renders judgment in
favor of plaintiff and sentences the defendant to pay unto the former the sum
of P15,000.00, representing the balance of salary up to October 5, 1958; the
sum of P1,438.00, as reimburse­ment of transportation fare from Mani­la to San
Francisco; the sum of P560 as salary for extra services for 21 days; the sum of
P10,000.00 as moral damages; the sum of P10,000.00 as exem­plary damages and
the sum of P5,000 for and as attorney's fees, together with interest at the
legal rate from November 24, 1959, until fully paid, and the costs of the
suit."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Defendant Mackay appealed from the above-mentioned decision of
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> to the Court of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1964</st1:date>, the Court of Ap­peals rendered
a decision modifying the judgment of the lower court by eliminating the award
of exemplary damages and reducing the award of moral damages from P10<span class="GramE">,000</span> to P5,000, and providing that the award for moral
damages and attorney's fees should bear no interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In all other respects the judgment of the
lower court was affirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present appeal before this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Mackay now contends that the Court of Ap­peals erred:<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant Mackay
contends that the Court of Appeals erred in not holding that after the
termination of Rich's contract of employment on April 30, 1955 his em­ployment
from October 5, 1955 to February 15, 1956 was "on a month to month
basis", no new contract of employ­ment having been executed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mackay argues that clause 8 of the original
contract of employment (Exhibit A), which provides that</p>

<blockquote>"8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is further mutually agreed between the
parties hereto that upon the satisfactory completion of the term of service
specified in Clause 1 of this Agreement, the Company will grant to the Employee
a furlough of three months on full pay, with free passage to the place referred
to in Clause 7 above, and free passage from such place to the station of the
company to which he may be assigned upon a renewal of this agreement between
the parties hereto being executed" (Brief for the Petitioner, p. 53).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">should</span> govern
the relationship of the parties, it being stated in said clause that "a
renewal of this agreement between the parties hereto being executed".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is ad­mitted in the instant case that no
written contract of renewal of employment was executed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> Rich, on the other hand,
argues that the matter regarding his re-employment for a 3-year period is a
factual question, and the Court of Appeals had found that his re-employment was
for a 3-year period; and the finding of the Court of Appeals is conclusive upon
this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is to be considered, therefore, is whether the question
raised is one of fact or of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
Joaquin vs. Navarro,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court laid down a guide in determining whether a question is of fact or of
law, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"When the evidence is purely documentary, the authenticity of
which is not questioned and the only issue is the construction to be placed
thereon, or where a case is submitted upon an agreement of facts, or where all
the facts are stated in the judgment and the issue is the correctness of the
conclusions drawn <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, the question is one of
law which may be reviewed by the Supreme Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The decision of the Court of Appeals, appealed from, shows that
the issue regarding the period of re-employ­ment was resolved on the basis of
evidence not purely documentary, because <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
evidence on the matter was both documentary and testimonial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither was the issue decided on the basis of
an agreement of facts, because there was no such agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find that the Court of Appeals made a
thorough examination of the evidence of both parties before arriving at
findings and conclusions, as follows:<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"The <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> statement that he
was sent back to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> for another
3 years finds confirmation from the appel­lant's own officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, the appellant did not
produce any evidence that the second contract was month-to-month, nor did the
appellant deny the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> statement that he was
asked to come back for another three years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The appellant does not question the authenticity of <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
<span class="GramE">F, G, H, I and J.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In short, the appel­lant relies on the absence of a written
contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even in <span class="GramE">its
own</span> documen­tary evidence, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 16, sent by
its <st1:state><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:state> to the <st1:place>Manila</st1:place>
office, reference is made to the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> period of
employ­ment as 'HIS CONTRACT TERM OF THREE YEARS'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It seems that every one always considered the re-employment
as for another 3 years and the failure to put the contract in writing hardly
affected its duration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, no fault
should be attributed to the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, for even with
regard to the first tour of duty which began on <st1:date year="1952" day="1" month="5">May 1, 1952</st1:date>, the written contract for it, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A, was executed only on <st1:date year="1952" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1952</st1:date>, or more than 5 months later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To our minds, it is con­clusive that the
appellant rehired or reemployed the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> for
another period of 3 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contract
com­menced on <st1:date year="1955" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1955</st1:date>,
the day the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> arrived in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
for the second assignment and the day he started draw­ing his salary for this
second assign­ment."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing conclusions of the Court of Appeals, based as they
are upon its findings of facts, cannot be reviewed by this Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Applicable to the issue at bar is the statement of this Court in
Lim vs. <span class="SpellE">Calaguas</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
to wit:</p>

<blockquote>“That query necessarily invites calibration of the whole 'evidence'
considering mainly the credibility of witnesses, existence and relevancy of
specific surrounding circumstances, their relation to each other and to the
whole and the probabilities of the situation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the question must be deemed factual, for the Appeals'
Court to solve."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In Corbin on Contracts,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
We read that the question regarding the term of service in service contracts is
"one of factual interpretation, and very frequently it is a jury
question."</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, the case is now before this Court, and upon
examination of the record and of the issue there­in raised <span class="GramE">We</span>
find that the Court of Appeals correctly held that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Rich was reemployed by appellant Mackay under the same terms and conditions as
in the original contract of employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Horton vs. <span class="SpellE">Wollner</span>, 71 <st1:state><st1:place>Ala.</st1:place></st1:state>
452, cited in Abbot on Facts, 5th ed., 1937, p. 651, <span class="GramE">We</span>
read:</p>

<blockquote>"The weight of authority holds that an employee originally
hired for a de­finite term, who continues to render the same services after the
expiration of such term without explicitly entering into a new agreement, is
prima facie pre­sumed to be serving under a new contract having the same terms
and conditions as the original one."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Again, in Corbin on Contracts, Vol. 3, pp. 689-690, <span class="GramE">We</span> read:</p>

<blockquote>"When parties have made a contract of employment for a
definite period of the expiration of that period the em­ployment is often
continued without making any new agreement about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this conduct, especially if the original
contract was for one year's service, an in­ference will usually be made that
the parties intend a renewal of the contract for a second similar period; such
is said to be the 'presumption,' <span class="SpellE">rebut­table</span> in
character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even though the parties
expressly agree upon a different salary, the presumption will be indulged as to
the extension of time." (Citing Associated Newspapers v. Phillips, 294 F
845; Williams vs. <span class="SpellE">Schalk</span> Chemical Co., 53 P 2d 1015,

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In 56 CJS p. 83, <span class="GramE">We</span>
read:</p>

<blockquote>"As a general rule, where one enters into the service of
another for a definite period, and continues in the employment after the expiration
of that period, without any new contract, the presumption is that the
employment is continued on the terms of the original contract."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find in the record that the presumption of renewal of the
contract of employment of Rich, for the same 3-year period, has not been
rebutted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, as the Court
of Appeals said, Rich's state­ment that he was sent back to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
for another 3 years found confirmation from <span class="SpellE">Mackay's</span>
own officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For instance:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a Vice-President of Mackay, after re­viewing
the concessions given to Rich for his second assignment to Manila, reported to
Executive Vice-Pre­sident Henderson that:</p>

<blockquote>"He [Rich] appeared very pleased with these decisions, and he
returned to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> for a further
3-year period." (Exhibit H-1)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">And in <st1:city><st1:place>Henderson</st1:place></st1:city>'s
second letter to Rich, Exhibit J, he stated that:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> [Mackay]
would have provided you with a return passage to San Francisco at the end of
your <u>second three-year</u> term, just as we did at the end of the term of
your first three-year tour of duty x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
J-2)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Even Mackay itself understood the contract to be for 3 years, as
the <st1:state><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:state> cable (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 16) stated that:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">Pls</span> note as Rich is leaving Manila without completing his contract
term of three years his transportation back to the States will be at his own
expense."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The foregoing evidence certainly
militates against, and overcomes, appellant <span class="SpellE">Mackay's</span>
contention that the second employment of Rich was on a month-to-month basis
because there was no written contract of renewal of employment for another
3-year service.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We now come to the
question of whether, or not, the Court of Appeals erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) in finding that Rich was dismissed by
Mackay before the expiration of the 3-year period of the second employment; (b)
in declaring that Rich is entitled to actual damages of P15,000 which is
approximately 60% of the balance of his unpaid salary of P25,333.34; and (c) in
not deducting the earnings of Rich, in other employments during the unexpired
portion of the term of the contract, in the amount of P20,966.66.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find in the record conflicting evidence on the question of
whether Rich was dismissed from, or Rich did abandon, his job.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In spite of appellant <span class="SpellE">Mackay's</span>
own evidence which shows that it had discharged Rich from his job, said
appellant asserts that Rich abandoned his job.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Regarding this question, the Court of Appeals made the following
findings:</p>

<blockquote>“. . . . . [Like] the trial court we also 'cannot but note the
contradic­tory and irreconcilable positions adopted by defendant in this
regard'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the face of documents coming
from the appellant itself, we find, as the lower court found, that the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> did not abandon his employ­ment but was dismissed
by the appel­lant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This dismissal is a
breach of the 3-year contract of employment."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The question, therefore, is another question of fact, and the
finding of the Court of Appeals on this matter is conclusive on this Court.</p>

<blockquote>"The question had of whether an employee was in fact discharged
or had voluntarily quit or resigned is ordinarily a question of fact for the
jury." (56 CJS p. 461)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In employee's action against employer for wrongful discharge,
evidence that he did not leave employ­ment of his own accord <u>held</u> to pre­sent
jury question and to make jury's finding in favor of plaintiff thereon
conclusive on appeal." (D. Buchanan &amp; Son v. <span class="SpellE">Ewell</span>,
139 S.E. 483)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In action for wrongful discharge of employee, whether
employee volunta­rily quit his employment was for jury." <span class="GramE">(Sinclair Refining </span><st1:place><span class="GramE">Co.</span></st1:place><span class="GramE"> v. <span class="SpellE">McCullom</span>, et al., 24 NE 2d 784).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In action by employee for breach of contract of employment,
evidence as to whether plaintiff voluntarily quit or was discharged held
sufficient for jury." (Crosby v. Bradley, 140 SE 702)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We now determine whether, or not, the award of damages made by
the Court of Appeals to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Rich is
correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the settled rule in this
juris­diction that in an action for breach of contract for employment where the

It has been shown that <span class="SpellE">appel­lee</span> Rich was reemployed

wrongfully discharged from his employment, and the discharge took effect on <st1:date year="1956" day="16" month="2">February 16, 1956</st1:date>, it follows that

deduct what Rich had earned in other employments, during the unexpired period
of his employment with Mackay, from the amount that he would have earned had he
not been wrongfully discharged by Mackay and had worked till the end of the
period stipulated in the contract for employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, the Court of Appeals awarded to Rich
the sum of P15<span class="GramE">,000</span> as actual damages, representing
about 60% of what he would have earned during the unexpired period of his
contract of employment with Mackay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court of Appeals affirmed the award made by the trial court in this respect,
based on the decisions in the cases of Garcia Palomar vs. Hotel de France Co.,
42 Phil. 660, and the case of <span class="SpellE">Sotelo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Behn</span> Meyer &amp; Co. 57 Phil. 775.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is now claimed by appellant Mackay that the Court of Appeals
erred in not deducting the compensa­tion earned by Rich during the period of
the unexpired term of the contract from the amount which he would have earned
during the same period if he had not been wrongfully discharged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, it is the con­tention of
Mackay that the Court of Appeals erred in giving a downright award of P15<span class="GramE">,000</span> to Rich.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find merit in the contention of appellant Mackay.</p>

<p class="BODY">The ruling in the cases of Garcia Palomar vs. Hotel de France

damages for breach of con­tracts of employment were filed before the lapse of
the agreed period of employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>Garcia
Palomar</u>, the contract had more than 20 months to run when the case was
submitted; and in <span class="SpellE"><u>Sotelo</u></span>, the unexpired term
of the contract was 33 months when the case was brought to court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the latter case, this Court awarded
plaintiff "about 60 per centum of the amount which he would have earned
under his contract with defendant if he had been permitted to serve as its
salesman for the entire term," because the Court took into account the
probability that the discharged employee would be able to earn money in another
employment during the period which was still to run after the breach.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case now before Us, however, the action for damages for
breach of the contract of employment was filed <u>after</u> the lapse of the
agreed period of employment, and, therefore, there is no reason to take into
consideration what the employee might earn during the period after discharge
until expiration of the agreed period, because the evidence shows what the dis­charged
employee had <u>actually earned</u> during the period from the date of his
discharge to the date of the ex­piration of the contract of employment.</p>

</span>On appeal, this Court ruled:</p>

of at least 8 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span> of <span class="SpellE">palay</span>
for each year, or a total of 16 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span>, it is the

<blockquote>"Commenting upon Article 1586 of the Civil Code, the

indemnify is implicit in the prohibition to dismiss without cause; and in this
connection he says that in strictness the employer who is proved to have dis­missed
his employee capriciously or unjustifiably should be considered a debtor in bad
faith...."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals gave reasons for granting moral damages, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"With our finding that the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
was in fact dismissed by the appellant, what remains to be resolved is whether
the awards are justified under the circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
because of the nature of his work belonged to exclusive clubs and moved in
select business circles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had a good
name in the com­munity and this good name no doubt suf­fered from his
unjustified dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No doubt also,
this dismissal caused mental anguish and suffering such that when he arrived in
<st1:city><st1:place>San Francisco</st1:place></st1:city> he was hos­pitalized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further contributing to and increasing the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> suffering is the appellant's changing stand from
dismissal then to that of <span class="GramE">aban­donment.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it was bad enough that the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was dismissed without justification, to be blamed
later for abandonment compounds the breach.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It shows a clear attempt on the part of the appellant to evade liability
at all cost which we cannot countenance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We also note that while the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had
simply requested to use part of his ac­crued leave, the appellant, because of
what can be called a distorted cable of its then <st1:place>Manila</st1:place>
manager, cabled back releasing him without ado.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was not even afforded the simple
courtesy of being asked <span class="GramE">for an</span> explanation nor a
softening letter explaining his termina­tion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To our minds, the behavior of the appellant amounts to bad faith
entitling the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to moral damages (Article
2220, Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We feel, however,
that an award of P5<span class="GramE">,000</span> moral damages is reasonable
and sufficient."</blockquote>
