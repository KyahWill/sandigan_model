				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Out of <span style="">a </span>total consignment of 191 <span style="">cases of </span>malleable iron pipe fittings imported from Osaka, Japan
by the Weston Hardware &amp; Plumbing, Inc. sometime in June, 1963, <span style="">8 </span>cases valued at P1,246.97 reportedly
remained undelivered and were considered lost in the course of their
importation into the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
plaintiff Domestic Insurance Company of the Philippines which had indemnified
the owner for the loss and, therefore, was sub<span style="">rogated to the latter's rights, could not, however, definitively determine
at which stage of the importation the loss occurred and which party to hold
responsible <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Finally, the plaintiff lodged a complaint against several alternative
defendants, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the Everett Siam Line,
operator of the <u>SS</u> <u>Pablo</u> which carried the goods; the Everett
Steamship <span style="">Corporation, </span>Philippine
agent of the Everett Siam Line; the Republic of the Philippines, as ope<span style="">rator of the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Service which had </span>allegedly re<span style="">ceived
the goods discharged from the <u>SS</u> <u>Pablo</u>; and the A.R. Reyes &amp;
Company to whose bonded warehouse an undefined portion of the subject
importation is claimed to have been subsequently transferred without the
owner's consent.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The present appeal is
from the dismissal by the court <u>a</u> </span><u>quo</u><span style=""> </span>of the complaint insofar as it
affects the <st1:place><st1:placename>defendant</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Republic</st1:placetype></st1:place>
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
<span style="">on the
grounds </span>of 1) lack of jurisdiction and <span style="">2) non-suability of </span>the State without
its consent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These involve pure
questions of law.</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the matter of lack
of jurisdiction, the lower court reasoned that since the complaint against the
Government is one founded upon a breach of the contract of deposit and involves
an amount not exceeding P10,000, the same is exclusively cognizable by the city
or municipal court.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This is obviously erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> overlooks the fact that the complaint also
<span class="SpellE">impleads</span>, in the alternative, the Everett Siam Line
and its Philippine agent, the Everett Steamship <span style="">Corporation, upon a breach of their contract of <span class="SpellE">affreight<span style="">ment</span></span></span>, thus, properly
invoking the court's admiralty jurisdiction.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The rule is now settled that in the <span class="SpellE">joinder</span> of two
causes of action, in the alternative, under section 5 of Rule 2 of the Rules of
Court, the fact that one of the causes of action is within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the city or municipal court, will not deprive the Court of
First Instance of its jurisdiction over both, if the latter has jurisdiction
over one of the causes of action.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>2. As regards, however, the non-suability of the State without its
consent in its operation Of the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service,
the lower court correctly dismissed the complaint insofar as the Republic of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have repeatedly held
that the then Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service, as an arm of
the Bureau of Customs, was performing services purely incidental to the
governmental function of assessing and collecting customs duties, and, in
engaging in such necessary incidental activity, the Government did not thereby
shed its immunity from suit.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiff's remedy, if any, may be found in the provisions of
Act 3083 and Commonwealth Act 327.</p>

<p class="BODY">A third ground relied upon by the lower court in dismissing the
case against the Republic of the Philippines, although assailed by the
plaintiff, need not be resolved <span style="">in </span>view
of the result we have just reached.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment, dismissing the complaint in so
far as the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is concerned, is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
pronouncement as to costs.</p>
