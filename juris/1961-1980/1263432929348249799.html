<p class="BODY">On September 3, 1975, Alberto R. <span class="SpellE">Salanga</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Salanga</span> and Rodolfo
Chua filed in the Court of Appeals against Progressive Commercial Bank and the
Hon. <span class="SpellE">Onofre</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span>, in
his capacity as Presiding Judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, a petition for <i>certiorari</i> to annul the
respondent judge's order of July 21, 1975 issued in Civil Case No. Q-19158 of
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> allowing the
plaintiffs in said case to present its evidence <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The facts, as found by the Court of Appeals, are:</p>

<blockquote>"IT RESULTING:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the
antecedents are quite simple; Civil Q-19158 was filed on 9 August, 1974 for sum
of money against three (3) defendants, the herein petitioners, by Progressive
Commercial Bank, herein private respondent; cause was failure to pay promissory
note attached to complaint, and supported by chattel mortgage over motor car of
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Salanga</span>; upon filing of complaint,
Progressive prayed for and secured attachment on car not of <span class="SpellE">Salanga</span>
but of petitioner, Chua; defendant Chua moved to dissolve attachment because of
alleged lack of good grounds as well upon filing <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>,
and he also moved to cite counsel for plaintiff for contempt for having
allegedly used the car while in custody of Sheriff; and Judge <span class="SpellE">Lustre</span>, formerly presiding Branch VII, permitted lifting of
attachment on Chua's car upon the filing of the P45,000.00 <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>
which was done, page 71, original <span class="SpellE">expediente</span>; in due
time, defendants answered, page 90, raising principal defense that promissory
note had been subject to collateral understanding that consideration thereof
would be</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'payable out of the proceeds'</p>

<blockquote>of a certain television program being
conducted by <span class="SpellE">Salanga</span>, but by the imposition of
Martial Law, continuation of said television program became impossible,
therefore, they asked restructuring of liquidation of loan but the proposal was
summarily rejected by Progressive, page 92; therefore, they took it that
payment should be suspended in the meantime; <span class="SpellE">expediente</span>
shows that pre-trial together with pending incidents was set for 11 November,
1974, but was postponed upon agreement of the parties, page 111; then it was
re-scheduled for 13 May, 1975, but reset for 30 May, 1975, page 115; then reset
for 9 June, 1975, page 117; but neither did this go thru; then on back of page
117 appears a handwritten notice of hearing already on the merits for 1 July,
1975 at 8:00 A.M., signed by both counsel; <span style="">going to show that apparently pre-trial was already waived </span>by
both; but again hearing did not go through on 8 July, 1975; what then appears
is that on this 8 July, 1975, respondent Judge, who had taken over from Judge <span class="SpellE">Lustre</span> who had already retired, caused issuance of a new
notice, for 21 and 28 July, 1975, at 8:00 A.M. of a notice, captioned,<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Notice of Hearing'</p>

<blockquote>which was mimeographed, but below it immediately, the letters,</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Hearing of Incidents &amp; Motions'</p>

<blockquote>typewritten; and it is here where complications set in. -</blockquote>

<blockquote>Because while this notice was received by defendant's counsel,
Atty. Mariano P. Marcos, on 17 July, 1975, he did not appear on scheduled date,
21 July, 1975 at 8:00 A.M., instead, he sent his own client, <span class="SpellE">Salanga</span> to plead verbally for postponement, because he,
Atty. Marcos, had to attend to a hearing in Civil 19051, Philippine Public
Affairs Consultants vs. Fernando <span class="SpellE">Pedrosa</span>, et al.,
Court of First Instance, <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
on same date and hour; page 169, <span class="SpellE">rollo</span>, therefore,
instant case was called in his absence, and because of that, His Honor, now
respondent Judge, issued his order in open court reading,</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">When this case was called for trial this morning, the defendants
and their counsel failed to appear notwithstanding due notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view thereof, the plaintiff was allowed to
present its evidence ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span>, in support of its
complaint, its opposition to the motion to lift attachment, and its opposition
to the motion for contempt, after which plaintiff rested its case and submitted
all the pending incidents for resolution.</p>

<p class="2Q">The Court however orders the plaintiff to submit a memorandum
within ten (10) days from today, after which the case shall be deemed
submitted.</p>

<p class="2Q">SO ORDERED.</p>

<p class="2Q">In open Court, July 21, 1975.' p. 119, Original <span class="SpellE">Expediente</span>,</p>

<blockquote>and plaintiff Progressive, presented its
evidence, and closed, but immediately also, the very next day, page 58,
defendants thru counsel moved to reconsider, on the position that he had as
expounded, the obligation to appear, and he did appear, in <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>
Branch in connection with Civil 19051, that was why he had instructed his
client to come to court in present case and orally plead postponement, not only
this, but that the notice of hearing he had received had by him been understood
to mean notice only of the hearing on the 'Incidents and Motion', not of the
Notice of Hearing on the Merits; but His Honor denied, and as well a second
motion; the last order being dated 13 August, 1975, page 200 <span class="SpellE">expediente</span>; it is because of this that petitioners
defendants in the court below, have come here on <i>certiorari</i> on 3 September,
1975, on the thesis that His Honor's actuations constituted <span style="">grave abuse, but required to answer, respondents
contend the contrary";</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals found that the notice of hearing was
ambiguous because:</p>

<blockquote>"I. CONSIDERING:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
the notice on page 118 <span class="SpellE">expediente</span> reads,</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Notice of Hearing'</p>

<p class="2Q">'Hearing on Incidents &amp; <span style="">Motions'</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>setting these for 21 and 28 July, 1975 at
8:00 A.M., perhaps, it can be understood to mean that not only was case set for
hearing on the merits but also that said hearing also was for hearing of
pending <span style="">incidents and pending motion,
but perhaps also, the fact that the words,</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Notice of Hearing'</p>

<blockquote>was in the formal mimeographed form as were
also all the other parts of the notice except the dates and the name of the
Judge and the name of <span style="">the Deputy Clerk
of Court, while the words,</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'HEARING ON INCIDENTS &amp; MOTION'</p>

<blockquote>were in typewritten form, - really, one who
reads might be confused, he could have taken this notice to mean notice for
hearing on the incidents and motion, not for hearing on the merits, for after
the words,</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'NOTICE OF HEARING',</p>

<blockquote>there was not added the word, 'and'; if
this word 'and' had only been added there could have been no more ambiguity; as
it is, this Court must concede for defendants-petitioners that there really was
that ambiguity in the notice.";<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals said that although counsel for the
defendants was impolite in not filing a written motion for postponement,
perhaps the "impoliteness of counsel should not prejudice his
client".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent portion of
the decision of the Court of Appeals reads:</p>

<blockquote>"It is true however, that counsel for defendants having
received the notice of hearing in present case on 17 July, 1975, it had
behooved him, because of his predicament, to have immediately moved for
postponement, it was impoliteness for him to have failed to do so, and to just
have instructed his client to appear in Court on 21 July, 1975 and to move orally
for that; but perhaps, impoliteness of counsel should not prejudice his client,
it is the client who has a litigation, not his coun<span style="">sel; </span>here, client himself went to Court, see page 120 <span class="SpellE">expediente</span>, and informed trial Judge, herein respondent,
about the situation, - <span style="">unfortunately, -
trial Judge did not even in his order of 21 July, 1975, state that His Honor
was denying that verbal plea of litigant himself; His Honor totally ignored
client's verbal plea, which was not very correct, in fact in the mind of this
Court, rather gravely wrong, the private citizen who knocks at the portals of
Justice does not deserve to be ignored’;</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">However, the Court of Appeals dismissed the case for the
following reason:</p>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>CONSIDERING:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That if foregoing were to be the only basis to resolve this <i>certiorari</i>,
perhaps it would only be correct to grant, and give defendant a clear day in
Court, - but there is the other line of resistance relied upon by plaintiff
Bank, which is that motion for reconsideration to be given a chance to prove
the defense is not supported by an affidavit of merits; and here, this Court
after some reflection, must concede unto Progressive Bank that where a litigant
seeks another chance, it behooves him really to show good cause, to demonstrate
that if he were to be given that, he would in all probability, be able to prove
his defense; and here, it is true that defendants admit that promissory note,
what they only allege is that it had been written subject to an alleged
collateral condition that payment thereon was to be made out of the proceeds of
their television program, - which disappeared because of the proclamation of
Martial Law; - now as to this, under Rule 130, sec. 7, par. a, defendants do
have the right to prove that defense, - but one thing is their right to do so,
and another, to present a probable showing of the truth thereof in an affidavit
of merits; which they have not done; they should have presented memoranda,
notes, signed by Bank's representatives, or failing that, in the very least,
affidavit of witnesses or even them<span style="">selves,
that at the signing of the promissory note, there was that clear collateral
understanding, to convince the trial Judge that another chance might destroy
plaintiff Bank's case and the reason for the jurisprudence requiring such
affidavit is because otherwise, the grant of another chance would only prolong
a litigation without a useful purpose; nor should it be argued as defendants do
that, an affidavit of merits is needed only if there is already a decision, not
when there is none yet, for the reason for the affidavit is there just the
same, even where no decision has not as yet been promulgated; the net result of
all these is to justify that after all there has not been shown such a grave </span><span style="">abuse of authority </span><span style="">as to warrant <i>certiorari</i>.";</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It appears, however, that an affidavit of merit was attached to
the second motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The said affidavit alleges the defendants' good defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus paragraph 7 of said affidavit reads:</p>

<blockquote>"7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants' good defense consists of the
fact, as alleged in their answer, that the promissory note (printed at that and
therefore a contract of adhesion under the Civil Code) does not reflect the
true agreement of the parties since the loan was extended to defendants on the
understanding that repayment thereof shall be in kind through the <span class="SpellE">Telebingo</span> T.V. program which defendant Alberto R. <span class="SpellE">Salanga</span> was then conducting and financing through the
proceeds of said loan; the declaration of martial law and circumstances
thereafter rendered the continuation of said program impossible which is a
valid excuse for nonpayment of the loan subject of the said case within the
period stipulated.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Even if the allegations in said paragraph
are not considered as sufficient compliance with the rule on affidavits of
merit, the petitioners are entitled to due process of law.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The ambiguity is the notice of hearing is such that the counsel
for the defendants, petitioners <span style="">herein,
</span>had good reason to believe that the hearing was only on the incidents
and motion and not <span style="">on </span>the merits
of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of such ambiguity,
the petitioners are deemed to have been denied their day in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent trial judge certainly acted with
grave abuse of discretion in proceeding with the hearing on the merits and in
denying the motions for reconsideration of the defendants, petitioners herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Where the rules which are merely secondary in importance are made
to override the ends of justice and the technical rules had been misapplied to
the <span style="">prejudice o</span>f the substantial
rights of a party, said rigid application cannot be countenanced.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the interest of justice, the petitioners should be given an
opportunity to prove their defense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Technicalities should give way to the realities of the situation.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>
