dated <st1:date year="1976" day="16" month="2">February 16, 1976</st1:date> of
the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. SP-04403 dismissing petitioners' petition
for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> with writ of preliminary injunction
for lack of merit, as well as, of the resolution dated <st1:date year="1976" day="11" month="5">May 11, 1976</st1:date> of the same court denying the two

<p class="BODY">The petition in L-43813 dated June 24, 1976 was filed by petitioner
Francisco C. Hernandez, as heir and in his capacity as judicial administrator
of the estate of the late <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> C. Hernandez Sr.,
through counsel, Atty. Manuel T. De <span class="SpellE">Guia</span>, while the

C. Hernandez Sr., through counsel, Atty. Antonio R. <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main thrust of these petitions is to seek a review of the
April 24, 1967 order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
Branch II, in Special Proceeding No. 5309 admitting to probate the last will
and testament of the late <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> C. Hernandez Sr.,
and of the August 10, 1968 order of the same court in the same special
proceeding ordering the executrix and/or the estate of the testator to pay
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> J. <span class="SpellE">Tansinsin</span>
the sum of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand (P250,000.00) Pesos as attorney's fees
with legal interests from August 23, 1967.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 19, 1976 and during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of these cases, the petitioner in L-43813, Francisco C. Hernandez died, and by
resolution dated August 25, 1976 this Court allowed the substitution of the
deceased, as petitioner in this case, by his heirs, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> Gabriel <span class="SpellE">Leuterio</span>, wife, and children:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Georgina, Geraldine, Wilhelmina, Francisco

in the notice of death and motion for substitution filed by petitioner's
counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(p. 450,

<p class="BODY">By motion dated February 10, 1977, Atty. Ernesto O. <span class="SpellE">Rodas</span> manifested to this Court that he was appointed the
new administrator of the estate of the late <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> C.
Hernandez Sr. by order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
Branch II, dated January 11, 1977 issued in Special Proceeding No. 5309 without
objection from any of the heirs of the late <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> C.
Hernandez Sr. and, likewise, without objection on the part of <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Leuterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Hernandez who had been appointed in Special
Proceeding No. 8324 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
Branch I, as <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> of the estate of the late
Francisco C. Hernandez, her deceased husband and the original petitioner in
L-43813, and prayed, among other things, for his substitution as petitioner in
L-43813 in lieu of the heirs of the late Francisco C. Hernandez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(pp. 614-618, ibid.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="15" month="3">March 15, 1977</st1:date>
a Motion to <span class="GramE">Dismiss</span> the petitions dated <st1:date year="1977" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1977</st1:date> was filed jointly, by
Ernesto O. <span class="SpellE">Rodas</span>, present administrator of the estate

Hernandez, Max <span class="SpellE">Mojica</span> Hernandez, Lourdes D.
Hernandez, Jacinto D. Hernandez, Priscilla D. Hernandez and <span class="SpellE">Enriqueta</span>
Bautista, with the assistance of their respective counsel, on the ground that
all the parties having interests in the estate of the late <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span>
C. Hernandez Sr. have amicably settled their differences and have agreed on a
"Partial Project of Partition and Settlement of Claims" dated March
1, 1977 and approved by Order dated March 3, 1977 of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Branch II; with attached <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copy of the original order of approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(pp. 705-724, ibid.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Only counsel Manuel T. de <span class="SpellE">Guia</span> filed
comment dated March 22, 1977 on the said motion to dismiss stating that the
record shows that he is the lawyer who had actively and personally handled the
case for the administrator Francisco C. Hernandez (now deceased) but he had not
been honored with a simple notice of termination of his services; that he came
to know of the Partial Project of Partition and Settlement of Claims dated
March 1, 1977 only on March 18, 1977; and that the filing of the present motion
to dismiss was attended by a flagrant violation of the principles of
professional ethics.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(p.
726, ibid.)</span> This comment states, however, no particular objection or
opposition to the Motion to Dismiss.</p>

Dismiss dated <st1:date year="1977" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1977</st1:date>,
the Court resolves to grant the same and the petitions in L-43813 and L-43952
are accordingly DISMISSED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All incidents
involved and pending in these two cases are rendered moot and academic
requiring no further action from this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Any claim for attorney's fees of Atty. Manuel T. de <span class="SpellE">Guia</span>
is reserved in his favor for action in the court below.</p>

<p class="BODY">Let copies hereof be furnished all parties concerned including
individually the children of deceased Francisco C. Hernandez who are enumerated
