<span class="SpellE">Veles</span>, <span class="SpellE">Teo­dulfo</span> <span class="SpellE">Veles</span> and Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Veles</span> were
charged with the crime of robbery with double homicide before the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vic­tims were Alfonso Yu and Victor Yu,
father and son, respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the court rendered a deci­sion acquitting Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Veles</span> reasonable doubt, and finding Manuel <span class="SpellE">Fontillas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Venerando</span> <span class="SpellE">Veles</span> and <span class="SpellE">Teodulfo</span> <span class="SpellE">Veles</span> guilty as charged, and sentencing them to <u>reclusion</u>

law, to pay jointly and severally, the heirs of the deceased in the amounts <span class="GramE">stated</span> in the decision in concept of indemnity and damages,

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this appeal from the decision by Ma­nuel
<span class="SpellE">Fontillas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Venerando</span> <span class="SpellE">Veles</span> and <span class="SpellE">Teodulfo</span> <span class="SpellE">Veles</span>.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Alfonso Yu was the owner of a general merchand­ise store in Las
Nieves, <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span> City, <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>,
Adjoin­ing the store at the back was a mill for grinding pa lay and corn, also
owned by Alfonso Yu.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><u>Alfreda</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>Layno</u></span>,
wife of Alfonso Yu, declared that at about 6:00 O'clock in the evening of
October 22, 1963, she was returning to the store from an er­rand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The store had two doors fronting the
street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching one of the doors,
she saw six men seated on a bench thereat.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She talked to one of them, later identified as appellant Manuel <span class="SpellE">Fontillas</span>, who was holding a Pepsi-Cola bottle. Isaac <span class="SpellE">Zoleta</span>, municipal judge of Las Nieves, who was boarding
with the family of Alfonso Yu, was seated on another bench outside the store,
conversing with a woman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alfreda</span> <span class="SpellE">Layno</span> be­came suspicious
of the presence of the six men.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
warned her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alfonso Yu ordered
that the store be closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A man, later
identified as Manuel Mango, dashed inside the store. He approached Alfonso Yu
wanting to buy cigarettes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the latter
was about to open a drawer to get cigarettes, the man (Mango) poked a gun at
Alfonso Yu telling him not to move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
latter raised his hand and uttered "<span class="SpellE">waw</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ano­ther man, later identified as <span class="SpellE">Teodulfo</span> <span class="SpellE">Veles</span>, approach­ed
Alfonso Yu and held his hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seized
with fear, <span class="SpellE">Alfreda</span> <span class="SpellE">Layno</span>
hid behind some boxes in the mezzanine whence she saw another man inside the
store, later identified as <span class="SpellE">Venerando</span> <span class="SpellE">Veles</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a
while, she noticed that the man (<span class="SpellE">Venerando</span> <span class="SpellE">Veles</span>) was no longer at the place where she saw him before,
so she ran away and went to the house of her neighbor Roman <span class="SpellE">Mu­sico</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, <span class="SpellE">Alfreda</span> <span class="SpellE">Layno</span> was con­fronted by counsel for the defense with her
affidavit sworn to before the provincial fiscal on October 28, 1963, and
quoting several questions and answers from the said affidavit, counsel asked
the witness if they were her statements, to which the witness replied in the
affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The quoted portions of the
affidavit, marked as Exhibits 5-A and 5-B, are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That the robbers forcibly took from us cash in the amount of
about four thousand two hund­red pesos P4,200.00), jewelries valued at about
P100.00, assort­ed items from our store like flashlights, dry goods and other
items valued at about P300.00;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Q<span class="GramE">.-</span> Can you identify the rob­bers if you see them again?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A.-</span>
I do not know but <u>I think I can identify some of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>them if I see them again</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Q.-
Showing to you these pho­tographs (affiant shown the photographs of Manuel
Mango, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Fontillas</span>, Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Veles</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Teodulfo</span> <span class="SpellE">Veles</span>, <span class="SpellE">Venerando</span> <span class="SpellE">Veles</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balbuena</span>) <u>what can
you say about these</u> photographs?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A.-</span>
I can only remember this person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<u>Affiant
pointing to the photograph of Ma­nuel <span class="SpellE">Fontillas</span></u>)
I remem­ber him because he was the one who pretended to buy some cigarettes
from my husband and pointed his gun to my husband during that incident."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Continuing her testimony on cross-examination, <span class="SpellE">Alfreda</span> <span class="SpellE">Layno</span> was asked why
"<u>she cannot recognize the persons who entered the store by their photographs</u>?"
and she answered, "If I use eyeglasses, because since the incident my eyes
were defective," and "I cannot identify clearly (the photographs)
because the lenses of my eyeglasses are blurred."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the witness insisted that when she
was investigated by the PC, and was asked if she could identify the persons who
entered the store, she told the PC that she could identify them.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, on direct examination, <span class="SpellE">Alfreda</span>
<span class="SpellE">Layno</span> pointed to Manuel <span class="SpellE">Fontillas</span>
as the man with whom she conversed and who was holding a Pepsi-Cola bot­tle;
she declared that the one who wanted to buy cigarette was the dead man (Manuel
Mango) in the picture, exhibit 1-A; the man who approached Alfonso Yu and held
the latter's hand was <span class="SpellE">Teodulfo</span> <span class="SpellE">Veles</span>,
and she pointed to him at the trial; and the man she saw guarding the store
while she was in the mezzanine, was <span class="SpellE">Venerando</span> <span class="SpellE">Veles</span>, and she also pointed to him at the trial.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Emma Yu</u>, daughter of Alfonso Yu, 24 years old, was seated
at a table inside the store making entries in the business book, when she heard
the order of her father to close the store.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She stood up to help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sud­denly,
a man, later identified as Manuel Mango, dash­ed inside the store to buy
cigarettes. While Alfonso Yu was opening a drawer to get cigarettes, Manuel
Mango, with a drawn gun, approached Alfonso Yu telling him not to move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Taken aback, Alfonso Yu raised his hands and
uttered "<span class="SpellE">waw</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another man, later identified as <span class="SpellE">Teodulfo</span> <span class="SpellE">Veles</span>, advanced towards
Alfon­so Yu, and both Mango and <span class="SpellE">Teodulfo</span> surrounded
Alfonso Yu.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A man brought Victor Yu
inside the store. Six men entered the store.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Teodulfo</span> <span class="SpellE">Veles</span> and
his com­panion ordered her to go upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the second floor of the house, she met her brother Jose Yu. Then, <span class="SpellE">Teodulfo</span> <span class="SpellE">Veles</span> entered the room
of Judge <span class="SpellE">Zoleta</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After a while, <span class="SpellE">Teodulfo</span> <span class="SpellE">Veles</span>
emerged from the room, and ordered her and her brother to go downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Once downstairs, the men
opened the drawers where the mo­ney was kept.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>They took the money in the drawer, and also
jewelry, flashlights, batteries, textiles and many other things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the opportunity for escape presented
itself, she and her brother ran away and went to the house of a neighbor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On October 26, 1963, Emma Yu was investigated
by the provincial fiscal, and her testimony in court substantially conforms <span class="GramE">with</span> the contents of her affidavit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge <u>Isaac</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Zoleta</u></span>
declared that as he was preparing to go inside the store, a man grabbed him by
the collar of his shirt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was released
when someone shouted "do not include him".<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Zoleta</span> ran to a
neighboring house and apprised the people of the robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The store was well-lighted with several
electric bulbs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Zoleta</span>
was not able to recognize the man who grabbed him because he was at his
back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the same time, <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Bation</span>, policeman of Las
Nie­ves, was approaching the door of the store, when a man poked a pistol at
his back and made him lie down with his face pressed against a pile of sacks.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Jose</u> <u>Yu</u>, 11 years old, student, son of Alfon­so Yu,
declared that at about 6:00 o'clock in the evening of October 22, 1963, he was
in the store of his father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A man
approached his father to buy ci­garettes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Suddenly, the man drew a gun and pointed it at his father, and at the
same time another man jumped over a table and approached his father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A man approached him (Jose) and ordered him
to go up­stairs, and thereat he met his sister Emma. He re­cognized the man,
later identified as <span class="SpellE">Teodulfo</span> <span class="SpellE">Veles</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter entered the room of Judge <span class="SpellE">Zoleta</span> from which he emerged after a while.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The men ordered him (Jose) and his sister
Emma to go down followed by the men.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the store, the men forcibly opened the drawers and took the money inside the
drawers.</p>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, he declared that on Octo­ber 26, 1963 he
executed an affidavit, marked Exhibit 2 for the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He affirmed the veracity of the answers to
questions numbers 5, 6 and 7 thereof, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Q<span class="GramE">.-</span> If you will see that per­sons, can you still re­cognize
him?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A.-</span>
I can identify the tall persons wearing yellow shirt and the person who pointed
the pistol at Papa.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Q<span class="GramE">.-</span> These persons can you identify them?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Affiant shown to the persons of <span class="SpellE">Venerando</span> <span class="SpellE">Veles</span>, Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Veles</span>, <span class="SpellE">Teodulfo</span> <span class="SpellE">Veles</span> and Manuel, all of <span class="SpellE">Mandamo</span>,
Las Nieves)</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A.-</span>
These two persons are the ones that I know.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">(Affiant pointing to <span class="SpellE">Teodulfo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Veles</span> and <span class="SpellE">Venerando</span> <span class="SpellE">Veles</span>.)</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Q<span class="GramE">.-</span> Where is that person who brought you there your brother

only this <span class="GramE">whom</span> I can recog­nize," (and pointed to
<span class="SpellE">Venerando</span> <span class="SpellE">Veles</span>).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Being shown the pictures of two dead men appear­ing in Exhibits 1
and 1-A, he identified them as two of the robbers who were killed on that
occasion, later identified as Manuel Mango and <span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Balbuena</span>, and he declared that he could recognize
them because he saw them in the store.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Benita</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Balonda</u></span>, 18 years
old, cook in the house of Alfonso Yu, declared that at past 6:00 o'clock in the
evening of October 12, 1963, she was in the kit­chen preparing supper; she saw
her master, Alfonso Yu, being choked by a man, later identified as <span class="SpellE">Venerando</span> <span class="SpellE">Veles</span>; she saw three
men, but could recognize only one of them whom she pointed at the trial to be <span class="SpellE">Venerando</span> <span class="SpellE">Veles</span>; she ran to the
house of a neighbor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was when she was
running that she heard several shots in­side the store and in the street.</p>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, she declared that a few days after the
robbery, she was brought to the PC headquarters at <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span>
City and investigated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her statement,
dated October 28, 1963, before the provin­cial fiscal, is exhibit 4 for the
defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The PC asked her if she could
identify the robbers; she ans­wered in the affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Confronting her with her affidavit, counsel
for the defense read <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the answer to question
number "3", thus:</p>

<blockquote>"A.- After that time and date, I
was about to go downstairs to get some vegetables be­cause I (was) preparing
our supper when I met my employ­er, Alfonso Yu, going up­stairs to the house
followed by a person whom I do not recognize."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Questions numbered 5, 6 and 7 in the
affidavit, marked Exhibit 4-A and the corresponding answers for the de­fense, <span class="GramE">were</span> also quoted to the witness, thus:</p>

<blockquote>“5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Q<span class="GramE">.-</span> Showing to you these pic­tures (photographs) of these
persons shown to you at the provincial jail on <st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1963</st1:date>, what can you say about that?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A.-</span>
This one, sir, was the person whom I saw follow­ing my employer and the one who
choked him." <span class="GramE">(Affiant pointing to the photograph of <span class="SpellE">Teodulfo</span> <span class="SpellE">Veles</span>.)</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Q<span class="GramE">.-</span> What made you so sure that he was the one?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A.-</span>
Because I still remember his face and I still remember that he was wearing a cap."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">She affirmed the truth of her statements.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><u>Teresita</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>Arendayen</u></span>,
14 years old, maid in the house of Alfonso Yu, declared that the man who choked
Alfonso Yu was <span class="SpellE">Teodulfo</span> <span class="SpellE">Veles</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Late in the evening, Emma Yu returned to the store with Judge <span class="SpellE">Zoleta</span>. They found Alfonso Yu al­ready dead, and Victor Yu,
seriously wounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter died on
the way to the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bodies of
two slain robbers, later identified as <span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balbuena</span> and Manuel Mango, were found outside the
store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Near the body of Manuel Mango, a
pistol, ca­liber .38, and a single-bladed dagger were found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inside the store were found live-bullets,
slugs and <span class="SpellE">cartriges</span>, and a red cap all of which were
turned over to the authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Sgt. Ernesto</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Baril</u></span>, chief
investigator of the 66th PC at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Butuan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, conducted an investigation
the day after the commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After information were gathered from the inmates of the house, the
accused were picked up and brought to the PC headquarters for questioning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused denied having anything to do with
the crime; they claimed that they were in <span class="SpellE">Mandamo</span> on
the day and at the time the robbery was committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the provincial jail, the four accused were
made to stand in a line-up, in­terspersed one another with other convicts, and
the government witnesses Emma Yu, Jose Yu, Benita <span class="SpellE">Balonda</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Arendayen</span> were
asked to identify the rob­bers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
basis of the evidence gathered by the PC and the provincial fiscal, the
affidavits of the witnesses, and the identification of the accused in the
provincial jail by the witnesses, the information was filed in court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Summarizing the evidence of the prosecution, they tended to show
that six men entered the store, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Teodulfo</span> <span class="SpellE">Veles</span>, <span class="SpellE">Venerando</span> <span class="SpellE">Veles</span>, Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Ve­les</span>, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Fontillas</span>, Manuel
Mango and <span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bal­buena</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last two, Manuel Mango and <span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bal­buena</span>, were killed
while attempting to escape from the scene of the crime; the first four were
arrested and charged with the crime of robbery with double homicide before the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>; one of them,
Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Veles</span>, was acquitted on reason­able doubt,
and the remaining accused were found guilty of the offense charged and
sentenced accord­ingly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victims,
Alfonso Yu and Victor Yu, were killed during and on the occasion of the robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crime was committed between <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00</st1:time> and <st1:time minute="30" hour="18">6:30
 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="10">October
 22, 1963</st1:date>, in Las Nieves, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Butuan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Agusan</span></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The scene of the crime was well-lighted with
several burning electric bulbs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
scene of the crime and during its commission, the appellants were recognized by
the witnesses of the prosecution and were identified during the trial; and in
the affidavits executed by said witnesses just a few days after the robbery,
the appellants were pin­pointed as the perpetrators of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contending that the evidence of the prosecution have not
established beyond reasonable doubt the pre­sence of the appellants at the
scene of the crime, and relying heavily on their defense of <u>alibi</u>, the appellants
have assailed the decision of the trial court under two (2) assignment of
errors:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, "in giving weight
and credit to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses"; Second,
"in convicting the accused of the crime charged."</p>

<p class="NUM"><span class="GramE">1.-</span> Citing the testimony of Judge <span class="SpellE">Zoleta</span> who, admittedly, was outside the store conversing
with a woman, and simply because he had declared that he did not recognize the
man who grabbed him by the collar of his shirt, the appellants argue that with
more reason the witnesses of the prosecution could not have recognized the
appellants because of their state of fear.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The argument is <u>non</u> <u>sequitur</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be re­membered that, according to <span class="SpellE">Zoleta</span>, the man was behind him, and when he was grabbed by
the collar of his shirt, a shout was heard "do not include him", and
he was immediately released, and he ran away; on the other hand, the witnesses
of the prosecution were in­side the store where the crime was being committed,
and they had the opportunity to recognize the appel­lants who were not masked,
for the incident did not happen in a split of seconds but lasted for about
twenty to twenty-five minutes.</p>

<p class="NUM"><span class="GramE">2.-</span> The testimony of Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Cuvillar</span>, witness for the defense, rural policeman of Las

<span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, is relied upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He declared that the appellants were not at
the scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, as we shall
show presently, this witness, to our mind, had attempted to distort the facts,
or perjured himself in his de­sire to help the appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To quote his testimony:</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The foregoing portions of the testimony
of <span class="SpellE">Cuvillar</span> clearly show that the men he saw at the
store were the two slain robbers, but he also affirmed that the appellants were
not at the scene of the crime, and the basis of his affirmation <span class="GramE">is,</span> that he did not see them at the store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His affirmation, however, as shown by the
evidence, is without basis and a fabrication in his desire to help the
appellants, because definitely he admitted that when he arrived at the store
the robbers had already left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To quote
his testimony:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span class="GramE">.-</span><span style=""> </span>When you head the shots, you were still in your

that was the time I closed my store and immediately thereafter, I ran towards
the house of Alfonso Yu but I had not reached yet the house of Alfonso Yu

already 7 meters away from the house of Alfonso Yu because there were already
persons.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="GramE">Q.-</span> In other words, you were not able to get inside the
store of Alfonso Yu?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="GramE">A.-</span> Yes, sir, at the time of the incident, I was not inside
the store of Alfonso Yu.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the

<p class="NUM"><span class="GramE">3.-</span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabio</span>, a guard in the
provincial jail of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, was presented to establish
the fact that at the confrontation of the accused by the witnesses of the
prosecution in the provincial jail on <st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="10">October
 27, 1963</st1:date>, the witnesses were not able to identify the
appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He declared thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At 11:30 in the morning of October 27, 1963,
Sgt. Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Baril</span>, investigator of the PC, brought
to the provincial jail, Emma Yu, Jose Yu, Benita <span class="SpellE">Balonda</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Arenda­yen</span> to
find out whether the said persons would be able to identify the appellants;
that they were not able to identify the accused; that the office of the
provincial jail keeps a record book where are entered diverse mat­ters
transpiring in the jail, such as the visit of wit­nesses to identify certain
accused; that on this parti­cular visit of Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Baril</span>,
accompanied by the witnesses of the prosecution, on October 27, 1963, he
recorded in his <u>personal diary and not in the record book (blotter) of the
office of the provincial jail what transpired at the confrontation</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To corroborate his testimony, he read on page
4 of his diary the following entry:</p>

<blockquote>"At <st1:time minute="30" hour="11">11:30 a.m.</st1:time>,
Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Baril</span> arrived at the station for the purpose of
identifying the ac­cused, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Fontillas</span> and nobody
was pinpointed.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">He also declared that the entry in his
diary was made by him "<u>during and after the identification was fi­nished</u>."
Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span class="GramE">.-</span> Will
you please tell this Honorable Court whether or not you made this entry?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="GramE">A.-</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir, I made
that entry during and after the identi­fication was finished."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing, however, is self-impeached.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On cross-examination, he admitted that <u>the
entry was made by him in the house and not during and after the iden­tification</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span class="GramE">.-</span> And
you entered the event which happened at <st1:time minute="30" hour="11">11:30
 o'clock</st1:time> in the provincial jail?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="GramE">A.-</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir, in the
house.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="GramE">Q.-</span><span style=""> </span>In other words, you
made this entry outside of your tour of duty?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="GramE">A.-</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">And the entry was made in his private
diary and not in the official book (blotter) of the office of the pro­vincial
jail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span class="GramE">.-</span> You
said that you entered some important items in your diary and you entered the
same in your record book.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is that right?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="GramE">A.-</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>I entered the
important item in my diary</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is
pre­cisely the coming of Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Baril</span> and government
witnesses."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Then, it is pertinent to ask:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When did he make the entry in his personal diary? <span style="">&nbsp;</span>He failed to state the specific occasion or
date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And why the entry made in his
private diary and not in the official book or blot­ter of the office of the
provincial jail as it was his duty to do?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He kept the reason for himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
read­ing of the testimony of the witness has persuaded us that the entry was
made not to reflect the truth but to fabricate in order to help the appellants.</p>

<p class="BODY">"A witness should not be allowed to see, consult or refer to
a memorandum or other writing for the pur­pose of recollection of his memory
unless and until it appears that the memorandum was written by himself or under
his direction at the time when the fact occurred, or immediately thereafter, or
to any other time when the fact was fresh in his memory." (Francisco, Criminal
Procedure, Vol. III, 1345.)</p>

<p class="BODY">The reason for the rule that the making of the memorandum must be
contemporaneous with the event is that the evidentiary force comes, not from
narration of facts by the witness, but from the fact that the memorandum is the
record of a past recollection, re­duced to writing while there was an existing
independ­ent recollection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
memorandum stands in the place of present recollection, the witness being at
most a mere conduit for repetition of its statements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As one court remarks: ‘It is for that reason
that a memoran­dum to be available in such cases, must have been made at or
about the time of the happening of the trans­action, so that it may safely be
assumed that the re­collection was then sufficiently fresh to correctly express
it.‘ The assumed reliability of the memorandum as a contemporaneous record is
the sole justification of its use by the witness, and hence, it is essential in
such cases that the witness should produce and testi­fy by reference to the
original memorandum.' (<span class="SpellE">Volusa</span> <span class="SpellE">Cty</span>.

<p class="NUM">4.- <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Bation</span>,
policeman of Las Nieves, de­clared that at about 6:00 o'clock in the evening of
October 22, 1963, he was on his way to the store of Alfonso Yu; upon reaching
the store "there were men who followed me and aimed their pistols at my
back and told me to lie down"; and "my face pressed against the
sacks"; he cannot tell how long he was in that posi­tion; he knows the
appellants; he did not see them at the store; he did not recognize the men who
held him; he never reported to anyone that he had been at the store of Alfonso
Yu, except to the lawyer of the de­fense.</p>

<p class="BODY">Relying on the testimony, the appellants argue that, as the
witness knows the faces of the appellants, and he did not see them at the scene
of the crime, <i>ergo</i>, the appellants were not at the store of Alfonso
Yu.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The argument is fallacious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is obvious that <span class="SpellE">Bation</span>
could not have seen the appellants who were inside the store, because he was
outside the store with his face pressed against the sacks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not have the oppor­tunity to see what
was happening inside the store.</p>

<p class="NUM"><span class="GramE">5.-</span><span style=""> </span>Angela

in the evening of <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="10">October 22, 1963</st1:date>,
she was in the store of Alfonso Yu; "there were persons outside the store
of Alfonso Yu", and they held the latter by the hands; "Q.- After
that what happened to Alfonso Yu?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">A.-</span> <u>I did not know because I ran away</u>." x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" Q.- Now, before you ran

she did not see the accused on that day, at <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">six
 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening; prior to <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="10">October 22, 1963</st1:date>, she had been in <span class="SpellE">Madamo</span>
only once.</p>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, she said that in the eve­ning of March 23,
1964, she went to see <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Cataluña</span>
in <span class="SpellE">Mandamo</span> and told him that she will testify in the
case (witness testified the next day, March 24, 1964), although she did not
know that there was a case pending in court; she never told anyone that she was
in the store on the occasion of the robbery; she knows that it was 6:00 o'clock
in the evening when she was in the store of Alfonso Yu, because "A- When I
arrived home I looked at the watch", and "the dial indicated six
o'clock"; on October 22, 1963, she did not even know who were <span class="SpellE">Teodulfo</span> <span class="SpellE">Veles</span>, <span class="SpellE">Venerando</span> <span class="SpellE">Veles</span> and Nico­las <span class="SpellE">Fontillas</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no reason to accord credence to the tes­timony of this
witness. From the fact that she did not see the appellants at the scene of the
crime, even assuming that she was there, it does not necessa­rily follow that
the appellants were not at the scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not surprising that the witness did not
see the appellants inside the store on that occasion, because she did not even
know the appellants; she never saw them before, she was outside the store, and
when she saw that Alfonso Yu was held by the arm by the persons whom she did
not recognize, she ran a­way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
testimony gives the impression that she was a tutored witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">Testifying in their own behalf, the appellants are in <span class="SpellE">concensus</span> in the affirmation that from 5:00 o'clock in the
afternoon until midnight of October 22, 1963, they were in the house of <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Cataluña</span> slaughtering
pig and pounding rice in prepara­tion for a celebration that night - of
thanksgiving for the good harvest that year; the testimonies of the witnesses
of the prosecution that they were seen at the scene of the crime were lies, for
the truth is, they were in the house of <span class="SpellE">Cataluña</span>;
they were ar­rested by the PC on October 25, 1963 for investiga­tion; they were
asked about the robbery-killing in the store of Alfonso Yu, and they told the
investigator they did not have anything to do with it, because they were in the
house of <span class="SpellE">Cataluña</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Cataluña</span>,

<span class="SpellE">Veles</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cataluña</span> declared that he knows the appellants because they

house pounding rice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
cross-examination, however, he said: "Q<span class="GramE">.-</span> Since
when have you stayed in <span class="SpellE">Mandamo</span>?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">A.-</span> Since
1964." Since the first time he stayed in <span class="SpellE">Mandamo</span>
was in 1964, therefore, he was not in <span class="SpellE">Mandamo</span> in
1963, and the ap­pellants could not have been in his house in <span class="SpellE">Mandamo</span> on October 22, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming, that the mention of
"1964" was a mistake, and what he meant was "1963", still
it is improbable that the appellants were in his house on October 22, 1963,
because -</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span class="GramE">.-</span> When
you stayed in <span class="SpellE">Mandamo</span> these accused were not yet with

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">So, neither in 1963 could the appellants have
been in <span class="SpellE">Cataluña's</span> house. Correlating the foregoing
answers with his last on cross-examination -</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span class="GramE">.-</span><span style=""> </span>Who were with you in the house at 5:00 o'clock
in the afternoon?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">it</span> is clearly
deducible that the appellants, who were not members of the family of <span class="SpellE">Cataluña</span> were not in the latter's house on October 22,

the testimonies of the appellants, confirmed by <span class="SpellE">Cataluña</span>,
that the former were in the latter's house on October 22, 1963, slaughtering

<p class="BODY">With the foregoing admissions of <span class="SpellE">Cataluña</span>,
the claim, that under those circumstances he would still think of having a
celebration of thanksgiving for the good harvest that year, when he did not
have any har­vest of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> at all, does not appeal to
reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, the appellants said that <span class="GramE">beside</span> slaughtering pig, they were also pounding <span class="SpellE">palay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
strange.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cataluña</span>
declared that he knows Alfonso Yu because "A<span class="GramE">.-</span> We
used to go to his house (like milling our pa-lay and corn)." Then it may
be asked: Why did they have to pound <span class="SpellE">palay</span> that
afternoon when there was the mill of Alfonso Yu where they used to grind their <span class="SpellE">palay</span> and corn?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was
it because <span class="SpellE">Cataluña</span> had no avail­able stock of rice
to serve to his visitors in that celebration of thanksgiving?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If so, then it is <span class="SpellE">be­lieveable</span>
that the preparation for that celebration was an eleventh hour decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is to our mind, out of the ordinary.</p>

<p class="BODY">Five more witnesses, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Aristan</span>,
Damian <span class="SpellE">Cataluña</span>, Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Aninao</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Estela</span> <span class="SpellE">Cagas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Aurea</span> <span class="SpellE">Cataluña</span>, were presented to
corroborate the <u>alibi</u> of the appellants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On cross-examination, however, their testimonies showed, let us take
Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Aninao</span>, that the affirmations have no basis
in fact. Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Q.-Since (when)
have you known the accused? <span class="GramE">A.-</span> Since they were
arrested by the PC (They were arrested on October 25, 1963)."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since he did not know the appel­lants on
October 22, 1963, how could he be sure that they were in the house of <span class="SpellE">Cataluña</span>, even assuming that the witness was there?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was his interest for taking particular
attention of the presence of the appellants and to make him remember that they
were there when he did not even say that he had a conver­sation with them or
something had happened to arouse his interest to make him remember?</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to <span class="SpellE">Aurea</span> <span class="SpellE">Cataluña</span> and Ester Cages, wife of <span class="SpellE">Teodulfo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Veles</span>, it is enough to remember their relationship by
blood and affinity with the appellants.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the foregoing facts, two questions con­front the Court in
the solution of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, has the
prosecution's evidence established the guilt of the appellants beyond
reasonable doubt? Second, has the defense of <u>alibi</u> been successfully
proved by evidence which satisfy the Court of the truth thereof?</p>

<p class="BODY">The commission of the robbery and the slaying of Alfonso Yu and
Victor Yu thereof by the <span class="GramE">malefactors,</span> are facts conclusively
established by the evi­dence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimonies of the witnesses of the prose­cution appear to be
straight-forward, plausible and consistent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is true that in some respects they suffer from slight discrepancies
in the details of the occurrence related by them. There can be no doubt,
however, that they agree in the essential fact that the appellants were the
perpetrators of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The credit of
a witness is tested when from a rigid cross-examination the general veracity of
his testimony in chief is not impeached.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The witnesses of the prosecu­tion remained firm and unshaken in the case
at bar notwithstanding a long and detailed <span class="GramE">cross-examination,</span>
and they corroborated each other in substantial de­tails regarding the
occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is reason to accord
full credence to their testimonies because they had the opportunity for a
better observation, they re­cognized the faces of the appellants who were not
masked, and they identified the appellants in their affidavits and at the trial
of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the testimonies of the wit­nesses for the
defense suffer from flaws, inconsist­encies and improbabilities which have a
cast se­rious doubt, in the mind of the trial court, as to their
trustworthiness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court's observation
finds support in the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>alibi</u>
set up by the appellants is sought to be corroborated by witnesses bound by
ties of consanguinity and affinity with the appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, appellants <span class="SpellE">Venerando</span>
<span class="SpellE">Veles</span> and Ni­colas <span class="SpellE">Veles</span>
are the brothers-in-law of <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Cataluña</span>, and the other witnesses are bound by ties of
friendship with the appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But more
than this consideration, it has been demonstrated that even witnesses holding
official positions, have shown a predisposition to distort the facts in their
desire to help the appellants. Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Cuvillar</span>, for
in­stance, who, at the time of giving his testimony, was the incumbent chief of
police of <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span> City, tried to make the court
believe on his direct testimony that the appellants were not, and could not
have be­en, at the scene of the crime; but, on cross-exami­nation, he had to
tell the truth, impeaching his previous testimony, and admitting that he did
not see the appellants at the scene of the crime, be­cause when he arrived at
the store where the crime was committed, the perpetrators of the crime had al­ready
left the place.</p>

<p class="BODY">The same observation may be made as to the wit­ness <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his desire to help the appel­lants, he
tried to make the court believe, contrary to the truth, that the witnesses of
the prosecution could not identify the accused at the confrontation on October
27, 1963, and to give a semblance of relia­bility to his affirmation, he read
an entry purporting to be from an official record of the provincial jail, but
when he was asked by the private prosecutor to pro­duce the entry, he could
only show a personal diary and not an official record or blotter which is kept
in the provincial jail where entries of such kind, the visit of witnesses in
jail to identify certain accused, should be entered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it has been discussed herein-above, the
entry in the personal diary of the witness is incompetent and has no probative
value as evidence for failure to lay down the prerequisite basis for its
admission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motivation for making the
entry in his private diary is apparent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering that the witnesses of the prosecution had really identified
the appellants as the perpetrators of the crime, as the evidence on the record
have <span class="GramE">shown,</span> the falsity of an entry in the official
record or blotter to the con­trary could have been easily discovered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, with an entry in his
private diary, witness was free to produce it or not as his interest dictates.</p>

<p class="BODY">With reference to the testimonies of the appel­lants which was
sought to be confirmed by <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Cataluña</span>, it has been shown that the account of the
whereabouts of the appellants at the time of the com­mission of the crime, is
unbelievable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The weight to be given to the testimony of wit­nesses possessing
integrity and intelligence, as are the witnesses of the prosecution in this
case, who have no motive to fabricate the facts and to foist a very serious
crime against the appellants, depends chiefly upon their observation and means
of knowing the facts testified to by them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Other things being equal, in case of conflict of testimony, the great
weight should be given to the testimony of those wit­nesses whose position gave
them the best opportunity for observation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">(Moore on Facts, p. 734.)</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of Judge <span class="SpellE">Zoleta</span>
is negatively pregnant; the tes­timony of Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Cuvillar</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Bation</span> and Angela Otero
are pregnant with inconsist­encies and improbabilities, and at times, they
border on distortion of facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, the testi­monies of the witnesses of the prosecution are direct,
clear and positive, and they had the best opportunity for observation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Possibility of a higher degree of attention
and interest gives rise to a presumption of considerable force that a person's
recollection of his own acts and of the attendant circumstances is more
definite and <span class="SpellE">trusthworthy</span> than another person's
recollection of it who had no special interest than that of an observer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apart from comparative tenacity of memory,
the actor usually knows better than any one else what he did or did not do, or
saw, and his testi­mony is generally entitled to superior weight on that
account.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Moore on Facts, p. 870) There
are some facts of which the importance, with regard to the in­dividual, is so
great, that unless on the supposition of an almost total decay of the faculty,
it will not be credible that the picture in them should have ef­faced out of
his memory by any length of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
where a man and a wife were dragged from their bed at nighttime, and cruelly
tortured by robbers partly masked (in our case, the robbers were not masked),
and heard the voices of their torturers, observed their figures, their
movements, and the manner and pe­culiarity of each of them, must have been
literally burned into the memory of their victims and enable the latter to
identify them subsequently with confi­dence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Moore on Facts, p. 890)</p>

<p class="BODY">There is, therefore, no convincing, corrobora­tive evidence
adduced, to establish the defense of <u>alibi</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances, there is no rea­son,
by any means, to allow the defense of <u>alibi</u> to prevail over the clear
and positive proof as to the identification of the appellants and their
participa­tion of the crime, as testified to by the witnesses of the
prosecution who saw and observed the faces of the appellants who were not
masked, from vantage po­sitions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, with its superior facilities for weighing the
conflict in the testimonies of wit­nesses, accorded credence to witnesses of
the prose­cution, and this Court will not interfere with the conclusion of the
trial court which saw them in the act of testifying, observed their manners and
demea­nors as witnesses, unless it is satisfactorily shown that the trial court
overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight
and influence sufficient to induce belief to warrant a reversal of the
decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the facts brought out and discussed in the
brief of the appellants have not shown that the trial court committed such error;
on the contrary, <span class="GramE">We</span> are persuaded upon the evidence
that the guilt of the appellants has been proven beyond reason­able doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conspiracy among the appellants in the com­mission of the <span class="GramE">crime,</span> is evident upon the facts as pro­ven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their acts, collectively and individually
execut­ed, have demonstrated the existence of a common design towards the
accomplishment of the same unlawful purpose and objective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The killing of Alfonso Yu and Victor <span class="GramE">Yu,</span> bears a direct relation and intimate connection between
the robbery and the killing, for the killing happened during and on the
occasion of the robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether the
latter <span class="GramE">be</span> prior or subsequent to the former, for the
element of conspiracy having been proven, it is unques­tionable that the
complex crime of robbery with homicide has been committed, and all the
appellants are liable <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">There being no mitigating <span class="GramE">nor</span>
aggravating cir­cumstance present and the decision is in accordance with the
facts and the law, the same is affirmed, in all respects, with proportionate costs
against the ap­pellants.</p>
