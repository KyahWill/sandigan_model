for Robbery In Band With Homicide, entitled "The People of the Philippines
vs. Ariston Guillermo, Carlito Aborde, Ronito Cullo and Jesus Cullo,
accused", by the Court of First Instance of Iloilo, Branch IV (Judge
Valerio V. Rovira), containing the following dispositive portion:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds accused Ariston Guillermo, Carlito
Aborde, Ronito Cullo and Jesus Cullo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of robbery
in band with homicide defined and penalized in Article 294 (1) of the Revised
Penal Code in relation to Articles 293 and 296 of the same Code, and hereby
sentences each of the four ac­cused to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>,

imprisonment.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellants Jesus and Ronito Cullo filed a separate brief
from that filed by accused-appellants Ariston Guillermo and Carlito Aborde, all
accused-appellants almost identical issues as alleged errors of the trial
court, namely:  (1) the trial court's
admitting in evidence Exhibits "A" and "B", alleged
extrajudicial confessions of Ariston Guillermo and Car­lito Aborde; (2) in
relying on the evidence of the prosecution both oral and documentary which have
disturbing inconsistencies and inherent improbabilities; (3) in not believing
the testimonies of the witnesses and documentary evidence for
accused-appellants; (4) in convicting the accused-appellants.  Accused-appellants Ariston Guillermo and
Carlito Abordle also raised the issue that the lower court allegedly erred in
holding that the suspects were sufficiently identified and in relying thereon
as basis of conviction when in truth and in fact they were allegedly victims of
a frame-up.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is firmly established by evidence that at about 5:30 A.M. of
May 10, 1972, at Barrio Lamonan, Passi, Iloilo, near the residence of Vicente
Gardoce and his wife Demetria Castor, there occured an incident where Billardo
Gardoce was shot and killed with a homemade shotgun during a robbery wherein
Vicente Gardoce was compelled to give the malefactors P500 cash, one 22 caliber
paltik revolver, and one 12-ga. homemade shotgun.  The prosecution's version of the crime, established principally
by the testimony of witnesses Vicente Gardoce and Benedicto Gardoce, is that
early in the morning (about 5:30 A.M.) of May 10, 1972, at the house of Vicente
Gardoce, in Barrio Lamonan, Passi, Iloilo, where he lived with his <span style="">wife </span>Demetria Castor and his children
Godofredo, Billardo, Rufino and Benedicto, all surnamed Gardoce, Vicente Gardoce
was awakened by the barking of their dogs downstairs.  Vicente told his son, Benedicto, to go out of the house and find
out the cause of the barking of the dogs.  Benedicto went down the house and opened the gate of their fence which
surrounded the house, while his father Vicente was stand­ing on the balcony of
their house.  When Benedicto opened the
gate accused Ariston Guillermo held and pushed the former to accused Carlito
Aborde who then tied Benedicto's hands behind his back.  Godofredo Gardoce followed Benedicto,
whereupon Ariston Guillermo also held Godofredo and pushed him to Carlito
Aborde who also tied Godofredo's hands at his back.  In the mean­time accused Ronito and Jesus, both surnamed Cullo,
each hold­ing a pistolized homemade firearm, pointed their guns at the Gardoce
brothers.  Rufino Gardoce followed his
brother Godo­fredo.  He, too, was also
pushed by Ariston Guillermo to Jesus Cullo who tied Rufino's hands with a rope
the latter had with him.  Billardo
Gardoce followed his brother Rufino and he asked Ariston Guillermo, "What
is going on, Brod?", whereupon Ariston Guillermo without saying a word
shot Billardo Gardoce with a pistolized "pugakhang" (homemade
shotgun).  Billardo was hit on the left
eye, fell to the ground, and died immediately.  According to witness Vicente Gardoce, Ariston Guillermo demand­ed money
and the former's long barrel shotgun with the threat that the sons of Vicente
Gardoce would be killed if the latter would not give his money and his
shotgun.  Vicente Gardoce therefore gave
his P5.00 and homemade shotgun to Ariston Guillermo.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
According to witness Benedicto Gardoce, when his father Vicente Gardoce at
first refused to heed the demand of Ariston Guillermo for money and the gun,
the group went near the balcony and Carlito Aborde fired his gun in the
air.  The Gardoce brothers pleaded with
their father Vicente Gardoce before the latter gave the money and the gun to
Ariston Guillermo.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Before the accused left the place, the Gardoces were threatened with death
should they tell the police authorities about the in­cident.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant Ariston Guillermo denied participation in the
crime.  He testified that he was a
casual laborer in the stock farm of the Bureau of National Husbandry station at
Duma­rao, Capiz; that he worked in the breeding station on May 9, 1972; that he
asked permission to be absent on May 10, 1972 to plow his farm for planting
casava, which he did; that at about 10:00 A.M. of May 10, 1972, a policeman
accompanied by the son of Vicente Gardoce came and asked the accused whether
four persons had passed that way and when Guillermo said no, he was told that
he would be taken for questioning; that he was brought to the house of Vicente
Gardoce and later he was placed inside the Municipal Jail of Passi; that
afterwards he was brought to the P.C. Detachment in Barrio Dacuton, Dumarao,
Capiz, where the policemen asked the soldiers whether they knew Barrio
Carataya, Cuartero, Capiz, and a person named Carlito Aborde; that the P.C.
soldiers accompanied the policemen to Carataya where they picked up Carlito
Aborde and brought him to the P.C. detachment where he was asked if he knew
Ariston Guillermo; that when Carlito Aborde denied knowing Ariston Guillermo,
both were hand-cuffed to each other and they were brought to Passi; that on the
way to Passi, when Carlito denied knowledge of the robbery in the place of
Gardoce, he was maltreated, clubbed, kicked and boxed; that they arrived at
Barrio Tabobong at 9:00 P.M., where they (policemen) continued maltreating Carlito
Aborde, who later mentioned his father-in-law as his companion, as well as
Guillermo Galvez, and one "Potpot"; that Guillermo Galvez denied
participation in the crime, whereupon the police­men continued maltreatment of
Carlito who pointed in desperation to Ariston Guillermo as his companion in the
crime; that when Ariston Guillermo denied participation in the crime, he was
also maltreated; that the investigation and maltreatment continued inside the
municipal jail of Passi on May 12, 1972; and that be­cause of continued
maltreatment by policemen, Carlito Aborde and Ariston Guillermo signed
confessions.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant Carlito Aborde denied participation in the
crime.  He claimed that in the evening
of the incident he was in his house at Barrio Carataya, Cuartero, Capiz, where
at about 7:00 p.m. that evening of May 9, 1972, he saw the house of his elder
brother, Hermenigildo Aborde, burning; that he helped in putting out the fire
after half of the roof of the kitchen was burned and the hand of his sister-in-law
was burned; that after the fire was extinguished, with Pedro Mestidio he pro­ceeded
to Barrio Lunayan, Cuartero, Capiz, to inform his older brother that the
latter's house was partially burned and his wife sustained burns; that his
elder brother left for home upon being so informed, while Carlito Aborde
remained; that on May 11, 1972, the policemen came and arrested him; that he
was brought to the P.C. detachment in Barrio Dacuton, Dumarao, Capiz, then to
Passi, Iloilo, in the municipal jail; and that he signed Exh. "A",
his alleged confession, because he was continuously maltreated by the police.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused- appellants Ronito Cullo and Jesus Cullo claimed that in
the afternoon of May 8, 1972, Sulpicio Palsis invited them to the fiesta of
Barrio Lunayan, Cuartero, Capiz; that at about 4:00 p.m. of May 9, 1972, Ronito
and Jesus Cullo, with Elena Primitivo and Leopoldo Mestidio went to Barrio
Lunayan; that in the house of Sulpicio Palsis, they helped in the preparation
of food for visitors; that at about 4:00 a.m. of May 10, 1972, Elena Primitivo
requested Ronito and Jesus Cullo to get water from a brook; that they attended
mass at 8:00 a.m. of May 10, 19 72 and they helped served food to visitors
until 12:30 p.m. of May 10, 1972; that they went to the cockpit in the
afternoon and attended a dance in the evening which ended the morning of May
11, 1972; that they did not know of the death of Billardo Gardoce until they
were jailed in Passi; that both Ronito and Jesus Cullo were arrested May 19,
1972 in their house at sitio Dumalagamba, Cuartero, Capiz; and that they were
severely maltreated by police­men but they refused to sign confessions before
the Municipal Judge of Passi.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Focus is made on the crucial issue of admissibility of Exhibits
"A" and "B", the alleged extrajudicial confessions of
accused-appellants Carlito Aborde and Ariston Guillermo, respectively, which
were considered admissible in evidence by the trial court, on the reasoning
that:</p>

<blockquote>"The confessions contained in these exhi­bits ("A"
and "B") to be repudiated, must not only be proved to have been
obtained by force and violence, but also that it is false or untrue, for the
law rejects the confession when, by force or violence or intimidation, the
accused is compelled against his will to tell the truth.  This is in consonance with the principle
that the <u>admissibility of evidence is not affected by the illegality of the
means with which it was secured</u>.  (People vs. de los Santos, G.R. No. L-4880, May 18, 1953)."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underscored For Emphasis)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The ruling that admissibility of evidence
is not affected by the illegality of the means with which it was secured as
pronounced in the case of <u>People vs. de los Santos</u>, G.R. No. L-4880, May
18, 1953, has long been abandoned, because the prevailing rule now is that illegally
obtained evidence are not admissible.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, the 1973 Constitution clearly provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 20.  No person
shall be compelled to be a witness against himself.  Any per­son under investigation for the commission of an offense
shall have the right to remain silent and to counsel, and to be informed of
such right.  No force, violence, threat,
in­timidation, or any other means which vitiates the free will shall be used
against him.  Any confession obtained <u>in
violation of this section shall be inadmissible in evidence</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underscored For Emphasis)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">An examination of Exhibits "A" and "B",
written in English, will readily show that they were prepared by another
person, both Ariston Guillermo and Carlito Aborde, affiants therein being
without knowledge of the English language.  The Chief of Police Alfonso Palmares of Passi, Iloilo, admitted that he
prepared the affidavits of Ariston Guillermo and Carlito Aborde.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Both Ariston Guillermo and Carlito Aborde stated that at first they refused to
sign Exhibits "A" and "B" but later they signed because
they were threatened with further maltreat­ment if they would not sign the
confessions.  Accused Ronito and Jesus
Cullo also stated that they were maltreated and threatened to sign confessions
but they refused.  Municipal Judge
Mariano Basa, Jr., of Passi, Iloilo, before whom Exhibits "A" and
"B" were supposed to have been voluntarily subscribed and sworn to,
admitted in his testimony that before the signing of Exhibits "A" and
"B", Judge Basa, Jr. asked the affiants if they would sign the
declaration and "they said no".<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> Judge
Basa, Jr. also admitted that he did not remember how many times the accused
Ariston Guillermo and Carlito Aborde were brought to his office to sign
Exhibits "A" and "B".<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a> The
trial court relied so much on the voluntariness of the execution of Exhibits
"A" and "B", having been sworn to and subscribed before the
Municipal Judge of Passi, Iloilo, and yet the Municipal Judge himself was not
so sure if the affiants Ariston Guillermo and Carlito Aborde voluntarily and
readily signed said confessions.  The
finding of the trial court that the physical examination conducted by Dr. <span style="">Jose </span>M. Acosta on Ariston Guillermo
and Carlito Aborde, found no signs of physical injury on Ariston Guillermo and
healed lesions on Carlito Aborde which must have resulted from a vehicular
accident on May 2, 1972, cannot be conclusive on the question of whether or not
both accused were maltreated by policemen when they were detained from May 11,
1972, because the physical examination of both accused was done on July 17,
1972, more than two months after the alleged maltreatment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing established facts, together with the admission of
Chief of Police Alfonso Palmares of Passi, Iloilo, that accused-appellants
Jesus Cullo and Ronito Cullo were held encommuni­cado in jail and that he even
refused at first to allow the lawyer of the Cullo brothers to see them while in
jail,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
leave linger­ing doubts in Our mind about the voluntariness of the
extrajudicial confessions, Exhibits "A" and "B" and the not
too remote possi­bility that the accused-appellants were really maltreated
while detained for investigation to extract confessions from them.  There being reasonably sufficient doubts on
the voluntariness of Exhibits "A" and "B", We cannot see
our way clear to sustain the lower court's stand on their admissibility as
evidence for the prosecution.  We have
no alternative but to rule that the linger­ing reasonable doubt on the
voluntariness of the extrajudicial con­fessions Exhibits "A" and
"B" should be in favor of the accused and against their admissibility
as evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the accused-appellants Cullo brothers, the
extrajudicial confessions Exhibits "A" and "B", assuming <u>arguendo</u>
that they are admissible as evidence, cannot be used as evidence against the
Cullo brothers because of the "<u>res inter alios acta</u>" rule,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
since the declarations against interest or confessions of Ariston Guillermo and
Carlito Aborde are admissible and effective against themselves alone, in the
absence of independent evidence of conspiracy among Ariston Guillermo, Carlito
Aborde and the Cullo brothers.  The act
or declaration of a conspirator relating to the conspiracy and during its
existence, may be given against the co-conspirator after the conspiracy is
shown by evidence other than such act or declaration.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
It may be argued that the direct evidence presented in the testimonies of
Vicente and Be­nedicto Gardoce about the concerted act of the four
accused-appellants during the robbery constituted direct independent evidence
of conspiracy outside of the extrajudicial confessions Exhibits "A"
and "B", since the said evidence established the unison of the
concerted acts of robbery to realize a common objective which independently
establishes the conspiracy among the four appellants in the perpetration of the
criminal act, but We are aware of a flaw in the said direct testimony of Vi­cente
and Benedicto Gardoce.  The said flaw in
the direct testimony of Vicente and Benedicto Gardoce is precisely on the
participation of the Cullo brothers in the crime.  Vicente Gardoce testified in court and admitted that in the
affidavit which he signed before the Chief of Police of Passi, Iloilo, on May
11, 1972, one day after the death of his son and the robbery, he stated when he
was asked if he knew who were the companions of accused Carlito Aborde and
Ariston Guillermo during the robbery that the two companions were unknown to
him.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Benedicto Gardoce also stated in his affidavit subscribed and sworn to before
the Municipal Judge of Passi, Iloilo, on May 22, 1972 that the perpetrators of
the alleged offense (Guillermo and Aborde) were with unidentified
companions.  It is also of record that
the original complaint named Ronni and <span style="">Jesus
</span>Estorque, as the two companions of Guillermo and Aborde, later on
amended to include the Cullo brothers by changing the surname Estorque to
Cullo, another indication that during the investigation of the crime on May 11,
1972, the Gardoces, father and son, did not point to the Cullo brothers as participants
in the crime.  Under the circumstances,
the direct testimony of Vicente and Benedicto Gardoce as to the participation
of the Cullo brothers in the crime remains in serious doubt.  Without the extrajudicial confessions
Exhibits "A" and "B" of Guillermo and Aborde implicating
the Cullo brothers, and there being serious doubts on the direct testimony of
Vicente and Benedicto Gardoce regarding the participation of the Cullo brothers
in the crime, there remains a reasonable doubt in their favor which materially
strengthens the alibi they established.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is truth to the trial court's stand that even without
Exhibits "A" and "B", the direct evidence presented by the
testi­monies of Vicente and Benedicto Gardoce, supported by other evidence,
sufficiently established the guilt of Ariston Guillermo and Carlito Aborde
beyond doubt, as the said evidence from the very beginning pointed unerringly
at Guillermo and Aborde, together with two others, who committed the crime,
Guillermo as the one who shot Billardo Gardoce and who received the P500 and
the guns, and Carlito Aborde who allegedly fired a shot in the air to threaten
Vicente Gardoce to give in to their demands the absence of sufficient
indications that Vicente and Benedicto Gardoce falsely testified against
Ariston Guillermo and Carlito Aborde, and there is no shown motive why they
should do so, their straightforward narration in a very simple way of what
happened during the incident and the participation of the accused Guillermo and
Aborde in the crime committed constitute ample evidence beyond reasonable doubt
to sustain conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the trial court's decision is affirmed and
sustained with respect to the conviction of and penalty imposed on
accused-appellants Ariston Guillermo and Carlito Aborde who committed the crime
with two others who have not been identified; and reversed and set aside with
respect to accused-appellants Ronito Cullo and Jesus Cullo who are acquitted,
on the ground of reasonable doubt.  The
Provincial Fiscal of Iloilo is hereby ordered to conduct an investigation of
the manner in which Exhibits "A" and "B" were taken by the
policemen concerned, and to prosecute them, if warranted by the evidence.  Costs against accused-appellants Ariston
