				<H3>MANILA ADJUSTERS & SURVEYORS COMPANY, PETITIONER,
VS. HON. JUAN BOCAR OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, NG YEK

<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition to annul the writ
of preliminary injunction issued by respondent judge and to order said
respondent to refrain from enjoining petitioner from proceed­ing against the
letter of credit for P1M issued in its favor by the Insular Bank of Asia and
America, the writ in question having been issued in Civil Case No. 99661 of the
Court of First Instance of Manila entitled Ng Yek Kiong and Ernesto Cokai vs.
Insular Bank of Asia and America, Manila Adjusters &amp; Surveyors Company and
Mariano Pintor, etc., on February 18, 1976.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the complaint of private respondents filed in the court below,
it is alleged that herein petitioner entered into a contract of sale of
fertilizer with the defendant Ilocos Sur Facoma, repre­sented by its President,
the other defendant Mariano Pintor, and to guarantee faithful performance on
the part of said Facoma, a letter of credit was opened with the Insular Bank of
Asia and America for P1M in favor of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To secure the issuance of such letter of
credit, Pintor made arrangements with herein other respondents, Ng Yek Kiong
and Ernesto Cokai, by virtue of which, said respondents bound some of their
properties to the Bank, such that in case of non-compliance on the part of the
Facoma with the contract of sale, the P1M would be subject to forfeiture and
respondents Ng and Cokai would answer with their properties to the Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also alleged that as the Facoma had
defaulted in the performance of its obligation to petitioner, the latter is <span class="GramE">proceeding</span> against the P1M letter of credit, hence the
complaint with motion for preliminary injunction which respondent judge has
granted, to enjoin the Bank from honoring the letter of credit and petitioner
from collecting the proceeds thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The cause of action alleged is that Ng and Cokai, the plaintiffs, bound
themselves with their properties to guarantee the P1M letter of credit only
because of the fraudulent representations made to them by Pintor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Significantly, said plaintiffs do not appear
to be parties to the contract of sale between petitioner and the Facoma.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the Facoma contracted with
petitioner upon the security of the letter of credit issued by the Bank, and
plaintiffs in turn bound themselves to the Bank on behalf of the Facoma.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the foregoing undisputed setting, <span class="GramE">We</span> hold that the subject writ of preliminary injunction has
no legal leg to stand on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the face of
their own complaint, it is evident that plaintiffs have neither contractual nor
any kind of relation with petitioner. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The petitioner's contract with the Facoma is a
separate and independent relationship from the agreement between the Facoma and
said plaintiffs, herein respondents Ng and Cokai.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever fraud might have attended the latter
agree­ment because of misrepresentations of Pintor to <span class="GramE">said</span>
respondents cannot affect the right of petitioner to the proceeds of the letter
of credit, there being no allegation whatsoever linking petitioner to
Pintor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is thus clear that the
complaint below states no cause of action against petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is there any basis for enjoining the Bank
from honoring the letter of credit, absent any showing that Pintor's alleged
fraudulent representations in obtaining the assistance of Ng and Cokai were
made on behalf of or with the knowledge of the Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Sections 3 and 4 of Rule 58, a
preliminary injunction is proper only when the plaintiff appears to be entitled
to the relief demanded in his complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such is not the case here.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is granted, the order of respondent
judge dated <st1:date year="1976" day="18" month="2">February 18, 1976</st1:date>
is hereby set aside, with costs against private respondents.</p>
