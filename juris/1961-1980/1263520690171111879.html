				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">An information</span> filed on <st1:date year="1971" day="31" month="3">31 March 1971</st1:date> in the Circuit Criminal
Court, 7th Judicial District, and signed by Assistant Provincial Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> C. de Guzman of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> and
State Prosecutor <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Barot</span>,
Jr., and docketed as Criminal Case No. CCC-VII-753, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
(People vs. Jose <span class="SpellE">Rentoria</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>,
et al.), charged herein petitioner <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> with a
violation of Sections 3(a) and 3(e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act
(Republic Act No. 3019).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In substance,
it was alleged therein that between 1 August 1968 and 31 January 1969 said
petitioner, as Municipal Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, in conspiracy with other persons unknown, in bad
faith and with intent to defraud the Government of the Philippine Republic,
appointed his brother, <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span>, to the position of
confidential agent to the office of the mayor, knowing the appointee to be an
employee of the Far East Bank &amp; Trust Company, and caused the salary as
confidential agent from 1 August 1968 to 31 January 1969, in the sum of P1,080,
to be charged to the general funds of the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span>,
without the appointee rendering service nor presenting proof of service, as
required by the applicable regulations.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 31 March 1971, the presiding judge, respondent <span class="SpellE">Onofre</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span>, without
previous hearing, issued an order (Annex <span style="">"A",
</span>Petition) suspending the accused <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>,
under Section 13 of Republic Act No. 3019, and stating, <u><span style="">inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></span></u><span style="">, </span>the following:</p>

<blockquote>"Considering that the information is sufficient in form and
substance, the same being duly approved by the Chief State Prosecutor Emilio <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span> and filed by State Prosecutor <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Barot</span>, Jr. and Assistant Provincial Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> C. de Guzman, they having certified that a
preliminary investigation has been conducted in the above-entitled case in
accordance with law; that the <span class="GramE">accused</span> was given a
chance to appear in person or by counsel; that there is reasonable ground to
believe that the offense complained of has been committed and that the accused
are probably guilty thereof, the accused Jose <span class="SpellE">Rentoria</span>
<span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> is hereby ordered SUSPENDED from office
within twenty-four (24) hours from receipt of this order."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner applied to this Court for writs of <i>certiorari</i>
and prohibition, pleading grave abuse of discretion and excess of jurisdiction,
in that (a) the prosecutors who filed the information had no authority to do
so, and that they filed it without giving him proper preliminary investigation;
(b) that he was ordered suspended without giving him opportunity to contest the
sufficiency of the information.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the charge of lack of preliminary investigation to be
without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The annexes to the
petition and the answer plainly show that a preliminary investigation was first
conducted by respondent Assistant Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> de
Guzman, who recommended to his chief, the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, that an information be filed for violation of the
Anti-Graft law (Republic Act 3019); that upon petitioner <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>'
motion, the Provincial Fiscal had the case reviewed by First Assistant Fiscal
Luis Victor and State Prosecutor Joel <span class="SpellE">Tiangco</span>, who
later recommended dismissal of the charges, with which Provincial Fiscal
Castillo concurred.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the latter, on <st1:date year="1971" day="20" month="1">20
 January 1971</st1:date>, submitted the recommendation to quash the charges and
the entire record of the case to the Secretary of Justice, for review by the
Department (Answer, Annex "2").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The case was referred to State Prosecutor <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Barot</span>, Jr., who, after study, concurred with
Assistant Fiscal de Guzman, and recommended that the charges be filed (Answer,
Annex "3").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Department of
Justice returned the records to the Provincial Fiscal, with instructions to
take appropriate action in conformity with the <span class="SpellE">Barot</span>
report; but as the Provincial Fiscal considered the action asked of him to be
contrary to his convictions, upon his suggestion and request (Annex
"5"), the Department of Justice, by Administrative Order No. 130,
designated respondent <span class="SpellE">Barot</span> to handle the case (Annex
"6"), and thus the information came to be filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus petitioner's claim that the original charges against him had
been quashed by the Provincial Fiscal, and that no information could be there­after
filed against him without another investigation, is unfounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The quashing of the charges never became
operative, since the Secretary of Justice, in the exercise of his supervisory
power as Department Head (Sections 83, 74 and 76, Revised Administrative Code),
reversed the opinion of the Provincial Fiscal, and designated State Prosecutor <span class="SpellE">Barot</span> to handle the case as special prosecutor, as
authorized by Section 3, Republic Act No. 3783, as amended by Republic Act No.
5184.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This authority of the Secretary
has been repeatedly upheld by this Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with petitioner <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>,
however, that the order of suspension issued by respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span> was premature and in grave abuse of discretion,
being contrary to the doctrine set by this Court in <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>
vs. Wilson, L-31347, 31 August 1970 (34 SCRA 638, 643).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, upon review of a similar <u>ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span></u> order of suspension under Section 13 <span style="">of </span>the Anti-Graft and Corrupt
Practices Act, this Court held that before <span style="">an order of suspension should be issued,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"a hearing on the validity of the
information appears conformable to the spirit of the law, taking into account
the serious and far reaching consequences of a suspension of an elected public
official even before his conviction",</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">and</span> accordingly
set aside the order <span style="">of suspension
issued </span>by Judge <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> Mariano of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, and directed him to "forthwith hold a hearing
on the validity of the information".</p>

<p class="BODY">The same rule applies to this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It goes without saying that should the court
judicially uphold the validity of the information, after due hearing of the
parties, it may reissue the <span style="">suspension </span>order.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the writ of <i>certiorari</i> is granted, and
the order of respondent judge dated <st1:date year="1971" day="31" month="3">31
 March 1971</st1:date> suspending petitioner Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span>
is set aside, and said respondent is ordered to hold a preliminary hearing on
the validity of the information, Criminal Case No. CCC-VII-753, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, after due notice to the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition is dismissed as to the other
respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The preliminary injunction
is dissolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
