<p class="style3">Delfin Montano brought to the Philippines from the United States 
a Cadillac car which he registered in his name in the Motor Vehicles Office and 
for which he obtained a certificate of registration. On May 30, 1952, he sold 
the car to Jose Lim Ang and his wife Teodora A. Gonzales for the sum of 
P28,000.00, payable in installments, for which the latter executed a promissory 
note. Having paid part of the price, said spouses executed on the same date a 
chattel mortgage on the car in favor of Montano to guarantee the payment of the 
balance. Because Montano did not want to transfer the registration certificate 
to Jose Lim Ang before the registration of the mortgage, the latter was 
registered in the effice of the register of deeds on June 4, 1952, but Montano 
failed to notify the Motor Vehicles Office of the execution of the mortgage 
pursuant to the requirement of Section 5(e) of Act No. 3992, known as the 
Revised Motor Vehicles Law. </p>
<p class="style3">On June 12, 1952, Jose Lim Ang transferred the registration 
certificate to Eugenio Villanueva. On June 18, 1952, Villanueva sold the car to 
Amador D. Santos for P25,000.00, transferring to the latter the registration 
certificate. On the same date, Santos sold the car to the Manila Trading &amp; 
Supply Company for P25,000.00, and on the same date this company sold the car to 
Angel M. Tinio for P26,000.00. Tinio made a down payment of P12,000.00 and for 
the balance he executed a promissory note which he assumed to pay in monthly 
installments. He also executed a chattel mortgage on the same car to secure the 
payment of the promissory note. This mortgage was registered both in the office 
of the register of deeds as well as in the Motor Vehicles Office. After paying 
his obligation in full, the mortgage executed by Tinio in favor of the Manila 
Trading &amp; Supply Company was cancelled, and as a consequence he secured the 
transfer to his name of the certificate of registration from the Motor Vehicles 
Office. None of the transferees took the trouble of investigating from whom Jose 
Lim Ang had acquired the Cadillac car, and neither did any of them investigate 
in the office of the registered of deeds if there was any incumbrance existing 
thereon.</p>
<p class="style3">Jose Lim Ang failed to pay the balance of the purchase price to 
Montano in spite of the latter's demand and so on December 8, 1952 Montano 
requested the sheriff of Manila to sell the car in accordance with the 
conditions agreed upon in the chattel mortgage. Having found, however, that the 
car was no longer in the possession of Lim Ang but in that of Angel M. Tinio who 
claimed ownership thereof, on July 8, 1953 Montano commenced the present action 
of replevin before the Court of First Instance of Manila against spouses Jose 
Lim Ang and Teodora A. Gonzales and Angel M. Tinio to recover the ownership and 
possession of the car in question (Civil Case No. 1998).</p>
<p class="style3">In order to obtain possession of the car, Montano put up a bond 
in the amount of P30,000.00 and, accordingly, on July 11, 1953 an order for the 
seizure of the car was issued by the trial court. The sheriff hauled the car 
from Tinio's garage only to return the same on the promise of Tinio to post a 
counterbond to enable him to retain possession thereof. In effect, Tinio posted 
a counterbond in the amount of P30,000.00, and forthwith filed a third-party 
complaint in the same case against the Marila Trading &amp; Supply Company from 
which he bought the car in question. This company in turn filed a fourth-party 
complaint against Amador D. Santos, who in turn brought into the case as 
defendants Marciano and Eugenio Villanueva. The Villanuevas filed a cross-claim 
against Jose Lim Ang arid his wife Teodora A. Gonzales. On March 29, 1954, these 
spouses were declared in default for their failure to answer Montano's complaint 
within the reglementary period.</p>
<p class="style3">Meanwhile, during the pendency of the replevin case, it was 
brought to the attention of the court <i>a quo</i> that on May 15, 1953, at the 
instance of Montano, the aforesaid spouses were accused of estafa under Article 
319, paragraph 2, of the Revised Penal Code for having sold the car in question 
without the consent of Montano notwithstanding the existence thereon of the 
chattel mortgage (Criminal Case No. 22627); that Atty. Abraham Sarmiento, 
Montano's counsel in the replevin case, appeared as private prosecutor in the 
criminal case; and that having been awarded an indemnity, in the amount of 
P7,875.00 which is the same amount Montano seeks to recover in the civil case, 
said award has the effect of a waiver on his part to further prosecute the 
same.</p>
<p class="style3">On September 24, 1955, the court <i>a quo</i> rendered decision 
the dispositive part of which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="style3">"(<i>a</i>) The court orders defendants Jose Lim Ang, Teodora A. 
Gonzales and Angel M. Tinio to deliver the car in question to plaintiff Delfin 
Montano or to pay jointly and severally to plaintiff Delfin Montano the sum of 
P6,000.00 plus 12% interest per annum from August 15, 1952, until the amount is 
fully paid with costs; </p>
<p class="style3">"(<i>b</i>) The court orders Manila Trading &amp; Supply Co. to 
reimburse defendant and third-party plaintiff Angel M. Tinio the amount of 
P6,000.00 plus interest at the rate of 12% per annum from August 15, 1952, until 
the said amount is fully paid with costs. This amount of reimbursement shall be 
made by Manila Trading &amp; Supply Co. even if defendant and third-party 
plaintiff Angel M. Tinio delivers the car back to plaintiff Delfin Montano. If 
Angel M. Tinio elects to return the car to Delfin Montano instead of paying him 
the sum of P6,000.00 plus 12% interest per annum, the value of the car must have 
been reduced to P6,000.00 only, or less, due to its use. Manila Trading &amp; 
Supply Co. as third-party defendant shall also pay to defendant Angel M. Tinio 
as third-party plaintiff the sum of P3,000.00 for damages actual and moral, 
expenses so far incurred by him in defending himself in this case, and 
attorney's fees;</p>
<p class="style3">"(<i>c</i>) The court orders fourth-party defendant Amador D, 
Santos to reimburse to fourth-party plaintiff Manila Trading &amp; Supply Co. 
the sum of P6 000.00, plus 12% interest per annum from August 15, 1952, until 
this sum is paid by Manila Trading &amp; Supply Co. to defendant and third-party 
plaintiff Angel M. Tinio, plus costs. No reimbursement for damages and 
attorney's fees is ordered because Manila Trading &amp; Supply Co. waived 
damages and attorney's fees from Amador D. Santos;</p>
<p class="style3">"(<i>d</i>) The court orders defendant spouses Jose Lim Ang and 
Teodora A. Gonzales to pay jointly and severally to Amador D. Santos, as 
reimbursement, all sums the said Amador D. Santos shall have paid Manila Trading 
&amp; Supply Co. in compliance with this decision.</p>
<p class="style3">"Fifth-party defendants Marciano Villanueva and Eugenio 
Villanueva are absolved from the fifth-party complaint of Amador D. Santos 
because the evidence is conclusive that Eugenio Villanueva acted as dummy only 
of Jose Lim Ang. Amador D. Santos himself testified expressly and positively 
that he refused to buy the car in question unless it was transferred to the 
Villanuevas. Fifth-party defendants Eugenio Villanueva and Marciano Villanueva 
conclusively proved that they received not a cent of the price of the car in 
question from Amador D. Santos. The sum of P11, 228.50, for which Amador D. 
Santos extended a promissory note and which was paid by him the following day, 
was the price of Eugenio Villanueva's Oldsmobile car. The Villanuevas 
conclusively established that on June 18, 1953, when the car in question was 
sold to Amador D. Santos, Eugenio Villanueva signer the deed of sale in order to 
get tho payment for his Oldsmobile car."</p></blockquote>
<p class="style3">Their motions for reconsideration having been denied, defendant 
and third-party plaintiff Angel M. Tinio, third-party defendant and fourth-party 
plaintiff Manila Trading &amp; Supply Company, fourth-party defendant and 
fifth-party plaintiff Amador D. Santos, fifth-party defendants and 
cross-claimants Marciano Villanueva and Eugenio Villanueva appealed to the Court 
of Appeals. The case is now before us upon certification of the Court of Appeals 
on the ground that only questions of law are involved.</p>
<p class="style3">Amador D. Santos died during the pendency of this case and so he 
was substituted by his wife Dolores L. Santos, special administratrix of his 
estate.</p>
<p class="style3">The issues posed in this appeal are: (1) whether or not the 
chattel mortgage executed by Jose Lim Ang and his wife Teodora A. Gonzales on 
May 30, 1952 before the car was actually registered in their name is valid and 
regular; (2) whether or not the chattel mortgage executed by Jose Lim Ang and 
Teodora A. Gonzales in favor of Delfin Montano is binding against third persons 
even if they failed to give notice thereof to the Motor Vehicles Office as 
required, by Section 5(c) of the Revised Motor Vehicles Law; and (3) whether or 
not the intervention of Montano in the prosecution of the criminal case against 
Jose Lim Ang and his wife for estafa under Article 319, paragraph 2, of the 
Revised Penal Code wherein he was awarded an indemnity of P7,875.00 constitutes 
a waiver of his right to foreclose the chattel mortgage executed by said spouses 
on the ear in question.</p>
<p class="style3">Anent the first issue, appellants maintain the negative. They 
aver that since the chattel mortgage was executed on May 30, 1952 and the 
transfer of the registration certificate was made only on June 7, 1952, said 
mortgage is invalid because the mortgagors were not yefc the owners of the car 
when the mortgage was executed. They bolster up their claim by invoking the 
testimony of Montano to the effect that on May 31, 1952 he still considered 
himself owner of the car because he intended to transfer its ownership to the 
mortgagors only after the registration of the mortgage in the office of register 
of deeds.</p>
<p class="style3">This contention is untenable. It is not disputed that Montano 
agreed to sell and the spouses Ang agreed to buy the car for P28,000.00 for 
which a promissory note was executed and that to guarantee the same the spouses 
executed a chattel mortgage and took possession of the car sold. It is therefore 
safe to conclude that at the time of the sale wherein the parties agreed over 
the car and the price, the contract became perfected, and when part of the 
purchase price was paid and the car was delivered upon the execution of the 
promissory note and the mortgage, the sale became consummated.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2"><sup>[1]</sup></span> The fact that the registration certificate of 
the car has not as yet been transmitted to the purchasers when the mortgage was 
constituted is of no moment for, as this Court well said: "The registry of the 
transfer of automobiles and of the certificates of license for their use in the 
Bureau of Public Works (now Motor Vehicles Office) merely constitutes an 
administrative proceeding which does not bear any essential relation to the 
contract of sale entered into between the parties."<span class="style2"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </span>At any rate, this flaw, if any, is deemed to 
have been cured when after the registration of the mortgage the registration 
certificate was transferred to the purchasers on June 4, 1952.</p>
<p class="style2 style3">The second issue raised is not new. In a similar case 
decided by this Court, we said: "A mortgage in order to affect third persons 
should not only be registered in the Chattel Mortgage Registry, but the same 
should also be recorded in the Motor Vehicles Office as required by section 5(e) 
of the Revised Motor Vehicles Law: And the failure of the respondent mortgagee 
to report the mortgage executed in its favor had the effect of making said 
mortgage ineffective against Borlough, who had his purchase registered in the 
said Motor Vehicles Offices."<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2"><sup>[3]</sup></span> Adopting 
this view in our case the inevitable conclusion is that as between Montano whose 
mortgage over the car was not recorded in the Motor Vehicles Office and Angel M. 
Tinio who notified said office of his purchase and registered the car in his 
name, the latter is entitled to preference considering that the mere 
registration of the chattel mortgage in the office of the register of deeds is 
in itself not sufficient to hold it binding against third persons.</p>
<p class="style3">Having reached the foregoing conclusion, we deem it unnecessary 
to discuss the third issue relative to Montano's intervention in Criminal Case 
No. 22627.</p>
<p class="style3">With regard to the claim for damages of Angel M. Tinio, we find 
no factual basis to grant the same it appearing that Montano filed the present 
case merely to protect his interest.</p>
<p class="style3">Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed insofar as it 
orders defendants Jose Lim Ang and his wife Teodora A. Gonzales to pay Delfin 
Montano the sum of P6,000.00, plus 12% interest thereon per annum from August 
15, 1952 until it is fully paid.</p>
<p class="style3">The rest of the decision is reversed, without pronouncement as 
to costs.</p>
