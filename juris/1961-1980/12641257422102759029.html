Congress of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
passed Resolution No. 2, which was amended by Resolution No. 4 of said body,
adopted on <st1:date year="1969" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1969</st1:date>, calling
a Convention to propose amendments to the Constitution of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said Resolution No. 2, as amended, was
implemented by Republic Act No. 6132, approved on <st1:date year="1970" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1970</st1:date>, pursuant to the provisions of which the
election of delegates to said Convention was held on <st1:date year="1970" day="10" month="11">November 10, 1970</st1:date>, and the 1971 Constitutional
Convention began to perform its functions on <st1:date year="1971" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1971</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
the Convention was in session on <st1:date year="1972" day="21" month="9">September
 21, 1972</st1:date>, the President issued Proclamation No. 1081 placing the
entire <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
under Martial Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1972" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1972</st1:date>, the Convention
approved its Proposed Constitution of the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
The next day, November 30, 1972, the President of the Philippines issued
Presidential Decree No. 73, 'submitting to the Filipino people for ratification
or rejection the Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines proposed by
the 1971 Constitutional Convention, and appropriating funds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,'
as well as setting the plebiscite for said ratification or rejection of the
Proposed Constitution on January 15, 1973.</blockquote>

 7, 1972</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Charito</span> <span class="SpellE">Planas</span>
filed, with this Court, Case G.R. No. L-35925, against the Commission on
Elections, the Treasurer of the Philippines and the Auditor General, to enjoin
said 'respondents or their agents from implementing Presidential Decree No. 73,
in any manner, until further orders of the Court;' upon the grounds, <i>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></i><span style="">, </span>that
said Presidential Decree 'has no force and effect as law because the calling *
* * of such plebiscite, the setting of guidelines for the conduct of the same,
the prescription of the ballots to be used and the question to be answered by
the voters, and the appropriation of public funds for the purpose, are, by the
Constitution, lodged exclusively in Congress, * * *,' and 'there is no proper
submission to the people of said Proposed Constitution set for January 15,
1973, there being no freedom of speech, press and assembly, and there being no <span style="">sufficient time to inform the people of the
contents </span>thereof.'</blockquote>

issued an order temporarily </span>suspending the effects of Proclamation No. 1081,
for the purpose of free and open debate on the Proposed Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On December 23, the President announced the
postponement of the plebiscite for the ratification or rejection of the
Proposed Constitution. No formal action to this effect was taken until January
7, 1973, when General Order No. 20 was issued, directing <span style="">'that </span>the plebiscite scheduled to be
held on January 15, 1973, be postponed until further notice.' Said General
Order No. 20, moreover, 'suspended in the meantime' the 'order of <st1:date year="1972" day="17" month="12">December 17, 1972</st1:date>, temporarily
suspending the effects of Proclamation No. 1081 for purposes of free and open
debate on the proposed Constitution.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In view of these events relative to the postponement of the
aforementioned plebiscite, the Court deemed it fit to refrain, for the time
being, from deciding the aforementioned cases, for neither the date nor the
conditions under which said plebiscite would be held were known or announced
officially.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, again, Congress was, pursuant
to the 1935 Constitution, scheduled to meet in regular session on January 22,
1973, and since the main objection to Presidential Decree No. 73 was that the
President does not have the legislative authority to call a plebiscite and
appropriate funds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, which Congress
unquestionably could do, particularly in view of the formal postponement of the
plebiscite by the President - reportedly after consultation with, among others,
the leaders of Congress and the Commission on Elections the Court deemed it
more imperative to defer its final action on these cases.</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">'4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">That
the proceedings of the so-called Citizens' Assemblies are illegal, null and
void particularly insofar as </span>such proceedings are being made the basis
of a supposed consensus for the ratification of the proposed Constitution

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">[a]<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The elections contemplated in the
Constitution, Article XV, at <span style="">which </span>the
proposed constitutional amendments are to be submitted for ratification, are
elections at which only qualified and duly registered voters are permitted to
vote, whereas, the so-called Citizens' Assemblies were participated in by
persons 15 years of age and older, regardless of qualifications or lack
thereof, as prescribed in the Election Code;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;"><span style="">[b]<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Elections
or plebiscites for the ratification of </span>constitutional amendments
contemplated in Article XV of the Constitution have provisions for the secrecy
of choice and of vote, which is one of the safeguards of freedom of action, but
votes in the Citizens' Assemblies were open and were cast by raising hands;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">[c]<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Election Code makes ample provisions for
free, orderly and honest elections, and such provisions are a minimum
requirement for elections or plebiscites for the ratification of constitutional
amendments, but there were no similar provisions to guide and regulate
proceedings of the so-called Citizens' Assemblies;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">[d]<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is seriously to be doubted that, for lack
of material time, more than a handful of the so-called Citizens' Assemblies
have been actually formed, because the mechanics of their organization were
still being discussed a day or so before the day they were supposed to begin
functioning: –</p>

<p class="2Q"><span style="">'Provincial governors and
city and municipal mayors had been meeting with barrio captains and community
leaders </span>since last Monday [January 8, 1973] to thresh <span style="">out the </span>mechanics in the formation of

<p class="2Q">'It should be recalled that the Citizens' Assemblies were ordered
formed only at the <span style="">beginning of the
year [Daily </span>Express, January 1, 1973], and considering the lack of
experience of the local organizers of said assemblies, <span style="">as </span>well as the absence of sufficient
guidelines for organization, it is too much to believe that such assemblies
could <span style="">be </span>organized at such a
short notice.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">'5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That for lack of material time, the
appropriate amended petition to include the additional officials and government
agencies mentioned in paragraph 3 of this Supplemental Urgent Motion could not
be completed because, as noted in the Urgent Motion of January 12, 1973, the
submission of the proposed Constitution to the Citizens' Assemblies was not
made known to the public until January 11, 1973.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But be that as it may, the said additional
officials and agencies may be properly included in the petition at bar because:
–</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">[a]<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The herein petitioners have prayed in their

"any similar decree, proclamation, order or instruction."</p>

Decree No. 86, insofar at least as it attempts to submit the proposed

in issue in <span style="">this </span>case, and those

the instructions incidental thereto 'clearly fall within the scope of this
petition;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">[b]<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In their petition, petitioners sought the
issuance of <span style="">a </span>writ of preliminary

implementing not only Presidential Decree No. 73, hut also "any other

government agencies mentioned in paragraph 3 of this Supplemental Urgent
Motion, can lawfully be reached by the <span class="SpellE">processess</span> of
this Honorable Court by reason of this petition, considering, furthermore, that
the Commission on Elections has under our laws the power, among others, of:</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">'6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That unless the petition at bar is decided
immediately and the Commission on Elections, together with the officials and government
agencies mentioned in paragraph 3 of this Supplemental Urgent Motion are
restrained or enjoined from collecting, certifying, reporting or announcing to
the President the results of the alleged voting of the so-called Citizens'
Assemblies, irreparable damage will be caused to the Republic of the
Philippines, the Filipino people, the cause of freedom and democracy, and the
petitioners herein because:</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">[a]<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the result of the supposed voting on
the questions mentioned in paragraph 1 hereof shall have been announced, a
conflict will arise between those who maintain that the 1935 Constitution is
still in force, on the one hand, and those who will maintain that it has been
superseded by the proposed Constitution, on the other, thereby creating confusion,
if not chaos;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">[b]<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even the jurisdiction of this Court will be
subject to serious attack because the advocates of the theory that <span style="">the proposed Constitution has been ratified by
reason of the announcement of the results of the </span>proceedings of the
so-called Citizens' Assemblies will argue that, General Order <span style="">No. 3, which shall also be deemed ratified
pursuant to the Transitory Provisions of the </span>proposed Constitution, <span style="">has placed Presidential Decree Nos. 73 and 86
beyond the reach and jurisdiction of this Honorable </span>Court.'</p>

municipalities and in districts/wards in chartered cities pursuant to

who are residents of the barrio, district or ward for at least six months,
fifteen years of age or over, citizens of the Philippines and who are
registered in the list of Citizen Assembly members kept by the barrio, district
or ward secretary;</blockquote>

to broaden the base of citizen participation in the democratic process and to
afford ample opportunity for the citizenry to express their views on important
national issues;</blockquote>

<blockquote>'WHEREAS, responding to the clamor of the people and pursuant to
Presidential Decree No. 86-A, dated January 5, 1973, the following questions
were posed before the Citizens Assemblies or <span class="SpellE">Barangays</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do you approve of the New Constitution?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do you still want a plebiscite to be called

against seven hundred forty-three thousand eight hundred sixty-nine (743,869)
who voted for its rejection; while on the question as to whether or not the
people would still like a plebiscite to be called to ratify the new
Constitution, fourteen million two hundred ninety-eight thousand eight hundred
fourteen (14,298,814) answered that there was no need for a plebiscite and that
the vote of the <span class="SpellE">Barangays</span> (Citizens Assemblies)

the allegations made in the petition in L-35948 and denying the other
allegations thereof, respondents therein alleged in their answer thereto, by
way of affirmative defenses:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1) that the
'questions raised' in said petition 'are political in character'; 2) that 'the
Constitutional Convention acted freely and had plenary authority to propose not
only amendments but a Constitution which would supersede the present
Constitution'; 3) that 'the President's call for a plebiscite and the
appropriation of funds for this purpose are valid'; 4) that 'there is not an
improper submission' and 'there can be a plebiscite under Martial Law'; and 5)
that the 'argument that the Proposed Constitution is vague and incomplete,
makes an unconstitutional delegation of power, includes a referendum on the
proclamation of Martial Law and purports to exercise judicial power' is 'not
relevant and * * * without merit.' Identical defenses were set up in the other
cases under consideration.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Immediately after the hearing held on January 17, 1973, or

thereon and that thereafter the Chief Justice should state the result or the
votes thus cast on the points in issue.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the individual views of my brethren in the Court are set forth in
the opinions attached hereto, except that, instead of writing their separate
opinions, some Members have preferred to merely concur in the opinion of one of
our colleagues."</blockquote>

issues involved therein, after which he recapitulated the views of the Members

nature of the issue on the legality of Presidential Decree No. 73.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the validity of the decree itself, Justices
<span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, Castro, Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> and myself, or six (6) Members of the Court,
are of the opinion that the issue has become moot and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>academic, whereas Justices <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span> and Antonio
voted to uphold the validity of said Decree.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the authority of the 1971 Constitutional

authority of the Convention.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justice Fernando, likewise, expressed the view
that the <span style="">1971 </span>Constitutional

despite the proclamation of Martial Law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In effect, Justices <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span> and Antonio hold the same view.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the question whether the proclamation of
Martial Law affected (the proper submission of the proposed Constitution to a
plebiscite, insofar as the freedom essential <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
is concerned, Justice Fernando is of the opinion that there is a repugnancy
between the election contemplated under Art. XV of the <span style="">1935 </span>Constitution and the existence of Martial Law, and would,
therefore, grant the petitions were they not moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justices <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>,
Antonio and <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> are of the opinion that that
issue involves questions of fact which cannot be predetermined, and that
Martial law <i style=""><span style="">per se</span></i><span style=""> </span>does not necessarily preclude the factual possibility of
adequate freedom of the purposes contemplated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On Presidential Proclamation No. 1102, the

Castro, Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>, <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span>,

question of validity of said Proclamation has not been properly raised before
the Court, which, accordingly, should not pass upon such question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"b.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>
holds that the issue on the constitutionality of Proclamation No. 1102 has been
submitted to and should be determined by the Court, and that the 'purported
ratification of the Proposed Constitution * * * based on the referendum among
Citizens' Assemblies falls short of being in strict conformity with the
requirements of Article XV of the 1935 Constitution,' but that such unfortunate
drawback notwithstanding, 'considering all other related relevant
circumstances, * * * the new Constitution is legally recognizable and should be
recognized as legitimately in force.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"c.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justice <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>
maintains unqualifiedly that the Proposed Constitution has not been ratified in
accordance with Article XV of the 1935 Constitution, <span style="">and that, accordingly, it has no force and effect whatsoever.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"d.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Justice
Antonio feels 'that the Court is not competent to act' on the issue whether the
Proposed Constitution has been ratified by the people or not, 'in the absence
of any judicially discoverable and manageable standards,' since the issue
'poses a question of fact.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the question whether or not these cases
should be dismissed, Justices <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, Castro, <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span>, Antonio and <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> voted in the affirmative, for the reasons set
forth in their respective opinions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Justices Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span> and the writer
similarly voted, except as regards Case No. L-35948 as to which they voted to
grant to the petitioners therein a reasonable period of time within which to
file appropriate pleadings should they wish to contest the legality of
Presidential Proclamation No. 1102.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Justice <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span> favors the granting of said
period to the petitioners in said Case No. L-35948 for the aforementioned
purpose, but he believes, in effect, that the Court should go farther and

that the petitioners "are ready and willing to perform their duties as
duly elected members of the Senate of the Philippines," but respondents
Secretary of National Defense, Executive Secretary and Chief of Staff,
"through their agents and representatives, are preventing petitioners from
perform­ing their duties as duly elected Senators of the Philippines";
that "the Senate premises in the Congress of the Philippines Building * *

Constitution of the Philippines by action of the so-called Citizens' Assemblies
on January 10, 1973 to January 15, 1973, as stated in and by virtue of
Proclamation No. 1102 signed and issued by the President of the

unlawfully refrained and continue to refrain from and/or unlawfully neglected

cases, to which reference has been made in the preceding pages, the Supreme
Court dismissed said cases on January 22, 1973, by a majority vote, upon the
ground that the petitions therein had become moot and academic; that the alleged
ratification of the 1972 (1973) Constitution "is illegal, unconstitutional

Constitution," for the reasons specified in the petition as amended; that,

convening the Senate for its 8th session, assuming general jurisdiction over
the Session Hall and the premises of the Senate and * * * continue such

<p class="BODY">Respondents <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> and Roy, in said Case

academic exercise in futility."</p>

<p class="BODY">This defense or theory, set up by counsel for respon­dents Gil J.
<span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> and Jose Roy in G.R. No. L-36165, and, also, by
the Solicitor General, is predicated upon the fact that, in Our decision in the
plebiscite cases, Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> had expressed
the view that the 1935 Constitution had "pro <span class="SpellE">tanto</span>
passed into history" and "been legitimately supplanted by the
Constitution now in force by virtue of Proclamation No. 1102 * * * "; that
Mr. Justice Antonio did not feel "that this Court is competent to
act" in said cases<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"in the
absence of any judicially discoverable and manageable standards" and
because "the access to relevant information is insufficient to assure the
correct determination of the issue," apart from the circumstance that
"the new constitution has been promulgated and great interests have
already arisen under it" and that the political organ of the Government has
recognized its provisions; whereas, Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>
had postulated that "(w)<span class="SpellE">ithout</span> any competent
evidence * * * about the circumstances attending the holding" of the
"referendum or plebiscite" thru the Citizens' Assemblies, he
"cannot say that it was not lawfully held" and that, accordingly, he <i style="">assumed</i><span style=""> </span>"that what the proclamation (No. 1102) says on its face is
true and until overcome by satisfactory evidence" he could not
"subscribe to the claim that such plebiscite was not held
accordingly"; and that he accepted "as a <i style="">fait accompli</i><span style=""> </span>that
the Constitution adopted (by the 1971 Constitutional Convention) on November
30, 1972, has been duly ratified."</p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel for respondents Gil J. <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>
and Jose Roy goes on to say that, under these circumstances, "it seems
remote or improbable that the necessary eight (8) votes under the 1935
Constitution, and much less the ten (10) votes required by the 1972 (1973)
Constitution, can be obtained for the relief sought in the Amended
Petition" in G.R. No. L-36165.</p>

<p class="BODY">I am unable to share this view.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To begin with, Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> announced
publicly, in open court, during the hearing of these cases, that he was and is
willing to be convinced that his aforementioned opinion in the plebiscite cases
should be reconsidered and changed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
effect, he thus declared that he had an open mind in connection with the cases
at bar, and that in deciding the same he would not necessarily adhere to said
opinion if the petitioners herein succeeded in convincing him that their view
should be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, counsel for the aforesaid respondents had apparently
assumed that, under the 1935 Constitution, eight (8) votes are necessary to
declare invalid the contested Proclamation No. 1102. I do not believe that this
assumption is borne out by any provision of said Constitution Section 10 of
Article VIII thereof reads:</p>

<blockquote>"All cases involving the constitutionality of a treaty or law
shall be heard and decided by the Supreme Court <i style=""><span style="">in banc</span></i><span style="">, and </span>no
treaty or law may be declared unconstitutional without the concurrence of
two-thirds of all the members of the Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to this section, the concurrence of two-thirds of all
the Members of the Supreme Court is required only to declare a "treaty or
law" unconstitutional.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Construing
said provision, in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1949" day="16" month="9">September
 16, 1949</st1:date>, then Chief Justice Moran, voicing the <i style=""><span style="">unanimous</span></i><span style=""> </span>view of
the Members of this Court, postulated:</p>

<blockquote>"* * * There is <i style="">nothing</i><span style=""> </span>either in the Constitution or in the
Judiciary Act requiring the vote of eight Justices to nullify a rule or
regulation or an executive order issued by the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is very significant that in the previous
drafts of section 10, Article VIII of the Constitution, 'executive order' and
'regulation' <i style="">were included</i><span style=""> </span>among those that required for their
nullification the vote of two-thirds of all the members of the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But 'executive order' and 'regulation' were
later <i style="">deleted </i>from the final draft (<span class="SpellE">Aruego</span>, The Framing of the Philippine Constitution, Vol. I,
pp. 495, 496), and <i style="">thus a mere majority
of six members of this Court is enough to nullify them.</i><span style="">"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The distinction is not without reasonable foundation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two-thirds vote (eight [8] votes)
requirement, indeed, was made to apply only to treaty and law, because, in
these cases, the participation of the two other departments of the government –
the Executive and the Legislative – is present, <span style="">which circumstance is absent in the case of rules, regulations and
executive orders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, a law
(statute) passed by Congress is subject to the approval or veto of the
President, whose disapproval cannot be overridden except by the vote of
two-thirds (2/3) of all members of each House of Congress.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">A

regulations or executive orders which are exclusive acts of the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, to nullify the same, a lesser number
of votes is necessary in the Supreme Court than that required to invalidate a
law or treaty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Although the foregoing
refers to rules, regulations and executive orders issued by the President, the
dictum applies with equal force to executive proclamations, like said
Proclamation No. 1102, inasmuch as the authority to issue the same is governed
by section 63 of the Revised Administrative Code, which provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Administrative acts and commands of the (Governor-General)
President of the Philippine's touching the organization or mode of operation of
the Government or rearranging or readjusting any of the districts, divisions,
parts, or ports of the (Philippine Islands) Philippines and all acts and
commands governing the general performance of duties by public employees or
disposing of issues of general concern shall be made effective in executive
orders.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Executive orders fixing the dates when specific laws,
resolutions, or orders are to have or cease to (have) effect and <i style="">any information concerning matters of public
moment</i><span style=""> </span>determined by law,
resolution, or executive orders, may be promulgated in an executive

<p class="BODY">In fact, while executive orders embody administrative acts or
commands of the President, executive proclamations are mainly informative and
declaratory in character, and so does counsel for respondents Gil J. <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> and Jose Roy maintain in G.R. No. <span style="">L-36165.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>As a consequence, an executive
proclamation has <i style="">no more</i><span style=""> </span>than "the force of an executive

unconstitutional, under the </span>1935 <span style="">Constitution,
the same number of votes needed to invalidate an executive order, rule or
regulation – namely, six (6) votes – would suffice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the applicability of the provisions of the proposed
new Constitution, approved by the <span style="">1971 </span>Constitutional
Convention, in the determination of the question whether or not it is now in

of which said Constitutional Convention was called and approved the proposed
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well settled that

question?<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Solicitor General maintains
in his comment the affirmative view and this is his main defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support thereof, he alleges that
"petitioners would have this Court declare as invalid the New Constitution
of the Republic" from which – he claims – "this Court now derives <span style="">its </span>authority"; that
"nearly 15 million of our body politic from the age of 15 years have
mandated this Constitution to be the New Constitution and the prospect of
unsettling acts done in reliance on it caution against interposition of the
power of judicial review"; that "in the case of the New Constitution,
the government has been recognized in accordance with the New
Constitution"; that "the country's foreign relations are now being
conducted in accordance with the new charter"; that "foreign
governments have taken note of it"; that the "plebiscite cases"
are "not precedents for holding questions regarding proposal and
ratification <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>"; and that "to
abstain from judgment on the ultimate issue of constitutionality is not to
abdicate duty."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At the outset, it is obvious to me that We are <span style="">not </span>being asked to
"declare" the <i style="">new</i><span style=""> </span>Constitution invalid. What

people, especially that they have done so <i style="">in
accordance with Article XV of the 1935 Constitution</i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The petitioners
maintain that the conclusion reached by the Chief Executive in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of Proclamation No. 1102 is not borne
out by the <span class="SpellE">whereases</span> preceding the same, as the
predicates from which said conclusion was drawn; that the plebiscite or
"election" required in said Article XV has not been held; that the
Chief Executive has no authority, under the <span style="">1935 </span>Constitution, <i style="">to
dispense</i><span style=""> </span>with said election
or plebiscite; that the proceedings before the Citizens' Assemblies did not
constitute and may not be considered as such plebiscite; that the facts of
record abundantly show that the aforementioned Assemblies could not have been
held throughout the Philippines from January 10 to January <span style="">15, 1973; </span>and that, in any event, the
proceedings <span style="">in </span>said Assemblies
are null and void as an alleged ratification of the new Constitution proposed
by the <span style="">1971 </span>Constitutional
Convention, not only because of the circumstances under which said Assemblies
had been created and held, but, also, because persons disqualified to vote
under Article V of the Constitution were allowed to participate therein,
because the provisions of our Election Code were not observed in said
Assemblies, because the same were not held under the supervision of the Commission
on Elections, in violation of section 2 of Article X of the <span style="">1935 </span>Constitution, and because <span style="">the existence of Martial Law and General
Order No. 20, withdrawing or suspending the limited freedom to discuss the </span>merits

voting thereon, particularly <i style=""><span style="">a viva </span></i><i style=""><span style="">voce</span></i><span style="">, as </span><span style="">it was done in many instances, as well as

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Referring now more
specifically to the issue on whether the new Constitution proposed by the 1971

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The reason why the issue
under consideration and other issues of similar character are <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>, not political, is plain and simple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the principal bases of the non-<span class="SpellE">justiciability</span> of so-called political questions is the
principle of </span>separation of powers – characteristic of the Presidential
system of government – the functions of which are classified or divided, by
reason of their nature, into three (3) categories, namely: (1) those involving
the making of laws, which are allocated to the legislative department; (2)
those concerned mainly with the enforcement of such laws and of judicial
decisions applying and/or interpreting the same, which belong to the executive
department; and (3) those dealing with the settlement of disputes,
controversies or conflicts involving rights, duties or prerogatives that are
legally demandable and enforceable, which are apportioned to courts of
justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i style=""><span style="">Within</span></i><span style=""> </span>its own
sphere - but <i style=""><span style="">only within</span></i><span style=""> </span>such sphere - each department is supreme
and independent of the others, and each is devoid of authority, not only to
encroach upon the powers or field of action assigned to any of the other
departments, but, also, to inquire into or pass upon the advisability or <i style=""><span style="">wisdom</span></i><span style=""> </span>of the
acts performed, measures taken or decisions made by the other departments –
provided that such acts, measures or decisions are <i style=""><span style="">within</span></i><span style=""> </span>the area
allocated thereto by the Constitution.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This principle of separation of powers under the Presidential
system goes hand in hand with the system of checks and balances, under which
each department is vested by the Fundamental Law with some powers to forestall,
restrain or arrest a possible or actual misuse or abuse of powers by the other
departments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the appointing power
of the Executive, his pardoning power, his veto power, his authority to call
the Legislature or Congress to special sessions and even to prescribe or limit
the object or objects of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>legislation
that may be taken up in such sessions, etc.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Conversely, Congress or an agency or arm thereof - such as the Commission
on Appointments – may approve or disapprove some appointments made by the
President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It, also, has the power of
appropriation, to "define, prescribe, and apportion the jurisdiction of
the various courts," as well as that of impeachment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, under the judicial power
vested by the Constitution, the "Supreme Court and * * * such inferior
courts as may be established by law," may settle or decide with finality,
not only <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> controversies between private
individuals or entities, but, also, disputes or conflicts between a private
individual or entity, on the one hand, and an officer or branch of the
government, on the other, or between two (2) officers or branches of service,
when the latter officer or branch is charged with acting without jurisdiction
or in excess thereof or in violation of law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And so, when a power vested in said officer or branch of the government
is <i style=""><span style="">absolute</span></i><span style=""> </span>or <i style=""><span style="">unqualified</span></i><span style="">, </span>the acts
in the exercise of such power are said to be <i style=""><span style="">political</span></i><span style=""> </span>in nature,
and, consequently, non-<span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> or beyond judicial
review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, courts of justice
would be arrogating upon themselves a power conferred by the Constitution upon
another branch of the service to the exclusion of the others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, in <span class="SpellE">Tañada</span> <i style=""><span style="">vs</span></i><span style="">. </span><span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>this Court quoted with approval from

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and, in an attempt to describe the nature
of a political question in terms, it was hoped, understandable to the laymen,
We added that "* * * the term 'political question' connotes, in legal
parlance, what it means in ordinary parlance, namely, a question of
policy" in matters concerning the government of a State, as a body
politic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In other words, in the
language of Corpus <span class="SpellE">Juris</span> <span class="SpellE">Secundum</span>
<span style="">(</span><i style=""><span style="">supra</span></i><span style="">), </span>it
refers to those questions which; under the Constitution, are to be <i style=""><span style="">decided

discretionary authority</span></i><span style=""> </span>has been delegated to the Legislature or
executive branch of the government.' It is concerned with issues dependent upon
the <i style=""><span style="">wisdom,
not legality</span></i><span style="">, </span>of a particular measure."</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, when the grant of power is qualified, conditional or
subject to limitations, the issue on whether or not the prescribed
qualifications or conditions have been met, or the limitations respected, <i style="">is</i><span style="">
</span><span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> or non-political, the crux of the
problem being one of <i style="">legality or validity</i><span style=""> </span>of the contested act, <i style="">not</i><span style=""> </span>its wisdom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise,
said qualifications, conditions or limitations – particularly those prescribed

<p class="BODY">Luther <i style="">vs</i><span style="">. </span>Borden was an action for trespass
filed by Luther with the Circuit Court of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> against Borden and others for having
forcibly entered into Luther's house, in <st1:state><st1:place>Rhode Island</st1:place></st1:state>,
sometime in 1842.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants who
were in the military service of said former colony of England, alleged in their
defense that they had acted in obedience to the commands of a superior officer,
because Luther and others were engaged in a conspiracy to overthrow the
government by force and the state had been placed by competent authority under
Martial Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such authority was the
charter government of Rhode Island at the time of the Declaration of
Independence, for – unlike other states which adopted a new Constitution upon
secession from England – Rhode Island retained its form of government under a
British Charter, making only such alterations, by acts of the Legislature, as were
necessary to adapt it to its subsequent condition as an independent state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was under this form of government when <st1:state><st1:place>Rhode
  Island</st1:place></st1:state> joined other American states in the
Declaration of Independence and, by subsequently ratifying the Constitution of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
became a member of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1843, it adopted a new Consti­tution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prior thereto, however, many citizens had become dissatisfied
with the charter government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Memorials
addressed by them to the Legislature having failed to bring about the desired
effect, meetings were held and associations formed — by those who belonged to
this segment of the population — which eventually resulted in a convention
called for the drafting of a new Constitution to be submitted to the people for
their adoption or rejection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
convention was <i style="">not</i><span style=""> </span>authorized by any law of the
existing government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The delegates to
such convention framed a new Constitution which was submitted to the
people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the return of the votes cast
by them, the convention declared that said Constitution had been adopted and
ratified by a majority of the people and became the paramount law and
Constitution of Rhode Island.</p>

<p class="BODY">The charter government, which was supported by a large number of
citizens of the state, contested, however, the validity of said
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This notwithstanding, one
Thomas W. Dorr, who had been elected governor under the new Constitution of the
rebels, prepared to assert authority by force of arms, and many citizens
assembled to support <span style="">him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, the charter government passed an
Act </span>declaring the state under Martial Law and adopted measures to repel
the threatened attack and subdue the rebels.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was the state of affairs when the defendants, who were in the
military service of charter government and were to arrest Luther, for engaging
in the support of the rebel government – <span style="">which
was </span><i style="">never</i><span style=""> </span><span style="">able to exercise </span><i style="">any</i><span style=""> </span><span style="">authority in the state – </span>broke into his house.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the charter government had taken measures to call its
own convention to revise the existing form of government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eventually, a new constitution was drafted by
a convention held under the authority of the charter government, and thereafter
was adopted and ratified by the people.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"(T)he times and places at which the votes were to be given, the
persons who were to receive and return them, and the qualifications of the
voters <i style=""><span style="">having all been previously authorized and provided for by law passed by
the charter government</span></i><span style="">," </span>the latter formally surrendered all
of its powers to the new government, established under its authority, in May
1843, which had been in operation <i style=""><span style="">uninterruptedly</span></i><span style=""> </span>since
then.</p>

<p class="BODY">About a year before, or in May 1842, Dorr, at the head of a
military force, had made an unsuccessful attempt to take possession of the
state arsenal in Providence, but he was repulsed, and, after an
"assemblage of some hundreds of armed men under his command at <span class="SpellE">Chepatchet</span> in the June following, which dispersed upon
approach of the troops of the old government, <i style=""><span style="">no</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">f</span>urther effort was made to

<p class="BODY">Having offered to introduce evidence to prove that the
constitution of the rebels had been ratified by the majority of the people,
which the Circuit Court rejected, apart from rendering judgment for the
defendants, the plaintiff took the case for review to the Federal Supreme Court
which affirmed the action of the Circuit Court, stating:</p>

held their authority under that constitution; and it is admitted on all hands

therefore, of a State court, whose judicial authority to decide upon the

<p class="BODY">Then, too, the case of Luther <i style="">vs</i><span style="">. </span>Borden hinged more on the question
of recognition of <i style="">government</i><span style="">, </span>than on recognition of <i style="">constitution</i><span style="">, </span>and there is a fundamental difference between these two (2)
types of recognition, the first being generally conceded to be a political
question, whereas the nature of the latter depends upon a number of factors,
one of them being whether the new Constitution has been adopted in the manner
prescribed in the Constitution in force at the time of the purported
ratification of the former, which is <i style="">essentially
</i><span style="">a</span><i style=""> <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span></i><span style=""> </span>question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was, in

antagonistic to each other, which is absent in the present cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, the Government established under the

ground: (1) that the President "is without authority to create the
Citizens' Assemblies" through which, respondents maintain, the proposed
new Constitution has been ratified; (2) that said Assemblies "are without
power to approve the proposed Constitution"; (3) that the President
"is without power to proclaim the ratification by the Filipino people of
the proposed Constitution"; and (4) that "the election held (in the
Citizens' Assemblies) to ratify the proposed Constitution was not a free
election, hence null and void."</p>

<p class="BODY">Apart from substantially reiterating these grounds in support of
said negative view, the petitioners in L-36164 contend: (1) that the President
"has no power to call a plebiscite for the ratification or rejection"
of the proposed new Constitution or "to appropriate funds for the holding
of the said plebiscite"; (2) that the proposed new or revised Constitution
"is vague and incomplete," as well as "contains provisions which
are beyond the powers of the 1971 Convention to enact," thereby rendering
it "unfit for * * * submission to the people"; (3) that "(t)he
period of time between November 30, 1972 when <span style="">the </span>1972 draft was approved and January 11-15, 1973," when
the Citizens' Assemblies supposedly ratified said draft, "was too short,
worse still, there was practically no time for the Citizens' Assemblies to
discuss the merits of the Constitution which the majority of them have not read
and which they never knew would be submitted to them for ratification until
they were asked the question — 'do you approve the New Constitution? ' during
the said days of the voting"; and that "(t)here was altogether no
freedom of discussion and no opportunity to concentrate on the matter submitted
to them when the 1972 draft was supposedly submitted to the Citizens'
Assemblies for ratification."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner in L-36236
added, as arguments in support of </span>the negative view, that: (1) "(w)<span class="SpellE">ith</span> a government-controlled press, there can never be a
fair and proper submission of the proposed Constitution to the people";
and (2) Proclamation No. 1102 is null and void "(<span class="SpellE">i</span>)<span class="SpellE">nasmuch</span> as the ratification process" prescribed
"in the 1935 Constitution was not followed."</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides adopting substantially some of the grounds relied upon by
the petitioners in the above-mentioned cases, the petitioners in L-36283 argue
that "(t)he creation of the <span style="">Citizens'

deception upon the people since the President announced the postponement of

<p class="NUM">1. That the amendments to the Constitution be pro­posed either by
Congress or by a convention called for that purpose, "by a vote of three-fourths
of all the Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives voting
separately," but "in joint session assembled";</p>

ratification" at an "election"; and</p>

<p class="NUM">3. That such amendments be "approved by a majority of the

Constitutional Convention to in<span style="">corporate

concerning "elections" must, also, be taken into account, namely,
section 1 of Art. V and Art. X of said Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The former reads:</p>

section 1 of Art. V of the Constitution is </span><span style="">a </span><i style="">limitation</i><span style=""> </span><span style="">upon the exercise of the right of suffrage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They claim that no other persons than

contends that said provision merely <i style=""><span style="">guarantees</span></i><span style=""> </span>the right of suffrage to persons possessing
the aforementioned qualifications and none of the disqualifications prescribed

all of the aforementioned qualifications, and <span style="">possessing </span>some of the aforesaid
disqualifications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support of this
view, he invokes the permissive nature of the language - "(s)<span class="SpellE">uffrage</span> may be exercised" — used in section 1 of Art.
V of the Constitution, and the provisions of the Revised Barrio Charter,
Republic Act No. 3590, particularly sections 4 and 6 thereof, providing that
citizens of the Philippines "eighteen years of age or over," who are
registered in the list of barrio assembly members, shall be <i style=""><span style="">members</span></i><span style=""> </span>thereof
and may participate as such in the plebiscites prescribed in said Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">I cannot accept the Solicitor General's theory. Art. V of the
Constitution declares <i style=""><span style="">who</span></i><span style=""> </span>may exercise the right of suffrage,
so that those lacking the qualifications therein prescribed may <i style=""><span style="">not</span></i><span style=""> </span>exercise
such right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This view is borne out by the
records of the Constitutional Convention that drafted the 1935
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, section 1 of Art.
V of the 1935 Constitution was largely based on the report of the committee on
suffrage of the Convention that drafted said Constitution, which report was, in
turn, "strongly influenced by the election laws then in force in the
Philippines * * *"<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a>
Said committee had recommended: (1) "That the right of suffrage should be
exercised <i style=""><span style="">only</span></i><span style=""> </span>by male citizens of the Philippines." (2) "That it
should be <i style="">limited</i><span style=""> </span>to those who could read and
write." (3) "That the <i style="">duty</i><span style=""> </span>to vote should be made <i style="">obligatory</i><span style="">." </span>It appears that the first recommendation was discussed
extensively in the Conven­tion, and that, by way of compromise, it was
eventually agreed to include, in section 1 of Art. V of the Constitution, the
second sentence thereof imposing upon the National Assembly, established by the
original Constitution — instead of the bicameral Congress subsequently created
by amend­ment of said Constitution — the duty to "extend the right of
suffrage to women, if in a plebiscite to be held for that purpose within two
years after the adoption of this Constitution, not less than three hundred
thousand women possessing the necessary qualifications shall vote affirmatively
on the question."<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a></p>

permissive language used in the first sentence of said Art. V. Despite some
debates on the age qualification — amendments having been proposed to reduce

constitutional grant or conferment of a right is necessarily a negation of the
authority of Congress or <span style="">of any other
branch of the Government to deny said right to the subject of the grant — and,
in this sense only, may the same partake of the nature of a guarantee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, this does not imply, not even remotely,
that the Fundamental Law allows Congress or anybody else to vest in those
lacking the qualifications and having the disqualifications mentioned in the

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At this juncture, it is

chapter 20 thereof, and then in the Administrative Code of 1917 — Act 2711 — as
chapter 18 thereof, which, in turn, was amended by Act 3387, approved on
December 3, 1927.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sections 431 and 432
of said Code of 1917, prescribing, respectively, the qualifications for and
disqualifications from voting, are quoted below.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">In

lacked </span>the requisite qualifications and possessed any of the statutory
disqualifications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, the history
of section 1, Art. V of the Constitution, shows beyond doubt that the same con­ferred
— not guaranteed — the authority to exercise the right of suffrage to persons

to be specified in ordinary laws and, by necessary implication, <i style="">denied</i><span style=""> </span>such right to those lacking any of said qualifications or <i style="">having</i><span style=""> </span>any of the aforementioned disqualifications.</p>

but a "partial amendment" of said section 1, <i style="">which could be amended further, after its ratification</i><span style="">, </span>had the same taken place, so that
the afore­mentioned partial amendment was, for legal purposes, no more than a <i style="">provisional</i><span style=""> </span>or <i style="">temporary</i><span style=""> </span>amendment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said partial amendment was predicated upon
the generally <span style="">accepted contemporary
construction that, under the 1935 Constitution, persons below- twenty-one (21)
years of age </span>could not exercise the right of suffrage, without a
previous amendment of the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, the question, whether 18-year-old members of

a debatable one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, there seems to
be a conflict between the last paragraph of said section 6 of Rep. Act No.

"any budgetary, supplemental appropriations or special tax

in favor of the 21-year-old members of the assembly, not only because this
interpretation is in accord with Art. V of the Constitution, but, also, because
provisions of a Constitution – particularly of a written and rigid one, like
ours – are generally accorded a mandatory status – unless the intention to the
contrary is manifest, which is not so as regards said Art. V – for otherwise
they would not have been considered sufficiently important to be included in

plebiscite and that the vote of the <span class="SpellE">Barangays</span>

<p class="BODY">It is thus clear that the proceedings held in such Citizens'

the plebiscite be held?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>( COMELEC
supervision indispensable; essential requisites)<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Just as essential as compliance with said Art. V of the 1935
Constitution is that of Art. X thereof, particularly its sections 1 and 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, section 1 provides that "(t)here
shall be an <i style="">independent</i><span style=""> </span>Commission on Elections * * *."
The point to be stressed here is the term "independent." Indeed, why
was the term used?</p>

<p class="BODY">In the absence of said constitutional provision as to the
independence of the Commission, would it have been dependent upon either
Congress or the Judiciary?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer
must be in the negative, because the functions of the Commission –
"enforcement and administration" of election laws – are neither
legislative nor judicial in nature, and, hence, beyond the field allocated to
either Congress or courts of justice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said functions are by their nature essentially <i style="">executive</i><span style="">, </span>for
which reason, the Commission would be under the "control" of the
President, pursuant to section 10, paragraph (1) of Art. VII of the
Constitution, if Art. X thereof did not explicitly declare that it (the
Commission) is an "independent" body.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, in amending the original 1935 Constitution, by inserting
therein said Art. X, on the Commission on Elections, the purpose was to make
said Commission <i style="">independent principally
of the Chief Execu­tive</i><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">And the reason <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> is, also,
obvious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prior to the creation of the
Commission on Elections as a constitutional organ, election laws in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
were enforced by the then Department of the Interior, through its Executive
Bureau, one of the offices under the supervision and control of said Department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same — like other departments of the
Executive Branch of the Government — was, in turn, under the control of the
Chief Executive, before the adoption of the 1935 Constitution, and had been —
until the abolition of said Department, sometime ago — under the control of the
President of the Philippines, since the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of said Fundamental Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the
provisions thereof, the Executive could so use his power of control over the
Department of the Interior and its Executive Bureau as to place the minority
party at such a great, if not decisive, disadvantage, as to deprive it, in
effect, of the opportunity to defeat the political party in power, and, hence,
to enable the same to perpetuate itself therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To forestall this possibility, the original
1935 Constitution was amended by the estab­lishment of the Commission on
Elections as a constitutional body <i style="">independent
primarily of the President</i><span style=""> of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Phil­ippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The independence of the Commission was sought to be <span style="">strengthened by the long term of office of

decide, save those involving the right to vote, <i style="">all</i><span style=""> </span>administrative
questions, affecting elections, including the determination of the number and
location of polling places, and the appointment of election inspectors and of

Citizens' Assemblies "shall conduct between January 10 and 15, 1973, a <i style=""><span style="">referendum</span></i><span style=""> </span>on
important national issues, including those specified in paragraph 2 hereof, and
submit the results thereof to the Department of Local Governments and Community
Development immediately thereafter, * * *." As in Presidential Decree No.
86, this Decree No. 86-A do not and cannot exclude the exercise of the
constitutional supervisory power of the Commission on Elections or its
participation in the proceedings in said Assemblies, if the same had been
intended to constitute the "election" or plebiscite required in Art.
V of the 1935 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
provision of Presidential Decree No. 86-A directing the immediate submission of
the result thereof to the Department of Local Governments and Community
Development is not necessarily inconsistent with, and must be subordinate to
the constitutional power of the commission on Elections to exercise its
"exclusive" authority over the "enforcement and administration
of all laws relative to the conduct of elections," if the proceedings in
the Assemblies would partake of the nature of an "election" or plebiscite
for the ratification or rejection of the proposed Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are told that Presidential Decree No. 86 was further amended
by Presidential Decree No. 86-B, dated January 7, 1973, ordering "that
important national issues shall from time to time be referred to the <span class="SpellE">Barangays</span> (Citizens Assemblies) for resolution in
accordance with Presidential Decree No. 86-A dated January 5, 1973 and that the
initial referendum shall include the matter of ratification of the Constitution
proposed by the 1971 Constitutional Convention" and that "(t)he
Secretary of the Department of Local Governments and Community Development
shall insure the implementation of this order." As in the case of
Presidential Decrees Nos. 86 and 86-A, the foregoing directives do not
necessarily exclude the exercise of the powers vested by the 1935 Constitution
in the Commission on Elections, even if the Executive had the authority to
repeal Art. X of our Fundamental Law — which he does <i style=""><span style="">not</span></i><span style=""> </span>possess.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copy of Presidential Decree No. 86-B is
appended hereto as Annex B hereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">The point is that, such of the Barrio Assemblies as were held
took place without the intervention of the Commission on Elections, and without
complying with the provisions of the Election Code of 1971 or even of those of
Presidential Decree No. 73. What is more, they were held under the supervision <i style=""><span style="">of
the very officers and agencies of the Executive Department sought to be
excluded</span></i><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> by Art. X of the 1935
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse still, said officers
and agencies of the Executive Department, who had been publicly urged and
ostensibly promised to work for the ratification of the proposed revised
Constitution would be favored thereby, owing to the practically indefinite
extension of their respective terms of office in consequence of section 9 of
the Transitory Provisions, found in Art. XVII of the proposed Constitution,
without any elections <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the procedure therein mostly followed is
such that there is <i style=""><span style="">no reasonable means of checking</span></i><span style=""> </span>the
accuracy of the returns filed by the officers who conducted said
plebiscites.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is another patent
violation of Art. X of the Constitution which can hardly be sanctioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, since the provisions of this article
form part of the <i style=""><span style="">fundamental</span></i><span style=""> </span>scheme set forth in the 1935 Constitution, as amended, to
ensure the "free, orderly, and honest" expression of the people's
will, the aforemen­tioned violation thereof renders null and void the contested
proceedings or alleged plebiscite in the Citizens' Assemblies, insofar as the
same are claimed to have ratified the revised Constitution proposed by the 1971
Constitutional Convention. " * * * <i style=""><span style="">all authorities agree</span></i><span style=""> </span>that the
legal definition of an election, as well as that which is usually understood by
the term, is a choosing or a selection by those having a right to participate

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in 15pt 22.3pt; text-align: justify;"><i>Has the proposed Constitution

Assemblies allegedly held throughout the </i><st1:country-region><st1:place><i>Philippines</i></st1:place></st1:country-region><i>?<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents maintain the affirmative, relying upon Proclamation
No. 1102, the validity of which is precisely being contested by petitioners
herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents claim that said
proclamation is "conclusive" upon this Court, or is, at least,
entitled to full faith and credence, as an enrolled bill; that the proposed
Constitution has been, in fact, ratified, approved or adopted by the
"overwhelming" majority of the people; that Art. XV of the 1935
Constitution has thus been "substantially" complied with; and that
the Court should refrain from passing upon the validity of Proclamation No.
1102, not only because such question is political in nature, but, also, because
should the Court invalidate the proclamation, the former would, in effect, veto
the action of the people in whom sovereignty resides and from whom its powers
are derived.</p>

<p class="BODY">The major flaw in this process of rationalization is that it
assumes, as a fact, the very premise on which it is predicated, and which,
moreover, is contested by the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As the Supreme Court of <span class="SpellE">Minnessota</span> has aptly
put it –</p>

<blockquote>" <span style="">* * * </span><i style="">every</i><span style=""> </span>officer under a constitutional government must act according to
law and subject to its restrictions, and <i style="">every
departure</i><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> or disregard thereof must subject him to the
restraining and controlling power of the people, <i style="">acting through the agency of the judiciary; for it must be remembered
that the people act through courts</i><span style="">,
as </span>well as through the executive or the Legislature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One department is just as representative as
the other, and <i style="">the judiciary is the
department which is charged with the special duty of determining the
limitations which the law places upon all official action</i><span style="">. * * *."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the issue boils down to whether or not the Executive
acted within the limits of his authority when he certified in Proclamation No.
1102 "that the Constitution proposed by the nineteen hundred and <span style="">seventy</span>-<span style="">one </span>(1971) Constitutional Convention has been ratified by an
overwhelming majority of all of the votes cast by the members of all the <span class="SpellE">Barangays</span> (Citizens Assemblies) throughout the Philippines,
and has thereby come into effect."</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, it is not claimed that the Chief Executive
had personal knowledge of the data he certified in said proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, Art. X of the 1935 Constitution was
precisely inserted to place <i style=""><span style="">beyond</span></i><span style=""> </span>the Executive the power to supervise
or even exercise <i style=""><span style="">any</span></i><span style=""> </span>authority whatsoever over <span style="">"</span><i style=""><span style="">all</span></i><span style=""> laws </span>relative to the conduct of
elections," and, hence, whether the elections are for the choice or
selection of public officers or for the ratification or rejection of any
proposed amendment, or revision of the Fundamental Law, since the proceedings
for the latter are, also, referred to in said Art. XV as "elections."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General stated, in his argument before this Court,
that he had been informed that there was in each municipality a municipal
association of presidents of the citizens' assemblies for each barrio of the
municipality; that the president of each such municipal association formed part
of a provincial or city association of presidents of such municipal
associations; that the president of each one of these provincial or city
associations in turn formed part of a National Association or Federation of
Presidents of such Provincial or City Associations; and that one Francisco Cruz
from <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, as
President of said National Association or Federation, reported to the President
of the Philippines, in the morning of January 17, 1973, the total result of the
voting in the citizens' assemblies all over the country from January 10 to
January 15, 1973.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General
further intimated that the said municipal associations had reported the results
of the citizens' assemblies in their respective municipalities to the
corresponding Provincial Association, which, in turn, transmitted the results
of the voting in the province to the Department of Local Governments and
Community Development, which tabulated the results of the voting in the
citizens assemblies through out the Philippines and then turned them over to
Mr. Francisco Cruz, as President or acting President of the National
Association or Federation, whereupon Mr. Cruz, acting in a ceremonial capacity,
reported said results (tabulated by the Department of Local Governments and
Community Development) to the Chief Executive, who, accordingly, issued
Proclamation No. 1102.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows, however, that Mr. Cruz was <i style="">not</i><span style=""> </span><i style="">even</i><span style=""> </span><i style="">a</i><span style=""> </span><i style="">member</i><span style=""> </span>of <span style="">any </span>barrio council since 1972, so that he could not possibly
have been a<i> member</i><span style=""> </span>on
January 17, 1973, of a <i style="">municipal</i><span style=""> </span>association of <i style="">presidents</i><span style=""> </span>of
barrio or ward citizens' assemblies, much less of a Provincial, City or
National Association or Federation of <i style="">Presidents</i><span style=""> </span>of any such provincial or city
associations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, at the conclusion of the hearing of these cases on
February 16, 1973, and in the resolution of this Court of the same date, the
Solicitor General was asked to submit, together with his notes on his oral
argument, a true copy of the aforementioned report of Mr. Cruz to the President
and of the "(p)<span class="SpellE">roclamation</span>, decree, instruction,
order, regulation or circular, if any, creating or directing or authorizing the
creation, establishment or organization" of said municipal, provincial and
national associations, but neither a copy of said alleged report to the
President, nor a copy of any said "(p)<span class="SpellE">roclamation</span>,
decree, instruction, order, regulation or circular," has been submitted to
this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of said
report, "(p)<span class="SpellE">roclamation</span>, decree,
instruction," etc., Proclamation No. 1102 is devoid of any <i style="">factual</i><span style=""> </span>and <i style="">legal </i><span style="">foundation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the conclusion set forth in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of said Proclamation No. 1102, to the effect that the proposed new or
revised Constitution had been ratified by the majority of the votes cast by the
people, cannot possibly have any legal effect or value.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The theory that said
proclamation is "conclusive" upon the Court is clearly
untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it were, acts of the
Executive and those of Congress could not possibly be annulled or invalidated
by courts of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, such is not
the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, even a resolution of

is squarely in point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"As the
Constitution stood from the organization of the state" - of <span class="SpellE">Minnessota</span> - "all taxes were required to be raised
under the system known as the 'general property tax.' Dissatisfaction with the
results of this method and the development of more scientific and satisfactory
methods of raising revenue induced the Legislature to submit to the people an
amendment to the Constitution which provided merely that taxes shall be uniform
upon the same class of subjects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
proposed amendment was submitted at the general election held in November 1906
and in due time it was <i style="">certified</i><span style=""> </span>by the state canvassing board and
proclaimed by the Governor as having been legally adopted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting upon the assumption that the amendment
had become part of the Constitution, the Legislature enacted statutes providing
for a State Tax Commission and a mortgage registry tax, and the latter statute,
upon the same theory, was held constitutional" by said Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The district court found that the

<p class="BODY">Even counsel for Gil J. <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> and Jose

other respondents in these cases, the burden of proving such defense which, if
true, should be within their, peculiar knowledge — is clearly on such
respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, if despite the
extensive notes and documents submitted by the parties herein, the members of
the Court do not know or are not prepared to say whether or not the majority of
the people or of those who took part in the Citizens' Assemblies have assented
to the proposed Constitution, the logical step would be to give due course to
these cases, require the respondents to file their answers, and the plaintiffs
their reply, and, thereafter, to receive the pertinent evidence and then
proceed to the determination of the issues raised thereby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, we would be placing upon the
petitioners the burden of disproving a defense set up by the respondents, who
have <i style=""><span style="">not so far</span></i><span style=""> </span>established the truth of such defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even more important, and decisive, than the foregoing is the
circumstance that there is ample reason to believe that many, if not most, of
the people did not know that the Citizens' Assemblies were, at the time they
were held, plebiscites for the ratification or rejection of the proposed
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, in Our decision in
the plebiscite cases, We said, <i><span style="">inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></span></i><span style="">:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Meanwhile, or on <st1:date year="1972" day="17" month="12">December
 17, 1972</st1:date>, the President had issued an order temporarily suspending
the effects of Proclamation No. 1081, for the purpose of free and open debate
on the Proposed Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
December 23, the President announced the postponement of the plebiscite for the
ratification or rejection of the Proposed Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No formal action to this effect was taken
until January 7, 1973, when General Order No. 20 was issued, directing 'that
the plebiscite scheduled to be held on January 15, 1973, be postponed until
further notice.' Said General Order No. 20, moreover, 'suspended in the
meantime' the 'order of <st1:date year="1972" day="17" month="12">December 17,
 1972</st1:date>, temporarily suspending the effects of Proclamation No. 1081
for purposes of free and open debate on the proposed Constitution.'</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"</span><i style="">In view of these events relative to the
postponement of the aforementioned plebiscite, the Court deemed it fit to
refrain, for the time being, from deciding the aforementioned cases, for
neither the date nor the conditions under which said plebiscite would be held
were known or announced officially.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then, again, Congress was, pursuant to the 1935 Constitution, scheduled
to meet in regular session on January 22, 1973, and since the main objection to
Presidential Decree No. 73 was that the President does not have the legislative
authority to call a plebiscite and appropriate funds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
which Congress unquestionably could do, particularly in view of the formal
postponement of the plebiscite by the President – reportedly after consultation
with, among others the leaders of Congress and the Commission on Elections –
the Court deemed it more imperative to defer its final action on these cases</i><span style="">."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">And, apparently, the
parties in said cases entertained the </span><span style="">same belief, for, on December 23, 1972 — four (4) days after the last
hearing of said cases</span><a style="" href="#_ftn76" name="_ftnref76" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the President announced the </span><i style="">postponement</i><span style=""> </span><span style="">of the plebiscite
scheduled by Presidential Decree No. 73 to be held on January 15, 1973, after
consultation with the Commission on Elections and the leaders of Congress,
owing to doubts on the sufficiency of the time available to translate the
proposed Constitution into some local dialects and to comply with some
pre-electoral requirements, as well as to afford the people a reasonable
opportunity to be posted on the contents and implications of said transcendental
document.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1973" day="7" month="1"><span style="">January 7, 1973</span></st1:date><span style="">, General Order No. 20 was issued formally,
postponing said plebiscite "under further notice." How can said </span><i style="">postponement</i><span style=""> </span><span style="">be reconciled with the
theory that the proceedings in the Citizens' Assemblies scheduled to be held
from January 10 to January 15, 1973, were "plebiscites," in effect, </span><i style="">accelerated</i><span style="">, </span><span style="">according to the
theory of the Solicitor General, for the ratification of the proposed
Constitution?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If said Assemblies were
meant to be the plebiscites or elections envisaged in Art. XV of the
Constitution, what, then, was the "plebiscite" </span><i style="">postponed</i><span style=""> </span><span style="">by General Order No.
20?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances, it was
only reasonable for the people who attended such assemblies to believe that the
same were not an "election" or plebiscite for the ratification or
adoption of said proposed Constitution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">And, this belief is
further bolstered up by the questions propounded in the Citizens' Assemblies,

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To begin with, questions
nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10 and 11 are not proper in a plebiscite for the
ratification of a proposed Constitution or of a proposed amendment
thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, neither is the
language of question No. 7 — "Do you approve of the new Constitution?
" One approves "of" the act of another, which does <i style="">not</i><span style=""> </span>need such approval for the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of said act, which the first person, however, finds to be good, wise or
satisfactory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The approval of the majority
of the votes cast in a plebiscite is, however, <i style="">essential</i><span style=""> </span>for an
amendment to the Constitution to be valid as part thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thirdly, if the proceedings in the Citizens'
Assemblies constituted a plebiscite, question No. 8 would have been </span>unnecessary
and improper, regardless of whether question No. 7 were answered affirmatively
or negatively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the majority of the
answers to question No. 7 were in the affirmative the proposed Constitution
would have become effective and no other plebiscite could be held thereafter in
connection therewith, even if the majority of the answers to question No. 8
were, also, in the affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
majority of the answers to question No. 7 were in the negative, neither may
another plebiscite be held, even if the majority of the answers to question No.
8 were in the affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In either
case, not more than <i style=""><span style="">one</span></i><span style=""> </span>plebiscite could be held for the
ratification or rejection of the proposed Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, the insertion of said two (2)
questions — apart from the other questions adverted to above — indicate
strongly that the proceedings therein did <i style=""><span style="">not</span></i><span style=""> </span>partake of the nature of <span style="">a </span>plebiscite or election for the
ratification or rejection of the proposed Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, I can not, in good conscience, declare that the proposed
Constitution has been approved or adopted by the people in the citizens'
assemblies all over the Philippines, when it is, to my mind, a matter of
judicial knowledge that there have been <i style=""><span style="">no</span></i><span style=""> </span>such citizens' assemblies in <i style=""><span style="">many</span></i><span style=""> </span>parts of

<p class="BODY">This communication manifestly shows: 1) that, as late as January

changing instructions from the top on how to organize the citizens' assemblies,
what to do therein and even what questions or topics to propound or touch in
said assemblies; 2) that the assemblies would involve no more than <i style="">consulta­tions</i><span style=""> </span>or dialogues between people and government — not <i style="">decisions</i><span style=""> </span>to be made <i style="">by the people</i><span style="">; </span>and 3) that said consultations were
aimed only at "shaping up <i style="">government
policies</i><span style="">" </span>and, hence,
could not, and did not, partake of the nature of a plebiscite for the
ratification or rejection of a proposed amendment of a new or revised
Constitution, for the latter does not entail the formulation of a <i style="">policy </i><i style=""><span style="">of the Government</span></i><span style="">, </span>but the

wish to have, once the proposed Constitution shall have been ratified.</p>

<p class="BODY">If this was the situation in <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> —
one of the province nearest to Manila — as late as January 11, 1973, one can

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 22.5pt;"><i>Have the
people acquiesced in the proposed Constitution?<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">It is urged that the present Government of the Philippines is now
and has been run, since January 17, 1973, under the Constitution drafted by the
1971 Constitutional Convention; that the political department of the Government
has recognized said revised Constitution; that our foreign relations are being
conducted under such new or revised Constitution; that the Legislative
Department has recognized the same; and that the people, in general, have, by
their acts or omissions, indicated their conformity thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the so-called political organs of the Government, I
gather that respondents refer mainly to the offices under the Executive Department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a sense, the latter performs some
functions which, from a constitutional viewpoint, are political in nature, such
as in recognizing a new state or government, in accepting diplomatic
representatives accredited to our Government, and even in devising
administrative means and ways to better carry into effect Acts of Congress
which define the goals or objectives thereof, but are either imprecise or
silent on the particular measures to be resorted to in order to achieve the
said goals or delegate the power to do so, expressly or impliedly, to the
Executive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, notwithstanding, the
political organ of a government that purports to be republican is essentially
the Congress or Legislative Department.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whatever may be the functions allocated to the Executive Department —
specially under a written, rigid Constitution, with a republican system of
Government like ours — the role of that Department is inherently, basically and
fundamentally <i style=""><span style="">executive</span></i><span style=""> in </span>nature — to "take care that the laws be faithfully
executed," in the language of our 1935 Constitution.<a style="" href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, I am not prepared to concede that the acts of the
officers and offices of the Executive Department, in line with Proclamation No.
1102, connote a recognition thereof or an acquiescence thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether they recognized the proposed
Constitution or acquiesce thereto or <i style="">not</i><span style=""> </span>is something that cannot legally,
much less necessarily or even normally, be deduced from their acts in accordance
therewith, because they are <i style="">bound</i><span style=""> </span>to obey and act in conformity with
the orders of the President, under whose "control" they are, <i style="">pursuant to the 1935 Constitution</i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>They
have absolutely <i style="">no</i><span style=""> </span><i style="">other</i><span style=""> </span><i style="">choice</i><span style="">, </span>specially in view of Proclamation
No. 1081 placing the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
under Martial Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, by virtue of
the very decrees, orders and instructions issued by the President thereafter,
he had assumed <i style="">all</i><span style=""> </span>powers of Government — although some
question his authority to do so — and, consequently, there is hardly anything
he has done since the issuance of Proclamation No. 1102, on January 17, 1973 —
declaring that the Constitution proposed by the 1971 Constitutional Convention
has been ratified by the overwhelming majority of the people — that he could
not do under the authority he claimed to have under Martial Law, since
September 21, 1972, except the power of supervision over inferior courts and
its personnel, which said proposed Constitution would place under the Supreme
Court, and which the President has not ostensibly exercised, except as to some
minor routine matters, which the Department of Justice has continued to handle,
this Court having preferred to maintain the <i style="">status
quo</i><span style=""> </span>in connection therewith
pending final determination of these cases, in which the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of the aforementioned Constitution is disputed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, again, a given department of the Government cannot
generally be said to have "recognized" <i style="">its own</i><span style="">, </span>acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Recognition
normally connotes the acknowledgment by a party of the acts of <i style="">another</i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, when a
subordinate officer or office of the Government complies with the commands of </span>a
<span style="">superior officer or office, under whose
supervision and control he or it is, the former merely <i style="">obeys</i><span style=""> </span>the
latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Strictly speaking, and from a
legal and constitutional viewpoint, there is no act of recognition involved
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the lower officer or
office, if he or it acted otherwise, would just be guilty of insubordination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the Governor; the Legislature — not merely by individual acts of its members,

</span>In the cases under consideration, <span style="">the

whereas the validity of </span>Proclamation No. 1102 declaring on January 17,
1973, that the proposed Constitution had been ratified – despite General Order
No. 20, issued on January 7, 1972, formally and officially suspending the <span style="">plebiscite until further notice was impugned

<p class="BODY">It is further alleged that a majority of the members of our House

<p class="BODY">Indeed, if the members of Congress were generally agreeable to
the proposed Constitution, why did it become necessary to padlock its premises
to prevent its meeting in session on <st1:date year="1973" day="22" month="1">January
 22, 1973</st1:date>, and thereafter as provided in the 1935 Constitution?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that, theoretically, the members
of Congress, if bent on discharging their functions under said Constitution,
could have met in any other place, the building in which they perform their
duties being immaterial to the legality of their official acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The force of this argument is, however,
offset or dissipated by the fact that, on or about December 27, 1972, immediately
after a conference between the Executive, on the one hand, and members of
Congress, on the other, some of whom expressed the wish to meet in session on
January 22, 1973, as provided in the 1935 Constitution, a Daily Express
columnist (<span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> <span class="SpellE">Mijares</span>)
attributed to Presidential Assistant Guillermo de Vega a statement to the
effect that " 'certain members of the Senate appear to be missing the
point in issue' when they reportedly <i style="">insisted
on taking up first the question of convening Congress</i><span style="">." </span>The Daily Express of that
date,<a style="" href="#_ftn82" name="_ftnref82" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup></span></span></a>
likewise, headlined, on its front page, a "Senatorial <i style="">Plot</i><span style=""> </span>Against
'Martial Law Government' Disclosed." Then, in its issue of <st1:date year="1972" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1972</st1:date>, the same paper
imputed to the Executive an appeal "to diverse groups involved in a <i style="">conspiracy</i><span style=""> </span>to undermine" his powers "under martial law to <i style="">desist from provoking </i><span style="">a constitutional crisis * * * </span><i style="">which may result in the exercise by me of
authority which I have not exercised.</i><span style="">"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">No matter how good the intention behind these statements may have
been, the idea implied therein was too clear and <i style="">ominous</i><span style=""> </span>for any
member of Congress who thought of organizing, holding or taking part in a
session of Congress, not to get the impression that he could hardly do so
without inviting or risking the application of Martial Law to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these conditions, I do not feel
justified in holding that the failure of the members of Congress to meet since <st1:date year="1973" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1973</st1:date>, was due to their
recognition, acquiescence in or conformity with the provisions of the aforementioned
Constitution, or its alleged ratification.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the same reasons, especially because of Proclama­tion No.
1081, placing the entire Philippines under Martial Law, neither am I prepared
to declare that the people's inaction as regards Proclamation No. 1102, and
their compliance with a number of Presidential orders, decrees and/or
instructions — some or many of which have admittedly had salutary effects —
issued subsequently thereto amounts, constitutes or attests to a ratification,
adoption or approval of said Proclamation No. 1102. In the words of the Chief
Executive, "martial law connotes <i style=""><span style="">power of the gun</span></i><span style="">, </span>meant <i style=""><span style="">coercion</span></i><span style=""> </span>by the
military, and <i style=""><span style="">compulsion </span></i><span style="">and</span><i style=""> </i><i style=""><span style="">intimidation</span></i><span style="">."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn83" name="_ftnref83" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">The </span>failure to use the gun
against those who <i style=""><span style="">comply</span></i><span style=""> </span>with the orders of the party wielding the weapon does not
detract from the intimidation that Martial Law necessarily connotes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may reflect the good, reasonable and
wholesome attitude of the person who has the gun, either pointed at others,
without pulling the trigger, or merely kept in its holster, but not without
warning that he may or would use it if he deemed it necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still, the intimidation is there, and
inaction or obedience of the people, under these conditions, is not necessarily
an act of conformity or acquiescence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is specially so when we consider that the masses are, by and large,
<i style=""><span style="">unfamiliar</span></i><span style=""> </span>with the
parliamentary system, the new form of government introduced in the proposed
Constitution, with the particularity that it is <i style=""><span style="">not</span></i><span style=""> </span><i style=""><span style="">even</span></i><span style=""> </span><i style=""><span style="">identical</span></i><span style=""> </span>to that
existing in England and other parts of the world, and that <i style=""><span style="">even</span></i><span style=""> </span><i style=""><span style="">experienced
lawyers and social scientists</span></i><span style=""> </span>find it difficult to grasp the full
implications of some provisions incorporated therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the applicability to these cases of the "enrolled
bill" rule, it is well to remember that the same refers to a document
certified to the President — for his action under the Constitution — by the
Senate President and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and attested
to by the Secretary of the Senate and the Secretary of the House of
Representatives, concerning legislative measures approved by the two Houses of
Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The argument of the Solicitor
General is, roughly, this: If the enrolled bill is entitled to full faith and
credence and, to this extent, it is conclusive upon the President and the
judicial branch of the Government, why should Proclamation No. 1102 merit less
consideration than an enrolled bill?</p>

<p class="BODY">Before answering this question, I would like to ask the
following: If, instead of being certified by the aforementioned officers of
Congress, the so-called enrolled bill were certified by, say, the President of
the Association of Sugar Planters and/or Millers of the Philippines, and the
measure in question were a proposed legislation concerning Sugar Plantations
and Mills sponsored by said Association, which even prepared the draft of said
legislation, as well as lobbied actually for its approval, for which reason the
officers of the Association, particularly its aforementioned president – whose
honesty and integrity are unquestionable – were present at the deliberations in
Congress when the same approved the proposed legislation, would the enrolled
bill rule apply thereto?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely, the a<span style="">nswer </span>would
have to be in the negative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Simply because said Association President has
absolutely no official authority to perform in connection therewith, and,
hence, his certification is, legally, as good as non-existent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, a certification, if any, of the Secretary of the Department
of Local Governments and Community Develop­ment about the tabulated results of
the voting in the Citizens' Assemblies allegedly <i style=""><span style="">held all over</span></i><span style=""> </span>the
Philippines – and the records do <i style=""><span style="">not</span></i><span style=""> </span>show that any such certification,
either to the President of the Philippines or to the President of the
Federation or National Association of presidents of <span style="">Provincial Associations of presidents of municipal associations of
presidents of barrio or ward assemblies of citizens — would not, legally and
constitutionally, be worth the paper on which it is written.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because said Department Secretary is </span><i style="">not</i><span style=""> </span><span style="">the officer designated by law to superintend
plebiscites or elections held for the ratification or rejection of a proposed
amendment or revision of the Constitution and, hence, to tabulate the results
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse still, it is the officer
or department which, according to Article X of the 1935 Constitution, should </span><i style="">not</i><span style=""> </span><span style="">and must </span><span style="">not </span><span style="">be allowed to participate in said plebiscite — if plebiscite there was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Before attempting </span>to
answer this question, a few words <span style="">must </span>be
said about the procedure followed in these five (5) cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, it should be noted that
the Court has not as yet decided whether or not to give due course to the
petitions herein or to require the respondents to answer thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, it has required the respondents to
comment on the respective petitions — with three (3) members of the Court
voting to dismiss them outright and then considered the comments thus submitted
by the respondents as motions to dismiss, as well as set the same for
hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was due to the
transcendental nature of the main issue raised, the necessity of deciding the
same with utmost dispatch, and the main defense set up by respondents herein,
namely, the alleged political nature of said issue, placing the same, according
to respondents, beyond the ambit of judicial inquiry and determination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this defense was sustained, the cases
could readily be dismissed; but, owing to the importance of the questions
involved, a reasoned resolution was demanded by public interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the same time, respondents had cautioned
against a judicial inquiry into the merits of the issues posed on account of
the magnitude of the evil consequences, it was claimed, which would result from
a decision thereon, if adverse to the Government.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a matter of fact, some of those issues had been raised in the
plebiscite cases, which were dismissed as moot and academic, owing to the
issuance of Proclamation No. 1102 subsequently to the filing of said cases,
although before the rendition of judgment therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still one of the members of the Court (Justice
<span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>) was of the opinion that the aforementioned
issues should he settled in said cases, and he, accordingly, filed an opinion
passing upon the merits thereof. On the other hand, three (3) members of the
Court – Justices <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, Antonio and <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> – filed separate opinions favorable to the
respondents in the plebiscite cases, Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>
holding "that the 1935 Constitution has pro <span class="SpellE">tanto</span>
passed into history and has been legitimately supplanted by the Constitution in
force by virtue of Proclamation 1102."<a style="" href="#_ftn86" name="_ftnref86" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup></span></span></a>
When the petitions at bar <span style="">were </span>filed,
the same three (3) members of the Court, consequently, voted for the dismissal
of said petitions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The majority of the
members of the Court did not share, however, either <span style="">view, </span>believing that the main question that arose before the
rendition of said judgment had not been sufficiently discussed and argued as
the nature and importance thereof demanded.</p>

<p class="BODY">The parties in the cases at bar were accordingly given every
possible opportunity to do so and to elucidate on and discuss said
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, apart from hearing the
parties in oral argument for five (5) consecutive days — morning and afternoon,
or a total of exactly 26 hours and 31 minutes — their respective counsel filed
extensive notes on their oral arguments, as well as on such additional
arguments as they wished to submit, and reply notes or memoranda, in addition
to rejoinders thereto, aside from a sizeable number of documents in support of
their respective contentions, or as required by the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The arguments, oral and written, submitted
have been so extensive and exhaustive, and the documents filed in support
thereof so numerous and bulky, that, for all intents and purposes, the
situation is as if — disregarding forms the petitions had been given due course
and the cases had been submitted for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the majority of the members of the Court believe
that they should express their views on the aforementioned issues as if the
same were being decided on the merits, and they have done so in their
individual opinions attached hereto.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the resume of the votes cast and the tenor of the resolution, in
the last pages hereof, despite the fact that technically the Court has not, as
yet, formally given due course to the petitions herein.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">And, now, here are <i style=""><span style="">my</span></i><span style=""> </span>views on
the <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> sought by the parties.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">In L-36165, it is clear that we should not issue the writ of <i>mandamus</i>
prayed for against Gil J. <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> and Jose Roy, as
President and President Pro Tempore respectively of the Senate, it being settled
in our jurisdiction, based upon the theory of separation of powers, that the
judiciary will not issue such writ to the head of a co-equal department, like
the aforementioned officers of the Senate.</p>

<p class="BODY">In all other respects and with regard to the other respondents in
said case, as well as in cases L-36142, L-36164, L-36236 and L-36283, my vote
is that the petitions therein should be given due course, there being more than
<i style=""><span style="">prima
facie</span></i><span style=""> </span>showing that the proposed Constitution has not been ratified in
accordance with Article XV of the 1935 Constitution, either strictly or
substantially, or has been acquiesced in by the people or a majority thereof;
that said proposed Constitution is <i>not </i><i><span style="">in force</span></i><span style=""> </span>and effect; and that the 1935 Constitution is still the
Fundamental Law of the Land, without prejudice to the submission of said
proposed Constitution to the people at a plebiscite for its ratification or
rejection in accordance with Articles V, X and XV of the 1935 Constitution and
the provisions of the Revised Election Code in force at the time of such
plebiscite.</p>

<p class="BODY">Perhaps others would feel that my position in these cases
overlooks what they might consider to be the demands of "judicial
statesmanship," whatever may be the meaning of such phrase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am aware of this possibility, if not
probability; but "judicial statesmanship," though <i style=""><span style="">consistent</span></i><span style=""> </span>with Rule
of Law, <i style=""><span style="">cannot prevail</span></i><span style=""> </span>over the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among consistent ends or <span style="">consistent values, there always is a
hierarchy, a rule of priority.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We must realize that the
New Society has many achievements which would have been very difficult, if not
impossible, to accomplish under the old dispensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, <i style="">in
and for the judiciary, statesmanship</i><span style="">
should </span>not prevail over the Rule of Law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, <i style="">the primacy of the law or
of the Rule of law and faithful adherence thereto are basic, fundamental and
essential parts of statesmanship itself.</i><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: left;" align="left"><i>Resume of the Votes
Cast and the Court's Resolution<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As earlier stated, after
the submittal by the members of the Court of their individual opinions and/or
concurrences as appended hereto, the writer will now make, with the concurrence
of his colleagues, a resume or summary of the votes cast by each of them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It should be stated that by virtue of the various approaches and
views expressed during the deliberations, it was agreed to synthesize the basic
issues at bar in broad general terms in five questions for purposes of taking
the votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was further agreed of
course that each member of the Court would expound in his individual opinion
and/or concurrence his own approach to the stated issues and deal with them and
state (or not) his opinion thereon singly or jointly and with such priority,
qualifications and modifications as he may deem proper, as well as discuss
thereon other related issues which he may consider vital and relevant to the
cases at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">The five questions thus agreed upon as reflecting the basic
issues herein involved are the following:</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is the issue of the
validity of Proclamation No. 1102 a <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>, or
political and therefore non-<span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>, question?</p>

<p class="NUM">2. Has the Constitution proposed by the 1971 Constitutional
Convention been ratified validly (with substantial, if not strict, compliance)
conformably to the applicable constitutional and statutory provisions?</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Has the aforementioned
proposed Constitution been acquiesced in (with or without valid ratification)
by the people?</p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Are petitioners entitled
to relief?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And</p>

<p class="NUM">Is the aforementioned proposed Constitution in force?</p>

<p class="BODY">The results of the voting, premised on the individual views
expressed by the members of the Court in their respective opinions and/or
concurrences, are as follows:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. On the first issue involving the political-question doctrine,
Justices <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>,
Castro, Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span> and myself, or six (6)
members of the Court, hold that the issue of the validity of Proclamation No.
1102 presents a <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> and non-political
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justices <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>
and Castro did not vote squarely on this question, but, only inferentially, in
their discussion of the second question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> qualified his vote, stating
that "inasmuch as it is claimed that there has been approval by the
people, the Court may inquire into the question of whether or not there has
actually been such an approval, and, in the affirmative, the Court should keep
its hands-off out of respect to the people's will, but, in the negative, the
Court may determine from both factual and legal angles whether or not Article
XV of the 1935 Constitution has been complied with." Justices <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span>, Antonio and <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>,
or three (3) members of the Court hold that the issue is political and
"beyond the ambit of judicial inquiry."</p>

<p class="NUM">2. On the second question of validity of the ratification,
Justices <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>,
Castro, Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span> and myself, or six (6)
members of the Court also hold that the Constitution proposed by the 1971
Constitutional Convention was not validly ratified in accordance with Article
XV, section 1 of the 1935 Constitution, which provides only one way for
ratification, i.e., "in an election or plebiscite held in accordance with
law and participated in only by qualified and duly registered voters."<a style="" href="#_ftn87" name="_ftnref87" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> qualified his vote,
stating that "(A)s to whether or not the 1973 Constitution has been
validly ratified pursuant to Article XV, I still maintain that in the light of
traditional concepts regarding the meaning and intent of said Article, the
referendum in the Citizens' Assemblies, specially in the manner the votes
therein were cast, reported and canvassed, falls short of the requirements
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view, however, of the fact
that I have no means of refusing to recognize as a judge that factually there
was voting and that the majority of the votes were for considering as approved
the 1973 Constitution without the necessity of the usual form of plebiscite
followed in past ratifications, I am constrained to hold that, in the political
sense, if not in the orthodox legal sense, the people may be deemed to have
cast their favorable votes in the belief that in doing so they did the part
required of them by Article XV, hence, it may be said that in its political
aspect, which is what counts most, after all, said Article has been
substantially complied with, and, in effect, the 1973 Constitution has been
constitutionally ratified."</p>

<p class="BODY">Justices <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span>, Antonio and <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>, or three (3) members of the Court hold that under
their view there has been in effect substantial compliance with the
constitutional requirements for valid ratification.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. On the third question of acquiescence by the Filipino people in
the aforementioned proposed Constitution, no majority vote has been reached by
the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Four (4) of its members, namely, Justices <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span>, Antonio and <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>
hold that "the people have already accepted the 1973 Constitution."<a style="" href="#_ftn88" name="_ftnref88" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Two (2) members of the Court, namely, Justice <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>
and myself hold that there can be no free expression, and there has even been
no expression, by the people qualified to vote all over the Philippines, of
their acceptance or repudiation of the proposed Constitution under Martial
Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justice Fernando states that
"(I)f it is conceded that the doctrine stated in some American decisions
to the effect that independently of the validity of the ratification, a new Constitution
once accepted or acquiesced in by the people must be accorded recognition by
the Court, I am not at this stage prepared to state that such doctrine calls
for application in view of the shortness of time that has elapsed and the
difficulty of ascertaining what is the mind of the people in the absence of the
freedom of debate that is a concomitant feature of martial law."</p>

<p class="BODY">Three (3) members of the Court express their lack of knowledge
and/or competence to rule on the question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Justices <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span> and Castro are joined by
Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span> in their statement that "Under
a regime of martial law, with the free expression of opinions through the usual
<span style="">media vehicles restricted, (they) have
no means of knowing, to the point of judicial certainty, whether the people
have accepted the Constitution."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn89" name="_ftnref89" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

namely, Justices <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, Castro, <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span>, Antonio and <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> voted to DISMISS the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justices <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>
and Castro so voted on the strength of their view that "(T)he <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the said Constitution, in the final
analysis, is the basic and ultimate question posed by these cases to resolve
which considerations other than judicial, and therefore beyond the competence

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BARREDO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">As far as I am concerned, I regard the present petitions as no
more than mere reiterations of the Supplemental Petitions filed by Counsel
Lorenzo M. <span class="SpellE">Tañada</span> on <st1:date year="1973" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1973</st1:date> in the so-called Plebiscite Cases decided
by this Court on <st1:date year="1973" day="22" month="1">January <span style="">22, 1973</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of </span>course,
there are amplifications of some of the grounds previously alleged, and in the
course of the unprecedented five-day hearing that was held from February 12, to
16 last, more extensive and illuminating arguments were heard by Us, but, in my
estimation, and with due recognition of the sincerity, brilliance and eloquence
of counsels, nothing more cogent and compelling than what had already been
previously presented by Counsel <span class="SpellE">Tañada</span> is before Us
now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I cannot see any
reason why I should change the position I took in regard to the earlier
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I reiterate, therefore, the vote
I cast when these petitions were initially considered by the Court, namely, to
dismiss them.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view, however, of the transcendental importance of the issues
before the Court and the significance to our people and in history of the
individual stands of the members of the Court in relation to said issues and to
the final outcome of these cases, and considering that I reserved before the
filing of a more extended opinion, I will take this opportunity to explain
further why I hold that the 1973 Constitution is already in force, if only to
clarify that apart from the people's right of revolution to which I made
pointed reference in my previous opinion, I can see now, after further
reflection, that the vote of the people in the referendum in the Citizens
Assemblies held on January 10 to 15, 1973, upon the result of which
Proclamation 1102 is based, may be viewed more importantly as a political act
than as a purely legal one, with the result that such vote to consider the 1973
Constitution as ratified without the necessity of holding a plebiscite in the
form followed in the previous ratification plebiscites in 1935 of the
Constitution it<span style="">s</span>elf, 1937 of
women's suffrage, 1939 of the amendments to the Ordinance Appended to the
Constitution, 1940 of the re-election of the President, the bicameral
legislature and the Commission on Elections, 1947 of the parity amendment and
1967, rejecting the proposed increase in the members of the House of
Representatives and eligibility of members of Congress to the Constitutional
Convention, may be deemed as a valid ratification substantially in compliance
with the basic intent of Article XV of the 1935 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If indeed this explanation may be considered
as a modification of my rationalization then, I wish to emphasize that my
position as to the fundamental issue regarding the enforceability of the new
Constitution is even firmer now than ever before. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>As I shall elucidate anon, paramount
considerations of national import have led me to the conviction that the best
interests of all concerned would be best served by the Supreme Court holding
that the 1973 Constitution is now in force, not necessarily as a consequence of
the revolutionary concept previously suggested by me, but upon the ground that
as a political, more than as a legal, act of the people, the result of the
referendum may be construed as a compliance with the substantiality of Article
XV of the 1935 Constitution.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts that gave rise to these proceedings are historical and
well known.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Generally, they may be taken
judicial notice of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They revolve around
the purported ratification of the Constitution of 1973 declared in Proclamation
1102 issued by the President on <st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="1">January
 17, 1973</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to a joint resolution of the Congress sitting as a
constituent assembly approved on <st1:date year="1967" day="16" month="3">March
 16, 1967</st1:date>, delegates to a constitutional convention to propose
amendments to the Constitution of 1935 were elected in accordance with the
implementing law, Republic Act 6132, on <st1:date year="1970" day="10" month="11">November 10, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Known as the Constitutional Convention of 1971, the assembly began its
sessions on <st1:date year="1971" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1971</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After encountering a lot of difficulties, due
to bitter rivalries over important positions and committees and an
incomprehensible fear of <span class="SpellE">overconcentrating</span> powers in
their officers, the delegates went about their work in comparatively slow pace,
and by the third quarter of 1972 had finished deliberations and second-reading
voting only on an insignificant number of proposals — until September 21, 1972,
when the President, not altogether unexpectedly, yet abruptly, issued
Proclamation 1081 declaring martial law throughout the country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An attempt was made to have the Convention recessed
until after the lifting of martial law, and not long after the motion of
Delegate <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span> to such effect was turned down, the
activities within the assembly shifted to high gear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As if unmindful of the arrest and continued
detention of several of its members, the convention gathered swift momentum in
its work, and on <st1:date year="1972" day="30" month="11">November 30, 1972</st1:date>,
it approved by overwhelming vole the draft of a complete constitution, instead
of mere specific amendments of particular portions of the Constitution of
1935.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to say, before martial
law was declared, there was full and unlimited coverage of the workings in the
convention by the mass media.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
same time, public debates and discussions on various aspects of proposed amendments
were not uncommon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Earlier, on <st1:date year="1972" day="22" month="11">November
 22, 1972</st1:date>, the Convention had approved Resolution No.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>5843 proposing "to President Ferdinand
E. Marcos that a decree be issued calling a plebiscite for the ratification of
the proposed new Constitution on such appropriate date as he shall determine
and providing for the necessary funds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>."
Acting under this authority, on <st1:date year="1972" day="1" month="12">December
 1, 1972</st1:date>, the President issued Presidential Decree No.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>73 submitting the draft constitution for
ratification by the people at a plebiscite set for <st1:date year="1973" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This order contained provisions more or less similar to the plebiscite
laws passed by Congress relative to the past plebiscites held in connection
with previous proposed amendments.</p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with the plebiscite thus contemplated, General
Order No. 17 was issued ordering and enjoining the authorities to allow and
encourage public and free discussions on the proposed constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only this, subsequently, under date of
December 17, 1972, the President ordered the suspension of the effects of martial
law and lifted the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus
insofar as activities connected with the ratification of the draft constitution
were concerned. These two orders were not, however, to last very long.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On January 7, 1973, the President, invoking
information related to him that the area of public debate and discussion he had
opened by his previous orders was being taken advantage of by subversive
elements to defeat the purposes for which they were issued and to foment public
confusion, withdrew said orders and enjoined full and stricter implementation
of martial law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the meantime, the
President had issued on December 31, 1972 Presidential Decree No. 86 creating
Citizens Assemblies "so as to afford ample opportunities for the citizenry
to express their views on important national issues" and one of the
questions presented to said assemblies was:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Do you like the plebiscite on the proposed Constitution to be held
later" So, in the same order of January 7, 1973, General Order No. 20, the
President ordered, "that the plebiscite scheduled to be held on January
15, 1973, be postponed until further notice."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the meanwhile also, on
</span><st1:date year="1973" day="5" month="1"><span style="">January 5, 1973</span></st1:date><span style="">,
the President issued Presidential Decree No. 86-A providing as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>WHEREAS, on the basis of preliminary and initial reports from the
field as gathered from <span class="SpellE">barangays</span> (citizens
assemblies) that have so far been established, the people would like to decide
for themselves questions or issues, both local and national, affecting their
day-to-day lives and their future;</blockquote>

the people on important national issues;</blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREAS, such <span class="SpellE">barangays</span> (citizens

constituting the genuine, legitimate and valid expression of the popular will;
and</blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREAS, the people would like the citizens assemblies to conduct
immediately a referendum on certain specified questions such as the
ratification of the new Constitution, continuance of martial law, the convening
of Congress on January 22, 1973, and the elections in November 1973 pursuant to
the 1935 Constitution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>NOW, THEREFORE, I, FERDINAND E. MARCOS, President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
by virtue of the powers vested in me by the Constitution as Commander-in-Chief
of all Armed Forces of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,

<blockquote>1. The present <span class="SpellE">barangays</span> (citizens assemblies) are created under
Presidential Decree No. 86 dated December 31, 1972, shall constitute the base
for citizen participation in governmental affairs and their collective views
shall be considered in the formulation of national policies or programs and,
wherever practicable, shall be translated into concrete and specific decision;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. Such <span class="SpellE">barangays</span> (citizens assemblies) shall consider vital
national issues now confronting the country, like the holding of the plebiscite
on the new Constitution, the continuation of martial rule, the convening of
Congress on January 22, 1973, and the holding of elections in November 1973,
and others in the future, which shall serve as guide or basis for action or
decision by the national government;</blockquote>

those specified in paragraph 2 hereof, and submit the results thereof to the Department
of Local Governments and Community Development immediately thereafter, pursuant
to the express will of the people as reflected in the reports gathered from the
many thousands of <span class="SpellE">barangays</span> (citizens assemblies)
throughout the country.</blockquote>

take effect immediately.</blockquote>

this 5th day of January, in the year of Our Lord, nineteen hundred and

on </span><st1:date year="1973" day="7" month="1"><span style="">January 7, 1973</span></st1:date><span style="">,
this was followed by Presidential Decree No. 86-B reading thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>WHEREAS, since their creation pursuant to Presidential Decree No.
86 dated December 31, 1972, the <span class="SpellE">Barangays</span> (Citizens

resolution important national issues;</blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREAS, one of the questions persistently mentioned refers to the
ratification of the Constitution proposed by the 1971 Constitutional
Convention;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, on the basis of the said petitions, it is evident
that the people believe that the submission of the proposed Constitution to the
Citizens Assemblies or <span class="SpellE">Barangays</span> should be taken as a
plebiscite in itself in view of the fact that freedom of debate has always been
limited to the leadership in political, <span style="">economic
</span>and social fields and that it is now necessary to bring this down to the
level of the people themselves through the <span class="SpellE">Barangays</span>
or Citizens Assemblies;</blockquote>

<blockquote>NOW THEREFORE, <span style="">I, </span>FERDINAND
E. MARCOS, President of the Philippines, by virtue of the powers in me vested

time to time be referred to the <span class="SpellE">Barangays</span> (Citizens
Assemblies) for resolution in accordance with Presidential Decree No. 86-A
dated January 5, 1973 and that the initial referendum shall include the matter
of ratification of the Constitution proposed by the <span style="">1971 </span>Constitutional Convention.</blockquote>

running the affairs of the government? "</blockquote>

on </span><st1:date year="1973" day="11" month="1"><span style="">January </span>11, <span style="">1973</span></st1:date><span style="">, six questions were added as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

November, 1973 in accordance with the provisions of the 1935 Constitution?</blockquote>

you want the next elections to be called?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The first attempt to
question the steps just enumerated taken by the President was in the so-called
Plebiscite Cases, ten in number, which were filed by different petitioners
during the first half of December 1972.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Their common target then was Presidential
Decree No. 73, but before the said cases could be decided, the series of moves
tending in effect to make them moot and academic insofar as they referred
exclusively to the said Presidential Decree began to take shape upon the
issuance of Presidential Decree No. 86-A, quoted above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when Presidential Decree No. 86-B, also
above-quoted, was issued and the six additional questions which were first
publicized on January 11, 1973 were known, together with the
"comments", petitioners sensed that a new and unorthodox procedure
was being adopted to secure approval by the people of the new Constitution,
hence Counsel <span class="SpellE">Tañada</span>, not being satisfied with the
fate of his urgent motion for early decision of the above ten cases dated
January 12, 1973, filed on January 15, 1973, his supplemental motion seeking
the prohibition against and injunction of the proceedings going on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Principal objective was to prevent that the
President be furnished the report of the results of the referendum and thereby
disable him from carrying out what petitioners were apprehensively foreseeing
would be done - the issuance of some kind of proclamation, order or decree,
declaring that the new Constitution had been ratified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reacting swiftly, the Court resolved on the
same day, January 15, which was Monday, to consider the supplemental motion as
a supplemental petition and to </span>require the <span style="">respondents to answer the same the next Wednesday, January 17th, before
the hour of the hearing of </span>the petition which was set for <st1:time minute="30" hour="9">9:30 <span style="">o'clock</span></st1:time><span style=""> </span>in the morning of that day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The details of what happened that morning
form part of the recital of facts in the decision rendered by this Court in the
ten cases on <st1:date year="1973" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1973</st1:date>
and <span style="">need not be </span>repeated
here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to state now that
before the <span style="">hearing could be closed and
while Counsel </span><span class="SpellE">Tañada</span> was still insisting on
his prayer for preliminary injunction or restraining order, the Secretary of
Justice arrived and personally handed to the Chief Justice <span style="">a copy of Proclamation 1102 which had been
issued at about 11:00 o'clock that same </span>morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the valiant and persistent
efforts of petitioners and their counsels were overtaken by adverse
developments, and in the mind of the majority of the members of the Court, the
cases had become academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For my part,
I took the view that even on the basis of the supplemental petition and the
answer thereto filed by respondents, the Court could already decide on the
fundamental issue of the validity of Proclama­tion 1102, as Justices <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>, Antonio and <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>
also believed, inasmuch as Counsel <span class="SpellE">Tañada's</span> pleading
and argu­ment had anticipated its issuance, but the majority felt it was not
ready to resolve the matter, for lack, according to them, of full ventilation,
and so, the decision reserved to petitioners the filing of the
"appropriate" cases, evidently, the present ones.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<p class="BODY">At the threshold, I find myself confronted by a matter which,
although believed to be inconsequential by my learned brethren, I strongly feel
needs special attention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I refer to the
point raised by Counsel Arturo M. <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> for respondents
Gil J. <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> and Jose Roy, who have been sued as
President and President Pro Tempore of the Senate, to the effect that the
change in the composition of the Supreme Court provided for in the 1973
Constitution, from the 11-man tribunal under the 1935 Constitution to a 15-man
Court, makes of these cases which were filed after January 17, 1973, the date
when Proclamation 1102 declared the new Constitution as ratified, political in
nature and beyond our jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
main consideration submitted in this connection is that inasmuch as the number
of votes needed for a decision of this Court has been increased from <span style="">six to eight in </span>ordinary
cases and from eight <span style="">to </span>ten for
the declaration of unconstitutionality of a treaty, <span style="">executive agreement</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
or law, the Court would have to resolve first as a prejudicial question whether
the Court is acting in these cases as the 15-man or the 11-man Court, in which
event, it would be faced with the dilemma that if it acts either as the former
or as the latter, it would be prejudging the very matter in issue one way or
the other, and, in effect, it would be choosing between two constitutions,
which is a political determination not within the Court's competence.</p>

<p class="BODY">While I agree that the problem is at first blush rather involved,
I do not share the view that the premises laid down by counsel necessarily
preclude this Court from taking a definite stand on whether the Court is acting
in these cases as the 15-man or the 11-man Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I feel very strongly that the issue should not
be ignored or dodged, if only to make the world know that the Supreme Court of
the Philippines is never incognizant of the capacity in which it <span style="">is </span>acting, much less lacking in courage
or <span style="">wisdom to resolve an issue </span>that
relates directly to its own composition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What a disgrace it would <span style="">be </span>to
admit that this Supreme Court does not know, to use a common apt expression,
whether it is fish or fowl. Withal, scholars and researchers who might go over
our records in the future will inevitably examine minutely how each of us voted
and upon what considerations we have individually acted, and, indeed, doubts
may arise as to whether or not, despite the general result we might announce,
there had been the requisite number of votes for a valid collegiate action.</p>

<p class="BODY">For instance, it may be argued that the present cases do not
involve an issue of unconstitutionality, hence, if we are acting as the 11-man
Court, only six votes would suffice to declare Proclamation 1102 ineffective,
and if upon analysis of our respective opinions it should be inferable <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> that six of us have considered the matter before
the Court as <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> and at the same time have
found the procedure of ratification adopted in Presidential Decrees 86-A and
86-B and related orders of the President as not being in conformity with
Article XV of the old Constitution, a cloud would exist as to the efficacy of
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of Our decision dismissing
these cases, even if we have it understood that by the vote of six justices in
favor of such dismissal, We intended to mean that the implementation or
enforcement of the new Constitution now being done could continue.</p>

<p class="BODY">Be that as it may, I am against leaving such an important point
open to speculation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By nature I am
averse to ambiguity and equivocation, and as a member of the Supreme Court, the
last thing I should knowingly countenance is uncertainty as to the juridical
significance of any decision of the Court which is precisely being looked upon
as the haven in which doubts are supposed to be authoritatively dispelled.
Besides, from the very nature of things, one thing is indubitably beyond
dispute - we cannot act in both capacities of a 15-man and an 11-man Court at
the same time, in like manner that it is inconceivable that the 1935 and 1973
Constitutions can be considered by Us as both in force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our inescapable duty is to make a choice
between them, according to what law and other considerations inherent to our
function- dictate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I cannot bear the
thought that someone may someday say that the Supreme Court of the Philippines
once decided a case without knowing the basis of its authority to act or that
it was ever wanting in judicial courage to define the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, with full consciousness of my limitations but
compelled by my sense of duty and propriety <span style="">to </span>straighten out this grave issue touching on the capacity in
which the Court is acting in these cases, I hold that we have no alternative
but to adopt in the present situation the orthodox rule that when the validity
of an act or law is challenged as being repugnant to a constitutional mandate,
the same is allowed to have effect until the Supreme Court rules that it is
unconstitutional.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated differently, We
have to proceed on the assumption that the new Constitution is in force and that
We are acting in these present cases as the 15-man Supreme Court provided for
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to counsel's
contention, there is here no prejudgment for or against any of the two
constitutions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The truth of the matter
is simply that in the normal and logical conduct of governmental activities, it
is neither practical nor wise to defer the course of any action until after the
courts have ascertained their legality, not only because if that were to be the
rule, the functioning of government would correspondingly be undesirably
hesitative and cumbersome, but more importantly, because the courts must at the
first instance accord due respect to the acts of the other departments, as
otherwise, the smooth running of the government would have to depend entirely
on the unanimity of opinions among all its departments, which is hardly
possible, unless it is assumed <span style="">that </span>only
the judges have the exclusive prerogative of making and enforcing the law,
aside from being its sole interpreter, which is contrary to all norms of
juridical and political thinking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To my
knowledge, there <span style="">is </span>yet no
country in the <span style="">world that has
recognized judicial supremacy as </span>its basic <span style="">governmental principle, </span>no matter how desirable we might <span style="">believe the idea to be.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, it is not hard to visualize the difficulty if not
absurdity of Our acting on the assumption that this Court is still functioning
under the 1935 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is undeniable
that the whole government, including the provincial, municipal and barrio units
and not excluding the lower courts up to the Court of Appeals, is operating
under the 1973 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Almost
daily, presidential orders and decrees of the most legislative character
affecting practically every aspect of governmental and private activity as well
as the relations between the government and the citizenry are pouring out from <span class="SpellE">Malacañang</span> under the authority of said Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, taxes are being exacted
and penalties in connection therewith are being imposed under said orders and
decrees. Obligations have been contracted and business and industrial plans
have been and are being projected pursuant to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Displacements of public officials and
employees in big numbers are going on in obedience to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the ten justices of the Supreme Court to
constitute an island of resistance in the midst of these developments, which
even unreasoning obstinacy cannot ignore, much less impede, is unimaginable,
let alone the absurd and complicated consequences such a position entails in
the internal workings within the judiciary among its different compo­nents,
what with the lower courts considering such orders and decrees as forming part
of the law of the land in making their orders and decisions, whereas the
Supreme Court is holding, as it were, their <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
at bay if it is not being indifferent to or ignoring them.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is suggested that the President, being a man of law, is
committed to abide by the decision of the Supreme Court, and if the Court feels
that it cannot in the meantime consider the enforcement of the new
Constitution, he can wait for its decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accepting the truth of this assertion, it does not necessarily follow
that by this <span class="SpellE">attitute</span> of the President, he considers
the Supreme Court as still operating under the Old Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Quite on the contrary, it is a fact that he
has given instructions for the payment of the justices in accordance with the
rate fixed in the New Constitution. Not only that, his official <i style=""><span style="">alter
ego</span></i><span style="">,
</span>the Secretary of Justice, has been shoving to this Court, since January
18, 1973, all matters related to the administrative supervision of the lower
courts which by the new charter has been transferred from the Department of
Justice to the Supreme Court, and as far as I know, the President has not
countermanded the Secretary's steps in that direction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That, on the other hand, the President has
not augmented the justices of the Court to complete the prescribed number of
fifteen is, in my appraisal, of no consequence, considering that with the
presence of ten justices who are in the Court now, there is a working quorum,
and the addition of new justices cannot in anyway affect the voting on the
constitutional questions now before Us because, while there are sufficient
justices to declare by their unanimous vote the illegality of Proclamation
1102, the votes of the justices to be added would only be committed to
upholding the same, since they cannot by any standard be expected to vote against
the legality of the very Constitution under which they would be appointed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, what makes the
premise of presumptive validity preferable and, even imperative, is that We are
dealing here with a whole constitution that radically modifies or alters not
only the form of our government from presidential to parliamentary but also
other constitutionally based institutions vitally affecting all levels of
society.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, to my mind, unrealistic
to insist on that, fundamentally, the 1973 Constitution is the same </span>1935
Constitution with a few improvements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
cursory perusal of the former should convince anyone that it is in essence a
new one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it does retain
republicanism as the basic governmental tenet, the institutional changes
introduced thereby are rather radical and its social orientation is decidedly
more socialistic, just as its nationalistic features are somewhat different in
certain respects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One cannot but note
that the change embraces practically every part of the old charter, from its
preamble down to its amending and <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
clauses, involving as they do the statement of general principles, the
citizenship and suffrage qualifications, the articles on the form of
government, the judiciary provisions, the spelling out of the duties and
responsibilities not only of citizens but also of officers of the government and
the provisions on the national economy as well as the patrimony of the nation,
not to mention the distinctive features of the general provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, the transitory provisions
notably depart from traditional and orthodox views in that, in general, the
powers of government during the interim period are more or less concentrated in
the President, to the extent that the continuation or discontinuance of what is
now practically a one-man-rule, is even left to his discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notably, the express ratification of all
proclamations, orders, decrees and acts previously issued or done by the
President, obviously meant to encompass those issued during martial law, is a
commitment to the concept of martial law powers being implemented by President
Marcos, in defiance of traditional views and prevailing jurisprudence, to the
effect that the Executive's power of legislation during a regime of martial law
is all inclusive and is not limited to the matters demanded by military
necessity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the new
constitution unlike any other constitution countenances the institution by <span style="">the executive of reforms which normally is
the exclusive attribute of the legislature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Withal, the best proofs
that by its expressed and implied intent, the Constitution of 1973 is a new
one, are that (1) </span>Section 16 of its Article XVII which provides that
this constitution <span style="">shall </span>"supersede
the Constitution of nineteen hundred and thirty-five and all amendments
thereto" and (2) its transitory provisions expressly continue the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of existing laws, offices and courts as well as
the tenure of all incumbent officials, not adversely affected by it, which
would have been unnecessary if the old constitution were being merely amended.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The new Constitution, in
its Section 10, Article XVII, provides that "(T)he incumbent members of
the Judiciary (which include the Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the
Supreme Court) may continue in office (under the new constitution) until they
reach the age of seventy years, etc." By virtue of the presumptive
validity of the new charter, all of Us form part of the 15-man Court provided
for therein and, correspondingly, We have in legal contemplation, ceased in the
meanwhile to be members of the 11-man Court in the 1935 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should the Court finally decide that the new
Constitution is invalid, then We would automatically revert to our positions in
the 11-man Court, otherwise, We would just continue to be in our membership in
the 15-man Court, unless We feel We cannot in conscience accept the legality of
its existence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, if it
is assumed that We are still the 11-man Court and it happens that Our </span>collective
decision is in favor of the new constitution, it would be problematical for any
dissenting justice to consider himself as <span style="">included
automatically in </span>the 15-man Court, since that would be tantamount to
accepting a position he does not honestly believe exists.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III</p>

<p class="BODY">In brief, the main contention of the petitioners <span style="">is that </span>Proclamation 1102 is invalid
because the ratification of the 1973 Constitution it purports .to declare as
having taken place as a result of the referendum above-referred to is
ineffective, since it cannot be said on the basis of <span style="">the said </span>referendum that said Constitution has been
"approved by a majority of the votes cast at an election" in the
manner prescribed by Article XV of the Constitution of 1935. More specifically,
they maintain that the word "election" in the said Article has
already acquired a definite accepted meaning out of the consistent holding in
the past of ratification plebiscites, and accordingly, no other form of
ratification can be considered contemplated by the framers of the Old
Constitution than that which had been followed in 1935, 1937, 1939, 1940, 1946
and 1967, the last three or four of which were held under the supervision of
the Commission on Elections.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, they emphatically deny the veracity of the proclaimed
results of the referendum because, according to them the referendum was a farce
and its results were manufactured or prefabricated, considering that Mr.
Francisco Cruz, who is supposed to have submitted the final report to the
President, which served as basis for Procla­mation 1102, had no official
authority to render the same, and it is inconceivable and humanly impossible
for anyone to have been able to gather, tabulate and canvass the 15 million
votes allegedly reported within the short period of time employed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, they also contend that in any
event, there was no proper submission because martial law <span style="">per se </span>creates
constructive duress which deprives the voters of the complete freedom needed
for the exercise of their right of choice and actually, there was neither time
nor opportunity for real debate before they voted.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the position of the Solicitor General as
counsel for the respondents <span style="">is </span>that
the matter raised in the petitions is a political one which the courts are not
supposed to inquire into, and, anyway, there has been a substantial compliance
with Article XV of the 1935 Constitution, inasmuch as, disregarding unessential
matters of form, the undeniable fact is that the voting in the referendum
resulted in the approval by the people of the New Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I need not dwell at
length on these variant positions of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In my separate opinion in the Plebiscite
Cases, I already made the observation that in view of the lack of solemnity </span>and
regularity in the voting as well as in the <span style="">manner of reporting and canvassing conducted in connection </span>with
the referendum, I cannot say that Article XV of the Old Constitution has been
complied with, albeit <span style="">I </span>held
that nonetheless, the Constitution of 1973 <span style="">is already in force. </span><span style="">In </span><span style="">order, </span>however, to make myself clearer
on some relevant points, I would like to add a few considerations to what I have
already said in the former cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">In my opinion in those cases, the most important point I took
into account was that in the face of the Presidential certification through
Proclamation 1102 itself that the New Constitution has been approved by a
majority of the people and having in mind facts of general knowledge which I
have taken judicial notice of, I am in no position to deny that the result of
the referendum was as the President had stated. I can believe that the figures
referred to in the proclamation may not be accurate, but I cannot say in
conscience that all of them are manufactured or prefabricated, simply because I
saw with my own eyes that people did actually gather and listen to discussions,
if brief and inadequate for those who are not abreast of current events and
general occurrences, and that they did vote.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I believe I can safely say that what I have seen have also been seen by
many others throughout the country and unless it can be assumed, which honestly,
I do not believe to be possible, that in fact there were actually no meetings
held and no voting done in more places than those wherein there were such
meetings and <span class="SpellE">votings</span>, I am not prepared to discredit
entirely the declaration that there was voting and that the majority of the
votes were in favor of the New Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If in fact there were substantially less than 14 million votes of
approval, the real figure, in my estimate, could still be significant enough
and legally sufficient to serve as basis for a valid ratification.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is contended, however, that the understanding was that the
referendum among the Citizens Assemblies was to be in the nature merely of a
loose consultation and not an outright submission for purposes of
ratification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can see that at the
outset, when the first set of questions was released, such may have been the
idea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must not be lost sight of,
however, that if the newspaper reports are to be believed, and I say this only
because petitioners would consider the newspapers as the official gazettes of
the administration, the last set of six questions were included precisely
because tie reaction to the idea of mere consulta­tion was that the people
wanted greater direct participation, thru the Citizens Assemblies, in
decision-making regarding matters of vital national interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, looking at things more understandingly
and realistically, the two questions emphasized by counsel, namely, <span style="">(1) </span>Do you approve of the New
Constitution? and (2) <span style="">Do </span>you want a plebiscite to be called to ratify the new
Constitution? should be considered no longer as loose consultations but as
direct inquiries about the desire of the voters regarding the matters
mentioned.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Accordingly,
I </span><span style="">take it that if </span><span style="">the majority had expressed </span>disapproval
of the new Constitution, the logical consequence would have been the complete
abandonment of the idea of holding any plebiscite at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, it is very plain to see
that since the majority has already approved the new Constitution, a plebiscite
would be superfluous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clear as these
rationalizations may be, it must have been thought that if the holding of a
plebiscite was to be abandoned, there should be a direct and expressed desire
of the people to such effect in order to forestall as much as possible any
serious controversy regarding the non-holding of the plebiscite required
by<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the <span style="">letter of Section 16 of Article </span>XVII, the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
clause, of the new Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Oddly
enough, the "comments" accompanying the questions do strongly suggest
this view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And <span style="">as it turned </span>out, <span style="">the
majority found no </span>necessity in holding a plebiscite.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In connection with the
question, Do you approve of the New Constitution? capital is being made of the
point that as so framed, </span>the thrust of <span style="">the said question does not seek an answer of fact but of opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is argued that it would have been factual
were it worded categorically thus - Do you approve the New Constitution? The
contention would have been weighty were it not unrealistic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember distinctly that the observation
regarding the construction of the subject question was not originally made by
any of the talented counsels for petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It came from Mr. Justice Fred Ruiz </span>Castro whose mastery of the
English language can rightly <span style="">be </span>the
cause of envy of even professors of English.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>None of the other members of the Court, as far as I can recall, ever
noticed how the said question is phrased, or if anyone of Us did, I am not
aware that he gave it more than passing attention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What <span style="">I
</span>mean is that if neither any of the distinguished and learned counsels nor
any member of the Court understood the said question otherwise than calling for
a factual answer instead of a mere opinion, how could anyone expect the
millions of unlettered members of the Citizens Assemblies to have noticed the
point brought out by Justice Castro? Truth to tell, I myself did not realize
the difference until Justice Castro gave it emphasis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, reading the question in the light of
the accompanying "comment" corresponding to it in particular, I am
certain that any one who answered the same understood it in no other sense than
a direct inquiry as to whether or not, as a matter of fact, he approves the New
Constitution, and naturally, his affirmative answer must be taken as a categori­cal
vote of approval thereof, considering, particularly, that according to the
reported result of the referendum <span style="">said </span>answer
was even coupled with the request that the President defer the convening of the
Interim National Assembly.</p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">is also contended that
because of this reference in the answer to that question to the deferment of
the convening of the interim assembly, the said answer is at best a conditional
approval not proper nor acceptable for purposes of a ratification plebiscite.
The contention has no basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
interest of accuracy, the additional answer proposed in the </span>pertinent
"comment" reads as follows:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"But we do not want the Ad interim Assembly to be convoked,
etc." On the assumption that the actual answer, as reported, was of
similar tenor, it is not fair to ascribe to <span style="">it </span>the imposition of a condition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the most, the intention is no more than a
suggestion or a wish.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards said "comments", it must be considered that
after martial law was declared, the circumstances surrounding the making of the
Constitution acquired a different and more meaningful aspect, namely, the
formation of a new society.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the
point of view of the President and on the basis of intelligence reports
available to him, the only way to meet the situation created by the subversive
elements was to introduce immediately effective reforms calculated to redeem
the people from the depth of retrogression and stagnation caused by rampant
graft and corruption in high places, influence peddling, oligarchic political
practices, private armies, anarchy, deteriorating conditions of peace and
order, the social inequalities widening the gap between the rich and the poor,
and many other deplorable long standing maladies crying for early relief and
solution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Definitely, as in the case of
the rebellious movement that threatened the <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span>
Administration, the remedy was far from using bullets alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a constitution was to be approved as an
effective instrument towards the eradication of such grave problems, it had to
be approved without loss of time and sans the cumbersome processes that, from
the realistic viewpoint, have in the past obstructed rather than hastened the
progress of the people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated
otherwise, in the context of actualities, the evident objective in having a new
constitution is to establish new directions in the pursuit of the national
aspirations and the carrying out of national policies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only by bearing these considerations in mind
can the "comments" already referred to be properly appreciated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To others said "comments" may
appear as evidence of corruption of the will of those who attended the
assemblies, but actually, they may also be viewed in the same light as the
sample ballots commonly resorted to in the elections of officials, which no one
can contend are <i style=""><span style="">per</span></i><span style=""> </span><i style=""><span style="">se</span></i><span style=""> </span>means of coercion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let
us not forget that the times are abnormal and prolonged dialogue and exchange
of ideas are not generally possible, nor practical, considering the need for
faster decisions and more resolute action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After all voting on a whole new constitution is different from voting on
one, two or three specific proposed amendments, the former calls for nothing
more than a collective view of all the provisions of the whole charter, for
necessarily, one has to <span style="">take </span>the
good together with the bad in it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
rare for anyone to reject a constitution only because of a few specific
objectionable features, no matter how substantial, considering the ever present
possibility that after all it may be cured by subsequent amendment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, there was need to indicate to
the people the paths open to them in their quest for the betterment of there
conditions, and as long as it is not shown that those who did not agree to the
suggestions in the "comments" were actually compelled to vote against
their will, I am not convinced that the existence of said "comments"
should make any appreciable difference in the Court's appraisal of the result
of the referendum.</p>

<p class="BODY">I must confess that the fact that the referendum was held during
martial law detracts somehow from the <span style="">value
that </span>the referendum would otherwise have had.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As intimated, however, in my former opinion,
it is not fair to condemn and disregard the result of the referendum barely
because of martial law <i style=""><span style="">per</span></i><span style=""> </span><i style=""><span style="">se. </span></i><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>For
one thing, <span style="">many </span>of the
objectionable features of martial law have not actually materialized, if only
because the implementation of martial law since its inception <span style="">has been generally characterized </span>by
restraint and consideration, thanks to the expressed wishes of the President
that the same be made "Philippine style", which means without the
rigor that has attended it in other lands and other times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, although the restrictions on the
freedom of speech, the press and movement during martial law do have their
corresponding adverse effects on the area of information which should be open
to a voter, in its real sense what "chills" his freedom of choice and
mars his exercise of discretion is the suspension of the privilege of the writ
of habeas corpus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason is simply
that a man may freely and correctly vote even if the needed information he
possesses as to the candidates or issues being voted upon is more or less
incomplete, but when he is subject to arrest and detention without
investigation and without being informed of the cause thereof, that is
something else which may actually cause him to cast a captive vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus it is the suspension of the writ of
habeas corpus accompanying martial law that can cause possible restraint on the
freedom of choice in an election held during martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a fact, however, borne by history and
actual experience, that in the Philippines, the suspension of the privilege of
the writ of habeas corpus has never produced any chilling effect upon the
voters, since it is known by all that only those who run afoul of the law,
saving inconsequential instances, have any cause for apprehension in regard to
the conduct by them of the normal activities of life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so it is recorded that in the elections
of 1951 and 1971, held while the privilege of writ of habeas corpus was under
suspension, the Filipino voters gave the then opposition parties overwhelming <span style="">if </span>not sweeping victories, in defiance
of the respective administrations that <span style="">ordered
the suspensions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, I think it is fit to make it clear that I am
not trying to show that the result of the referendum may be considered as
sufficient basis for declaring that the New Constitution has been ratified in
accordance with the amending clause of the 1935 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I reiterate that in point of law, I find
neither strict nor substantial compliance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The foregoing discussion is only to counter, if I may, certain
impressions regarding the general conditions obtaining during and in relation
to the referendum which could have in one way or another affected the exercise
of the freedom of choice and the use of discretion by the members of the
Citizens Assemblies, to the end that as far as the same conditions may be
relevant in my subsequent discussions of the acceptance by the people of the
New Constitution they may also be considered.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">IV</p>

<p class="BODY">It is my sincere conviction that the Constitution of 1973 has
been accepted or adopted by the people. And on this premise, my considered
opinion is that the Court may no longer decide these cases on the basis of
purely legal considerations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Factors
which are non-legal but nevertheless ponderous and compelling cannot be
ignored, for their relevancy is inherent in the issue itself to be resolved.</p>

<p class="BODY">In my opinion in the Plebiscite Cases, I joined my colleagues in
holding that the question of whether or not there was proper submission under
Presidential Decree No. 73 is <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>, and I
still hold that the propriety of submission under any other law or in any other
form is constitutionally a fit subject for inquiry by the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ruling in the decided cases relied upon
by petitioners are to this effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
view, however, of the factual background of the cases at bar which include
ratification itself, it is necessary for me to point out that when it comes to
ratification, I am persuaded that there should be a boundary beyond which the
competence of the courts no longer has any reason for being, because the other
side is exclusively political territory reserved for their own dominion by the
people.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main basis of my opinion in the previous cases was acceptance
by the people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Others may feel there is
not enough indication of such acceptance in the record and in the circumstances
the Court can take judicial notice of.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For my part, I consider it unnecessary to be strictly judicial in
inquiring into such fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being personally
aware, as I have already stated, that the Citizens Assemblies did meet and
vote, if irregularly and crudely, it is not for me to resort, for the purposes
of these cases, to judicial tape and measure, to find out with absolute
precision the veracity of the total number of votes actually cast. After all,
the claims that upon a comparison of conflicting reports, cases of excess votes
may be found, even if extrapolated will not, as far as I can figure out,
suffice to overcome the outcome officially announced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather than try to form a conclusion out of
the raw evidence before Us which the parties did not care to really complete, I
feel safer by referring to the results announced in the proclamation itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Giving substantial allowances for possible error
and downright manipulation, it must not be overlooked that, after all, their
having been accepted and adopted by the President, based on official reports
submitted to him in due course of the performance of duty of appropriate subor­dinate
officials, has elevated them to the category of an act of a coordinate
department of. the government which under the principle of separation of powers
is clothed with presumptive correctness or at least entitled to a high degree
of acceptability, until overcome by better evidence, which in these cases does
not exist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, considering the
unorthodoxy of the procedure<span style=""> </span>adopted
and the difficulty of an accurate checking <span style="">of </span>all the figures, I cannot conceive of any manageable means of
acquiring information upon which to predicate a denial, I have no alternative
but to rely on What has been officially declared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this point, I would venture to express the
feeling that if it were not generally conceded that there has been sufficient
showing of the acceptance in question, by this time, there would have been
already demonstrative and significant indications of a rather widespread, if <span style="">not organized resistance in one form or
another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much as they are to be given
due recognition as magnificent manifestations of loyalty and devotion, to prin­ciples.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I cannot accord to the filing of these cases
as indicative enough of the general attitude of the people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is true that in the
opinion I had the privilege of penning, for the Court in <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
<i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, </span>41 SCRA 702, I made strong
and unequivocal pronouncements to the <span style="">effect
that any amendment to the Constitution of 1935, to be valid, </span>must <span style="">appear </span>to <span style="">have been made in strict conformity with the requirements of </span>Article
XV thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, that decision
asserted judicial competence to inquire into the matter of compliance or
non-compliance as a <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I still believe in the correctness of those
views and I would even add that I sincerely feel it reflects the spirit of the
said constitutional provision. Without trying to strain any point,
however.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I submit the following
considerations in the context of the peculiar circumstances of the cases now at
bar, which are entirely different from those in the backdrop of the <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> rulings I have referred to:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. Consider that in the present case what is involved is not just
an amendment of a particular provision of an existing Constitution; here, it
is, as I have discussed earlier above, an entirely new Constitution that is
being proposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This important circumstance
makes a great deal of difference.</p>

<p class="BODY">No less than counsel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> for
herein respondents <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> and Roy, who was himself the
petitioner in the case I have just referred to, is now inviting Our attention
to the exact language of Article XV and suggesting that the said Article may be
strictly applied to proposed amendments but may hardly govern the ratification
of a new Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
particularly stressed that the Article specifically refers to nothing else but
"amendments to this Constitution" which if ratified "shall be
valid as part of this Constitution." Indeed, how can a whole new
constitution be by any manner of reasoning an amendment to any other
constitution and how can it, if ratified, form part of such other constitution?
In fact, in the <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> case I already somehow
hinted this point when I made reference in the resolution denying the motion
for reconsideration to the fact that Article XV must be followed "as long
as any amendment is formulated and submitted under the aegis of the present
Charter." Said resolution even added, "(T)his is not to say that the
people may not, in the exercise of their inherent revolutionary powers, amend
the Constitution or promulgate an entirely new one otherwise".</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not strange at all to think that the amending clause of a
constitution should be confined in its application only to proposed changes in
any part of the same constitution itself, for the very fact that a new
constitution is being adopted implies a general intent to put aside the whole of
the old one, and what would be really incongruous is the idea that in such an
eventuality, the new Constitution would subject its going into effect to any
provision of the constitution it is to supersede, to use the language precisely
of Section 16, Article XVII, the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> clause,
of the New Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
understanding is that generally, constitutions are self-born, they very rarely,
if at-all, come into being, by virtue of any provision of another constitution.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
This must be the reason why every constitution has its own <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
clause, so that if, the Constitutional Convention had only anticipated the idea
of the referendum and provided for such a method to be used in the ratification
of the New Constitution, I would have had serious doubts as to whether Article
XV could have had priority of application.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. When an entirely new constitution is proposed to supersede the
existing one, we cannot but take into consider­ation the forces and the
circumstances dictating the replace­ment. From the very nature of things, the
proposal to ordain a new constitution must be viewed as the most eloquent
expression of a people's resolute determination to bring about a massive change
of the existing order, a meaningful transformation of the old society and a responsive
refor­mation of the contemporary institutions and principles. Accordingly,
should any question arise as to its <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> and
there is some reasonable indication that the new charter has already received
in one way or another the sanction of the people, I would hold that the better
rule is for the courts to defer to the people's judgment, so long as they are
convinced of the fact of their approval, regardless of the form by which it is
expressed, provided it be reasonably feasible and reliable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated, in such instances, the
courts should not bother about inquiring into compliance with technical
requisites, and as a matter of policy should consider the matter non-<span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. There is still another circumstance which I consider to be of
great relevancy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I refer to the
ostensible reaction of the component elements, both collective and individual,
of the Congress of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither the Senate nor the House of
Representatives has been reported to have even made any appreciable effort or
attempt to convene as they were supposed to do under the Constitution of 1935
on <st1:date year="1973" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1973</st1:date> for the
regular session.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be assumed that
being composed of experienced, knowledgeable and courageous members, it would
not have been difficult for said parliamentary bodies to have conceived some
ingenious way of giving evidence of their determined adherence to the
Constitution under which they were elected.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Frankly, much as I admire the efforts of the handful of senators who had
their picture taken in front of the padlocked portals of the Senate chamber, I
do not feel warranted to accord such act as enough token of resistance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As counsel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
has informed the court, there was nothing to stop the senators and the
congressmen to meet in any other convenient place and somehow officially
organize themselves in a way that can logically he considered as a session,
even if nothing were done than to merely call the roll and disperse. Counsel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> even pointed out that if there were not enough
members to form a quorum, any smaller group could have ordered the arrest of
the absent members. And with particular relevance to the present cases, it was
not constitutionally indispensable for the presiding officers to issue any call
to the members to convene, hence the present prayers for <i>mandamus</i> have
no legal and factual bases. And to top it all, quite to the contrary, the
records of the Commission on Elections show that at least 15 of 24 senators and
over 95 out of less than 120 members of the House of Representative, have
officially and in writing exercised the option given to them to join the
Interim National Assembly under the New Constitution, thereby manifesting their
acceptance of the new charter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, having these facts in mind, and it being obvious that of the
three great departments of the government under the 1935 Constitution, two, the
Executive and the Legis­lative, have already accepted the New Constitution and
recognized its enforceability and enforcement, I cannot see how this Supreme Court
can by judicial fiat hold back the political developments taking place and for
the sake of being the guardian of the Constitution and the defender of its
integrity and supremacy make its judicial power prevail against the decision of
those who were duly chosen by the people to be their authorized spokesmen and
representatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not alone the
physical futility of such a gesture that concerns me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More than that, there is the stark reality
that the Senators and the Congressmen, no less than the President, have taken
the same oath of loyalty to the Constitution that we, the Justices, have taken
and they are, therefore, equally bound with Us to preserve and protect the
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If as the elected
representatives of the people, they have already opted to accept the New
Constitution as the more effective instrument for the fulfillment of the
national destiny, I really wonder if there is even any idealistic worth in Our
desperate­ly clinging by Ourselves alone to Our sworn duty <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span>
the 1935 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conscious of the
declared objectives of the new dispensation and cognizant of the decisive steps
being taken, with the least loss of time, towards their accomplishment, I
cannot but feel apprehensive that instead of serving the best interests of our
people, which to me is in reality the real meaning of our oath of office, the
Court might be standing in the way of the very thing our beloved country needs
to retrieve its past glory and greatness. In other words, it is my conviction
that, what these cases demand most of all is not a decision <span class="SpellE">demostrative</span>
of our legal erudition and <span class="SpellE">Solomonic</span> wisdom, but an
all-rounded judgment resulting from the consideration of all relevant
circumstances, principally the political, or, in brief, a decision more political
than legal, which a court can render only by deferring to the apparent judgment
of the people and the announcement thereof by the political departments of the
government and declaring the matter non-<span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>.</p>

<p class="NUM">4. Viewed from the strictly legal angle and in the light of
judicial methods of ascertainment, I cannot agree with the Solicitor General
that in the legal sense, there has been at least substantial compliance with
Article XV of the 1935 Constitution, but what I can see is that in a political sense,
the answers to the referendum questions were not given by the people as legal
conclusions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I take it that when they
answered that by their signified approval of the New Constitution, they do not
consider it necessary to hold a plebiscite, they could not have had in mind any
intent to do what was constitutionally improper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Basically accustomed to proceed along
constitutional channels, they must have acted in the honest conviction that
what was being done was in conformity with prevailing, constitutional
standards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not to assume that the
sovereign people were indulging in a futile exercise of their supreme political
right to choose the fundamental charter by which their lives, their liberties
and their fortunes shall be safeguarded.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, we must perforce infer that they meant their decision to
count, and it behooves this Court to render judgment herein in that
context.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is my considered opinion
that viewed understandingly and realistically, there is more than sufficient <span style="">ground </span>to hold that, judged by such
intent and, particularly, from the political standpoint, the ratification of
the 1973 Constitution declared in Proclamation 1102 complies substantially with
Article XV of the 1935 Charter, specially when it is considered that the most
important element of the ratification therein contemplated is not in the word
"election", which conceivably can be in many feasible and manageable
forms but in the word "approved" which may be said to constitute the
substantiality of the whole article, so long as such approval is reasonably
ascertained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the last analysis,
therefore, it can be rightly said, even if only in a broad sense, that the
ratification here in question was constitutionally justified and justifiable.</p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, if any doubt
should still linger as to the legitimacy of the New Constitution on legal
grounds, the same should be dispelled by viewing the situation in the manner
suggested by Counsel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> and by the writer of
this opinion in his separate opinion, oft-referred to above, in the Plebiscite
Cases – that is, as an extra-constitutional exercise by the people, under the
leadership of President Marcos, of, their inalienable right to change their
fundamental charter by any means they may deem appropriate, <span style="">the </span>moment they are convinced that the
existing one is no longer responsive to their fundamental, political and social
needs nor conducive to the timely attainment of their national destiny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not only the teaching of the American
Declaration of Independence but is indeed, a truth that is self-evident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More, it should be regarded as implied in
every constitution that regardless of the language of its amending clause, once
the people have given their sanction to a new charter, the latter may be deemed
as constitutionally permissible even from the point of view of the preceding
constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those who may feel
restrained to consider this view out of respect to the import of <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> <i style=""><span style="">vs</span></i><span style="">. </span><span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, <i style=""><span style="">supra</span></i><span style="">., </span>would be
well advised to bear in mind that that case was decided in the context of
submission, not of accomplished ratification.</p>

<p class="BODY">The language of the disputed amending clause of the 1935
Constitution should not be deemed as the be all and end all of the nation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More important than even the Constitution itself,
with all its excellent features, are the people living under it — their
happiness, their posterity and their national destiny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing that cannot be sacrificed in
the pursuit of these objectives, which constitute the totality of the reasons
for national existence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sacred
liberties and freedoms enshrined in it and the commitment and consecration
thereof to the forms of democracy we have hitherto observed are mere integral
parts of this totality; they are less important by themselves.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">What seems to me to be
bothering many of our countrymen now </span>is <span style="">that by </span>denying the present petitions, the Court would be deemed
as sanctioning, not only the deviations from traditional democratic concepts
and principles but also the qualified curtailment of individual liberties now
being practiced, and this would amount, if is feared, to a repudiation of our
oath to support and defend the Constitution of 1935.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is certainly something one must gravely
ponder upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I consider, however,
that the President, the Vice-President, the members of both Houses of Congress,
not to speak of all the executive departments and bureaus under them, as well
as all the lower courts, including the Court of Appeals, have already accepted
the New Constitution as an instrument of a meaningful nationwide-all-level
change in our government and society purported to make more realistic and
feasible, rather than idealistic and cumbersomely deliberative, the attainment
of our national aspirations, I am led to wonder, whether or not we, as members
of the Supreme Court are being true to our duty to our people by refusing to
follow suit and to accept the realities of the moment, despite our being
convinced of the sincerity and laudableness of their objectives, only because
we feel that by the people's own act of ratifying the Constitution of 1935,
they have so encased themselves within <span style="">its
</span>provisions and may, therefore, no longer take measures to redeem
themselves from the situation brought about by the deficiencies of the old
order, unless they act in strict conformity therewith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I cannot believe that any people can be so
stifled and enchained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, I
consider it a God-given attribute of the people to disengage themselves, if <span style="">necessary, </span>from any covenant that
would obstruct their taking what subsequently appears to them to be the better <span style="">road </span>to the promotion and protection
of their welfare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And once <span style="">they have made their decision </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">that respect, whether </span>sophisticatedly or crudely, whether in
legal form or otherwise, certainly, there can be no court or power on earth
that can reverse them.</p>

<p class="BODY">I would not be human if I should be insensitive to the passionate
and eloquent appeals of Counsels <span class="SpellE">Tañada</span> and <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> that these cases be decided on the basis of
conscience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is exactly what I am
doing. But if counsels mean that only by granting their petitions can this
Court he worthily the bulwark of the people's faith in the government, I cannot
agree, albeit my admiration and respect are <span style="">all theirs for their zeal and </span>tenacity, their industry and
wisdom, their patriotism and devotion to principle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Verily, they have brought out everything in
the Filipino that these cases demand.</p>

<p class="BODY">In times of national emergencies and crises, not arising from
foreign invasion, we need not fear playing opposite roles, as long as we are
all animated by sincere love of country and aim exclusively at the attainment
of the national destiny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our heroes of
the past, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span>, Antonio Luna, <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span>
and so also with our patriots of the recent generations, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>, <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, Laurel and
Recto, to mention only some of them, had their differences of views — and they
did not hesitate to take diametrically opposing sides that even reached tragic
proportions, but all of them are admired and venerated.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is my faith that to act with absolute loyalty to our <span style="">country and people is more important than
loyalty to any </span>particular precept or provision of the C<span style="">o</span>nstitution to the Constitution
itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My oath to abide by the
Constitution hinds me to whatever course of action I feel sincerely is demanded
by the welfare and best interest of the people.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this momentous juncture of our history, what is imperative is
national unity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>May God grant that the
controversies the events leading to these cases have entailed will heal after
the decision herein is promulgated; so that all of us Filipinos may forever
join hands in the pursuit of our national destiny.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, I vote to dismiss all these
petitions for <i>mandamus</i> and prohibition without costs.</p>

<span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Makasiar</span></span><span style="">, Antonio, </span><span style="font-style: normal;">and </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Esguerra</span></span><span style="">, JJ., </span><span style="font-style: normal;">c</span><span style="font-style: normal;">oncur insofar

It must be recalled that in the <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> case, the
Constitutional Convention intended to submit one amendment which was to form
part of the Constitution still being prepared by it separately from the rest of
the other parts of such constitution still unfinished, and We held that a
piece-meal submission <span style="">was </span>improper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had no occasion to express any view as to
how a whole new constitution may be ratified.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">FOR DISMISSAL OF PETITIONS</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">ESGUERRA, <i style="">J.</i><span style="">:</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">These petitions seek to stop and prohibit the respondents
Executive Officers from implementing the Constitution signed on November 30,
1972; in L-36165, to compel respondents Gil <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> and
Jose J. Roy, President and President Pro-Tempore, respectively, of the Senate
under the 1935 Constitution, to convene the Senate in regular session which
should have started on January 22, 1973; to nullify Proclamation No. 1102 of
the President, issued on January 17, 1973, which declared the ratification of
the Constitution on November 30, 1972, by the Filipino people, through <span style="">the </span><span class="SpellE">barangays</span> or Citizens' Assemblies established under
Presidential Decree No. 86 issued on December 31, 1972, which were empowered
under Presidential Decree No. 86-A, issued on January 5, 1973, to act in
connection with the ratification of said Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Grounds for the petitions are as follows:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. That the Constitutional Convention was not a free forum for the
making of a Constitution after the declaration of Martial Law on <st1:date year="1972" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1972</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. The Convention was not empowered to incorporate certain
provisions in the 1972 Constitution because they are highly unwise and
objectionable and the people were not sufficiently informed about them.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. The President had no authority to create and empower the
Citizens' Assemblies to ratify the new Constitu­tion at the referendum
conducted in connection therewith, as said assemblies were merely for
consultative purposes, and</p>

<p class="NUM">4. The provisions of Article XV of the 1935 Constitution
prescribing the manner of amending the same <span class="GramE">were</span> not
duly observed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitions were not given due course immediately but were
referred to the Solicitor General as counsel for the respondents for comment,
with three members of the Court, including the undersigned, voting to dismiss
them outright.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The comments were
considered <span class="GramE">motions</span> to dismiss which were set for
hearing and extensively argued.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter both parties submitted their notes and memoranda on their
oral arguments.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues raised for determination, on which the resolution of
the Motion to Dismiss hinges, are as follows:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. Is the question presented political and, hence, beyond the
competence of this Court to decide, or is it <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>
and fit for judicial determination?</p>

<p class="NUM">2. Was the new Constitution of <st1:date year="1972" day="30" month="11">November 30, 1972</st1:date>, ratified in accordance with the
amending process prescribed by Article XV of the 1935 Constitution?</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Has the new Constitution
been accepted and <span class="GramE">acquiesced</span> in by the Filipino
people?</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is the new Constitution
actually in force and effect?</p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the answers to
question Nos. 3 and 4 be in the affirmative, are petitioners entitled to the <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> prayed for?</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span class="GramE">II.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The pivotal question in these cases is whether the issue raised
is highly political and, therefore, not <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I<span style=""> </span>maintain
that this Court should abstain from assuming jurisdiction, but, instead, as an
act of judicial statesmanship, should dismiss the petitions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In resolving whether or not the question
presented is political, joint discussion of issues Nos. 1, 3 and 4 is necessary
so as to arrive at a logical conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For after the acceptance of a new Constitution and acquiescence therein
by the people by putting it into practical operation, any question regarding
its validity should be foreclosed and all debates on whether it was duly or
lawfully ushered into existence as the organic law of the state become
political and not judicial in character.</p>

<p class="BODY">The undisputed facts that lead to the issuance of Proclamation
No. 1102 and Presidential Decrees Nos. 86 and 86-<span class="GramE">A</span> are
fully set forth in the majority and dissenting opinions in the Plebiscite cases
decided on <st1:date year="1973" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1973</st1:date>,
and need not be repeated here.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners seek to set at naught Proclamation No. 1102 and
Presidential Decrees Nos. 86 and 86-A, claiming that the ratification of the
new Constitution pursuant to the said decrees is invalid and of no effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Presidential Decree No. 86 organized the <span class="SpellE">barangays</span> or Citizens' Assemblies composed of all citizens
at least fifteen years of age, and through these assemblies the proposed 1972
Constitution was submitted to the people for ratification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proclamation No. 1102 of the President
announced or declared the result of the referendum or plebiscite conducted
through the Citizens' Assemblies, and that 14,976,561 members thereof voted for
the ratification of the new Constitution and 743,869 voted against it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Peti­tioners assail these two acts of the
President as unauthorized and devoid of legal effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">But looking through the veneer of judicial conformity with which
the petitions have been adroitly contrived, what is sought to be invalidated is
the new Constitution itself —the very framework of the present Government since
<st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason is obvious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Presidential decrees set up the means for
the ratification and acceptance of the new Constitution and Proclamation No.
1102 simply announced the result of the referendum or plebiscite by the people
through the Citizens' Assemblies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Government under the new Constitution has been running on its tracks normally
and apparently without obstruction in the form of organized resistance capable
of jeopardizing its existence and disrupting its operation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ultimately the issue is whether the new Constitution
may be set aside by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But has
it the power and authority to assume such a stupendous task when the result of
such invalidation would be to subject this nation to divisive controversies
that may totally destroy the social order which the Government under the new
Constitution has been admirably protecting and promoting under Martial
Law?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the new Constitution has taken
deep root and the people are happy and contended with it is a living reality
which the most articulate critics of the new order cannot deny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>95 out of 108 members of the House of
Representatives have opted to serve in the interim National Assembly provided
for under the new Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>15 out
of 24 Senators have done likewise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
members of the Congress did not meet anymore last January 22, 1973, not because
they were really prevented from so doing but because of no serious effort on
their parts to assert their offices under the 1935 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In brief the Legislative Department under the
1935 Constitution is a thing of the past.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Executive Department has been fully reorganized; new appointments of
key executive officers including those of the Armed Forces were extended and
they took an oath to support and defend the new Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The courts, except the Supreme Court by
reason of these cases, have administered justice under the new
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All government offices
have dealt with the public and performed their functions according to the new
Constitution and laws promulgated <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">If the real purpose of the petitions is to set aside the new
Constitution, how can this Court justify its assumption of jurisdiction when no
power has * * * conferred upon it the jurisdiction to declare the Constitution
or any part thereof null and void?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
the height of absurdity and impudence for a court to wage open war against the
organic act to which it owes its existence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The situation in which this Court finds itself does not permit it to
pass upon the question whether or not the new Constitution has entered into
force and has superseded the 1935 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If it declares that the present Constitution has not been validly
ratified, it has to uphold the 1935 Constitution as still the prevailing
organic law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The result would be too
anomalous to describe, for then this Court would have to declare that it is
governed by one Constitution or the 1935 Constitution, and the legislative and
executive branches by another or the 1972 Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">If it declares that the 1972 Constitution is now operative, how
can it exercise judicial discretion in these cases when it would have no other
choice but to uphold the new Constitution as against any other one?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances it would be bereft of
judicial attributes as the matter would then be not meet for judicial
determination, but one addressed to the sovereign power of the people who have
already spoken and delivered their mandate by accepting the fundamental law on
which the government of this Republic is now functioning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To deny that the new Constitution has been
accepted and actually is In operation would be flying in the face of reason and
pounding one's bare head against a veritable stone wall or a heavily reinforced
concrete, or simply "kicking the deadly pricks" with one's bare foot
in an effort to eliminate the lethal points.</p>

<p class="BODY">When a Constitution has been in operation for sometime, even
without popular gratification at that, submission of the people thereto by the
organization of the government provided therein and observance of its prescriptions
b<span style="">y </span>public officers chosen <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">thereunder</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span>
is indicative of approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Courts should
be slow in nullifying a Constitution claimed to have been adopted not in
accordance with Constitutional or statutory directives [Miller <i style=""><span style="">vs</span></i><span style="">. </span>Johnson,
92 Ky. 589; 189 S. W. 522; Taylor <i style=""><span style="">vs</span></i><span style="">. </span>Commonwealth, 101; Va. 829; 44 S. E.

Neb. 211; 97 N. W. 347].</p>

<p class="BODY">In Miller <i style=""><span style="">vs</span></i><span style="">. </span>Johnson, supra, the Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"* * * But it is a case where a new constitution has been
formed and promulgated according to the forms of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Great interests have already arisen under it;
important rights exist by virtue of it; persons have been convicted of the
highest crimes known to the law, according to its provisions; the political
power of the government has in many <span style="">ways
</span>recognized it; <i style="">and, under such circumstances,
it is our duty to treat and regard it as a valid constitution, and now the
organic law of our state</i><span style="">. We need
not consider the validity of the amendments made after the convention
reassembled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><i style=""><span style="">If </span>the making of them was
in excess of its power, yet, as the entire instrument has been recognized as
valid in the manner suggested, it would be equally an abuse of power by the
judiciary, and <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the rights of the people,
— who can and properly should remedy the matter, if not to their liking, — if
it were to declare the instrument or a portion invalid, and bring confusion and
anarchy upon the state</i><span style="">." </span>(Italics
supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In Smith <i style="">vs</i><span style="">. </span>Good, <i style="">supra</i><span style="">, </span>the Court
said:</p>

<blockquote>"It is said that a state court is forbidden from entering upon
such an inquiry <i style="">when applied to a new
constitution, and not an amendment</i><span style="">,
</span>because the judicial power presupposes an established government, and if
the authority of that government is annulled and overthrown, the power of its
courts is annulled with it; and therefore, if a state court should enter upon
such an inquiry, and come to the conclusion that the government under which it
acted had been displaced by an opposing government, it would cease to be a
court, and it would be incapable of pronouncing a judicial decision upon the
question before it; but, if it decides at all, it must necessarily affirm the
existence of the government under which it exercises its judicial powers."
(Italics supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">These rules are all traceable to Luther <i>vs</i>. Borden, 48 U.S.
7 How.), 12 L. Ed. 581, 598 (1849) where it was held:</p>

<blockquote>"Judicial power presupposes an established government capable
of enacting laws and enforcing their execution, and of appointing judges <span style="">to </span>expound and administer them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The acceptance of the judicial office is <span class="GramE">a recognition</span> of the authority of the government from which
it is derived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if the authority of
that government is annulled and overthrown, the power of its courts and other
officers is annulled with it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if a
State court should enter upon the inquiry proposed in this case, and should
come to the conclusion that the government under which it acted had been put
aside and displaced by an opposing government it would cease to be a court, and
be incapable of pronouncing a judicial decision upon the question it undertook
to try.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it decides at all as a court,
it necessarily affirms the existence and authority of the government under
which if is exercising judicial power."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foreign relations of the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
have been normally conducted on the basis of the new Constitution and no state
with which we maintain diplomatic relations has withdrawn its recognition of
our government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(For
particulars about executive acts done under the new Constitution, see pages
22-25 of the Comments of the Solicitor General, dated February 3, 1973.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Certainly the invalidation of Proclamation No. 1102 and
Presidential Decrees Nos. 86 and 86-A by this Court would smack of plain
political meddling which is described by the United States Supreme Court as
"entering a political thicket" in <span class="SpellE">Colegrove</span>
<i>vs</i>. Green, 328 U.S. p. 549.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
this juncture it would be the better part of wisdom for this Court to adopt the
proper attitude towards political upheavals and realize that the question
before <span class="GramE">Us</span> is political and not fit for judicial
determination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">For a
political question is one entrusted to the people for judgment in their
sovereign capacity (<span class="SpellE">Tañada</span> <i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span>, G.R. No.</span> L-10520, Feb. 28, 1967; 100 Phil.
1101), or to a co-equal and coordinate branch of the Government (Vera <i>vs</i>.
Arellano, 77 Phil. 192; <span class="SpellE">Mabanag</span> <i style="">vs</i><span style="">. </span>Lopez Vito, 78
Phil. 1; <span class="SpellE">Alejandrino</span> <i style="">vs</i><span style="">. </span><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, 46 Phil. 35; <span class="SpellE">Cabili</span> <i style="">vs</i><span style="">.
</span>Francisco, G. R. No. 4638, May 8, 1931).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A case involves a political question when there would be "the
impossibility of undertaking independent resolutions without expressing a lack
of respect due to coordinate branches of government", or when there is
"the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by
various departments on one question."</p>

<p class="BODY">To preserve the prestige and eminence that this Court has long
enjoyed as the "ultimate organ of the ‘Supreme Law of the Land’ in that
vast range of legal problems often strongly entangled in popular feeling on
which this Court must pronounce", let us <span class="SpellE">harken</span>
to the following admonition of Justice Frankfurter in his dissent in Baker <i style="">vs</i><span style="">.
</span>Carr, 369 U.S.A. 186; 82 S. Ct. 691; 7 L. Ed. 2d. 663:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court's authority - possessed neither of the purse nor
the sword - <i>ultimately rests on sustained public confidence in its moral
sanction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such feeling must be nourished
by the Court's complete detachment, in fact and appearance, from political
entanglements and abstention from injecting itself into the clash of political
forces in political settlement</i>. <span style="">* *
*." </span>(Italics supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The people have accepted and submitted to a new Constitution to
replace the 1935 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The new
organic law is now in the plenitude of its efficacy and vigor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are now living under its aegis and
protection and only the cynics will deny this.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court should not in the least attempt to act as a super-legislature
or a super-board of canvassers and sow confusion and discord among our people
by pontificating that there was no valid ratification of the new
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sober realization of
its proper role and delicate function and its consciousness of the limitations
on its competence, especially in situations like this, are more in keeping with
the preservation of our democratic tradition than the blatant declamations of
those who wish the Court to engage in their brand of activism and would not
mind plunging it into the whirlpool of passion and emotion in an effort to
capture the intoxicating applause of the multitude.</p>

indicated the proper course and solution <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,

void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be borne in mind that
these executive orders had been issued in good faith and with the best of
intentions by three successive Presidents, and some of them may have already
produced extensive effects in the life of the nation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have, for instance, Executive Order No.
73, issued on November 12, 1945, appropriating the sum of P6,750,000 for public
works; Executive Order No. 86, issued on January 7, 1946, <i style=""><span style="">amend­ing a previous order

Order No. 89, issued on January 1, 1946, reorganizing the Courts of First

<p class="BODY">Then Chief Justice Moran, who penned the Court's majority
resolution, explained <span style="">his vote for </span>annulment
despite the great difficulties and possible "harmful consequences" in
the following passage, which bears re-reading:</p>

<blockquote>"However, now that the holding of a special session of
Congress for the purpose of remedying <span style="">the
nullity of the executive orders in question </span>appears remote and
uncertain, I am compelled to, and do hereby, give my unqualified concurrence in
the decision penned by Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> declar­ing
that these two executive orders were issued without authority of law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"While in voting for a temporary deferment of the judgment I
was moved by the belief that positive compliance with the Constitution by the
other branches of the Government, which is our prime concern in all these
cases, would be effected, and indefinite deferment will produce the opposite
result because it would legitimize a prolonged or permanent evasion of our
organic law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Executive orders which are,
in our opinion, repugnant to the Constitution, would be given permanent life,
opening the way or practices which may undermine our constitutional structure.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The harmful consequences which, as I envisioned in my
concurring opinion, would come to pass should the said executive orders be imme­diately
declared null and void, are still real.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They have not disappeared by reason of the fact that a special session
of Congress is not now forthcoming.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the remedy now lies in the hands of the Chief Executive and of
Congress, for the Constitution vests in the former the power to call a special
session should the need for one arise, and in the latter, the power to pass a
valid appropriations act.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That Congress may again fail to pass a valid appropriations
act is a remote possibility, for under the circumstances it fully realizes its
great respon­sibility of saving the nation from breaking down; and furthermore,
the President in the exercise of his constitutional powers may, if he so
desires, compel Congress to remain in special session till it approves the
legislative measures most needed by the country.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Democracy is on trial in the Philippines, and surely it will
emerge victorious as a permanent way of life in this country, if each of the
great branches of the Government, within its own allocated sphere, complies
with its own constitutional duty, uncompromisingly and regardless of
difficulties.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Our Republic is still young, and the vital principles
underlying its organic structure should be maintained firm and strong, hard as
the best of steel, so as to insure its growth and development along solid lines
of a stable and vigorous democracy.”<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The late Justice Pedro <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> who penned the initial majority judgment (declaring
null and void the rental and export control executive orders) likewise observed
that "(T<span class="GramE">)he</span> truth is that under our concept of
constitutional government, in times of extreme perils more than in normal
circumstances 'the various branches, executive, legislative, and judicial,'
given the ability to act, are called upon 'to perform the duties and discharge
the responsibilities committed to them respectively.'"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It should be duly acknowledged that the Court's task of
discharging its duty and responsibility has been considerably lightened by the
President's public manifestation of adherence to constitutional processes and
of working within the proper constitutional framework as per his press
conference of January 20, 1973, wherein he stated that "(T<span class="GramE">)he</span> Supreme Court is the final arbiter of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can and will probably determine the
validity of this Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did not
want to talk about this because actually there is a case pending before the
Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But suffice it to say
that I recognize the power of the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to appointments, the matter
falls under a general provision which authorizes the Prime Minister to appoint
additional members to the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp;

the principles of good government mere political apothegms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the limitations and restrictions

<p class="BODY">Justice Laurel pointed out that in contrast to the United States
Constitution, the Philippine Constitution as "a definition of the powers
of government" placed upon the judiciary the great burden of
"determining the nature, scope and extent of such powers" and
stressed that "when the judiciary mediates to allocate constitutional
boundaries, it does not assert any superiority over the other departments * * *
but only asserts the solemn and sacred obligation entrusted to it by the
Constitution to determine conflicting claims of authority under the
Constitution and to establish for the parties in an actual controversy the

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court held in <span class="SpellE"><i style="">Tolentino</i></span><span style=""> </span>that:</p>

<blockquote>“<span style="">*</span><span style=""> </span>* * as to
matters not related to its internal operation and the performance of its
assigned mission to propose amendments to the Consti­tution, the Convention and
its officers and members are all subject to <i style="">all</i><span style=""> </span>the provisions of the existing
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now <span class="GramE">We</span>
hold that even as to its latter task of proposing amendments to the
Constitution, it is subject to the provisions of Section 1 of <i style="">Article XV</i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>This must be so,
because it is plain to <span class="GramE">Us</span> that the framers of the
Constitution took care that the process of amending the same should <i style="">not</i><span style=""> </span>be undertaken with the same <i style="">ease</i><span style=""> </span>and <i style="">facility</i><span style=""> in </span>changing
an ordinary legislation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Constitution
making is the most valued power, second to <span class="GramE">none,</span> of
the people in a constitutional democracy such as the one our founding fathers
have chosen for this nation, and which we of the succeeding generations
generally cherish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And because the
Constitution affects the <i style="">lives, fortunes,
future </i><span style="">and</span><i style=""> every other conceivable aspect</i><span style=""> </span>of the lives of <i style="">all</i><span style=""> </span>the <i style="">people</i><span style=""> </span>within the country and those subject to its sovereignty, every degree
of care is taken in preparing and drafting it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A constitution worthy of the people for which it is intended must not be
prepared in haste without adequate deliberation and study.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is obvious that correspondingly, <i style="">any amendment</i><span style=""> </span>of the Consti­tution is of no less importance than the whole
Constitution itself, and perforce must be conceived and prepared with as much
care and deliberation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the very
nature of things, the drafters of an original constitution, as already observed
earlier, operate, without any limitations, restraints or inhibitions save those
that they may impose upon themselves.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is not necessarily true of subsequent conventions called to amend
the original constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Generally,
the framers of the latter see to it that their handiwork is not lightly treated
and as easily mutilated or changed, not only for reasons purely personal but
more importantly, because written constitutions are supposed to be designed so
as to last for some time, if not for ages, or for, at least, as long as they
can be adopted to the needs and exigencies of the people, hence, they must be <i style="">insulated</i><span style=""> </span>against precipitate and hasty actions motivated by more or less
passing political moods or fancies.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, as a rule, the original constitutions carry with them limitations
and conditions, more or <i>less stringent, made so by the people themselves</i><span style="">, in </span>regard to the process of their <i style="">amendment</i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>And when such
limitations or conditions are so incorporated in the original consti­tution, it
does not lie in the delegates of any subsequent convention to claim that they
may ignore and disregard such conditions because they are as powerful and
omnipotent as their original counterparts."<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<span class="SpellE"><i style="">Tolentino</i></span><span style=""> </span>concurring with this Court's denial
of the motion for reconsideration, succinctly restated this Court's position oh
the fundamentals, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>– On the premature submission of a partial amendment proposal, with
a "temporary provi­sional or tentative character": — "* * * a
partial amendment would deprive the voters of the context which is usually
necessary for them to make a <i style="">reasonably
intelligent appraisal</i><span style=""> </span>of
the issue sub­mitted for their ratification or rejection. * * * Then, too, the
submission to a plebiscite of a partial amendment, without a <i style="">definite frame of reference</i><span style="">, </span>is fraught with possibilities which
may jeopardize the social fabric.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
one thing, it opens the door to wild speculations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It offers ample opportunities for overzealous
leaders and members of opposing political camps to unduly exaggerate the pros
and cons of the partial amendment proposed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In short, it is apt to breed <i style="">false
hopes</i><span style=""> </span>and create <i style="">wrong impressions</i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>As a consequence, it is
bound to unduly strain the people's faith in the soundness and validity of
democratic processes and institutions."</blockquote>

<blockquote>– On the plea to allow submission to the sovereign people of the
"fragmentary and incomplete" proposal, although inconsistent with the
letter and spirit of the Constitution:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The view, has, also, been advanced that the foregoing
considerations are not decisive on the issue before Us, inasmuch as the <i style="">people are sovereign</i><span style="">, </span>and the partial amendment involved
in this case is being submitted to them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The issue before <span class="GramE">Us</span> is whether or not said
partial amendment <i style="">may</i><span style=""> </span>be <i style="">validly submitted</i><span style=""> </span>to
the people for ratification 'in a plebiscite to coincide with the local
elections in November 1971,' and <i style="">this</i><span style=""> </span>particular issue will <i style="">not</i><span style=""> </span>be submitted to the people.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is more, the Constitution does <i style="">not</i><span style=""> </span>permit its submission to the
people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question sought to be
settled in the scheduled plebiscite is whether or not the people are in favor
of the reduction of the voting age."</blockquote>

<blockquote>– On <span style="">a "</span><i style="">political</i><span style="">" </span>rather than <span style="">"</span><i style="">legalistic</i><span style="">" </span>approach:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Is
this approach to the problem too ‘<i style="">legalistic</i><span style="">?’ </span>This term has several possible
connotations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may mean <i style="">strict adherence to the law</i><span style="">, </span>which in the case at bar is the <i style="">Supreme Law</i><span style=""> </span>of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this
point, suffice it to say that, in compliance with the specific mandate of such
Supreme Law, the members of the Supreme Court have taken the requisite 'oath to
support and defend the Constitution.' * * * Then, again, the <span style="">term ‘</span><i style=""><span style="">legalistic’</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">may </span>be used to suggest inversely that
the somewhat strained interpretation of the Constitution being urged upon this
Court be <i style="">tolerated</i><span style=""> </span>or, at least, <i style="">overlooked</i><span style="">, </span>upon
the theory that the partial amendment on the voting age is badly needed and
reflects the will of the people, specially the youth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This course of action favors, in effect, the
adoption of a <i style="">political approach</i><span style="">, </span>inasmuch as the advisability of the
amendment and <span style="">an </span><span style="">appraisal of </span>the people's feeling thereon are
<i style="">political matters</i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In
fact, apart from the obvious message of the mass media, and, at times, of the
pulpit, the Court has been literally bombarded with scores of handwritten
letters, almost all of which bear the penmanship and the signature of girls, as
well as the letterhead of some sectarian educational institutions, generally
stating that the writer is 18 years of age and urging that she or he be allowed
to vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the pressure of public
opinion has been brought to bear heavily upon the Court for a reconsideration
of its decision in the case at bar.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As above stated, however, the <i style="">wisdom</i><span style=""> </span>of the
amendment and the <i style="">popularity</i><span style=""> </span>thereof are political questions
beyond our province.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact,

that <span class="GramE">We</span> have no jurisdiction to entertain the petition
herein, upon the ground that the issue therein raised is a political one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from the absence of authority to pass
upon political question, it is obviously improper and unwise for the bench to
delve into such questions owing to the danger of <i style="">getting involved in politics</i><span style="">,
</span>more likely of a partisan nature, and, hence, of impairing the image and

may be considered as valid; the allegedly huge and uniform votes reported; and
many others.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. These questions only serve to justify <span style="">and show the </span>basic validity of the
universal principle governing written constitutions that proposed amendments
thereto or in replacement thereof may be ratified only in the particular mode
or manner prescribed therein by the people.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under Article XV, section 1 of our Constitution, amendments thereto may
be ratified only in the <i style=""><span style="">one</span></i><span style=""> way </span>therein provided, <span class="SpellE"><i>i</i></span>. <i>e</i>. in an election or plebiscite held in
accordance with law and duly supervised by the Commission Elections, and which
is participated in only by qualified and duly registered voters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this manner, the safeguards provided by
the election code generally assure the true ascertainment of the results of the
vote and interested parties would have an opportunity to thresh out properly
before the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> all such questions in
pre-proclamation proceedings.</p>

observed, the cases at bar need not reach <span style="">the
</span>stage of answering the host of questions, raised by petitioners against
the procedure observed by the Citizens Assemblies and the reported referendum
results — since the purported ratification is rendered nugatory by virtue of
such non-observance.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">ZALDIVAR, <i>J.</i>:<span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In these five cases, the main issue to be resolved by this Court
is whether or not the Constitution proposed by the Constitutional Convention of
1971 had been ratified in accordance with the provisions of Article XV of the
1935 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the plebiscite
cases, which were decided by this Court on January 22, 1973',<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
I held the view that this issue could be properly resolved by this Court, and
that it was in the public interest that this Court should declare then whether
or not the proposed Constitution, had been validly ratified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The majority of this Court, however, was of
the view that the issue was not squarely raised in those cases, and so the
Court, as a body, did not make any categorical pronouncement on the question of
whether or not the Constitution proposed by the 1971 Convention was validly
ratified I was the only one who expressed the opinion that the proposed
Constitution was not validly ratified and therefore "it should not be
given force and effect."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is now called upon to declare, and to inform the people
of this country, whether or not that proposed Constitution had been validly
ratified and had come into effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, however, contends that this Court has no
jurisdiction to resolve the issue that we have mentioned because that issue is
a political question that cannot be decided by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contention of the Solicitor General is
untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A political question relates
to "those questions which under the Constitution are to be decided by the
people in their sovereign capacity or in regard to which full discretionary
authority has been delegated to the legislative, or to the executive, branch of
the government.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The courts have the power to determine whether the acts of the executive are
authorized by the Constitution and the laws whenever they are brought before
the court in a judicial proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
judicial department of the government exercises a sort of controlling, or
rather restraining, power over the two other departments of the
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each of the three
departments, within its proper constitutional sphere, acts independently of the
other, and restraint is only placed on one department when that sphere is
actually transcended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While a court may
not restrain the executive from committing an unlawful act, it may, when the
legality of such an act is brought before it in a judicial proceeding, declare
it to be void, the same as it may declare a law enacted by the legislature to
be unconstitutional.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
It is a settled doctrine that every officer under a constitutional government
must act according to law and subject to its <span class="GramE">restrictions,</span>
and every departure <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, or disregard thereof,
must subject him to the restraining and controlling power of the people, acting
through the agency of the judiciary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
must be remembered that the people act through the courts, as well as through
the executive or the legislature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
department is just as representative as the other, and the judiciary is the
department which is charged with the special duty of determining the
limitations which the law places upon all official actions.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>In the case of Gonzales <i>vs</i>.
Commission on Elections<span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>this Court ruled that the issue as to
whether or not a resolution of Congress acting as a constituent assembly
violates the Constitution is not a political question and is therefore subject
to judicial review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>,
this Court held that the exception to the rule that courts will not interfere
with a political question affecting another department is when such political
question involves an issue as to the construction and interpretation of the
provisions of the constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">And so, </span>it
has been held that the question of whether a constitution shall be amended or <span style="">not is a political question which is not in
the power of the court to decide, but whether or not the constitution has been
legally amended is a <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> question.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">My study on the subject of whether a question before the court is
political or judicial, based on decisions of the courts in the United States -
where, after all, our constitutional system has been patterned to a large
extent - made me arrive at the considered view that it is in the power of this
Court, as the ultimate interpreter of <span style="">the
</span>Constitution, to determine the validity of the proposal, the submission,
and the ratification of any change in the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ratifica­tion or non-ratification of a
constitutional amendment is a vital element in the procedure to amend the
constitution, and I believe that the Court can inquire into, and decide on, the
question of whether or not an amendment to the constitution, as in the present
cases, has been ratified in accordance with the requirements prescribed in the
Constitution that was amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so,
in the cases now before Us, I believe that the question of whether or not the
Constitution proposed by the 1971 Constitutional Convention had been validly
ratified or not is a <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> question.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Chief Justice, in his opinion, has discussed lengthily the
subject on whether or not, the cases, before <span class="GramE">Us</span>
involve a political, or a judicial, question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I fully concur with his conclusion that the question involved in these
cases is <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the question now of whether or not the Constitution proposed
by the 1971 Constitutional Convention has been validly ratified, I am
reproducing herein pertinent portions of my dissenting opinion in the
plebiscite cases:</p>

<blockquote>"The ratification of the Constitution proposed by the 1971
Constitutional Convention must be done in accordance with the provisions of
Section I, Article XV of the 1935 Constitution of the Philippines, which reads:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">‘Section 1.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Congress in <span style="">joint </span>session assembled by a vote of three fourths of all the
Members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives voting <span class="GramE">separately,</span> may propose amendments to the Constitution or
call a convention for that purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
amendments shall be valid as part of this Constitution when approved by a
majority of <span style="">the votes cast at an
election at which the amendments are submitted to the people for their
ratification.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It is in consonance with the above-quoted provision of the
1935 Constitution that on <st1:date year="1967" day="16" month="3">March 16,
 1967</st1:date>, the Congress of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
passed Resolution No. 2 calling <span style="">a </span>convention
to propose amendments to the Constitution of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sec. 7 of said Resolution No. 2 reads as
follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">'SECTION 7.</span> The amendments proposed by the
Convention shall be valid and considered part of the Constitution when approved
by a majority of the votes cast in an election at which they are submitted to
the people for their ratification pursuant to Article XV of the Constitution.'</p>

<blockquote>"It follows that from the very resolution of the Congress of the
Philippines which called for the 1971 Constitutional Convention there was a
clear mandate that the amendments proposed by the 1971 Convention, in order to
be valid and <span style="">considered part of the
Constitution, </span>must be approved by majority of the votes cast in an
election at which they are submitted to the people for their ratification as
provided in the Constitution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This Court, in the case of <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
<i>vs</i>. Commission on Elections, L-35140, <st1:date year="1971" day="16" month="10"><span class="GramE">October</span> 16, 1971</st1:date> (41 SCRA 715),
speaking through Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, said:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘The Constitutional Convention of 1971, as any other convention of
the same nature, <i style=""><span style="">owes its existence and derives all its authority and power from the
existing Constitution of the </span></i><st1:country-region><st1:place><i style=""><span style="">Philippines</span></i></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>This Convention has not been called by
the people directly as in the case of a revolutionary convention which drafts
the first Constitution of an entirely new government born of either a war of
liberation from a mother country or of a revolution against an existing
government or of a bloodless seizure of power <i>a </i><i><span style="">la coup <span class="SpellE">d'etat</span></span></i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>As to such kind of conventions, it is
absolutely true that the convention is completely without restraint and
omnipotent all wise, and it is as to such conventions that the remarks of
Delegate Manuel <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> of <span style="">the Constitutional Convention of 1934 quoted by Senator <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span> refer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
amount of rationalization can belie the fact that the current convention came
into being only because it was called by a resolution of a joint session of
Congress acting as a constituent assembly by authority of Section 1, Article XV
of the present Constitution * *<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">'As to matters not related to its internal operation and the
performance of its assigned mission to propose amendments to the Constitution,
the Convention and its officers and members are <i style="">all subject to all the provisions of the existing Constitution</i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Now
we hold that even as to its latter <i style="">task

<blockquote>"In Proclamation No. 1102, issued on January 17, 1973, the
President of the Philippines certified that as a result of the voting before
the <span class="SpellE">barangays</span> (Citizens' Assemblies) 14, 976,561
members of the <span class="SpellE">barangays</span> voted for the adoption of
the proposed Constitution, as against 743,869 who voted for its rejection, and
on the basis of the overwhelming majority of the votes cast by the members of
all the <span class="SpellE">barangays</span> throughout the Philippines the
President proclaimed that the Constitution proposed by the 1971 Convention has
been ratified and has thereby come into effect.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is very plain from <span style="">the
very </span>wordings of Proclamation No. 1102 that the provisions of Section 1
of Article XV of the Constitution of 1935 were not complied with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not necessary that evidence be produced
before this Court to show that no elections were held in accordance with the
provisions of the Election Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proclamation
No. 1102 <span class="SpellE">unequivocably</span> states that the proposed
Constitution of 1972 was voted upon by the <span class="SpellE">barangays</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is very clear, therefore, that the voting
held in these <span class="SpellE">barangays</span> is not the election
contemplated in the provisions of Section 1, Article XV, of the 1935
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The election contemplated
in said constitutional provision is an election held in accordance with the
provisions of the election law, where only the qualified and registered voters
of the country would cast their votes, where official ballots prepared for the
purpose are used, where the voters would prepare their ballots in secret inside
the voting booths in the polling places established in the different election
precincts throughout the country, where the election is conducted by election
inspectors duly appointed in accordance with the election law, where the votes
are canvassed and reported in a manner provided for in the election law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was this kind of election that was held on
May 14, 1935, when the Constitution of 1935 was ratified; on April 30, 1937,
when the amendment to the Constitution providing for Women's Suffrage was
ratified; on June 18, 1940, when the 1940 Amendments to the Constitution were
ratified; on March 11, 1947 when the Parity Amendment to the Constitution was
ratified; and on November 14, 1967 when the amendments to the Constitution to
increase the number of Members of the House of Representatives and to allow the
Members of Congress to run in the elections for Delegates to the Constitutional
Convention of 1971 were rejected.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I cannot see any valid reason why the practice or procedure
in the past, in implementing the constitutional provision requiring the holding
of an election to ratify or reject an amendment to the Constitution, has not
been followed in the case of the Constitution proposed by the 1971 Constitutional
Convention.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is my view that the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
cannot by decree order the ratification of the proposed 1972 Constitution thru
a voting in the <span class="SpellE">barangays</span> and make said result the
basis for proclaiming the ratification of the proposed consti­tution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is very clear, to me, that Proclamation
No. 1102 was issued in complete disregard or in violation, of the provisions of
Section 1 of Article XV of the 1935 Constitution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Proclamation No. 1102 mentions, furthermore, that on the
question as to whether or not the people would still like a plebiscite to be
called to ratify the new Constitution, 14,298,814 members of the <span class="SpellE">barangays</span> answered that there was no need for a plebiscite
but that the vote of the <span class="SpellE">barangays</span> should be
considered a vote in a plebiscite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
would thus appear that the <span class="SpellE">barangays</span> assumed the
power to determine whether a plebiscite as ordained in the Constitution <span class="GramE">be</span> held or not.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the provision of Section 1, Article XV of the Constitution was
completely disregarded.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The affirmative votes cast in the <span class="SpellE">barangays</span>
are not the votes contemplated in Section 1 of Article XV of the 1935
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The votes contemplated in
said constitutional provision are votes obtained through the election processes

Presidential Decree No. 73, is that there is no freedom on the part of the
people to exercise their right of choice, because of the existence of martial
law in our country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same ground
holds true as regards the voting of the <span class="SpellE">barangays</span> on <st1:date year="1973" day="10" month="1">January 10 to 15, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More so, because by General Order No. 20,
issued on January 7, 1973, the President of the Philippines ordered 'that the
provisions of Section 3 of Presidential Decree No. 73 in so far as they allow
free public discussion of the proposed constitution, as well as my order of
December 17, 1972 temporarily suspending the effects of Proclamation No. 1081
for the purpose of free and open debate on the proposed constitution, be
suspended in the meantime.' It is, therefore, my view that voting in the <span class="SpellE">barangays</span> on <st1:date year="1973" day="10" month="1">January
 10-15, 1973</st1:date> was not free, and so this is one added reason why the
results of the voting in the <span class="SpellE">barangays</span> should not be
made the basis for the proclamation of the ratification of the proposed
Constitution.</blockquote>

repugnant to the 1935 Constitution, and so it is invalid, and should not be

proposed by the 1971 Constitutional Convention should be considered as not yet

<p class="BODY">The term "election" as used in Section 1 of Article XV
of the 1935 Constitution should be construed along with the term
"election" as used in the provisions of Section <span style="">4 of </span>the
Philippine Independence Act of the Congress of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, popularly known as the <span class="SpellE">Tydings</span>-McDuffie Law (Public Act No. 127).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said Section 4 of the <span class="SpellE">Tydings</span>-McDuffie

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><span style="">"</span><i style="">Section</i><span style=""> </span><i style="">4</i><span style="">.</span></span><span style=""> </span>After the President of the United States has certified that the

from the Philippine Legislature, issue a proclamation for the <i style="">election</i><span style=""> </span>of officers of the government of the Commonwealth of the
Philippine Islands provided for in the Constitution * * *."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It can safely be said, therefore, that when the framers of the
1935 Constitution used the word "election" in Section 1 of Article XV
of the 1935 Constitution they had no other idea in mind except the elections
that were periodically held in the Philippines for the choice of public
officials prior to the drafting of the 1935 Constitution, and also the
"election" mentioned <span style="">in </span>the
Independence Act at which "the qualified voters of the Philippines Islands
shall have an opportunity to vote directly for or <span style="">against </span>the proposed constitution * * *." It is but logical
to expect that the framers of the 1935 Constitution would provide a mode of
ratifying an amendment to that Constitution similar to the mode of ratifying
the original Constitution itself.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>It is clear, therefore,
that the ratification of any amendment to the 1935 Constitution could only be
done by holding an election, as the term "election" was understood,
and practiced, when the 1935 Constitution was drafted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged <span class="SpellE">referedum</span>
in the citizens assemblies — participated in by persons aged 15 years or more,
regardless of whether they were qualified voters or not, voting by raising
their hands, and the results of the voting repotted by the barrio or <span style="">ward </span>captain to the municipal mayor,
who in turn submitted the report to the Provincial Governor, and the latter
forwarding the reports to the Department of Local Governments, all without the
intervention of the Commission on Elections which is the constitutional body
which has exclusive charge of the enforcement and administration of all laws
relative to the conduct of elections — was not only a non-substantial
compliance with the provisions of Section 1 of Article XV of the 1935
Constitution but a downright violation of said constitutional provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be indulging in sophistry to
maintain that the voting in the citizens assemblies amounted to a substantial
compliance with the requirements prescribed in Section 1 of Article XV of the
1935 Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is further contended by the Solicitor General, that even if
the Constitution proposed by the 1971 Constitutional Convention was not
ratified in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of Article XV of the
1935 Constitu­tion, the fact is that after the President of the Philippines had
issued Proclamation No. 1102 declaring that the said proposed Constitution
"has been ratified by an overwhelming majority of all the votes cast by
the members of all the <span class="SpellE">barangays</span> (citizens
assemblies) throughout the Philippines and had thereby come into effect"
the people have accepted the new Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What appears to me, however, is that practically it is only the
officials and employees under the executive department of the Government who
have been performing their duties apparently in observance of the provisions of
the new Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could not be
otherwise, because the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
who is the head of the executive department, had proclaimed that the new
Constitution had come into effect, and his office had taken the steps to
implement the provisions of the new Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True it <span class="GramE">is,</span> that
some 92 members of the House of Representatives and 15 members of the Senate,
of the Congress of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
had expressed their option to serve in the interim National Assembly that is
provided for in Section 2 <span style="">of </span>Article XVII of the proposed Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted, however, that of the 15
senators who expressed their option to serve in the interim National Assembly
only one of them took his oath of office; and of the 92 members of the House of
Representatives who opted to serve in the interim National Assembly, only 22
took their oath of office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact,
that only one Senator out of 25, and only 22 Representatives out of 110, took
their oath of office, is an indication that only a small portion of the members
of Congress had manifested their acceptance of the new Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is in the taking of the oath of office
where the affiant says that he swears to "support and defend the
Constitution" that the acceptance of the Constitution is made
manifest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I agree with counsel for
petitioners in L-36165 (Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, et al. <i style=""><span style="">vs</span></i><span style="">. </span>Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>, et al) when he said that the members of Congress

of a precaution, or making sure, that in the event the anew Constitution
becomes definitely effective and the interim National Assembly is convened they
can participate in legislative work in their capacity as duly elected
representatives of the people, which otherwise they could not do if they did
not manifest their option to serve, and that option had to be made within 30
days from January 17, 1973, the date when Proclamation No. 1102 was
issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, if the proposed
Constitution does not become effective, they continue to be members of Congress
under the 1935 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let it be considered
that the members of the House of Representatives were elected in 1969 to serve
a term which will yet expire on <st1:date year="1973" day="31" month="12">December
 31, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereas, of the
Senators who opted to serve in the interim National Assembly, the term of some
of them will yet expire on December 31, 1973, some on December 31, 1975, and
the rest on December 31, 1977.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let it be
noted that 9 Senators did not opt to serve in the interim National Assembly,
and 18 members of the House of Representatives also <span style="">did </span>not opt to serve in the interim National Assembly.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can it <span style="">be </span>said

the truthfulness and accuracy of the reports of the voting in the citizens
assemblies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This doubt has been
engendered in my mind after a careful examination and study of the records of
these cases, particularly with respect to the reports of the voting in the <span class="GramE">citizens</span> assemblies.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Perhaps, it may be said that the people, or the inhabitants of this
country, have acquiesced to the new Constitution, in the sense that they have
continued to live peacefully and orderly under the government that has been
existing since <st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1973</st1:date>
when it was proclaimed that the new Constitution came into effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But what could the people do?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same way that the people have lived
under martial law since <st1:date year="1972" day="23" month="9">September 23,
 1972</st1:date>, they also have to live under the government as it now exists,
and as it has existed since the declaration of martial law on <st1:date year="1972" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1972</st1:date>, regardless of
what Constitution is operative - whether it is the 1935 Constitution or the new
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, there is nothing
that the people can do under the circumstances, known to all, and which I do
not consider necessary to state in this opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I cannot agree, therefore, with my worthy
colleagues in the Court who hold the view that the people have accepted the new
Constitution, and that because the people have accepted it, the new
Constitution should be considered as in force, regardless of the fact that it
was not ratified in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of Article XV
of the 1935 Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is my honest view that the Constitution proposed by the 1971
Constitutional Convention has not come into effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do not say, however, that the proposed
Constitution is invalid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To me, the
validity of the proposed Constitution is not in issue in the cases before <span class="GramE">Us</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the
petitioners assail is not the validity of the proposed Constitution but the
validity of Presidential Proclamation No. 1102 which declares the proposed
Constitution as having been ratified and has come into effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It being my considered view that the
ratification of the proposed Constitution as proclaimed in Proclamation 1102,
is not in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of Article XV of the 1935
Constitution, I hold that Proclamation No. 1102 is invalid and should not be
given force and effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proposed
Constitution, therefore, should be considered as not yet validly ratified, and
so it is not in force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proposed
Constitution may still be submitted to a plebiscite in conformity with Section
1 of Article XV of the 1935 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Incidentally, I must state that the 1935 Constitution is still in force,
and this Court is still functioning under the 1935 Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">I sincerely believe that the proposed Constitution may still be
submitted to the people in an election or plebiscite held in accordance with
the provisions of Section 1 of Article XV of the 1935 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, as we have adverted to in this
opinion, this was the mandate of Congress when, on <st1:date year="1967" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1967</st1:date>, it passed Resolution No. 2 calling
a convention to propose amendments to the 1935 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court may take judicial notice of the
fact that the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
has reassured the nation that the government of our Republic since the
declaration of martial law is not a revolutionary government, and that he has
been acting all the way in consonance with his powers under the
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="GramE">people
of this Republic has</span> reason to be happy because, according to the
President, we still have a constitutional government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It being my view that the 1935 Constitution
is still in force, I believe Congress may still convene and pass a law calling
for an election at which the Constitution proposed by the 1971 Constitutional
Convention will he submitted to the people for their ratification or rejection.
s A plebiscite called pursuant to Section <span style="">1
</span>of Article XV of the 1935 Constitution is <span style="">an </span>assurance to our people that we still have in our country the
Rule of Law, and that the democratic system of government that has been implanted
in our country by the Americans, and which has become a part of our social and
political fabric, is still a reality.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The views that I have
expressed in this opinion are inspired by a desire on my part to bring about
stability in the democratic and constitutional system in our country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I feel that if this Court would give its
imprimatur to the ratification of the proposed Constitution, as announced in
Proclamation No. 1102, it being very clear that the provisions of Section 1 of
Article XV of the 1935 Constitution had not been complied with, We will be
opening the gates for a similar disregard of the Constitution in the
future.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What I mean is that if this
Court now declares that a new Constitution is now in force because the members
of the citizens assemblies had approved said new Constitution, although that
approval was not in accordance with the procedure and the requirements
prescribed in the 1935 Constitution, it can happen again in some future time
that some amendments to the Constitution may be adopted, even in a manner
contrary to the existing Constitution and the law, and then said proposed
amendment is submitted to the people in any manner and what will matter is that
a basis is claimed that there was approval by the people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There will not be stability in our constitutional
system, and necessarily no stability in our government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a member of this Court I only wish to
contribute my humble efforts to prevent the happening of such a situation in
the future.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It appearing to me that
the announced ratification of the proposed Constitution through the voting in
the <span class="GramE">citizens</span> assemblies is a clear violation of the
1935 Constitution, what </span>I <span style="">say in
this opinion is simply an endeavor on my part to be true to my oath of office
to defend and support the 1935 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="">I </span><span style="">am inspired by what the great jurist and
statesman, Jose </span><span style="">P. </span><span style="">Laurel, said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>"Let our judges be as
it were the vestal keepers of the purity and sanctity of our Constitution, and
the protection and vindication <span style="">of </span>popular
rights will be safe and secure in their reverential guardianship."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">I only wish to help prevent, if <span style="">I </span>can, democracy, and the liberties of
our people from vanishing in our land, because, as Justice George Sutherland of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
Supreme Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"(t<span class="GramE">)he</span> saddest epitaph which can be
carved in memory of a vanished liberty is that it was lost because its
possessors failed to stretch forth a saving hand while yet there was
time."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I
</span>concur fully with the personal views expressed by the Chief Justice in
the opinion that he has written in these cases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Along with him, I vote to deny the motion to dismiss and to give due
course to the petitions in these cases.</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">MAKALINTAL and CASTRO, <i style="">JJ.</i><span style="">:</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The preliminary question before this Court was whether or not the
petitioners had made out a sufficient <i style="">prima
facie</i><span style=""> </span>case in their
petitions to justify their being given due course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering on the one hand the urgency of
the matter and on the other hand its transcendental importance, which suggested
the need for hearing the side of the respondents before that preliminary
question was resolved, We required them -to submit their comments on the
petitions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the comments were filed
We considered them as motions to dismiss so that they could be orally
argued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it turned out, the hearing
lasted five days, morning and afternoon, and could not have been more
exhaustive if the petitions had been given due course from the beginning.</p>

<p class="BODY">The major thrust of the petitions is that the act of the Citizens
Assemblies as certified and proclaimed by the President on January 17, 1973
(Proclamation No. 1102) was not an act of ratification, let alone a valid one,
of the proposed Constitution, because it was not in accordance with, the
existing Constitution (of 1935) and the Election Code of 1971.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other grounds are relied upon by the
petitioners in support of their basic proposition, but to our mind they are
merely subordinate and peripheral.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article XV, Section 1, of the 1935 Constitution provides that
amendments (proposed either by Congress in joint session or by a Convention
called by it for the purpose) "shall be valid as part-of this Constitution
when approved by a majority of the votes cast at an <i style=""><span style="">election</span></i><span style=""> at </span>which
the amendments are submitted to the people for their ratification." At the
time that Constitution was approved by the Constitutional Convention on
February 8, 1935, and ratified in a plebiscite held on the following May 14,
the word "election" had already a definite meaning in our law and
jurisprudence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not a vague and
amorphous concept, but a procedure prescribed by statute for ascertaining the
people's choices among candidates for public offices, or their will on
important matters submitted to them, pursuant to law, for approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was in this sense that the word was used
by the framers in Article XV (also in Articles VI and VII), and in accordance
with such procedure that plebiscites were held to ratify the very same
Constitution in 1935 as well <span style="">as </span>the
subsequent amendments thereto, thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in
1939 (Ordinance appended to the Constitution); 1940 (establishment of a
bicameral legislature; eligibility of the President and the Vice-President for
reelection; creation of the Commission of Elections); 1947 (Parity Amendment); <span style="">and 1967 (increase in membership of the House
of Representatives and eligibility of members of Congress to run for the
Constitutional Convention without forfeiture of their offices).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Election Code of 1971, in its Section 2, states that
"all elections of public officers except barrio officials and <i style=""><span style="">plebiscites</span></i><span style=""> </span>shall be
conducted in the manner provided by this Code." This is statutory
requirement designed, as were the other election laws previously in force, to
carry out the constitutional mandate relative to the exercise of the right of
suffrage, and with specific reference to the term "plebiscites," the
provision of Article XV regarding ratification of constitutional amendments.</p>

<p class="BODY">The manner of conducting elections and plebiscites provided by
the Code is spelled out in other sections thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 99 requires that qualified voters be
registered in a permanent list, the qualifications being those set forth in
Article V, Section 1, of the 1935 Constitution on the basis of age, (21),
literacy and residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
qualifications are reiterated in Section 101 of the Election Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 102 enumerates the classes of persons
disqualified to vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Succeeding sections
prescribe the election paraphernalia to be used, the procedure for registering
voters, the records of registration and the custody thereof, the description
and printing of official ballots, the actual casting of votes and their
subsequent counting by the boards of inspectors, the rules for appreciation of
ballots, and then the canvass and proclamation of the results.</p>

<p class="BODY">With specific reference to the ratification of the 1972 draft
constitution, several additional circumstances should be considered:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(1) This draft was
prepared and approved by a Convention which had been convened pursuant to
Resolution No. 2 passed by Congress on <st1:date year="1967" day="16" month="3">March
 16, 1967</st1:date>, which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 7. The amendments proposed by the Convention shall be
valid and considered part of the Constitution when approved by a majority of
the <i style=""><span style="">votes
cast in an election</span></i><span style=""> </span>at which they are submitted to the people
for their ratification pursuant to Article XV of the Constitution."</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article XVII, Section
16, of the draft itself states:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 16. This Constitution shall take effect immediately upon
its ratification by a majority of the <i style=""><span style="">votes cast in a plebiscite</span></i><span style=""> </span>called for
the purpose and, except as herein provided, shall supersede the Constitution of
nineteen hundred and thirty-five and all amendments thereto."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The same procedure is prescribed in
Article XVI, Section 2, for the ratification of any future amendment to or
revision of the said Constitution.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(3) After the draft
Constitution was approved by the Constitutional Convention on November 30, 1972
the said body adopted Resolution No. 5843, proposing "to President
Ferdinand E. Marcos that a decree be issued calling a <i style="">plebiscite</i><span style=""> </span>for the
ratification of the proposed New Constitution on such appropriate date as he
shall determine and providing for the necessary funds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>."
Pursuant to said Resolution the President issued Decree No. 73 on the same day,
calling a plebiscite to be held on <st1:date year="1973" day="15" month="1">January
 15, 1973</st1:date>, at which the proposed Constitution "shall be
submitted to the people for ratification or rejection." The Decree had
eighteen (18) sections in all, prescribing in detail the different steps to be
taken to carry out the <span style="">process </span>of
ratification, such as:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) publication
of the proposed Constitution in English and Pilipino; (b) freedom of
information and discussion; (c) registration of voters; (d) appointment of
boards of election inspectors and designation of watchers in each precinct; (e)
printing of official ballots; manner of voting to insure freedom and secrecy
thereof; canvass of plebiscite returns; and (h) in general, compliance with the
provisions of the Election Code of 1971, with the Commission on Elections
exercising its<span style="">&nbsp; </span>constitutional and
statutory powers of supervision of the entire process.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There can hardly be any
doubt that in everybody's view from the framers of the 1935 Constitution
through all the Congresses since then to the 1971 Constitutional Convention </span>amendments
to the Constitution should be ratified in only one way, that is, in an election
or plebiscite held in accordance with law and participated in only by qualified
and duly registered voters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, so
concerned was this Court with the importance and indispensability of complying
with the mandate of the (1935) Constitution in this respect that in the recent
case of <span class="SpellE"><i style=""><span style="">Tolentino</span></i></span><i style=""><span style=""> vs. Commission
on Elections</span></i><span style="">, </span>No. L-34150; October 16, 1971 (41 SCRA 702), a <span style="">re</span>solution of the (1971)
Constitutional Convention submitting a proposed amendment for ratification to a
plebiscite to be held in November 1971 was declared null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amendment sought to reduce the voting age
from twenty-one to eighteen years and was approved by the Convention for
submission to a plebiscite ahead of and separately from other amendments still
being or to be considered by it, so as to enable the youth to be thus
enfranchised to participate in the plebiscite for the ratifi<span style="">cation of such other amendments later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court held that such separate submission
was <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of Article XV, Section 1, of the
Constitution, which contemplated that "all the amendments to be proposed
by the same Convention must be submitted to the people in a single ‘election'
or plebiscite."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Thus a grammatical construction based on a
singular, instead of plural, rendition of the word "election" was
considered a sufficient ground to rule out the plebiscite which had been called
to ratify a proposed amendment in accordance with the procedure and under all
the safeguards provided in the Election Law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the cases now before
Us what </span>is at issue is not merely <span style="">the
ratification of just one amendment, as in <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> </span><i style=""><span style="">vs</span></i><span style="">. </span><span style="">COMELEC, but the ratification of an entire
charter setting up a new form of government; and the issue has arisen not
because of a disputed construction of one word or one provision in the 1935
Constitution but because no election or plebiscite in accordance with that
Constitution and with the Election Code of 1971 was held for the purpose of
such ratification.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Citizens Assemblies
which purportedly ratified the draft Constitution were created by Presidential
Decree No. 86 dated </span><st1:date year="1972" day="31" month="12"><span style="">December 31, 1972</span></st1:date><span style="">, "to broaden the base of citizen
participation in the democratic process and to afford ample opportunities for
the citizenry to </span><i style=""><span style="">express their views</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">on important national issues." The
Assemblies "shall consist of all persons </span>who are residents of the
barrio, district or ward for at least six months, <i style=""><span style="">fifteen</span></i><span style=""> </span>years of
age or over, citizens of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and who are registered in the lists of Citizen Assembly members kept by the
barrio, district or ward secretary." By Presidential Decree No. 86-A,
dated January 5, 1973, the Assemblies were convened for a referendum between
January 10 and 15, to "consider vital national issues now confronting the
country, like the holding of the plebiscite on the new Constitution, the
continuation of martial rule, the convening of Congress on January 22, 1973,
and the holding of elections in November 1973."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1973" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1973</st1:date>
the newspapers came out with a list of four questions to be submitted to the
Citizens Assemblies, the fourth one being as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"How soon would you like the plebiscite
on the new Constitution to be held?" It should be noted in this connection
that the President had previously announced that he had ordered the
postponement of the plebiscite which he had called for January 15, 1973 (Presidential
Decree No. 73) for the ratification of the draft Constitution, and that he was
considering two new dates for the purpose - February 19 or March 5; that he had
ordered that the registration of voters (pursuant to Decree No. 73) be extended
to accommodate new voters; and that copies of the new Constitution would be
distributed in eight dialects to the people <span style="">(</span><i style=""><span style="">Bulletin Today</span></i><span style="">, </span>December
24, 1972.)</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1973" day="10" month="1">January 10, 1973</st1:date>
it was reported that one more <span style="">question </span>would
be added to the original four which were to be submitted to the Citizens
Assemblies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question concerning the
plebiscite was reworded as follows:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Do you like the plebiscite to be held later?" The implication,
it may likewise be noted, was that the <span style="">Assemblies should express </span>their views as to when
the plebiscite <span style="">should be </span>held, not <span style="">as to </span>whether or not it should be held at
all.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The next day, January 11,
it was reported that six additional questions would be submitted, namely:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do you approve of the citizens <span class="SpellE">assenblies</span> as the base of popular government to decide

<p class="BODY"><span style="">So it was that on </span><st1:date year="1973" day="11" month="1"><span style="">January
 11, 1973</span></st1:date><span style="">, the second
day of the purported referendum, the suggestion was broached, for </span>the
first time, that the plebiscite should be done away with and a favorable vote
by the Assemblies deemed equivalent to ratification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was done, not in the questionnaire
itself, but in the suggested answer to question No. 3. Strangely, however, it
was not similarly suggested that an unfavorable vote be considered as
rejection.</p>

<p class="BODY">There should be no serious dispute as to the fact that the manner
in which the voting was conducted in the Citizens Assemblies, assuming that
such voting was held, was not within the intendment of Article XV, Section 1,
of the 1935 Constitution nor in accordance with the Election Code of 1971.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The referendum can by no means be considered
as the <span style="">plebiscite
</span>contemplated in Section 2 of said Code and in Article XVII, Section 16,
of the draft Constitution itself, or as the <i style=""><span style="">election</span></i><span style=""> </span>intended by Congress when it passed
Resolution No. 2 on March 16, 1967 calling a Convention for the revision of the
1935 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Citizens
Assemblies were not limited to qualified, let alone registered, voters, but
included all citizens from the age of fifteen, and regardless of whether or not
they were illiterates, feeble-minded, or ex-convicts<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
these being the classes of persons expressly disqualified from voting by
Section 102 of the Election Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
short, the constitutional and statutory qualifications were not considered in
the determination of who should participate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No official ballots were used in the <span style="">voting; </span>it was done mostly by acclamation or open show of
hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secrecy, which is one of the
essential features of the election process, was not therefore observed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No set of rules for counting the votes or of
tabulating them and reporting the figures was prescribed or followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission on Elections, which is the
constitutional body charged with the enforcement and administration of all laws
relative to the conduct of elections, took no part of all, either by way of
supervision or in the assessment of the results.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been suggested that since according to Proclamation No.
1102 the overwhelming majority of all the members of the Citizens Assemblies
had voted for the adoption of the proposed Constitution there was a substantial
compliance with Article XV, Section 1, of the 1935 Constitution and with the
Election Code of 1971.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The suggestion
misses the point entirely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is of the
essence of a valid exercise of the right of suffrage that not only must a
majority or plurality of the voters carry the day but that the same must be
duly ascertained in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words the very existence of such
majority or plurality depends upon the manner of its ascertainment, and <span style="">to </span>conclude that it exists even if it
has not been ascertained according to law <span style="">is
</span>simply to beg the issue, or to assume the very fact to be
established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise no election or
plebiscite could be questioned for non-compliance with the provisions of the
Election Law as long as it is certified that a majority of the citizens had
voted favorably or adversely on whatever it was that was submitted to them to
vote upon.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, a finding that the ratification of the draft
Constitution by the Citizens Assemblies, as certified by the President in
Proclamation No. 1102, was not in accordance <span style="">with the constitutional and statutory procedure laid down </span>for
the purpose does not quite resolve the questions raised in these cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a finding, in our opinion, is on a
matter which is essentially <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>, that is,
within the power of this Court to inquire into.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It imports nothing more than a simple reading and application of the
pertinent provisions of the 1935 Constitution, of the Election Code and of
other related laws and official acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
question of wisdom or of policy is involved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But from this finding it does not necessarily follow that this Court may
justifiably declare that the Constitution has not become effective, and for
that reason give due course to these petitions or grant the writs <span style="">herein prayed for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of
the </span>said Constitution, in the final analysis, is the basic and ultimate
question posed by these cases, to resolve which considerations other than
judicial, and therefore beyond the competence of this Court, are relevant and
unavoidable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Several theories have been advanced respectively by the
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners lay stress on
the invalidity of the ratification process adopted by the Citizens Assemblies
and on that premise would have this Court grant the <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>
they seek.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondents represented
by the Solicitor General, whose theory may be taken as the official position of
the Government, challenge the jurisdiction of this Court on the ground that the
questions raised in the petitions are political and therefore non-<span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>, and that in any case popular acquiescence in
the new Constitution and the prospect of unsettling acts done in reliance
thereon should caution against interposition of the power of judicial
review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents Gil J. <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> and Jose Roy (in L-36165), in their respective
capacities as President and President Pro-Tempore of the Senate of the
Philippines, and through their counsel, Senator Arturo <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
likewise invoke the political question doctrine, but on a ground not concurred
in by the Solicitor General, namely, that "the approval of the 1973 Constitution
by the people was made under a revolutionary government, in the course of a
successful political revolution, which was converted by act of the people to
the present <i style=""><span style="">de <span class="SpellE">jure</span></span></i><span style=""> </span>government under the 1973
Constitution."</p>

<p class="BODY">Heretofore, constitutional disputes which have come before this
Court for adjudication proceeded on the assumption, conceded by all, that the
Constitution was in full force and effect, with the power and authority of the
entire Government behind it; and the task of this Court was simply to <span class="SpellE">detemine</span> whether or not the particular act or statute that
was being challenged contravened some rule or mandate of that Constitution. s
The process employed was one of interpretation and synthesis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the cases at bar there is no such
assumption:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the Constitution (1935) has
been derogated and its continued existence as well as the validity of the act
of derogation is the issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The legal
problem posed by the situation is aggravated by the fact that the political
arms of the Government — the Executive Departments and the two Houses of
Congress — have accepted the new Constitution as effective:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the former by organizing themselves and
discharging their functions under it, and the latter by not convening on
January 22, 1973 or at any time thereafter, as ordained by the 1935
Constitution, and in the case of a majority of the members by expressing their
option to serve in the Interim National Assembly in accordance with Article
XVII, Section 2, of the 1973 Constitution.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The theory advanced by Senator <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
as counsel for respondents <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> and Roy, may be
taken up and restated at some length if only because it would constitute, if
sustained, the most convenient ground for the invocation of the
political-question doctrine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support
of his theory, Senator <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> contends that after
President Marcos declared martial law on September 21, 1972 (Proclamation No.
1081) he established a revolutionary government when he issued General Order
No. 1 the next day, wherein he proclaimed "that I shall govern the nation
and direct the operation of the entire government, including all its agencies
and instrumentalities, in my capacity, and shall exercise all the powers and
prerogatives appurtenant and incident to my position as such Commander-in-Chief
of all the Armed Forces of the Philippines." By this order, it is pointed
out, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces assumed all the powers of
government — executive, legislative, and judicial; and thereafter proceeded to
exercise such powers by a series of Orders and Decrees which amounted to
legislative enactments not justified under martial law and, in some instances,
trenched upon the domain of the judiciary, by removing from its jurisdiction
certain classes of cases, such as "those involving the validity, legality,
or constitutionality of Proclamation No. 1081, or of any decree, order or act
issued, promulgated or performed by me or by my duly designated representative
pursuant thereto." (General Order No. 3 as amended by General Order No.
3-A, dated September 24, 1972.) The ratification by the Citizens Assemblies, it
is averred, was the culminating act of the revolution, which thereupon
converted the government into a <i style=""><span style="">de <span class="SpellE">jure</span></span></i><span style=""> </span>one under
the 1973 Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">If indeed it be accepted that the Citizens Assemblies had
ratified the 1973 Constitution and that such ratification as well as the
establishment of the government <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> formed
part of a revolution, albeit peaceful, then the issue of whether or not that
Constitution has become effective and, as a necessary corollary, whether or not
the government legitimately functions under it instead of under the 1935
Constitution, is political and therefore non-judicial in nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under such a postulate what the people did in
the Citizens Assemblies should be taken as an exercise of the ultimate
sovereign power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If they had risen up in
arms and by force deposed the then existing government and set up a new
government in its place, there could not be the least doubt that their act
would be political and not subject to judicial review but only to the judgment
of the same body politic that is the people.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This concept of what is a political act, in the context just set forth,
is based on realities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a new
government gains authority and dominance through force, it can be effectively
challenged only by a stronger force; no judicial dictum can prevail against
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not see that the situation
would be any different, as far as the doctrine of judicial review is concerned,
if no force had been resorted to and the people, in defiance of the existing
Constitution but peacefully because of the absence of any appreciable opposition,
ordained a new Constitution and succeeded in having the government operate
under it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Against such a reality there
can be no adequate judicial relief; and so courts forbear to take cognizance of
the question but leave it to be decided through political means.</p>

<p class="BODY">The logic of the political-question doctrine is illustrated in a
statement of the U.S. Supreme Court in a case<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
relied upon, curiously enough, by the Solicitor General, who disagrees with the
revolutionary-government theory of Senator <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case involved the issue of which of two
opposing government struggling for supremacy in the State of <st1:state><st1:place>Rhode
  Island</st1:place></st1:state> was the lawful one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue had previously come up in several
other cases before the courts of the State, which uniformly held that the
inquiry belonged to the political power and not to the judicial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Commenting on the ruling thus arrived at, the
U.S. Supreme Court said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"And if a State
court should enter upon the inquiry proposed in this case, and should come to
the conclusion that the government under which it acted had been put aside and
displaced by an opposing government, it would cease to be a court, and
incapable of pronouncing a judicial decision upon the question it undertook to
try.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it decides at all as a court, it
necessarily affirms the existence and authority of the government under which
it is exercising judicial power." In other words, since the court would
have no choice but to decide in one way alone in order to be able to decide at
all, the question could not be considered proper for judicial determination.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that the above statement from Luther <i>vs</i>.
Borden would be applicable in the cases at bar only on the premise that the
ratification of the Constitution was a revolutionary act and that the
government now functioning under it is the product of such revolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, we are not prepared to agree that the
premise is justified.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the first place, with
specific<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>reference to the questioned
ratification, several </span>significant circumstances may be noted (1) <span style="">The Citizens </span>Assemblies <span style="">were created, according to Presidential </span>Decree
No. 86, "to broaden the base of citizen participation in the democratic process
and to afford ample opportunities for the citizenry to <i style=""><span style="">express their views</span></i><span style=""> </span>on
important national issues." (2) The President announced, according to the <i style=""><span style="">Daily
Express</span></i><span style=""> </span>of <st1:date year="1973" day="2" month="1">January 2, 1973</st1:date>,
that "the referendum will be in the nature of a <i style=""><span style="">loose consultation</span></i><span style=""> </span>with the
people." (3) The question, as submitted to them on the particular point at
issue here, was "Do you <i style=""><span style="">approve of</span></i><span style=""> </span>the Constitution?” (4) President
Marcos, in proclaiming that the Constitution had been ratified, stated as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"(S)<span class="SpellE">ince</span>
the referendum results show that more than ninety-five (95) per cent of the
members of the <span class="SpellE">Barangays</span> (Citizens Assemblies) are in
favor of the new Constitution, the <span class="SpellE"><i style=""><span style="">Katipunan</span></i></span><i style=""><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">mga</span> <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
</span></i><span style="">has</span><i style=""> </i><i style=""><span style="">strongly recommended</span></i><span style=""> </span>that the
new Constitution should already <i style=""><span style="">be</span></i><span style=""> </span><i style=""><span style="">deemed</span></i><span style=""> </span>ratified by the Filipino
people." (5) There was not enough time for the Citizens Assemblies to
really familiarize themselves with the Constitu­tion, much less with the many
other subjects that were submitted to them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact the plebiscite planned for January <span style="">15, 1</span>973 under Presidential Decree No. 73 had been postponed to
an indefinite date, the reasons for the postponement being, as attributed to
the President in the newspapers, that "there was little time to campaign
for or against ratification" <span style="">(</span><i style=""><span style="">Daily Express</span></i><span style="">; </span>Dec. 22,
1972); "that he would base his decision (as to the date of the plebiscite)
on the compliance by the Commission (on Elections) on the publication
requirement of the new Charter and on the position taken by national
leaders" <span style="">(</span><i style=""><span style="">Daily
Express</span></i><span style="">, </span>Dec. 23, 1972); and that "the postponement would give us
more time to <span style="">debate </span>on the <span style="">merits of </span>the Charter." <span style="">(</span><i style=""><span style="">Bulletin
Today</span></i><span style="">, </span><span style="">Dec. 24, 1972.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span>circumstances
above enumerated lead us to the conclusion that the Citizens Assemblies could
not have understood the referendum to be for the ratification of the
Constitution, but only for the expression of their views on a consultative
basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, if the expression of
those views had been intended as an act of ratification (or of rejection as a logical
corollary) - there would have been no need for the <span class="SpellE"><i style=""><span style="">Katipunan</span></i></span><i style=""><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">mga</span> <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
</span>to </i><i style=""><span style="">recommend</span></i><span style=""> </span>that the Constitution should already be deemed ratified, for
recommendation imports recognition of some higher authority in whom the final
decision rests.</p>

<p class="BODY">But then the President, pursuant to such recommendation, did
proclaim that the Constitution had been ratified and had come into effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The
more relevant </span>consideration, therefore, as far as we can see, should be as
to what the President had in mind in convening the Citizens Assemblies,
submitting the Constitution to them and proclaiming that the favorable
expression of their views was an act of ratification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this respect subjective factors, which
defy judicial analysis and adjudication, are necessarily involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">In positing the problem within an identifiable frame of reference
we find no need to consider whether or not the regime established by President
Marcos since he declared martial law and under which the new Constitution was
submitted to the Citizens Assemblies was a revolutionary one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pivotal question is rather whether or not
the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the said Constitution by virtue of
Presidential Proclamation No. 1102, upon the recommendation of the <span class="SpellE"><i style=""><span style="">Katipunan</span></i></span><i style=""><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">mga</span> <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span></span></i><span style="">, </span>was
intended to be definite and irrevocable, regardless of non-compliance with the
pertinent constitutional and statutory provisions prescribing the procedure for
ratification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We must confess that after
<span style="">considering all the available evidence
and all the relevant circumstances we have found no reasonably reliable answer
to the question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On one hand we read,
for instance, the following public statements of the President:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Speaking about the proclamation of martial law, he said:</p>

<blockquote>"I reiterate what I have said in the past:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>there is no turning back for our people.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We have committed ourselves to this revolu­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have pledged to it our future, our
fortunes, our lives, our destiny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
have burned our bridges behind us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let
no man misunderstand the strength of our resolution." (A Report to the
Nation, Jan. 7, 1973.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the occasion of the signing of Proclamation No. 1102 on <st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1973</st1:date>, the President said
the following, among other things:</p>

<blockquote>"* * * We can, perhaps delimit the power of the people to
speak on legal matters, on <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> matters, on
matters that may come before the experts and interpreters of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But we cannot disqualify the people from
speaking on what we and the people consider purely political matters especially
those that affect the fundamental law of the land.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"* * * The political questions that were presented to the
people are exactly those that refer to the form of government which the people
want * * *. The implications of disregarding the people's will are too awesome
to be even considered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For if any power
in government should even dare to disregard the people's will there would be
valid ground for revolt."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"* * * Let it be known to everybody that the people have
spoken and they will no longer tolerate any attempt to undermine the stability
of their Republic; they will rise up in arms not in revolt against the Republic
<i style="">but in protection of the Republic which
they have installed</i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It is quite clear when the people say,
we ratify the Constitution, that they mean they will not discard, the Constitution."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1973" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1973</st1:date>
the <i style="">Daily Express</i><span style=""> </span>published a statement of the
President made the day before, from which the following portion is quoted:</p>

<blockquote>"* * * the times are too grave and the stakes too high for us
to permit the customary concessions to traditional democratic process to hold
back our people's clear and unequivocal re<span style="">s</span>olve
and mandate to meet and overcome the extraordinary challenges presented by
these extra­ordinary times."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the same occasion of the signing of Proclamation No. 1102 the
President made pointed reference to "the demand of some of our citizens *
* * that when all other measures should fail, that the President be directed to
organize and establish a Revolutionary Government," but in the next breath
added:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"* * if we do ratify the
Constitution, how can we speak of a Revolutionary Government?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">They
cannot be compatible * * *." "(I)t is my feeling," he said,
"that the Citizens’ Assemblies which submitted this recommendation merely
sought to articulate their impatience with the <i style="">status quo</i><span style=""> </span>that has
brought about anarchy, confusion and misery to the masses * * *." The only
</span>alternatives which the President clearly implied by the foregoing
statements were the ratification of the new Constitution and the establishment
of a revolutionary govern­ment, the latter being unnecessary, in his opinion,
because precisely the Constitution had been ratified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The third obvious alternative was entirely
ruled out, namely, a return to the 1935 Constitution, for it was the <i style=""><span style="">status
quo</span></i><span style="">
</span>under that Constitution that had caused "anarchy, confusion and
misery." The message seems clear:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>rather than return to such <i style=""><span style="">status quo</span></i><span style="">, </span>he would heed the recommendation of
the Citizens' Assemblies to establish a revolutionary government, because that
would be the only other way to carry out the reforms he had <span class="SpellE">evisioned</span>
and initiated - reforms which, in all fairness and honesty, must be given
credit for the improved quality of life in its many aspects, except only in the
field of civil liberties.</p>

<p class="BODY">If there is any significance, both explicit and implicit, and
certainly unmistakable, in the foregoing pronouncements, it is that the step
taken in connection with the ratification of the Constitution was meant to be
irreversible, and that nothing anyone could say would make the least
difference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if this is a correct and
accurate assessment of the situation, then we would say that since it has been
brought about by political action and is now maintained by the government that
is in undisputed authority and dominance, the matter lies beyond the power of
judicial review.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, by avowals no less significant if not so
emphatic in terms, President Marcos has professed fealty to the
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In "Today's
Revolution:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Democracy" he <span style="">says:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"I believe, therefore, in the necessity of Revolution as an
instrument of individual and social change * * * but that in a democratic
society, revolution is of necessity, constitutional, peaceful, and legal."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his TV address of <st1:date year="1972" day="23" month="9">September
 23, 1972</st1:date>, President Marcos told the nation:</p>

<blockquote>"I have proclaimed martial law in accordance with the powers <i>vested
in the President by the Constitution of the </i><st1:country-region><st1:place><i>Philippines</i></st1:place></st1:country-region>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"* * *<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>* * *
*</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I repeat, this is not a military takeover of civil government
functions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Government of the <i style="">Republic of the </i><st1:country-region><st1:place><i style="">Philippines</i></st1:place></st1:country-region><i style=""> which was established by our people in 1946</i><span style=""> </span>continues.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the report of an
interview </span>granted by the President to <span style="">the </span><i style="">Newsweek</i><span style=""> </span><span style="">Magazine (published in the issue of </span><st1:date year="1973" day="29" month="1"><span style="">January </span>29,

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have never gotten off the constitutional
track.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everything I am doing is in
accordance with the 1935 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
only thing is that instead of 18-year-olds voting, we have allowed 15-year-olds
the right to vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the 15-year-olds
of today are high-school students, if not graduates, and they are better
informed than my contemporaries at that age.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the matter of whether it is constitutional to proclaim martial law,
it is constitutional because the Constitution provides for it in the event of
invasion, insurrection, rebellion or immediate danger thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We may quarrel about whether what we have
gone through is sufficient cause to proclaim martial law but at the very least
there is a danger of rebellion because so many of our soldiers have been
killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You must remember this (martial
law provision) was lifted from the American legislation that was the funda­mental
law of our country.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"* * * *<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>* * * *</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the light of this
seeming ambivalence, the choice of what course of action to pursue belongs to
the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have earlier made
reference to subjective factors on which this Court, to our mind, is in no position
to pass judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among them is the
President's own assessment of </span>the will of <span style="">the people as expressed through the Citizens Assemblies and of the
importance of the 1973 Constitution to the successful implementation of the
social and economic reforms he has started or envisioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he should decide that there is no </span>turning
back, that what the people recommended through the Citizens Assemblies, as they
were reported to him, demanded that the action he took pursuant thereto be
final and irrevocable, then judicial review is out of the question.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In articulating our view
that the procedure of ratifica</span>tion that was followed was not in
accordance with the 1935 Constitution and related statutes, we have discharged
our sworn duty as we conceive it to be.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The President should now perhaps decide, if he has not already decided,
whether adherence to such procedure is weighty enough a consideration, if only
to dispel any cloud of doubt that may now and in the future shroud the nation's
Charter.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the deliberations of
this Court one of the issues formulated for resolution is whether or not the
new Constitution, since its submission to the Citizens Assemblies, has found
acceptance among the people, such issue being related to the political-question
theory propounded by the respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
have not tarried on the point at all since we find no reliable basis on which
to form a judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under a regime of
martial law, with the free expression of opinions through the usual media
vehicles restricted, we have no means of knowing, to the point of judicial
certainty, whether the people have accepted the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event we do not find the issue
decisive insofar as our vote in these cases is concerned To interpret the Constitution
— that is judicial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the Constitution
should be deemed in effect because of popular acquiescence — that is political,
and therefore beyond the domain of judicial review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We therefore vote not to
give due course to the instant petitions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

The undersigned (Justice <span class="SpellE">Querube</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>) who had reserved his right to do so, filed a
separate dissenting opinion when the Court denied a motion for reconsideration,

Thus by Presidential Decree No. 86 what the Constitutional Convention itself
had proposed unsuccessfully as an amendment to the 1935 Constitution, reducing
the voting age from 21 to 18, but the submission of which to a plebiscite was
declared invalid by this Court in <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> <i>vs</i>.
COMELEC, became a reality of an even more far-reaching import - since
fifteen-year olds were included in the Citizens Assemblies.</p>

According to the Solicitor General 92 Congressmen and 15 Senators (both numbers
constituting majorities) have expressed their option.</p>
