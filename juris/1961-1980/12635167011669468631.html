SANTOS DY-KIA AND HON. VALERIANO A. DEL VALLE, AS JUDGE OF THE COURT OF
AGRARIAN RELATIONS, ALBAY, NINTH REGIONAL DISTRICT, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>SANCHEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Upon the averment that the Court of Agrarian Relations acted
without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion in
issuing its orders of August 22, 1964 and September 12, 1964 granting private
respondent's motion to reconsider the allegedly final order of May 4, 1963
dismissing private respondent's suit against herein petitioners and its order
of October 26, 1964 denying petitioners' motion for the issuance of a writ of
the execution of the said dismissal order, said petitioners now come to this
Court on certiorari with prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We issued a cease-and-desist order.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case began when private respondent Santos <span class="SpellE">Dy-Kia</span> filed in the Court of Agrarian Relations his amended
petition<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">impleading</span> herein petitioners, the spouses Jose Maria
<span class="SpellE">Anduiza</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> <span class="SpellE">Dezalisa</span>, the vendees of three parcels of land situated in
Barrio <span class="SpellE">Humapon</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Legazpi</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
and therein original respondent <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> <span class="SpellE">Cajarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Dy-Kia</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That amended
petition below alleged that Santos <span class="SpellE">Dy-Kia</span> was a
tenant who had planted and intro­duced improvements on the three parcels from
1943 up to 1959; that in 1948 he left <span class="SpellE">Humapon</span> to work
in <span class="SpellE">Legazpi</span> City but hired a caretaker to work on the
lands even as he continued to super­vise and manage the landholding and
introduce improvements therein; that <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> <span class="SpellE">Cajarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Dy-Kia</span> refused to reimburse him for the expenses he
incurred in the maintenance and introduction of said improvements; that on
December 6, 1961, while this case was pending, <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span>
sold the lands to the spouses who knew about the tenancy litigation; and that
in accord­ance with Section 9 of Republic Act 1199<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
the spouses are liable <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>solidum</u></span> with
their vendor.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their answer below, the spouses <span class="SpellE">Anduiza</span>
(petitioners herein) admitted the purchase, denied the other substantial aver­ments
of the amended petition and set up as defense, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>
that there existed no tenancy relationship between Santos <span class="SpellE">Dy-Kia</span>
and respondents below, the former being merely a <span class="SpellE">protege</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> and dependent upon her for support.</p>

<p class="BODY">After Santos <span class="SpellE">Dy-Kia</span> had presented his
evidence, respondents below filed a joint motion to dismiss dated October 15,
1962 on the grounds that the agrarian court lacked jurisdiction because there
was no landlord-tenant relationship between the parties; and that even granting
that such a relationship existed, Santos <span class="SpellE">Dy-Kia</span> had
no right to demand payment for the improvements because he was not ejected but
he voluntarily abandoned the landholding when he employed himself in <span class="SpellE">Legazpi</span> City.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1963</st1:date>,
on opposition of Santos <span class="SpellE">Dy-Kia</span>, the agrarian court
denied the motion to dismiss.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 2, 1963, the <span class="SpellE">Anduizas</span>
(petitioners herein) filed a motion for reconsideration on the ground that
Santos <span class="SpellE">Dy-Kia</span> had admitted in his testimony in open
court that he was merely an "<span class="SpellE">encargado</span>" of
his step-mother <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> <span class="SpellE">Cajarito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Dy-Kia</span> and that
indemnity for improvements is not recoverable.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1963</st1:date>,
the agrarian court, upon being clarified that the motion to dismiss was only
for the <span class="SpellE">Anduizas</span>, resolved "to amend the order
dated <st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1963</st1:date>,
ordering the dismissal of the petition as regards respondents (herein
petitioners) Jose <span class="SpellE">Anduiza</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dezalisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Anduiza</span> only'',
leaving the rest of the order to stand.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In absolving the spouses <span class="SpellE">Anduiza</span>, the court
pointed out that the purchase of the property did not include any lien or
encumbrance thereon; that at the time they bought the lands, "there was no
tenant on the property"; and that Santos <span class="SpellE">Dy-Kia</span>
was not connected therewith "in any manner whatsoever".</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="6" month="5">May 6, 1963</st1:date>,
Santos <span class="SpellE">Dy-Kia</span>, thru counsel, received a copy of the
foregoing resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 14, 1963, Santos <span class="SpellE">Dy-Kia</span> in turn
filed a motion (amended on June 20) to reconsider the May 4, 1963 order, claim
being made by him that said order was null and void because he was not afforded
opportunity to be heard and to oppose the spouses' motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="7">July 1,1963</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> <span class="SpellE">Cajarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Dy-Kia</span> filed a motion to
resolve the question of jurisdiction and for this pur­pose adopted the spouses'
<st1:date year="1963" day="2" month="5">May 2, 1963</st1:date> motion for
reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="8">August 1, 1963</st1:date>,
the agrarian court, having before it the two motions just adverted to, declared
that Santos <span class="SpellE">Dy-Kia</span> had no tenancy relationship with <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> <span class="SpellE">Cajarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Dy-Kia</span> or with the
spouses, and ruled that it had no jurisdiction over the case, and forthwith
dismissed the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">Copy of this resolution was received by counsel for Santos <span class="SpellE">Dy-Kia</span> on August 6.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="8">August 20, 1963</st1:date>,
Santos <span class="SpellE">Dy-Kia</span>, by his then counsel Jaime N.
Hernandez, filed a motion for the reconsideration of this order of August
1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The grounds he there advanced were
that the motion of <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> to resolve the question
of jurisdiction was filed out of time and was based on grounds already existing
at the time the <st1:date year="1963" day="2" month="5">May 2, 1963</st1:date>
motion of the <span class="SpellE">Anduiza</span> spouses was filed; and that
there was a landlord-tenant relationship between him and the respondents <span style="">below.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On
</span><st1:date year="1963" day="29" month="8"><span style="">August </span>29, 1963</st1:date>, the
agrarian court, on objection of herein petitioners, denied for lack of merit
the motion for recon­sideration <span style="">just <span style="">referred to.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Nothing happened until February 18, 1964 when Atty. <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span> O. <span class="SpellE">Orbase</span> entered his
appearance below as counsel of record for Santos <span class="SpellE">Dy-Kia</span>
in lieu of Atty. Jaime N. Hernandez who allegedly ceased as attorney as of
August 30, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The clerk of the
agrarian court sent Atty. <span class="SpellE">Orbase</span> a copy of the <st1:date year="1963" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1963</st1:date> order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Orbase</span>

<p class="BODY">On March 31, 1964, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Orbase</span>, on
behalf of Santos <span class="SpellE">Dy-Kia</span>, filed a motion dated March
28, 1964(which he called second motion for reconsideration, the first being
that of August 20, 1963) alleging that the acts performed by him (<span class="SpellE">Dy­Kia</span>) with respect to the lands qualified him as tenant
of <span class="SpellE">Filo­mena</span> <span class="SpellE">Cajarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Dy-Kia</span>; that the sale of
said property to the spouses while his claim was pending constituted fraud;
that proof of the admission of the tenancy relationship by <span class="SpellE">Filo­mena</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cajarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Dy-Kia</span> automatically placed the case within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the agrarian court; and that the resolution of <st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="8">August 1, 1963</st1:date> was not in accordance
with the evidence presented by him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The spouses opposed, averred amongst others that the order of
dismissal had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <u>first</u> order petitioners now question before this Court
was issued by the agrarian court on <st1:date year="1964" day="22" month="8">August
 22, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Santos <span class="SpellE">Dy­Kia's</span> motion for reconsideration and resetting the case
for further proceedings was there granted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The agrarian court gave no reason for this order except that it would be
“[<span class="SpellE">i</span>]n the interest of justice."</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Anduizas</span> moved to reconsider the <st1:date year="1964" day="22" month="8">August 22, 1964</st1:date> order and upon
opposition of Santos <span class="SpellE">Dy-Kia</span> the court issued its <u>second</u>
questioned order on <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="9">September 12, 1964</st1:date>
denying the motion of the spouses, "for being untenable."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1964</st1:date>,
Santos <span class="SpellE">Dy-Kia</span> moved for reins­tatement as
tenant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Anduizas</span>
opposed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="23" month="10">October 23, 1964</st1:date>,
the spouses <span class="SpellE">Anduiza</span> moved for the issuance of a writ
of execution of the order of dismissal of the case dated <st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="26" month="10">October 26, 1964</st1:date>,
the agrarian court handed down its <u>third</u> disputed order denying the
motion for execution "for lack of merit."</p>

<p class="BODY">Promptly, on <st1:date year="1964" day="27" month="10">October
 27, 1964</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Anduizas</span> appealed to this
Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The forefront question
is whether the disputed orders are final and <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent Santos <span class="SpellE">Dy-Kia</span>
seeks to strike down the appeal because the orders are inter­locutory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And citing Section 1 of Rule 43 of the Rules
of Court, he puts forth the claim that only <u>final</u> orders of the agrarian
court are <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He is correct.</p>

<p class="BODY">The orders of the lower court are aimed at continuing the
proceedings before it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hearing of the
case on the merits is not yet finished.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Final judgment is yet to be rendered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A rule long standing and frequently cited is that orders which do not
finally dispose of the pending case so that nothing more can be done with it in
the trial court are interlocutory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any
issue relating thereto must wait until the trial court writes its final deter­mination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only then that appeal is proper.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While interlocutory orders
are not <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>, none­theless, when want or excess
of jurisdiction or abuse of dis­cretion is averred in the petition for review,
an appeal may, in the discretion of the court, be converted into a special
civil action for certiorari, to avert injustice and thwart delay.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To be conceded is that certiorari was not specifically availed of
by petitioners in their notice of appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They there merely signified their intention to appeal pursuant to Rule
43.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They <span class="SpellE">labelled</span>
their petition before this Court as a "Petition For Certiorari or Review
with Injunction".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But said verified
petition before this Court contains all the necessary allegations to make it a
petition for certiorari.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, under
paragraph XXI of said peti­tion, it is alleged that "the respondent,
Honorable Judge <span class="SpellE">Valeriano</span> A. del Valle, of the CAR,
exercising judicial functions has acted: (a) without or in excess of its
jurisdiction; (b) or with grave abuse of discretion, and there is no appeal,
nor any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law,
pursuant to Rule 65, Sec. 1, New Rules of Court." We required respondents
Santos <span class="SpellE">Dy­Kia</span> and Judge del Valle to answer that
petition within ten days after receipt of summons.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is then no obstacle to viewing this petition in the concept
of certiorari.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The interests of justice
would not coun­tenance tying down petitioners to what their notice of appeal
expressed when there was substantial compliance with the <span class="SpellE">regle­mentary</span>
requisites for the remedy of certiorari.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is not an entirely new practice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Tengco</u></span> <u>vs</u>. <u>San</u> <u>Jose</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
which involves a more complicated situation, this Court dispensed with the
filing of an appeal and considered the petition for mandamus to compel the
trial judge to give due course to the appeal, a petition for certiorari to
annul or set aside the order yet to be appealed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, <span style="">in </span><u>Gutierrez</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Villegas</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
citing the <span class="SpellE"><u>Tengco</u></span> case, <span style="">this Court declared that the appeal from an
interlocutory order may not be considered as a petition for certiorari because
of the absence of allegations <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>effect</u> that the court
had no jurisdiction or it acted in excess thereof or with grave abuse of
discretion.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Conversely then, an appeal from an inter­locutory
order may, in the discretion of the court, be con­sidered as a petition for
certiorari under Rule 65 when the necessary allegations are present.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The core of this case, the validity of the
disputed orders of the lower court, depends upon whether or not the </span><st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="5"><span style="">May 4,
 1963</span></st1:date><span style=""> order
dismissing the petition as against the spouses had already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> when the agrarian court directed the proceedings

counsel of record for private respondent, by registered mail and the first
notice was given on September 9, 1963, a second notice on September 13, 1963,

<p class="BODY">It would not avail private respondent any to say that his first
counsel, Atty. Jaime N. Hernandez, did not receive the registered mail
containing the order of August 29, 1963 denying his motion of August 20 to
reconsider the dismissal order of August 1, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>First</u>, because that motion as
aforesaid was filed out of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Second</u>,
the fact that Atty. Hernandez con­cededly was given three notices to take
delivery of the registered mail containing the order of August 29 would also be
a sufficient cause to declare the dismissal order final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first of those notices was sent to him on
September 9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We need but draw attention
to Section 8, Rule 13, Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Santos <span class="SpellE">Dy-Kia's</span> counsel having failed to claim

It should go without saying that service of the order was completed on <st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="9">September 15, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since his new counsel filed another motion to
reconsider only on <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1964</st1:date>,
we again say that the judgment had become final in the meantime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More than six months had elapsed from the

<p class="BODY">But even conceding to respondent <span class="SpellE">Dy-Kia</span>
the widest latitude, he will not escape the effects of the finality of the
order of dis­missal of <st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="8">August 1, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His new counsel received copy of that order
on <st1:date year="1964" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet, counsel took his first move by way
of another motion for reconsideration only on <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1964</st1:date>, a delay of 21 days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judgment once again is final.</p>

<p class="BODY">All of the foregoing brings to the fore the oft-cited stern
reminder in <span class="SpellE"><u>Dy</u></span> <u>Cay</u> <u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Crossfield</u></span> <u>&amp;</u> <u>O'Brien</u> 38 Phil, 521,
526- 527, thus: "Public policy and sound practice demand that, at the risk
of occasional errors, judgments of courts should become final at some definite
date fixed by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The very object for
which courts were instituted was to put an end to controversies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To fulfill this purpose and to do so speedily,
certain time limits, more or less arbitrary, have to be set up to spur on the
slothful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'If a vacillating, irresolute
judge were allowed to thus keep causes ever within his power, to determine and <span class="SpellE">redetermine</span> them term after term, to bandy his judgments
about from one party to the other, and to change his conclusions as freely and
as capriciously as a chameleon may change its hues, then liti­gation might
become more intolerable than the wrongs it is intended to redress.' (<u>See</u>
