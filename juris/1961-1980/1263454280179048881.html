<p class="BODY">From the aforementioned judgment, The <span class="SpellE">Senoros</span>

on <st1:date year="1959" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1959</st1:date>, the
appellate court affirmed the trial court's decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court of Appeals made the following findings:</p>

<blockquote>"The facts as found by the court below are as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'From the evidence adduced at the trial, the following facts are
established:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That Lot No. 1687-B of the
Cadastral Survey of <span class="SpellE">Himamaylan</span> was possessed,
occupied and cultivated by Juan <span class="SpellE">Labansawan</span>, during
his lifetime up to the year 1909, when he died; that after his death, his wife <span class="SpellE">Ciriaca</span> Lobo took possession of the property in the same
manner up to the year 1938 when she died; that in the year 1932, the Heirs of
Juan <span class="SpellE">Labansawan</span>, thru <span class="SpellE">Albina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pediongula</span>, filed a Free Patent Application for Lot
No. 1687-B of the Cadastral Survey of <span class="SpellE">Himamaylan</span>,
which application, after having been inspected by the Land Inspector, who
recommended its approval, was approved by the Director of the Bureau of Lands
and thereafter the Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce, Secretary <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, issued Patent No. 28101 and the Director of Lands
directed the Register of Deeds to issue the title in accordance with Patent No.
28101; that Original Certificate of Title No. P-442 was issued by the Register
of Deeds of the Province of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental in the
year 1939, just a year after the death of <span class="SpellE">Ciriaca</span>
Lobo, the wife of Juan <span class="SpellE">Labansawan</span> and the grandmother
of the plaintiffs; that in the year 1952, defendants <span class="SpellE">Senoros</span>,
falsely pretending that they are the Heirs of <span style="">Juan </span><span class="SpellE">Labansawan</span>,
succeeded in taking the title from the Office of the Register of Deeds; that
once they had the said title No. P-442, in their possession they fraudulently
executed a document entitled Declaration of <span class="SpellE">Heirship</span>
and Extra Judicial Partition, wherein the defendants, Isabel <span class="SpellE">Senoro</span>, <span class="SpellE">Estelito</span> <span class="SpellE">Senoro</span> and <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span> <span class="SpellE">Senoro</span> have falsely declared themselves entitled to succeed
him and thereby partitioned the property, Lot No. 1687-B <span style="">of the Cadastral Survey of <span class="SpellE">Himamaylan</span>
equally among themselves; that by virtue of the said false document, upon its
registration, the Register of Deeds, issued Transfer Certificate of Title No.
T-9774 in the name of the defendants, Isabel <span class="SpellE">Senoro</span>, <span class="SpellE">Estelito</span> <span class="SpellE">Senoro</span> and <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span> <span class="SpellE">Senoro</span> in equal shares;
that upon the issuance of the aforesaid title, they fraudulently executed a
Deed of Sale of Lot No. 1687-B in favor of Socorro <span class="SpellE">Zuldivilla</span>
and her husband, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Sanicas</span>, for which
Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-10099 was issued, in the name of the spouses,
Socorro <span class="SpellE">Zuldivilla</span> and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Sanicas</span>.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">That once the <span class="SpellE">Sanicas</span> were in possession
of the title in their names, with the help of the defendants <span class="SpellE">Senoros</span>, notwithstanding that the <span class="SpellE">Sanicas</span>
knew beforehand that the property was owned by the plaintiffs for they were
neighbors living in the same place, and in fact was warned by Felipe <span class="SpellE">Labansawan</span> before he purchased the land, but
notwithstanding, jointly by force drove the plaintiffs from the land and once
in possession of the land, cut and destroyed the sugar canes and corns of the
plaintiffs which caused a damage of 24 <span class="SpellE">piculs</span> of
sugar yearly and for 5 years, they suffered a damage of 120 <span class="SpellE">piculs</span>
of sugar in the amount of P1,680.00 at P14.00 per <span class="SpellE">picul</span>,
together <span style="">with the actual expenses of
P200.00 in defending their rights in the case, plus P300.00 </span><span style="">for attorney's fees.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The defendants, as appellants, assign the following errors
supposedly committed by the lower court:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.35in;">‘(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial court erred in finding <span style="">and </span>concluding that from the facts of

Cadastral Survey of <span class="SpellE">Himamaylan</span> is owned by the heirs
of Juan <span class="SpellE">Labansawan</span>, who are the herein plaintiffs as
conclusively proved by Original Certificate of Title No. <span class="GramE">P-442.</span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.35in;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
trial court erred in declaring the deed of sale in favor of the spouses <span class="SpellE">Sanicas</span> and the Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-10099
issued and registered in the name of the said <span class="GramE">spouses</span>
illegal, null and void and of no legal effect, and in not declaring that the
spouses Socorro <span class="SpellE">Soldevilla</span> and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Sanicas</span> are purchasers for value and in good faith.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.35in;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
trial court erred in ordering the defendants to vacate the land in question and
to pay the plaintiffs damages in the sum of P1,880.00, plus attorney's fees of
P300.00, and in not dismissing plaintiffs' unfounded action and ordering them to
pay defendants actual damages and attorney's fees which they have suffered as
alleged in their separate counterclaim.'</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"The </span>appellants
maintain that there is no person by the name of Juan <span class="SpellE">Labansawan</span>;
that the husband of <span class="SpellE">Ciriaca</span> Lobo was <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Labansawan</span>; and, that
the Juan <span class="SpellE">Labansawan</span> mentioned in the <span style="">documents issued by the Bureau of Lands as
well as in the Original Certificate of Title No. P-442 was in real life the
late Juan Lobo, one of 3 brothers of <span class="SpellE">Ciriaca</span>
Lobo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is belied by the evidence of

presume that as the applicant or representative of the applicants for the land
in litigation under <span class="SpellE">F.P</span>. Application No. 52361
(Exhibit A), she received copies of the order approving the application
(Exhibit B, dated May 19, 1933, wherein she is designated as the representative
and 'Heirs of Juan <span class="SpellE">Labansawan</span>' as the applicant), the
order authorizing the issuance of a patent (Exhibit D, dated November 16, 1937,
wherein she also appears as the representative and 'Heirs of Juan <span class="SpellE">Labansawan</span>' as the applicants), as well as Free Patent No.
28101, dated March 15, 1939, and the duplicate of Original Certificate of Title
No. <span class="GramE">P-442 (Exhibits B and C).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellants have not explained why, from
1933 to 1952, the late <span class="SpellE">Albina</span> <span class="SpellE">Pediongola</span>
never took steps for the correction of the </span>name of the patentee, on the
ground that she is the applicant-patentee, not the representative of the
applicants, and that there is no person by the name of Juan <span class="SpellE">Labansawan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The application signed by <span class="SpellE">Albina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pediongola</span> (Exhibit A) states that Juan <span class="SpellE">Tabo</span> (not Juan Lobo), the original occupant of the land, is
the brother of her (<span class="SpellE">Albina's</span>) grandmother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the appellants' evidence, <span class="SpellE">Albina's</span> mother is <span class="SpellE">Estefania</span> Lobo
and her grandfather is Felipe Lobo, the latter being a brother of <span class="SpellE">Ciriaca</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Juan Lobo,
the alleged original occupant of the land, can not be the brother of <span class="SpellE">Albina's</span> grandmother, as stated in <span class="SpellE">Albina's</span>
application, because the appellants' evidence also <span class="GramE">show</span>
that Felipe Lobo, <span class="SpellE">Albina's</span> grandfather, was the
brother of Juan Lobo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are more
inclined to believe that after the land was inspected by <span class="SpellE">Pio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dunasco</span> of the Bureau of Lands, the heirs of Juan
Lobo and Juan <span class="SpellE">Labansawan</span> agreed to partition the
properties occupied and claimed by the two <span class="SpellE">Juans</span>,
resulting in the preparation and submission of the sketch (Exhibit F).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This plan was approved by the Bureau of Lands
(Exhibit E) so that the application signed by <span class="SpellE">Albina</span> <span class="SpellE">Pediongola</span> was amended to make the heirs of Juan <span class="SpellE">Labansawan</span> the applicants for Lot No. 1687-B. This
agreement between the heirs of the two <span class="SpellE">Juans</span>, which
the parties in this case claim to have been effected in 1932, might explain the
silence of the late <span class="SpellE">Albina</span> <span class="SpellE">Pediongola</span>
to the change in the name of the applicants for Lot No. 1687-B.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, the appellants took advantage of

are attempting, in Civil Case No. 5639, to <span class="SpellE">relitigate</span>
the issues which were definitely settled in the previous case (Civil Case No. <span style="">2435).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>The subject matter of Civil Case No. <span style="">2435 </span>was the recovery of the possession of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>

Occidental, and the cancellation of Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-<span style="">9774 </span>covering said property, and of
Transfer Certificate of Title No. <span class="GramE">T-10099, which was
subsequently issued to <span style="">Socorro </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Soldevilla</span></span><span style=""> </span>de <span class="SpellE">Sanicas</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The basic issue was the ownership and
possession over said property, it being the claim of plaintiffs (<span class="SpellE">Labansawans</span> and <span class="SpellE">Infantes</span>) therein
that the property was acquired by them by inheritance from Juan <span class="SpellE">Labansawan</span> and was, in fact, originally registered in the
name of the "Heirs of Juan <span class="SpellE">Labansawan</span>", as
evidenced by Original Certificate of Title No. P- 442, but thru the fraudulent
acts of the defendants (<span class="SpellE">Senoros</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sanicas</span>), the said certificate was cancelled and Transfer
Certificate of Title No. T-9774 issued to <span class="GramE">said</span>
defendants, while the latter contended that they and their mother, <span class="SpellE">Albina</span> <span class="SpellE">Pediongola</span>, were the
absolute owners and possessors of said property for many years until they sold
it to the <span class="SpellE">Sanicas</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Reduced to its basic fundamental, the main issue in Civil Case
No. 5639 is again the ownership of Lot No. 1687-B, for the claim of the

plaintiffs-appellants as her share in the estate of the deceased Juan Lobo,
pursuant to an agreement of partition among the <span style="">heirs, and that, subsequently, she applied with the Bureau of Lands on
December 3, </span><span style="">1962 </span><span style="">for the issuance to
her of a Free Patent over the said property but, due to the "mistake of
the representative of the Bureau of Lands", Original Certificate of Title
No. P-422 Covering Lot No. 1687-B was issued, not in her name or those of the
heirs of Juan Lobo, but in the name of the "Heirs of Juan <span class="SpellE">Labansawan</span>", and, taking advantage of said error, the
defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> took possession of and asserted
exclusive ownership over said property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">As to whether or not Original Certificate of Title No.</span>
P-442, was erroneously issued in the name of the "Heirs of Juan <span class="SpellE">Labansawan</span>" or that Lot No. 1687-B was in fact owned
by the "Heirs of Juan <span class="SpellE">Labansawan</span>",
represented by <span class="SpellE">Agripina</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zoila</span>,

<span class="SpellE">Infante</span>, the children and grandchildren of Juan <span class="SpellE">Labansawan</span>, are issues that have been definitely and
finally resolved in the judgment of the court in Civil Case No. </span><span style="">2435, </span><span style="">which decision was affirmed by the Court of
Appeals in CA-<span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. No. 19635-R on February </span><span style="">23, 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">There is identity of causes of action in the two cases, considering that
the principal object of both the prior case and the present one is the recovery
of the possession and ownership of Lot No. 1687-B, notwithstanding that
alternative prayers for the recovery of the land, damages and the produce of
the land from </span><span style="">1954 </span><span style="">are made in the case

nevertheless the doctrine of <span class="SpellE"><i style=""><span style="">res</span></i></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><i style=""><span style="">judicata</span></i></span><span style=""> </span>would be applied where it appeared that the

<p class="BODY">It is, however, urged that the present case is not barred by the
decision in Civil Case No. 2435 because there is no identity of parties,
considering that there are additional parties-defendants in the present case
who were not included as parties in the previous case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contention is manifestly untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no question that the
plaintiffs-appellants in the case at bar, against whom the prior judgment is
offered in evidence, were parties-defendants in Civil Case No. 2435.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The joining of new parties does not remove
the case from the operation of the doctrine of <span class="SpellE"><i style="">res</i></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><i style="">judicata</i></span><span style=""> </span>if the party against whom the
judgment is offered in evidence was a party in the first action; otherwise, the
