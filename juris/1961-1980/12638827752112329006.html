				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><u>Antecedents</u>. - Since the onset in 1954 of litigation between
the parties herein, this is the fifth case between them that has been elevated
to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The incidents preceding
the instant appeal are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1952" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1952</st1:date>
the <span class="SpellE">Compañia</span> <span class="SpellE">Maritima</span> and
the Allied Free Workers Union entered into a written contract whereby the union
agreed to perform <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> and stevedoring work for
the company's vessels at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Iligan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contract was to be effective for one
month counted from <st1:date year="1952" day="12" month="8">August 12, 1952</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was stipulated that the company could revoke the contract before
the expiration of the term if the union failed to render proper service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contract could be renewed by agreement of
the parties (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. J).</p>

<p class="BODY">At the time the contract was entered into, the union had just
been organized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its primordial desire
was to find work for its members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
union agreed to the stipulation that the company would <u>not</u> be liable for
the payment of the services of the union "for the loading, unloading and
deliveries of cargoes" and that the compensation for such services would
be paid "by the owners and consignees of the cargoes" as "has
been the practice in the port of <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City"
(Par. 2 of <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. J).</p>

<p class="BODY">The union found out later that that stipulation was oppressive
and that the company was unduly favored by that arrangement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the contract, the work of the union consisted of <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> and stevedoring services. <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>,
a Spanish word which refers to hauling of cargo, comprehends the handling of
cargo on the wharf or between the establishment of the consignee or shipper and
the ship's tackle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The service is
usually performed by longshoremen.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, stevedoring refers to the handling of the
cargo in the holds of the vessel or between the ship's tackle and the holds of
the vessel.</p>

<p class="BODY">The shippers and consignees paid the union only for the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
refused to pay for the stevedoring service.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They claimed that the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span> was the one
obligated to pay for the stevedoring service because the bill of lading
provided that the unloading of the cargo was at the <span class="SpellE">shipowner's</span>
expense (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the company refused to pay for the stevedoring
service because the contract (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. J) explicitly
provided that the compensation for both <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> and
stevedoring work should be paid by the shippers and consignees, as was the
alleged practice in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Iligan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, and that the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span> would not be liable for the payment of such
services.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the issue of whether the company should pay for the
stevedoring service became a sore point of contention between the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The union members labored under the
impression that they were not being compensated for their stevedoring service
as distinguished from <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> and stevedoring
contract (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. J) was disadvantageous to the union,
it did not terminate the contract because its members were in dire need of work
and work, which was not adequately compensated, was preferable to having no
work at all (204, 214-5, 226-7 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> May 20, 1960).</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the expiration of the one-month period, the said contract was
verbally renewed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The company allowed
the union to continue performing <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> and
stevedoring work.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1954" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1954</st1:date>
the union sent a letter to the company requesting that it be recognized as the
exclusive bargaining unit to load and unload the cargo of its vessels at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Iligan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The company ignored that demand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, the union filed on <st1:date year="1954" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1954</st1:date> in the Court of Industrial
Relations (CIR) a petition praying that it be certified as the sole collective
bargaining unit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Despite that certification case, the company on <st1:date year="1954" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1954</st1:date> served a written
notice on the union that, in accordance with paragraph 4 of the 1952 contract,
the same would be terminated on <st1:date year="1954" day="31" month="8">August
 31, 1954</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of that
notice, the union on <st1:date year="1954" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1954</st1:date>
filed in the CIR charges of unfair labor practice against the company.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1954" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1954</st1:date>
the company entered into a new stevedoring and <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
contract with the <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> Stevedoring
Association.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the following day,
September 1, the union members picketed the wharf and prevented the <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> Stevedoring Association from performing <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> and stevedoring work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The picket lasted for nine days.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 8, 1954 the company sued the union and its officers
in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> for the
rescission of the aforementioned 1952 contract, to enjoin the union from
interfering with the loading and unloading of the cargo, and for the recovery
of damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the following day, September 9, the lower court issued <u>ex</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> a writ of preliminary injunction after
the company had posted a bond in the sum of P20,000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few hours later on that same day the union
was allowed to file a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The injunction was lifted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The union members resumed their <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> and stevedoring work.</p>

<p class="BODY">Later, the union assailed in a prohibition action in this Court
the jurisdiction of the trial court to entertain the action for damages and
injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">A majority of this Court held that the lower court had
jurisdiction to issue the injunction and to take cognizance of the damage suit
filed by the company but that the injunction was void because it was issued <u>ex</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> and the procedure laid down in section
9(d) of Republic Act No. 875 was not followed by the trial court (Allied Free
Workers Union vs. Judge <span class="SpellE">Apostol</span>, 102 Phil. 292, 298).</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the lower court <span style="">r</span>endered a decision dated December 5,
1960, amended on January 11, 1961, (1) declaring the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
and stevedoring contract terminated on August 31, 1954; (2) dismissing the
union's <span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>counterclaim; (3) ordering the union
and its officers to pay <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> to the company
P520,000 as damages with six percent interest <u>per</u> <u>annum</u> from
September 9, 1954, when the complaint was filed; (4) permanently enjoining the
union from performing any <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> and stevedoring
work for the company at <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City, and (5)
requiring the union to post a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond in the
sum of P520,000 to stay execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The union filed a motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the company filed a motion
for the execution pending appeal of the money judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It filed another motion for the immediate
issuance of a writ of injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
second motion was filed in the municipal court of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">lligan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in view of the absence of the District Judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">The municipal court issued the writ of injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, this Court set it aside because it
was not an interlocutory order and no special reasons were adduced to justify
its issuance (Allied Free Workers Union vs. Judge <span class="SpellE">Estipona</span>,
113 Phil. 748).</p>

<p class="BODY">The union on <st1:date year="1961" day="6" month="1">January 6,
 1961</st1:date> had perfected an appeal from the lower court's <u>original</u>
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not appeal from the <u>amended</u>
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="3">March 24, 1962</st1:date> the lower court issued an order
declaring its amended decision final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> in
view of the union's failure to appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court directed the clerk of court to
issue a writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That order
was assailed by the union in a <i>certiorari</i> action filed in this
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A preliminary injunction was
issued by this Court to restrain the execution of the judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1962</st1:date>
this Court dissolved the injunction at the instance of the company which had
filed a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, the 225 members of the union yielded their ten-year old jobs
to the new set of workers contracted by the company.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <i>certiorari</i> incident was decided on <st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court noted that the lower court amended
its decision for the purpose of correcting certain errors and omissions which
were not substantial in character and that its amended decision was served upon
the parties after the union had perfected its appeal from the original
decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under those circumstances, this Court held that the union's
appeal should be given due course, subject to the amendment of its record on
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court reserved to the
members of the union the right to secure restitution under sections 2 and 5,
Rule 39 of the Rules of Court (Allied Free Workers Union vs. <span class="SpellE">Estipona</span>, L-19651, June 30, 1966, 17 SCRA 513, 64 O.G.
2701).</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to that reservation, the union on December 16, 1966
filed a motion for restitution, praying that its 225 members be restored to
their jobs and that the company be ordered to pay P1,620,000 as damages
consisting of the lost earnings during the four-year<span style="">&nbsp; </span>period from May 8, 1962 to May 8, 1966.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the company in its motion of <st1:date year="1967" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1967</st1:date> reiterated its 1960
motion for the execution of the lower court's judgment as to the damages of
P520,000 and the permanent injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Later, the company called the lower court's attention to this
Court's decision dated <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="1">January 31,
 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that decision, this
Court affirmed the <span class="SpellE">CIR’s</span> decision holding that the
company did not commit any unfair labor practice and reversed the <span class="SpellE">CIR's</span> directive that a certification election be held to
determine whether the union should be the exclusive bargaining unit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court held that the union could not act
as a collective bargaining unit because the union was an independent contractor
and its members were not employees of the company (Allied Free Workers Union
vs. <span class="SpellE">Compañia</span> <span class="SpellE">Maritima</span>,
L-22951-2 and L-22971, 19 SCRA 258).</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court in its order of April 25, 1967 (1) denied the
union's motion for restitution and to stay execution of its amended decision on
January 11, 1961 and (2) required the union to file a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span>
bond in the sum of P100,000 within thirty days from notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bond was reduced to P50,000 in the lower
court's order of <st1:date year="1967" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The union posted the bond on <st1:date year="1967" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1967</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court approved the union's amended record on appeal in
its order of <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1967</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The union appealed directly to this Court because the amount
involved exceeds P200,000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal
was perfected before Republic Act No. 5440 took effect on <st1:date year="1968" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Other proceedings</u>. - The company in its original complaint
prayed that the union and its officials be ordered to pay actual damages
amounting to P15,000 for the union's failure to load and unload cargo in and
from the company's vessels from September 1 to 8, 1954; P50,000 as damages due
to the union's inefficiency in performing <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
and stevedoring work "during the latter part of the existence" of the
contract; P50,000 as moral and exemplary damages (not supported by any
allegation in the body of the complaint) and P5,000 as attorney's fees (10-12,
Record on Appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1954" day="15" month="9">September 15, 1954</st1:date>
the company added a fourth cause of action to its complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It alleged that by reason of the acts of
harassment and obstruction perpetrated by the union in the loading and
unloading of cargo the company suffered additional damage in the form of lost
and unrealized freight and passenger charges in the amount of P10,000 for
September 9 and 10, 1954 (66, Record on Appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1954" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1954</st1:date>
the company attached to its motion for the revival of the injunction against
the union an auditor's report dated <st1:date year="1954" day="15" month="9">September
 15, 1954</st1:date> wherein it was indicated that the company lost freight
revenues amounting to P178,579.20 during the period from January 1 to <st1:date year="1954" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1954</st1:date> (121-143, Record on
Appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1954" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1954</st1:date>
the company filed another motion for the restoration of the injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support of that motion, the company
attached a trip operation report showing the unloaded cargoes on the company's
vessels, when they docked at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Iligan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> on September 14, 19, 22 and 26
and October 3 and 5, 1954, as well as the delays in their departure (157-162,
Record on Appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1955" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1955</st1:date>
the company added a fifth cause of action to its complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It alleged that during the period from
September 12 to December 28, 1954 it lost freight charges on unloaded cargoes <span style="">in </span>the sum of P62,680.12, as shown in
a detailed statement, and that it incurred an estimated amount of P20,000 for
overhead expenses for the delay in the departure of its vessels attributable to
the union's unsatisfactory stevedoring and <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
work (225-229, 237-8, Record on Appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY">Also on <st1:date year="1955" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1955</st1:date>
the union answered the original and supplemental complaints.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It denied that its members had rendered
inefficient service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It averred that the
termination of the contract was prompted by the company's desire to give the
work to the <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> Stevedoring Association which the
company had allegedly organized and subsidized.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The union filed a counterclaim for P200,000 as compensation for its
services to the company and P500,000 as other damages (239-252, Record on
Appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="9" month="3">March 9, 1960</st1:date>
the company filed a third supplemental complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It alleged that the continuation of the
stevedoring and <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> work by the union for the
company from 1955 to date had caused <span style="">losses
</span>to the company at the rate of P25,000 annually in the form of lost
freight on shutout cargoes and the expenses for the equipment used to assist
the union members in performing their work (320-3, Record on Appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY"><u><span style="">Plaintiff company's
evidence</span></u><span style="">. - </span>Jose C. <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>, the company's branch manager at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Iligan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
testified that on <st1:date year="1954" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1954</st1:date>
he terminated the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> and stevedoring contract
with the union (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. J) upon instruction of the head
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contract was terminated in
order to avoid further losses to the company caused by the union's inefficient service
(85-86 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> <st1:date year="1960" day="11" month="3">March
 <span style="">11, </span>1960</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY">After the termination of the contract, the members of the union
allegedly harassed the company with the help of goons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cargoes could not be unloaded in spite of
the fact that the company had sought the protection of the law-enforcing
authorities (88).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The company's last
recourse was to go to court (89).</p>

<p class="BODY">The company supposedly suffered losses as a result of the union's
inefficient service since <st1:date year="1954" day="1" month="9">September 1,
 1954</st1:date> (91).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Teves</span> hired auditors to ascertain the losses suffered by
the company during the period from January 1 to <st1:date year="1954" day="11" month="9">September 11, 1954</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court awarded actual damages amounting to P450,000 on
the basis of the auditors' reports, Exhibits A to I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not carefully examine the said
exhibits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to the trial court's
impression, Exhibits B, C and D are not auditors' reports.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Appellants' statement of facts</u>. - To sustain their appeal,
the appellants made the following exceedingly short and deficient recital of
the facts:</p>

<blockquote>"Sometime in the month of August, 1954, defendant, Allied Free
Workers Union filed an unfair labor practice case against defendant (should be
plaintiff) and its branch manager, Mr. Jose <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>,
with the Court of Industrial Relations, Manila, and docketed as Case No.
426-ULP:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>defendant union also filed a
petition for certification election docketed as Case No. 175-MC against
plaintiff; defendant union also filed a notice of strike dated August 27, 1954;
the Secretary of Labor wired the public defender, <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span>
City, on August 27, 1954 (see annexes 1 to 4, motion to dismiss, Record on
Appeal, pp. 54-65).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"To counteract these legitimate moves of labor, plaintiff
filed the complaint docketed as Civil Case No. 577 in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> (now <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span>
del Norte) for damages and/or resolution of contract with writ of preliminary
injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On a decision adverse to
their interests, defendants take this appeal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the question of jurisdiction taken before this Honorable
Tribunal in G.R. No. L-8876, it was held:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span> for the instant case merely
refers to the recovery of damages occasioned by the picketing undertaken by the
members of the union and the rescission of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
and stevedoring contract previously entered into between the parties.'"</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The appellants did not discuss their oral
and documentary evidence.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><u><span style="">First assignment of
error</span></u><span style="">. - The appellants contend
that the trial court erred in awarding to the company actual damages amounting
to P450,000, moral damages of P50,000 and attorney's fees of P20,000, and in
holding that the four officers of the union are <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span>
liable for the said damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellants' counsel
assailed the award of actual damages on the ground that the auditors' reports,
on which they were based, were hearsay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After analyzing the
nature of the damages awarded, how the same were computed, and the
trustworthiness of the company's evidence, we find the first assignment of
error meritorious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We have already stressed
that, on the basis of the reports of the two accountants, the damages claimed
by the company, as a matter of simple addition, does not reach the sum of
P450,000 fixed by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
damages shown in the accountants' reports and in the statement made by the
company's chief clerk (who did not testify) amount to P349,245.37, or much less
than P450,000.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The company argues that
the accountants' reports are admissible in evidence because of the rule that
"when the original consists of numerous accounts or other documents which
cannot be examined in court without great loss of time and the fact sought to
be established from them is only the general result of the whole", the original
writings need not be produced (Sec. 2[e], Rule 130, Rules of Court).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">That rule cannot be
applied in this case because the voluminous character of the records, on which
the accountants' reports were based, was not duly established (</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">U. S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> vs. <span class="SpellE">Razon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tayag</span>, 37 Phil. 856, 861; 29 Am <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>
2nd 529).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is also a requisite
for the application of the rule that the records and accounts should be made
accessible to the adverse </span>party so that the correctness of the summary
may be tested on cross-examination (29 Am <span class="SpellE">Jur</span> 2nd
517-8; 32A C.J.S. 111).</p>

<p class="BODY">What applies to this case is the general rule "that an audit
made by, or the testimony of, a private auditor, is inadmissible in evidence as
proof of the original records, books of accounts, reports or the like" (<span class="SpellE">Anno</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>52 ALR 1266).</p>

<p class="BODY">That general rule cannot be relaxed in this case because the
company failed to make a preliminary showing as to the difficulty or
impossibility attending the production of the records in court and their
examination and analysis as evidence by the court (29 Am <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>
2nd 529).</p>

<p class="BODY">A close scrutiny of the accountants' reports reveals their lack
of probative value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The propriety of
allowing the different items of damages is discussed below.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u><span style="">Unrealized freight and

S. <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span></span></u><span style="">.- </span>In his report (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A, pp. 134 to
147, Record on Appeal), <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span> used the pronouns
"<span style="">we" </span>and
"our" and made reference to the examination made by the
"auditors" of his accounting office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He did not disclose the names of other "auditors" who assisted
him in making the examination of the company's records.</p>

<p class="BODY">He gave the impression that he was an independent accountant

company's losses for the period from January 1 to <st1:date year="1954" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1954</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The truth is that <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span> was a

 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>. <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>
was the company's principal witness in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He verified the complaint herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He signed for the company the stevedoring and
<span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> contract which he later rescinded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>
intervened in the drafting of the contract.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was his idea that the company should not pay the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
and stevedoring fees and that those charges should be borne by the shippers and
consignees.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Jayme</span> was not only the friend of <span class="SpellE">Teves</span> but was also his co-employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Jayme</span> was the

<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 12).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
suppressed that fact in his report of examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, the practice of accounting was
his sideline or he <span class="SpellE">practised</span> accounting and, as the
saying goes, he moonlighted as the company's branch manager.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span>
would be biased for the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
violated a rule of the accountants' code of ethics by not disclosing in his
report of examination that he was an employee of the company (84 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> <st1:date year="1960" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1960</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Accountant <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span> allegedly found from
the company's records at <span class="SpellE">lligan</span> City that its freight
and passenger revenue for the eight-month period from January 1 to August 31,
1953 amounted to P373,333.14 and that for the same period in 1954,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that revenue amounted to P470,716.29, or an
increase of P97,383.12 (Statement D of <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A, 145,
Record on Appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Jayme</span> interpreted those figures as
signifying that the company would have realized more revenue if the union had
rendered<span style="">&nbsp; </span>better service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He reasoned out that there was a big volume
of business in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Iligan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> due to the Maria Cristina
Fertilizer Plant, <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> Steel Mill and NPC
Hydroelectric Plant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He imagined that
the company's freight revenue during the first eight months of 1954 could have
amounted to at least P600,000 and that since it actually realized only
P470,716.29, its loss of freight revenue for that period could be
"conservatively" estimated at least P100,000 (item 7 of the
tabulation of damages).</p>

<p class="BODY">He stated that he attached to his report on the comparative
statement of gross revenue a certificate of the captain of the vessel <st1:place><span class="SpellE"><u>Panay</u></span></st1:place> showing the delays in its
departure in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">lligan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> as indicated in its
logbook.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No such document was attached
to <span class="SpellE">Jayme's</span> report.</p>

<p class="BODY">And from the fact that the total fares received by the company
during the eight-month period were reduced in <span style="">the </span>sum of P3,951.58 (<span class="SpellE">Jayme</span> fixed the
reduction at the round figure of P4,000), he calculated that the company
suffered a loss of at least P20,000 in passenger revenue up to December 31,
1954 (Item 8 of the tabulation of damages).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Jayme</span> also included in his report (a)
damages amounting to P10,000 as his <u>estimate</u> of losses supposedly
"based on interviews with disinterested parties at the wharf and city
proper customers"; (b) damages amounting to P3,764.50 allegedly suffered
in the operation of the vessels <span class="SpellE"><u>Mindoro</u></span> and <span class="SpellE"><u>Panay</u></span> from September 4 to 11, 1954, consisting of
extra meals, expenses for unloading cargo, estimated loss in passage revenue

from January 1 to August 31, 1954 (items 4, 5 and 6 of the tabulation of
damages).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records of the purser and
chief steward were allegedly examined in ascertaining those damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would not be proper to allow <span class="SpellE">Jayme's</span>
estimates as recoverable damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
are not supported by reliable evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They can hardly be sanctioned by the "generally accepted auditing
standards" alluded to in <span class="SpellE">Jayme's</span> report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent records of the company should have
been produced in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purser and
steward did not testify.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is that the auditor's summary should not include his
conclusions <span style="">or </span>inferences (29 Am
<span class="SpellE">Jur</span> 2d 519).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His opinion is not evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court unreservedly gave credence to the conjectures of <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously,
his inflated guesses are inherently speculative and devoid of probative
value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, his estimate of the
unrealized freight revenue for January 1 to <st1:date year="1954" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1954</st1:date> overlapped with his computation of the
lost freight for the unloaded 74,751 bags of fertilizer and other cargoes <span style="">cover</span>ing the
same period (Statement A of <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A).</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing discussion shows <span class="SpellE">Jayme's</span>
unreliable <u>modus</u> <u>operandi</u> in ascertaining the 1954 losses which
the company claimed to have suffered in consequence of the union's alleged
inefficiency or poor service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
noteworthy that those losses were not averred with particularity and certitude
in the company's complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">The same observations apply with equal cogency to the damages
amounting to P40,407.20 as lost freight revenue also for the year 1954 (items 1
to 3 of the tabulation of damages) which were computed by Accountant <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Those items refer to (1) the sum of P29,900.40 as lost freight
revenue on 74,751 bags of fertilizer, already mentioned, which were booked for
shipment in the company's vessels from January 1 to August 31, 1954 but which
were allegedly loaded in other vessels; (2) P4,339.64 as unrealized freight
revenue for other cargoes booked in the company's vessels but not loaded therein
during the same eight-month period, and (3) P6,167.16 as unrealized freight
revenue on shutout cargoes not loaded in the company's vessels during the
six-day period from September 2 to 7, 1954.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Jayme</span> allegedly based his computations
on the records of the company which were not produced in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The union objected to <span class="SpellE">Jayme's</span>
report as inadmissible under the hearsay rule or as not being the best
evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even if the presentation of the records themselves as exhibits
should have been dispensed with, yet the company, to show good faith and fair
dealing, could have brought <span style="">the </span>records
in court (manifests, bills of lading, receipts for the freights, if any, etc.)
and enabled the court and the union's counsel and its expert accountant to
verify the accuracy of <span class="SpellE">Jayme's</span> summaries.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Photostatic</span> copies of some manifests
and bills of lading proving that the company was not able to collect the
stipulated freight on the alleged shutout cargoes should have been presented in
evidence as supporting papers for <span class="SpellE">Jayme's</span>
report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No such exhibits were presented.</p>

<p class="BODY">The flaw or error in relying merely on <span class="SpellE">Jayme's</span>
summaries is that, as pointed out by witness Mariano LL. <span class="SpellE">Badelles</span>,
cargoes might be shutout due to causes other than the supposed inefficiency of
the union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified that cargoes
were shut out deliberately by the company because they could not be loaded in
one vessel (for example, 50,000 bags of fertilizer), or a shipper had no
allotment, or because the company did not want to load cargoes like bananas
(189-194 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> <st1:date year="1960" day="20" month="5">May
 20, 1960</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Jayme's</span> summaries did not take into account the probability
that a part of the cargo booked in the company's vessel for a certain date
might not have been loaded on that date but was loaded in another vessel of the
company which docked at the port a few days later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, there would be no loss of
freight revenue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere shutting out
of cargo in a particular voyage did not <u>ipso</u> <u>facto</u> produce loss
of freight revenue.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our conclusion is that an injustice would be perpetrated if the
damages aggregating P178,579 computed and estimated in the report of <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span>, a biased witness, should be accepted at their face
value.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Damages computed by Salvador M. <span class="SpellE">Magante</span></u>.
- The company also claims as damages for the period from September 12 to December
28, 1954 lost freight charges on shutout cargoes in the sum of P62,680.12, and
the sum of P20,000 as "overhead expenses for delay of vessels in
port", as set forth by <span style="">Salvador </span>M.
<span class="SpellE">Magante</span>, the company's chief clerk at <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City, in his statement, Exhibit B (items 9 and 10 of
the tabulation of damages).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Magante</span> did not testify on his
statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, accountant <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span>, substituting for <span class="SpellE">Magante</span>,
testified on that statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Jayme</span> said that he verified the company's records on which <span class="SpellE">Magante</span> based his statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Jayme</span> assured the
court that the figures in <span class="SpellE">Magante's</span> statement were
supported by the company's records.</p>

<p class="BODY">But as to the damages of P20,000, <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span>
said that he could not certify as to their correctness because he had not
finished his investigation (33 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> <st1:date year="1955" day="9" month="3">March 9, 1955</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In spite of that admission, the trial court
allowed that item of damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court erred in allowing the damages <span class="SpellE">totalling</span>
P82,680.12 because <span class="SpellE">Magante's</span> statement, Exhibit B, is
hearsay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Magante</span>
should have been presented as a witness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Jayme</span> was not competent to take his place
since the statement was prepared by <span class="SpellE">Magante</span>, not by <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More
appropriate still, the documents and records on which the statement was based
should have been presented as evidence or at least brought to the court for
examination by the union's counsel and its accountant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court required the production of
the manifests supporting <span class="SpellE">Magante's</span> statement (85-86 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> <st1:date year="1955" day="9" month="3">March 9, 1955</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only one such manifest, Exhibit C, was
produced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">nonproduction</span>
of the other records was not explained.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Lost freight revenue and operating expenses for the forklifts</u>.-
The company claimed as damages the sum of P87,986.05 (P151,403.85 as
erroneously computed by the company's counsel, 163 tsn March 11, 1960)
consisting of supposed unrealized freight charges for shutout or unloaded
cargoes for the year 1955 to 1959 (Exh. E to I, Items 11 to 20 of the
tabulation of damages).</p>

<p class="BODY">The claim is covered by the company's third supplemental
complaint dated March 9, 1960 wherein it was alleged that due to the acts of
the union and its officers the company had suffered damages of not less than
P25,000 annually since 1955 (320-3, Record on Appeal).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That supplemental complaint was hurriedly
filed during the trial as directed by the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The said damages were computed in the reports of Miguel J. <span class="SpellE">Siojo</span>, an accountant who, for two days and nights, March 8
to 10, 1960, or shortly before and during the trial, allegedly examined the
company's record at <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City, such as its cash book,
cash vouchers, reports to the head office, shipping manifests, and liquidation
reports.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those records were not produced
in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their <span class="SpellE">nonproduction</span>
was not explained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the accountant was
able to summarize the contents of those records in two days, they could not
have been very voluminous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They should
have been offered in evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged expenses in the operation of the forklifts consisted
of (a) the wages of the operators hired by the company and (b) the cost of
gasoline and oil and expenses for repair.</p>

<p class="BODY">The company's theory is that under the 1952 contract (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. J) the union was obligated to provide for forklifts in
the loading and unloading of cargo.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Inasmuch as the union allegedly did not have forklifts, the company, to
expedite the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> and stevedoring work, purchased
forklifts, hired laborers to operate the same, and paid for the maintenance
expenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The company treated those
expenses as losses or damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">Those alleged damages amounting to P87,986.05 are in the same
category as the depreciation allowances amounting to P38,835 which the company
claimed for the forklifts, pallet boards, tarpaulins, and wire rope slings that
it purchased for only P27,215.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have
stated that the company's counsel ignored that depreciation in his recapitulation
of the damages claimed by the plaintiff.</p>

<p class="BODY">The union contends that <span class="SpellE">Siojo's</span> reports
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. E to I) were inadmissible evidence because they
were hearsay, meaning that the original documents, on which the reports were
based, were not presented in evidence and, therefore, appellants' counsel and
the court itself were not able to gauge the correctness of <span style="">the </span>figures or data contained in the
said reports.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The person who had
personal knowledge of the operating expenses was not examined in court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are of the opinion that, to avoid fraud or fabrication, the
documents evidencing the alleged expenses should have been presented in
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Siojo's</span>
reports were not the best evidence on the said operating expenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The explanation of <span class="SpellE">Badelles</span>
with respect to shutout cargoes and our observations on <span class="SpellE">Jayme's</span>
summaries are applicable to <span style="">accountant <span class="SpellE">Si<span style="">ojo's</span></span></span>
reports.</p>

<p class="BODY">A more substantial ground for rejecting <span class="SpellE">Siojo's</span>
reports is that the said expenses, if really incurred, cannot be properly
treated as damages to the company.</p>

<p class="BODY">The union's witness, Mariano Ll. <span class="SpellE">Badelles</span>,
testified that the company's forklifts were not used exclusively on the
wharf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were used in the fertilizer
and carbide plants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes, the union
supplied the driver and the gasoline for the operation of the forklifts
(174-177 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> May 20, 1960).</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, as stated earlier, the company was not paying the union
a single centavo for <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> and stevedoring
work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The shippers and consignees paid
for the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service rendered by the union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The union did not receive any compensation
for stevedoring work.</p>

<p class="BODY">The company complained that the union had been rendering
unsatisfactory <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> and stevedoring
services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That grievance was <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> by the union.</p>

<p class="BODY">The use of the forklifts, tarpaulins, pallet boards and wire rope
slings immeasurably <span class="SpellE">benefitted</span> the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not proper nor <span style="">just </span>that the company's investment in those pieces of equipment
should be considered <span style="">damages just </span>because
it <span style="">was able </span>to bind the union to
a one-sided contract which exempted it from the payment of <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
and stevedoring fees and which impliedly obligated the union to purchase the
said equipment.</p>

<p class="BODY">If the service rendered by the union members was unsatisfactory, it
must be because the poor stevedores were underfed, and underpaid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were underfed and underpaid because the
company was astute enough to insure that it would obtain stevedoring service <span style="">without </span>paying for it.</p>

<p class="BODY">If <span style="">to </span>improve the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> and stevedoring service, the company had to incur
expenses for the purchase of forklifts, pallet boards, tarpaulins and wire rope
slings and for the operation of the forklifts, the union should not be required
to reimburse the company for those expenses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The company should bear those expenses because the same redounded to its
benefit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court erred in ordering the union and its officials to
pay the amount of the said expenses as damages to the company.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u><span style="">Moral damages and
attorney's fees</span></u><span style="">. - </span>Considering
that the company's claim for moral damages was based on the same facts on which
it predicated its claim for actual damages, which we have found to be
groundless, it follows that the company, a juridical person, is not entitled to
moral damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anyway, the company did not plead and prove moral damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It merely claimed moral damages in the prayer
of its complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is not sufficient
(<span class="SpellE">Darang</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Ty</span> <span class="SpellE">Belizar</span>, L-19487, January 31, 1967, 19 SCRA 214, 222).</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the facts of this case, we do not find any justification
for awarding attorney's<span style=""> </span>fees to
the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the trial court's
award of P20,000 as attorney's fees is set aside.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' first assignment of error, although not properly
argued by their counsel, should be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u><span style="">Other assignments </span>of
error</u>. - The union and its officers contend that the lower court erred in
dismissing their counterclaims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their
counsel did not even bother to state in their brief the amount of the
counterclaims.</p>

<p class="BODY">The union filed counterclaims for P200,000 as compensation for
stevedoring services from August, 1952 to March 4, 1955; P500,000 as <span style="">damages, </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>P10,000 as attorney's fees and P5,000 as
premium on the <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span> (251-2, Record on
Appeal).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their supplemental
counterclaim, they demanded P500,000 as stevedoring charges for the period from
March 4, 1955 to March 4, 1960 and additional damages of P10,000 (308-10,
Record on Appeal).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court
dismissed the said counterclaims.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants in their three-sentence argument in support of
their counterclaims alleged that the company's bill of lading provided that the
unloading of the cargoes was at the company's expense (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
1); that the company had not paid the sum of P500,000 as compensation for the
stevedoring services rendered by the laborers up to 1960, and that the
stipulation in the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> and stevedoring contract,
"<span style="">t</span>hat <span style="">the </span><span class="SpellE">Compañia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maritima</span> shall not be liable for the payment of the
services rendered by the Allied Free Workers Union for the loading and
deliveries of cargoes as same is payable by the owners and consignees of
cargoes, as it has been the practice in the port of <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span>
City" (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. J, pp. 14, 334, 359, 500, Record on
Appeal), was "non-operative" and void, "being contrary to morals
and public policy".</p>

<p class="BODY">That superficial argument is not well-taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The printed stipulation in <span style="">the </span>bill of lading was superseded by
the contractual stipulation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
contract was prepared by the union officials.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As already noted, it was stipulated in the contract that the stevedoring
and <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> charges should be paid by the shippers
and consignees in consonance with the practice in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Iligan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>That
stipulation was binding and enforceable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The supposed illegality of that stipulation was not squarely
raised by the union and its officials in their answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They merely averred that the contract did not
express the true agreement of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They did not sue for reformation of the instrument evidencing the
contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court did not err in
dismissing defendants' counterclaims.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other two errors assigned by the appellants, namely, that the
lower court erred in issuing a permanent injunction against them and in
executing its decision pending appeal, are devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants invoke section 9(d) of the Magna <span class="SpellE">Carta</span> of Labor regarding the issuance of injunctions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That section has no application to this case
because it was definitively ruled by this Court in the certification and unfair
labor practice cases that there is no employer-employee relationship between
the company and the stevedores.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(They work
under the <span class="SpellE"><u>cabo</u></span> system).</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court did not execute the money aspect of its
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It merely required the
defendants to file a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond of P50,000.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the injunction, it should be recalled that it was this
Court which, in its resolution of May 16, 1962 in the execution and appeal
incident (L-19651, 17 SCRA 513), allowed the company to terminate the
stevedoring and <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> work of the union and to use
another union to perform that work.</p>

<p class="BODY">The company had the contractual right to terminate the 1952
contract (Taylor vs. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Tieng</span>
<span class="SpellE">Piao</span>, 43 Phil. 873).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lower court did not err in sustaining the company's rescission of
the contract and in enjoining the union from performing <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
and stevedoring work.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, that portion of the trial court's judgment,

terminated, permanently enjoining the union and its officials from performing <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> and stevedoring work for the vessels of the <span class="SpellE">Compañia</span> <span class="SpellE">Maritima</span>, and dismissing
defendants' counterclaims, is affirmed.</p>
