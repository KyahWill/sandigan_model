				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">To the legitimate defense of one's rights, <span style="">as </span>Von <span class="SpellE">Jhering</span>
pointed out, may be attributed the growth and progress of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is worthy of admiration and
commendation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stubbornness in refusing
to acknowledge the rights of others, even if managed with a certain degree of
adroitness by invoking grounds apparently with colorable support in legal
principles, is something else again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unless characterized and stigmatized for the obstacle it thus presents
to the efficient adminis­tration of justice, the law itself stands in
disrepute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What distinguishes this case,
if that is the appropriate term, is the persistence that marks the efforts of
defendants-appellants to delay further, if not to render futile, plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> enjoyment of his rights to a piece of land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were not even deterred from taking up
the time and energy of this Court by appealing, osten­sibly relying on legal
questions that can be character­ized at best as trivial and insubstantial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such <span class="GramE">conduct</span>, to put
it at its mildest, is far from praiseworthy and must be treated as such.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this complaint to quiet title to a parcel of land planted with
coconuts and having an area of more than two hectares situated in <span class="SpellE">Guindulman</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span>, plaintiff, now
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Bernardo O. Salazar, alleged that he
acquired the same on July 28, 1941 from <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> C.
<span class="SpellE">Libres</span>, brother of the defendants, now appellants,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
in this case.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
It was then recited that plaintiff "had been in open, public, continuous
and peaceful possession of the land above-described, exercising complete
dominion over it, enjoying its fruits, and religiously paying its taxes, in the
concept of an exclusive possessor and absolute owner thereof since July 28,
1941 when the instrument of sale was executed by said <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span>
C. <span class="SpellE">Libres</span>, until August 24, 1960 or thereabouts when
said <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Libres</span>,
with neither legal right nor valid reason whatsoever, <span style="">and </span>employing threat and intimidation, claimed ownership over
the land [in question], and gathered coconuts and bamboos found within said land,
to the actual damage of the plaintiff."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As <span style="">a </span>result,
plaintiff instituted, on <st1:date year="1960" day="1" month="10">October 1,
 1960</st1:date>, a civil case<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
for the recovery of ownership and possession before the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
decision was rendered on <st1:date year="1962" day="9" month="5">May 9, 1962</st1:date>,
declaring the plaintiff as owner of such parcel of land and ordering the
defendants to vacate and deliver its possession to him.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Then, on July 16, 1962, <span style="">a </span>writ
of execution was issued pending appeal in such case, directing the Provincial
Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span> to deliver such parcel of land to
the plaintiff, but when such official sought to comply with such writ of
execution, defendants asserted an interest in such property claiming it to be <span style="">a </span>part of their individual
inheritance left them by their deceased father, <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Libres</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
an adverse claim was <span style="">a </span>surprise
to the plaintiff as no such representation had ever been made since 1941 when
he acquired the same from their brother, whose sale thereof was not unknown to
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, defendants never
bothered to intervene in the civil <span style="">case
</span>for recovery of the possession which, as noted, was decided in favor of
plaintiff.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this action to quiet title, with plaintiff praying that
the claim of defendants to the property in question be declared illegal and
unfounded and that he be recognized <span style="">as
</span>the legal absolute owner thereof with a plea likewise for attorney's
fees, damages and costs of the suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants first filed a third-party complaint, on <st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="2">February 18, 1963</st1:date>, to have their
brother, <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Libres</span>,
included <span style="">as a </span>third-party
defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, four days later, they
filed a motion to dismiss alleging that there was no cause of action, that
there was pending before the Court of Appeals another action between plaintiff
and defendants ignoring the fact that in this appeal then pending, the only
defendant was their brother <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Libres</span> and, with <span style="">a
fine </span>disregard of logic, asserting likewise that plaintiff was guilty of
splitting one cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
sufficed for a one-page order, dated <st1:date year="1963" day="13" month="3">March
 13, 1963</st1:date>, for the lower court to deny such a motion to
dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then <span class="GramE">came</span>
the answer on <st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="3">March 18, 1963</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
their main defense being that the property in question forms part of the
undivided intestate estate of their father, <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> <span class="SpellE">Libres</span>, the sale thereof by their brother to plaintiff
being null, void and ficti­tious.</p>

<p class="BODY">Why such <span style="">a </span>defense
could not prosper is explained clearly in the decision of <st1:date year="1965" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1965</st1:date>, vindicating the right of
plaintiff <span style="">as </span>the absolute owner
of the parcel of land in question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"During the trial of
the case, the parties in this case, that is the plaintiff, defendants and third
party defendants, stipu­lated and introduced as evidence, the records of Civil
Case No. 1380, together with the testimonial evidence embodied in the
transcript of stenographic notes * * *.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pending resolution of this case by this Court, the Court of Appeals had
decided that [CA-G.R. No. 32569-R] which was the appealed Case No.1380 of this
Court, between Bernardo O. Salazar <span style="">as </span>plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Libres</span> as defendant-appellant, confirming the decision of
the lower court and declaring that the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Bernardo O. Salazar is the owner of the parcel of land described in the
complaint which is the same parcel of land in question in this case before
us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, the Court of Appeals
declared the deed of sale * * * then executed by <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span>
C. <span class="SpellE">Libres</span> in favor of Bernardo O. Salazar <span style="">as </span>valid and legal."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">An appeal from such judgment was taken directly to this
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only questions of law can thus be
raised, defendants, now appellants<span class="GramE">, being</span> bound by the
findings of facts.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
On the above decisive facts, it is not surprising at all that success should
crown the efforts of plaintiff and that the claim of defendants to the property
in question should be considered as nothing but <span style="">a </span>form of <span class="SpellE">harrassment</span> being totally
bereft of any support in law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nonetheless, <span style="">as </span>pointed
out at the outset, defend­ants did appeal and, as appellants, would seek to
impugn the correctness of the decision of the lower court by alleging errors,
which on their face, are clearly devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are that the lower court erred in
denying the motion to dismiss the complaint, in applying the judgment in a
previous action <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>personam</u></span> to the case
at bar which is also an action <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>personam</u></span>,
and in making <span style="">a </span>finding of
partition of a hereditary estate by relying solely on a deed of sale which was
executed by one heir without the knowledge or consent of the other co-heirs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even if the motion to dismiss were not as untenable as it clearly
was, still it would be too late to raise it on appeal after it was shown that
during the trial of the case defendants did stipulate with plaintiff that they
would be bound by the decision of the Court of Appeals in the other civil case
filed by plaintiff against their brother, the third-party defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor could they raise the question implicit in
the third assignment of error <span style="">as </span>it
is <span style="">a matter </span>factual in char­acter,
and our appellate jurisdiction, as made clear, <span style="">is </span>limited to deciding questions of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants should not have ignored so
elementary <span style="">a </span>proposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their second alleged error, setting forth <span style="">as </span>their grievance that a judgment in
<span style="">a </span>personal action should not be
applied to the case at bar, which is another personal action, could have
required a certain degree of consideration were it not for the fact, <span style="">as </span>pointed out above, that they did
agree to be bound by the result of the decision of the Court of Appeals in such
case then pending before it.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus apparent that on its face the brief for
defendants-appellants is notable only for its flagrant and obvious disregard of
what the proprieties, not to say the decencies, of such a serious matter <span style="">as an </span>appeal to this Tribunal
requires.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if due regard be had for
the state of mind under which claimants to a piece of land, possessed of more
than an ordinary degree of obduracy, might be laboring under, still respect for
the rule of law ought to have cautioned defendants in attempting, perhaps
thoughtlessly, to delay unduly the termination of <span style="">a </span>pending litigation and thus accord respect to the just claims
of others.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is their counsel free from blame when he could have informed
them not only about the futility of such efforts, which was bad enough, but
also the barrier thus interposed against a fair, speedy and efficient
administration of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a member
of the bar and an officer of the court, he owes such minimum obligation to this
Tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, he failed to
live up to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should not escape
responsibility.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the lower court of December 14,
1965 is affirmed, with the modification that the defendants should pay
attorney's fees in the amount of P1<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Treble costs should be charged defendants,
payable by their counsel, Attorney <span class="SpellE">Lilio</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Amora</span>.</p>
