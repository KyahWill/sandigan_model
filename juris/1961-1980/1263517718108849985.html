and void the two <span style="">questioned orders </span>of
<span style="">respon­dent Court levying upon funds </span>of
petitioner Bureau of Public High­ways on deposit with the Philippine National
Bank, by virtue <span style="">of </span>the
fundamental precept that government funds are not subject <span style="">to </span>execution <span style="">or </span>garnishment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The background facts follow:</p>

<p class="BODY">On or about <st1:date month="11" day="20" year="1940">November
 20, 1940</st1:date>, the Government of <span style="">the
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> </span>filed a complaint for eminent domain
in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
for the expropriation of <span style="">a parcel </span>of
land <span style="">be­longing </span>to N. T. <span class="SpellE">Hashim</span>, with an area of 14,934 square meters, needed to
construct a public road, now known as <span class="SpellE">Epifanio</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:street><st1:address>Santos Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1940" day="25" month="11">November
 25, 1940</st1:date>, the Government took pos­session of the property upon
deposit with the City <span style="">Treasurer </span>of
the sum of P23,413.64 fixed by the Court therein as the provision­al value of
all the lots needed to construct the road, including <span class="SpellE">Hashim's</span>
property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records of the
expropriation case were destroyed and lost during the second world war, and
neither party took any step thereafter to reconstitute the proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1958, however, the estate of N. T. <span class="SpellE">Hashim</span>,
deceased, through its Judicial Administrator, Tomas N. <span class="SpellE">Hashim</span>,
filed a money claim with the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Engineer's
Office in the sum of P522,620.00, alleging said amount to be the fair market
value of the property in question, now already converted and used as a pub­lic
highway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing having come out of its
claim, respondent estate filed on August 6, 1963, with the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City Branch, assigned to Branch IX, presided by respondent judge,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
a complaint for the recovery of the fair market price of the said property in
the sum of P672,030.00 against the Bureau of Public Highways, which complaint
was <span style="">amend­</span>ed on August 26, 1963,
to include as additional defendants, the Auditor General and the City Engineer
of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The issues were joined in the case with the filing by then
Solicitor General Arturo A. <span class="SpellE">Alafriz</span> of the State's
answer, stating that the <span class="SpellE">Hashim</span> estate was entitled
only to the <span style="">sum </span>of P3,203.00 as
the fair market value of the property at the time that the State took
possession thereof on November 25, 1940, with legal inter­est thereon at 6% per
annum, and that said amount had been avail­able and tendered by petitioner
Bureau since 1958.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties
thereafter worked out a compromise agreement, respondent estate having proposed
on <st1:date month="4" day="28" year="1966">April 28, 1966</st1:date>, a
payment of P14.00 per <span class="SpellE"><span style="">sq.m</span></span><span style="">. for </span>its
14,934 <span class="SpellE">sq.m</span>.-parcel of land or the total amount<span style=""> <span style="">of </span>P209,076.00,
equivalent to the land's total assessed value,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> which was confirmed, ratified and approved
in November, 1966 by the Commissioner of Public Highways and the Secretary of
Public Works and Communications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
November 7, 1966, the Compromise Agreement subscribed by counsel for respondent
estate and by then Solicitor General Antonio P. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Barredo</span></span><span style="">, </span>now a mem­ber <span style="">of this
Court, </span>was submitted to the lower <span style="">Court and under date </span>of November 8, 1966, respondent judge, as
prayed for, rendered judgment approving the Compromise Agreement and ordering
peti­tioners, as defendants therein, to pay respondent estate as plaintiff
therein, the total sum of P209,076.00 for the expropriated lot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="10" day="10" year="1968">October 10, 1968</st1:date>,
respondent estate filed with the lower Court a motion for the issuance of a
writ of execution, alleging that petitioners had failed to satisfy the judgment
in its favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It further filed on <st1:date month="10" day="12" year="1968">October 12, 1968</st1:date>, an ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> motion for the appointment of respondent Benjamin
Garcia as special sheriff to serve the writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No opposition having been filed by the
Solicitor General's office to the motion for execution at the hearing thereof
on <st1:date month="10" day="12" year="1968">October 12, 1968</st1:date>,
respondent judge, in an order dated <st1:date month="10" day="14" year="1968">October
 14, 1968</st1:date>, granted both motions.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same date, October 14, 1968, respondent Garcia, as special
sheriff, forthwith served a Notice of Garnishment, together with the writ of
execution dated October 14, 1968, issued by respondent Manuela C. <span class="SpellE">Florendo</span> as Deputy Clerk of Court, on respondent Philippine
National Bank, notifying said bank that levy was thereby made upon funds of
petitioners Bureau of Public Highways and the Auditor General on deposit, with
the bank to cover the judgment of P209,076.00 in favor of respondent estate, and
requesting the bank to reply to the garnishment within five days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On October 16, 1968, three days before the
expiration of the five-day deadline, respondent Benjamin V. <span class="SpellE">Coruña</span>
in his capacity as Chief, Documentation Staff, of respondent bank's Legal Department,
allegedly acting in excess of his authority and without the knowledge and
consent of the Board of Directors and other <span style="">ranking </span>officials of respondent bank, replied to the notice of
garnishment that in compliance therewith, the bank was holding the amount of <span style="">P209,076.00 from
the account of <span style="">petitioner Bureau </span>of
Public Highways.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent bank alleged
that when it was served with Notice to Deliver Money signed by respondent
Garcia, as <span style="">special sheriff, </span>on </span><st1:date month="10" day="17" year="1968"><span style="">October 17, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">, it sent a letter
to the officials of <span style="">the Bureau </span>of
Public Highways notifying them of the notice of garnishment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under date of October 16, 1968, respondent estate further filed
with the lower Court an ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> motion for the
issuance of an order ordering respondent bank to release and deliver to the
special sheriff, respondent Garcia, the garnished amount of P209,076.00
deposited under the account of petitioner Bureau, which motion was granted by
respondent judge in an order of October 18, 1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day, <st1:date year="1968" day="18" month="10">October 18, 1968</st1:date>, respondent <span class="SpellE">Coruña</span>,
allegedly taking advantage of his position, authorized the <span style="">issuance </span>of a cashier's check of the
bank in the amount of P209,076.00, <span style="">taken
out </span>of the funds of petitioner Bureau deposited in current account with
the bank and paid the same to respondent estate, with­out notice to said
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Later on December 20, 1968, petitioners, through then<span style=""> </span>Solicitor General Felix V. <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span>, wrote respondent bank complaining that the bank
acted precipitately in having delivered such a substan­tial amount to the
special sheriff without affording petitioner <span style="">Bureau </span>a reasonable time to contest the validity of the
garnishment, not­withstanding the bank's being charged with legal knowledge
that government funds are exempt from execution or garnishment, and demanding
that the bank credit the said petitioner's account in the amount of
P209,076.00, which the bank had allowed to be illegally garnished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent bank replied on January 6, 1969
that it was not liable for the said garnishment of government funds, alleg­ing
that it was not for the bank to decide the question of legality of the
garnishment order and that much as it wanted to wait until it heard from the
Bureau of Public Highways, it was “helpless to refuse delivery under the
teeth" of the special order of October 18, 1968, directing immediate
delivery of the garnished amount.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners therefore filed on <st1:date month="1" day="28" year="1969">January 28, 1969</st1:date> the present action against respondents,
in their capacities as above stated in the title of this case, praying for
judgment declaring void the ques­tioned orders of respondent Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners also sought the issuance of a
writ of preliminary mandatory injunction for the imme­diate reimbursement of
the garnished sum of P209,076.00, consti­tuting funds of petitioner Bureau on
deposit with the Philippine Nation­al Bank as official depositary of Philippine
Government funds, to the said petitioner's account with the bank, so as to
forestall the dissi­pation of said funds, which the government had allocated to
its pub­lic highways and infrastructure projects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court ordered on <st1:date month="1" day="31" year="1969">January 31, 1969</st1:date> the issuance of the writ
against the principal res­pondents <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span>,
including respondent judge therein so that she would take forthwith all the
necessary measures and processes to <span style="">compel the immediate return of the said government
funds to petitioner Bureau's account with respondent bank.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In compliance with the writ, respondent bank restored the
garnished sum of P209,076.00 to petitioner Bureau's account with it.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The primary responsibility for the reimbursement of said amount to petitioner
Bureau's account with respondent bank, however, rested solely on respondent
estate, since it is the judgment creditor that received the amount upon the
questioned execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Strangely enough, a<span style="">s </span>appears
now from respondent bank's memorandum in lieu of oral argument<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>,
what respondent bank did, acting through respondent <span class="SpellE">Coruña</span>
as its counsel, was not to ask respondent estate to <u>reimburse</u> it in turn
in the same amount, but to file with the probate court with jurisdiction over
respondent estate<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>,
a motion for the estate to <u>deposit </u>the said amount with <span style="">it, purportedly in compliance with the
writ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent estate there­upon <u>deposited</u>
with respondent bank as <u>a savings account</u> the sum of P125,446.00, on which
the bank presumably would pay the usual <span style="">in­</span>terest,
besides.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the balance of
P83,630.00, this sum had been in the interval paid as attorney's fees to Atty.
Jesus B. Santos, counsel for the estate, by the administrator, allegedly
without author­ity of the probate court.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Accordingly, respondent estate has not
reimbursed the respondent bank either as to this last amount, and the bank has
complacently not taken any steps in the lower court to require such
reimbursement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The ancillary questions now belatedly raised by the State may
readily be disposed of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners may
not invoke the State's immunity from suit, since the case below was but a
continuation in effect of the pre-war expropriation proceedings instituted by
the State itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The expropriation of
the property, which now forms part of <span class="SpellE">Epifanio</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:street><st1:address>Santos Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>,
is a <u>fait accompli</u> and is not questioned by respondent estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only question at issue was the amount of
the just compensation due to respondent estate in payment of the expropriated
property, which properly pertained to the jurisdiction of the lower court.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
It is elementary that in expropriation proceedings, the State precisely submits
to the Court's jurisdiction and asks the Court to affirm its lawful right to
take the property sought to be expropriated for the public use or purpose
described in its complaint and to determine the amount of just compensation to
be paid <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither may the State impugn the validity of the compromise
agreement executed by the Solicitor General on behalf of the State with the
approval of the proper government officials, on the ground that it was executed
only by the lawyer of respondent estate, with­out any showing of having been
specially authorized to bind the estate thereby, because such alleged lack of
authority may be ques­tioned only <span style="">by </span>the
principal or client, and respondent estate as such principal has on the
contrary confirmed and ratified the compromise agreement.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
As a matter of fact, the Solicitor General, <span style="">in </span>representation of the State, makes
in the petition no prayer for <span style="">the </span>annulment of the compromise agreement or
of the respondent court's decision approving the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the principal issue, the Court holds that respondent Court's
two questioned orders (1) for execution of the judgment, in pursuance whereof
respondent deputy clerk issued the corresponding writ of execution and
respondent special sheriff issued the notice of garnishment, and (2) for
delivery of the garnished amount of P209,076.00 to respondent estate as
judgment creditor through respondent special sheriff, are null an void on the
fundamental ground that government funds are not subject to execution or
garnishment.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As early as 1919, the
Court has pointed out that although the Government, as plaintiff in expropriation
proceedings, <span style="">submits </span>itself to
the jurisdiction of the Court and thereby waives its <span style="">immu­</span>nity from suit, the judgment that is thus rendered requiring
its <span style="">payment of the award determined as
just compensation for the con­demned property as a condition precedent to the
transfer to the title thereto in its favor, cannot be realized upon execution.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The Court there added that it is incumbent
upon the legislature to appropriate any additional amount, over and above the
provisional deposit, that may be necessary to pay the award determined in the
judgment, since the Government cannot keep the land and dishonor the judgment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In another early case, where the government by an act of the
Philippine Legislature, expressly consented to be sued by the plaintiff in an action
for damages and waived its immunity from suit, the Court adjudged the
Government as not being legally liable on the complaint, since the State under
our laws would be liable only for torts caused by its special agents, specially
commissioned to carry out the acts complained of outside of such agents'
regular duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We held that the
plaintiff would have to look to the legis­lature for another legislative
enactment and appropriation of suf­ficient funds, if the Government intended
itself to be legally liable<span style=""> only for
the damages sustained by plaintiff as a result of the negligent <span style="">act of one of its employees.</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The universal rule that where the State gives its consent to be
sued by <span style="">private </span>parties either
by general or special law, it may <span style="">limit
</span>claimant's action "only up to the completion <span style="">of proceedings anterior to the stage of
execution" and that the power of </span>the Courts ends when the judgment
is <span style="">rendered, since </span>government
funds and properties may not be seized under writs of execution or garnish­ment
to satisfy such judgments, is based on obvious considerations of public
policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Disbursements of public funds
must be covered by the corresponding appropriation as required by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The func­tions and public services rendered
by the State cannot be allowed to be paralyzed or disrupted by the diversion of
public funds from their legitimate and specific objects, as appropriated by
law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, as pointed out by the Court in <span class="SpellE"><u>Belleng</u></span><u>
vs. Republic</u><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>,
while the State has given its consent to be sued in compensation cases, the
pauper-claimant therein must look specifically to the Compensation Guarantee
Fund provided by the Workmen's <span style="">Compen­</span>sation
Act for the corresponding disbursement in satisfaction of his claim, since the
State in Act 3083, the <span style="">general law </span>waiving
its immunity from suit "upon any money claim involving liability aris<span style="">ing </span><span style="">from contract express or implied", imposed the limitation in <span style="">Sec. </span>7 thereof <span style="">that "no execution shall issue upon any </span></span><span style="">judgment </span><span style="">rendered </span><span style="">by any Court against the Government of <span style="">the (Philippines) </span></span><span style="">under </span><span style="">the provisions of
this Act"; and that otherwise, the claimant would have to pro</span><span style="">s</span><span style="">ecute his money claim against the State
under Commonwealth Act 327.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This doctrine was again stressed by the Court in <u>Republic vs. <span class="SpellE">Palacio</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>,
setting aside as null and void the <span style="">order
</span>of garnishment issued by the sheriff pursuant to the lower Court's writ
of execution on funds of the Pump Irrigation Trust Fund in the account of the
Government's Irrigation Service Unit with the Phili­ppine National Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court emphasized then and re-emphasizes
now that judgments against the State or its agencies and <span style="">instrumen­</span>talities in cases where the
State has consented to be sued, operate<span style="">
merely to liquidate and establish the plaintiff's claim; such judgments may not
be enforced by writs of execution or garnishment and it is for the legislature
to provide for their payment through the corresponding appropriation, as
indicated in Act 3083.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent bank and its
Chief, Documentation Staff, respondent <span class="SpellE">Coruña</span>, have
advanced two specious arguments to jus­tify their wrongful delivery of the
garnished public funds to respon­dent estate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their first contention that the said government funds by <span style="">reason of their being deposited by
petitioner Bureau under a current account subject to withdrawal by check,
instead of being deposited as special trust funds, "lost their kind and
character as government funds",</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the official depositary of the Phili­ppine
Government, respondent bank and its officials should be the first ones to know
that all government funds deposited with it by any agency or instrumentality of
the government, whether by way of general or special deposit, remain government
funds, since such government agencies or instrumentalities do not have any non-public
or private funds of their own.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Their second contention that said government funds lost their
character as such "the moment they were deposited with the respondent
bank",<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
since the relation between a depositor and a depo­sitory bank is that of creditor
and debtor, is just as untenable, absolutely.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said respondents shockingly ignore the fact that said government funds
were deposited with respondent bank as the official depositary of the
Philippine Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming for the
nonce the creation of such relationship of creditor and debtor, peti­tioner
Bureau thereby held a credit against respondent bank whose obligation as debtor
was to pay upon demand of said petitioner-creditor the public funds thus
deposited with it; even though title to the deposited funds passes to the bank
under this theory since the funds become mingled with other funds which the
bank may employ <span style="">in its ordinary
business, what was garnished was not the bank's own funds but the credit of
petitioner bureau against the bank to receive payment of its funds, as a
consequence of which respondent bank delivered to respondent estate the
garnished amount of P209,076.00 belonging to said petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner bureau's credit against respondent
bank thereby never lost its character as a credit representing government funds
thus deposited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The moment the payment
is made by respondent bank on such deposit, what it pays out <span style="">repre</span>sents the public funds thus
deposited which are not <span class="SpellE">garnishable</span> and may be
expended only for their legitimate objects as authorized by the corresponding
legislative appropriation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither
respondent bank nor respondent <span class="SpellE">Coruña</span> are the duly
authorized disbursing offi­cers and auditors of the Government to authorize and
cause payment of the public funds of petitioner Bureau for the benefit of
private persons, as they wrongfully did in this case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents bank and <span class="SpellE">Coruña</span> next pretend that refusal on their part to obey
respondent judge's order to deliver the gar­nished amount, "which is valid
and binding unless annulled, would have exposed them for contempt of
court."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
They make no excuse for not having asked the lower court for time and
opportunity <span style="">to consult petitioner
Bureau or the Solicitor General with regard to the garnishment and execution of
said deposited public funds which were allocated to specific government
projects, or for not having simply replied to the sheriff that what they held
on deposit for petitioner Bureau were non-<span class="SpellE">garnishable</span>
government funds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have not given
any cogent reason or explanation, -- charged as they were with knowledge of the
nullity of the writ of execution and notice of garnishment against government
funds, for in the earlier case of <u>Republic vs. <span class="SpellE">Palacio</span></u>,
supra, they had then prudently and timely notified the proper government
officials of the attempted levy on the funds of the Irrigation Service Unit
deposited with it, thus enabling the Solicitor General to take the
corresponding action to annul the garnishment -- for their failure to follow
the same prudent course in this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the Court is appalled at the improper haste and lack of
circumspection with which respondent <span class="SpellE">Coruña</span> and other
responsible officials of respondent bank precipitately allowed the garnishment
and delivery of the large amount involved, all within </span><span style="">the period of just
four days, even before the expiration of the five-day <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period to reply to the sheriff's notice of garnish</span><span style="">ment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Failure on the State's part to oppose the issuance of the writ of
execution, which was patently null and void as an execution against government
funds, could not relieve them of their own responsibility.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents bank and <span class="SpellE">Coruña</span> further made common cause with respondent estate
beyond the legal issues that should solely concern them, by reason of their
having wrongfully allowed the gar­nishment and delivery of government funds,
instead assailing peti­tioners<span style=""> f</span>or
not having come to court with "clean hands" and asserting that in
fairness, justice and equity, petitioners should not impede, obstruct or in any
way delay the payment of just compensation to the land owners for their
property that was occupied way back in 1940.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This matter of payment of respondent estate's judgment credit is of no
concern to them as custodian and depositary of the public funds deposited with
them, whereby they are charged with the obligation of assuring that the funds
are not illegally or wrongfully paid out.<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Since they have gone into the records of the expropriation case,
then it should be noted that they should have considered the vital fact that at
the time that the compromise agreement therein was executed in November, 1966,
respondent estate was well aware of the fact that the funds for the payment of
the property in the amount of P209,076.00 still had to be released by the
Budget Commissioner and that at the time of the garnishment, respondent estate
was still making the necessary representations for the corresponding release of
such amount, pursuant to the Budget Commissioner's favorable recommendation.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
And with regard to the merits of the case, they should have likewise considered
that respondent estate could have no complaint against the fair attitude of the
authorities in not <span style="">having </span><span style="">insisted on </span><span style="">their original
stand in their answer that respon­dent estate </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">entitled only to the sum of P3,203.00 as the fair market value of the
property at </span><span style="">the time the State took possession </span><span style="">thereof on November 25, 1940, with </span><span style="">legal interests
thereon, but </span><span style="">rather agreed to pay <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> </span><span style="">the greatly
revised and increased amount </span><span style="">of P209,076.00 at P14.00 per square meter, not to
mention the consequential benefits derived by said respondent from the cons­truction
of the public highway with the resultant enhanced value of its remaining
properties in the area.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The manner in which respondent
bank's counsel and <span style="">offi</span>cials
proceeded to comply with the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction issued by
the Court commanding respondent estate, its judicial administrator and
respondents bank and <span class="SpellE">Coruña</span>, <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">solidum</span></u></span><span style="">,</span> to reimburse forthwith the account
of petitioner Bureau in the gar­nished amount of P209,076.00, does not speak
well of their fidelity to the bank's interests.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For while respondent bank had restored with its own funds the said
amount of P209,076.00 to petitioner Bureau's account, it has not required
respondent estate as the <span style="">party </span>primarily
liable <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> as the recipient of the garnished
amount to reimburse it in turn in this same amount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather, said bank <span style="">offi­</span>cials have allowed respondent estate to keep all this time
the whole amount of P209,076.00 wrongfully garnished by it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For as stated above, respondent bank allowed
respondent estate merely to deposit with it as a savings account, of respondent
estate, the lesser sum of P125,446.00 on which the bank presumably has paid and
continues paying respondent estate, besides the usual interest rates on such
savings accounts, and neither has it taken any steps to require reimbursement
to it from respondent estate of the remainder of P83,630.00 <span style="">which respondent
estate of its own doing and responsibility paid by way of attorney's fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It thus appears that all this time, respondent bank has not been
reimbursed by respondent estate as the party primarily liable for the whole
amount of P209,076.00 wrongfully and illegally gar­nished and received by
respondent estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This grave breach of
trust and dereliction of duty on the part of respondent bank's offi­cials
should be brought to the attention of respondent bank's Board of Directors and
management for the appropriate administrative action and other remedial action
for the bank to recover the damages it has been made to incur thereby.</p>

<p class="BODY">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General
has likewise questioned the legality of respondent Court's Order of October 14,
1968, appointing respon­dent Garcia as "special sheriff" for the
purpose of effecting service of the writ of execution, simply on respondent
estate's representa­tion that it was desirable “for a speedy enforcement of the
writ."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds this general practice of the lower courts of
appointing "special sheriffs" for the service of writs of execution
to be unauthorized by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The duty of
"executing all processes" of the courts in civil cases, particularly,
writs of execution, devolves upon the sheriff or his deputies, under Section
183 of the Revised Administrative Code and Rule 39, section 8 <span style="">of the Rules </span>of <span style="">Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unlike the service </span>of <span style="">summons
</span>which may be <span style="">made, aside from
the sheriff or other proper court officers, "for special reasons by any
person </span>especially authorized by <span style="">the
judge </span>of the court issuing the summons" under Rule 14, section 5 of
the Rules of Court, the law requires that the responsibility of serving writs
of execution, which involve the taking delivery of money or property in trust
for the judgment creditor, should be carried out by regularly bonded sheriffs
or other proper court officers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Sections 183 and 330, Revised Admin­istrative Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bond required by law of the sheriff is
conditioned <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, "for the
delivery or payment to the Government, or the persons entitled thereto, of all
the property or sums of money that<span style=""> shall officially come into his or their (his
deputies’) hands" (Section 330, idem), and thus avoids the risk of
embezzlement of such properties and moneys.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 185 of the Revised Administrative Code restrictively
authorizes the judge of the Court issuing the process or writ to <u><span style="">deputize</span></u><span style=""> </span>some suitable person only "when the sheriff is party to
any action or proceeding or is otherwise incompetent to serve process <span style="">therein." The
only other contingency provided by law is when the office of sheriff is vacant,
and the judge is then authorized, "in case of emergency, (to) make a
temporary appointment to the office of sheriff ... pending the appointment and
qualification of the sheriff in due course; and he may appoint the deputy clerk
of the court or other officer in the government service to act in said
capacity." (Section 189, </span><u><span style="">idem)</span></u><span style="">.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">None
of the above contingencies having been shown to be present, respondent Court's
order appointing respondent Garcia as "special sheriff" to serve the
writ of execution was devoid of authority.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No civil liability
attaches, however, to respondents special sheriff and deputy clerk, since they
acted strictly pursuant to orders issued by respondent judge in the discharge of
her judi­cial functions as presiding judge of the lower court, and respondent
judge's 'immunity from civil responsibility covers them, although <span style="">the said orders
are herein declared null and void.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
