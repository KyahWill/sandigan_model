Antique upon the ground of double jeopardy.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1962</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span> <span class="SpellE">Elequin</span> filed,
with the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Sibalom</span>, Antique, two
criminal complaints against <span class="SpellE">Monico</span> O. <span class="SpellE">Cervera</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
first complaint, Criminal Case No. 682, <span class="SpellE">Cervera</span> was
charged with grave oral defamation, later changed to slight defamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It alleged:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about September 28, 1962, bet­ween 4:00 and 5:00
o'clock in the afternoon, while inside the restaurant in the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE">Sibalom</span>, Antique,
Philippines, * * * the said accused MONICO O. CERVERA did then and there,
willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, utter to the undersigned the following
words in the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> dialect, to wit:</blockquote>

<blockquote>" '<span class="SpellE">Baboy</span> <span class="SpellE">ikaw</span>;
<span class="SpellE">wala</span> <span class="SpellE">huya</span>; <span class="SpellE">Hijodepota</span> <span class="SpellE">ikaw</span>; <span class="SpellE">Bastos</span>, <span class="SpellE">patay</span> <span class="SpellE">huya</span>

co <span class="SpellE">caron</span> <span class="SpellE">ikaw</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">suba</span>, and other words of
similar import, which when trans­lated into English, means:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'You are pig; Shame­less; Son of a Bastard
(whore); Shameless (rough); you will fight?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I will shoot you and
throw your body into the river,' and words of similar im­port."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Charging <span class="SpellE">Cervera</span> with grave threats, it
was alleged in the second complaint, Criminal Case No. 683:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about September 28, 1962, bet­ween 4:00 and 5:00
o'clock in the afternoon, while the undersigned was inside the restaurant of
Juana de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Santos, situated in the vicinity of the
public market, within the <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE">Sibalom</span>, Antique, * * * the said accused MONICO O. CERVERA,
did then and there, willfully, unlawfully, and felonious­ly, threaten to kill
the undersigned and throw his body into the river, when he uttered the
following words, as follows, to wit:</blockquote>

<blockquote>" 'Caron <span class="SpellE">badilon</span> <span class="SpellE">ta</span>;
<span class="SpellE">Patyon</span> <span class="SpellE">ta</span>; Caron <span class="SpellE">palo­tawon</span> co <span class="SpellE">caron</span> <span class="SpellE">ikaw</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">suba</span>;
Pa <span class="SpellE">lukpon</span> co <span class="SpellE">ang</span> <span class="SpellE">olo</span> mo; <span class="SpellE">Sabat</span> cay <span class="SpellE">badilon</span> to <span class="SpellE">ikaw</span>,' and words of si­milar
import, and which when translated into Eng­lish reads as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'I will shoot you; I will kill you; I will
throw your body into the river; I will blast your head; Answer and I will shoot
you,' and other words of similar import."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On April 15, 1963, the defendant filed a motion to quash the
complaint in Criminal Case No. 683, for grave threats, upon the ground:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the charge therein should have been
for light threats, the acts imputed to him having been allegedly committed in
the heat of anger; and (2) that he would be placed twice in jeopardy of
punishment for the same act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion
was denied, on <st1:date year="1963" day="9" month="5">May 9, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two cases were jointly tried.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the introduction of the evidence for the prosecution, on <st1:date year="1964" day="27" month="1">January 27, 1964</st1:date>, the defen­dant moved
to dismiss both cases, upon the ground of insufficiency of the evidence to
establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The complainant objected to the motion, which was denied on <st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the municipal court proceeded
with the trial, up to its conclusion.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1964</st1:date>,
said court rendered judgment in the two cases, acquitting the defendant in
Criminal Case No. 682, for slight oral defamation, but finding him guilty of
light threats in Cri­minal Case No. 683 and sentencing him to pay a fine of
P100.00, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendant appealed from the judgment in Criminal Case No. 683
to the Court of First Instance of Antique, in which the Provincial Fiscal
charged the defendant with light threats, under an information (Criminal Case
No. 428) alleging:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 28th day of September, 1962, in the
municipality of <span class="SpellE">Sibalom</span>, province of Antique,
Republic of the Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable
Court, the above-named accused, in the presence of several persons, did then
and there willfully, unlawfully and felonious­ly threaten <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Elequin</span> with a blunt instrument (<span class="SpellE">caborata</span>)
and at the same time uttering the follow­ing words, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Caron <span class="SpellE">badilon</span> <span class="SpellE">ta</span>; <span class="SpellE">Patyon</span> <span class="SpellE">ta</span>;
Caron <span class="SpellE">palotawon</span> c<span style="">o </span><span class="SpellE">caron</span> <span class="SpellE">ikaw</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">suba</span>; Pa <span class="SpellE">lukpon</span>
co <span class="SpellE">ang</span> <span class="SpellE">olo</span> mo; <span class="SpellE">Sabat</span> cay <span class="SpellE">badilon</span> to <span class="SpellE">ikaw</span>.' which translated into English is as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I will shoot you; I will kill you; I will
throw your body into the river; I will blast your head; Answer so that I will
shoot you), and other words of similar import."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The defendant moved to quash the information, upon the ground
that his acquittal in Criminal Case No. 682 of the muni­cipal court for slight
oral defamation was a bar to his prosecu­tion for light threats, both the oral
defamation and the light threats having been allegedly committed on one and the
same occasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution objected
thereto alleging that, although made on a single occasion, the utterances
conveyed distinct implications and meanings falling under two separate
provisions of the Revised Penal Code, one for oral defamation, and the other
for threats.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="12">December 3, 1965</st1:date>, the court of first instance
denied the mo­tion to quash, holding that the offense of oral defamation, of
which the defendant had been acquitted, was not necessarily included in the
offense of light threats.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendant filed a motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Relying principally upon People vs. Yebra,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> on February 28, 1966, the court of first instance
reconsidered its order of December 3, 1965 and dismissed the information, upon
the theory that, having been committed on the same occasion, the offense of
oral defamation was necessarily included in that of light threats, and that, in
view of defendant's acquittal in the case for oral defamation, his pro­secution
for the offense of light threats would place him in double jeopardy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution sought a reconsideration,
which said court of first instance denied on <st1:date year="1966" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, this ap­peal by the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant maintains that People vs. Yebra,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> is not in
point, because in that case only one information was filed, where­as, in the
present case, there have been two separate criminal complaints, one for oral
defamation and another for light threats.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the <span class="SpellE">Yebra</span> case, the trial court dismissed
the information, upon the ground that it charged two offenses, namely libel and
threats, committed and made in a letter written and sent by the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reversing the order of dismissal, this
Court held that the libelous remarks contained in said letter were merely
preparatory acts culminating in the final threat, which was the offense
committed by the defendant.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the court of first instance seemed to be­lieve
that defendant's acquittal in criminal case No. 682 of the municipal court, for
slight defamation, necessarily implied his acquittal for the threatening
remarks alleged in the complaint in that case, for, apart from setting forth
the insults heaped upon the complainant, it was averred therein that the
accused had ad­ded:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"You will
fight?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Will you fight?) Answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I will shoot you and throw your body into the
river," and "words of similar import.' The conclusion thus reached by
the court of first instance is untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">To begin with, a remark that is literally insulting may be made
without the slightest intention of casting any aspersion upon the person to
whom it is addressed or even as an expression of affection for him or of joy
upon seeing him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, too, a person may
say that he will kill another and throw his body into the river, for the
purpose, not of intimidating, but of insulting him, as a manifestation of the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> contempt for him and to express the feeling that
the former considers the latter so worthless and insignificant, as well as so
lacking in manly qualities, that the former could do whatever he wanted to with
the latter, as if he were <span style="">a </span>chicken
or a rat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in the <span class="SpellE">Yebra</span> case, it was held that the offensive' remarks made by
the accused did not constitute defamation, the remarks being merely an incident
preliminary to the threat made by him, in the heat of anger.</p>

<p class="BODY">We note that - unlike the complaint in case No. 683 of the
municipal court, in which it is alleged that the defendant had <u>threatened to
kill</u> the complainant - in case No. 682 of the same court, the complaint did
<u>not</u> allege that the remarks above-quoted were uttered <u>with the
intention of intimidating the complainant.</u><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, in choosing to designate the offense therein charged as grave
oral defamation, and, later, as slight oral defamation, the complainant
impliedly indicated therein that said remarks had not been made for the purpose
of intimidating him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the words
"you will fight?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Will you fight?)
Answer, " allegedly ut­tered by the defendant, before saying "I will
shoot you and throw your body into the river," suggested that he had
doubts about the courage of the complainant, not only to fight, but, even to
answer him back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant intimated
thereby that complainant was afraid of him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, the complaint in case No. 682, when considered in its entirety,
strongly suggests the intention of asserting that the acts therein set forth
were performed for no other pur­pose than to <u>insult</u> the
complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not prepared, there­fore,
to hold that the crime of light threat was included in the charge contained in
said complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, we should bear in mind that the two (2) cases were
heard and decided, by the municipal court, at the same time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let us suppose that the complaint in said case
No. 682 was exactly identical to that filed in case No. 683 of the municipal
court, and that, in deciding both, the same declared that, since the two (2)
cases involved one and the same offense, it was not proper to twice punish the
accused <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, and that, accordingly, he should be
and was convicted in one case only, and acquitted in the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such event, it would be clear that said
judgment of con­viction would not violate the constitutional injunction against
double jeopardy of punishment for the same offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">No such infringement has similarly taken place in the case at
bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, a breach of the
fundamental law should not be assumed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the contrary, the municipal judge is presumed to have done his duty
and complied with the law, unless and until the contrary is clearly
established, and the defendant has not done so.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the decision of the municipal court, in said case No. 682, does
not appear in the record of the present case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither does the latter show that the judgment of acquittal in case No.
682 was based either upon failure to prove the facts alleged in the complaint
or upon proof that the allegations thereof are not true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, the denial of the motion to
quash filed by the defendant, in the municipal court, upon the conclusion of
the evidence for the prosecution, premised upon the alleged insufficiency of
the evidence to establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and his conviction
in case No. 683 of said court indicate the exact opposite and that his
acquittal in case No. 682 was due merely to th<span style="">e </span>belief that said facts constituted the crime of light threat,
not slight defamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these
circumstances, the court of first instance erred in reconsidering its order of <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="12">December 3, 1965</st1:date> and in dismissing
the information in the present case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order appealed from should be, as leis
hereby set aside, and the case at bar remanded to the Court of First Instance
of Antique for further proceedings, in conformity with this decision, without
special pronouncement as to costs.</p>
