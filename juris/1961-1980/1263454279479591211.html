<span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span> are appealing from a judgment of conviction
for murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two were, on <st1:date year="1960" day="29" month="2">February 29, 1960</st1:date>, charged by the
provincial fiscal for <span style="">the killing of

First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental sitting at <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> City, on September
12, </span><span style="">1963, </span><span style="">found both accused guilty as charged and
sentenced each to "suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA, to indemnify

in the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> without subsidiary
imprisonment in case of insolvency and to pay the costs."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution, relying mainly on the testimonies of two
eyewitnesses - Vidal <span class="SpellE">Masong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ahenor</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pagasihan</span> - and that of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Megdonio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bacal</span>, attending physician, es­tablished <span style="">the following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 p.m.</st1:time> on <st1:date year="1959" day="1" month="8">August 1, 1959</st1:date>, in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Taytay</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>El Salvador</st1:placename></st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Oriental, appellant <span class="SpellE">Labis</span>, with a bolo, chased the
deceased <span class="SpellE">Clarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabria</span>
near the national highway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the
latter happened to pass by <span style="">a </span>coconut
tree, appellant <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span> who was standing there,
grabbed him and locked his arms around the <span style="">shoulders of <span class="SpellE">Clarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabria</span>,
with <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span>' chest pressing against the right
shoulder of <span class="SpellE">Clarito</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This enabled <span class="SpellE">Labis</span> to overtake <span class="SpellE">Clarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabria</span> and thereupon, the
former stabbed the latter with the bolo at his back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Cables then released the deceased who, badly wounded,
tried to run further towards his father's house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, <span class="SpellE">Clarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabria</span> was brought for treatment to the provincial hospital
at <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> City,
where he died two hours later.</p>

<p class="BODY">The attending physician, <span style="">Dr.
</span><span class="SpellE">Bacal</span>, found an opening stab wound, about
three inches long, at the back lumbar region, <u>middle</u>, which deviated
laterally <u>to the left</u>, and causing an exit wound of one inch in front, <u>at
the left</u> iliac region (lower abdomen).<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Dr. <span class="SpellE">Bacal</span> also testified that the two wounds could
have been caused by a bolo and that the decedent's death was due to profuse
internal hemorrhage resulting from multiple <span class="GramE">perforation</span>
of the sig­moid and <span class="SpellE">mysentery</span> of the intestine,
organs usually found on the left of the abdominal cavity.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense narrated the events differently.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to appellants <span class="SpellE">Labis</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span> and three of their alleged eyewitnesses,
what transpired was this:</p>

<p class="BODY">On the morning of <st1:date year="1959" day="1" month="8">August
 1, 1959</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Labis</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span>
with <span style="">several </span>of
their <span class="SpellE">barriomates</span> attended a community group work,
locally known as "<span class="SpellE">pahina</span>", at the public
school compound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About noontime, they
all proceeded to the <span style="">wedding p</span>arty at Pedro Estrada's house where the deceased and the
latter's brother-in-law, Raul <span class="SpellE">Espejon</span>, were also
present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Lunch over,
the group left the place together at <span style="">the
invitation of the decedent and <span class="SpellE">Espejon</span>.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the way home, the two walked ahead while <span class="SpellE">Labis</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span> and the rest followed about 20 meters behind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As the decedent <span class="SpellE">Fabria</span> and <span class="SpellE">Espejon</span> neared the national highway, the latter stopped
near a coconut tree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As appellant <span class="SpellE">Labis</span> approached, <span class="SpellE">Espejon</span>
confronted him with a bolo, asking whether he had a grudge against <span class="SpellE">Clarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabria</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Labis</span> answered that
they ought <span class="GramE">not</span> fight as they were bro­thers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sensing trouble, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Labis</span>, a third degree cousin of Mauricio <span class="SpellE">Labis</span>, intervened and advised the two not to fight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Raul <span class="SpellE">Espejon</span> then
repaired towards the near­by house of <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gaid</span> and <span class="SpellE">Labis</span> with the others
went their way.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this moment, <span class="SpellE">Clarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabria</span>, brandishing a bolo, came running towards them and
asked <span class="SpellE">Labis</span> if the latter had any grudges against
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Labis</span>
retreated with up<span style="">raised hands and <span class="SpellE">endeavoured</span> to pacify the deceased by calling him brother
and pleading that they should not fight.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Clarito</span> answered by slashing his bolo at <span class="SpellE">Labis</span> who, in trying to parry the blow, was wounded on his
left wrist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Labis</span>
retreated further but Raul <span class="SpellE">Espejon</span> reappeared on the
scene and <span class="SpellE">boloed</span> <span class="SpellE">Labis</span> at
the nape, wounding him also.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ap­pellant <span class="SpellE">Labis</span> then turned to face <span class="SpellE">Espejon</span>
when <span class="SpellE">Clarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabria</span> hurled
his bolo at him with the handle-end thereof hitting <span class="SpellE">Labis</span>
on the breast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decedent now bent
down to pick up the bolo which fell by <span class="SpellE">Labis</span>' left
side but the lat­ter immediately warded off <span class="SpellE">Clarito's</span>
hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This caused the decedent to turn
half-way to his right, exposing his left flank to <span class="SpellE">Labis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instantly, <span class="SpellE">Labis</span>
drew his own bolo from the waist and thrust it at the decedent's back, at the
left side of the lumbar region on the level of the pel­vis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Clarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabria</span>
then ran away wounded towards <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gaid's</span> house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few
moments later, policeman <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gallego</span>,
who had fired several shots upwards while still at a distance, arrived at the
scene of the incident and <span class="SpellE">Labis</span> surrendered to him
the bolo (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">C,</span> also
marked as <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 12) <span class="GramE">he</span> used
in stabbing <span class="SpellE">Clarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabria</span>
and also the bolo (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 14) which the latter
allegedly hurled at him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Policeman <span class="SpellE">Gallego</span> placed <span class="SpellE">Labis</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span> under custody and then went after Raul <span class="SpellE">Espejon</span> in the house of Hugo <span class="SpellE">Fabria</span>
and got Raul's bolo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still later,
Gregorio Salas, the Chief of Police of El Salvador, arrived and brought appel­lants
<span class="SpellE">Labis</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span> to the
municipal building for investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span> denied having held
the decedent <span class="SpellE">Clarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabria</span>
as testified to by the prosecution witnes­ses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He claimed that when the deceased confronted <span class="SpellE">Labis</span>
with a drawn bolo, he (<span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span>) and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Labis</span> stood between the protagonists and tried to pacify
them and pre­vent a fight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, when
<span class="SpellE">Clarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabria</span> threw his
bolo at <span class="SpellE">Labis</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span>
retreated about four meters away since he was afraid that <span class="SpellE">Clarito</span>
carried a dagger also which he might use.</p>

<p class="BODY">As between the two conflicting versions, the trial court upheld
the <span class="GramE">prosecution's</span> and rejected that of the de­fense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And <span class="GramE">We</span> quote the
findings and conclusions of said court:</p>

<blockquote>"At first blush the theory advanced by the de­fense would seem
foolproof but a closer examination of the same reveals weaknesses that cannot
stand <span style="">the test of judicial
scrutiny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The defense witnesses, <span style="">either close </span>friends or relatives of
the accused</u>, <u>gave evidently well-rehearsed testimonies likely to mislead
the gullible and unsuspected person</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, a careful evaluation of their version of the incident would
show its inconsistency with the na</span>tural course of events and human
conduct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For in­stance, their claim that
the accused Mauricio <span class="SpellE">Labis</span> delivered the fatal blow
at the back of <span class="SpellE">Clarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Labis</span>
while they were embracing each other and as the latter was about to pick up his
bolo from the ground, is not borne out by the position and direc­tion of the
wounds of said victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their observa<span style="">tions do not also coincide because one
declared that Mauricio <span class="SpellE">Labis</span> Pushed aside <span class="SpellE">Clarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabria</span> instead of
embraced him as two others testified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Some even asserted that <span class="SpellE">Clarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabria</span> was hit on the left side of his back which is not
true.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The finding of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Megdonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bacal</span>, the examining physician at the Provincial Hospital
of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental, located the entrance wound of about
3 inches in length at the back of <span class="SpellE">Clarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabria</span> across the lower portion of his spinal column, and
the injury deflected laterally towards <span style="">his
left front side below the waistline causing an exit wound of about an inch in
length (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. ‘<span class="GramE">B’, ‘B-1’ and 'B-2').</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u><span style="">Since it</span> is admitted that </u><u><span style="">the accused Mauricio <span class="SpellE">Labi<span style="">s</span></span></span></u><u><span style="">,
who</span></u><u><span style=""> is right-handed, </span></u><u><span style="">used </span></u><u><span style="">the bolo, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span></u></span></span><u>
'12', about two feet long, pointed </u><u><span style="">and
wide at its middle, by no stretch of <span style="">ima</span>gin<span style="">ati</span>on</span> could the wound </u><u><span style="">have followed such a course</span></u><span style="">, irrespective of</span> <span style="">whether said <span class="SpellE">Clarito</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Fabria</span></span><span style=""> was slightly bending to pick up his weapon or in a standing position
locked in an embrace with said accused as the defense tried to picture during
the reenactment of the incident in open court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>The </u></span><u><span style="">wound </span></u><u><span style="">should have come out on the right side of the
deceased if </span></u><u><span style="">the </span></u><u><span style="">accused was in front of him when he delivered
the fatal thrust</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only plausible hypothesis deducible from
the position and direction of the wounds of <span class="SpellE">Clarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabria</span> is that it was inflicted by a right-handed assailant
who was either directly behind him or towards his right side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such circumstances therefore, lend color of
truth and bear out the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses<span style=""> </span>that Mauricio <span class="SpellE">Labis</span>
stabbed <span class="SpellE">Clarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabria</span> from
the back as <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span>
was holding the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be <span class="GramE">remembered,</span> however, that ac­cording to the defense
witnesses themselves, <span class="SpellE"><u>Clarito</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">Fabria</span> was more robust and stronger in build than the
accused Mauricio <span class="SpellE">Labis</span> so that he could not have been
easily bested by the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as the </u></span><u>defense
would put it, the encounter involved <span class="SpellE">Clarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabria</span> and his brother-in-law Raul <span class="SpellE">Espejon</span>
<span style="">on one side against Mauricio <span class="SpellE">Labis</span> alone on</span></u><u><span style=""> the other</span></u><span style="">, </span><u>and
if that is true, the latter must be a superman to have</u><u><span style=""> </span>come out of the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>struggle practically unscathed</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Furthermore, it would seem odd if not contrary to human
behavior for <span class="SpellE">Clarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabria</span>
to have hurled his own weapon at Mauricio <span class="SpellE">Labis</span> in
the course of their armed struggle and endeavor again to retrieve it knowing
that Mauricio <span class="SpellE">Labis</span> was also provided with a
bolo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The court cannot also conceive
why the wound of Mauricio <span class="SpellE">Labis</span> on his left<span style=""> </span>forearm allegedly caused by the
thrust of <span class="SpellE">Clarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabria's</span>
bolo appeared small and superficial, involving only the skin and that on his nape
only an <span style="">abrasion, </span>although it
was supposedly produced by a slash administered by Raul <span class="SpellE">Espejon</span>
with another bolo, considering the sharpness of the weapons used and strength
of the blows delivered</u> as described by the witnesses for the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, a potent bolo like the one
allegedly used by Raul <span class="SpellE">Espejon</span> would not have
produced just an abrasion which according to medical science may be caused by
mere rubbing of the skin against a hard object.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Likewise, the arm wound of Mauricio <span class="SpellE">Labis</span>
would have been bigger or deeper because the bolo (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
'14') allegedly used by <span class="SpellE">Clarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabria</span>
is not only sharp but also double?edged at its point.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>The court, nevertheless, is inclined to be­<span style="">lieve </span>that the deceased <span class="SpellE">Clarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabria</span> was not provided
with a bolo at the time because he came from the wedding party in the house of
Pedro Estrada and the accused themsel<span style="">ves
observed</span> him carry<span style=""> none </span>while
they were yet there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand,
Mauricio <span class="SpellE">Labis</span> admitted having brought his bolo along
and declared that <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span>
also carried a bolo as both of them came from the '<span class="SpellE">pahina</span>'</u>
(group labor) at the schoolhouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span>, nevertheless,
denied having a bolo at that time, but Francisco <span class="SpellE">Labis</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gaid</span> declared
that he was also provided with a bolo.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is very probable that one of the bolos delivered by
Mauricio <span class="SpellE">Labis</span> to patrolman <span class="SpellE">Gallego</span>
may be that of the accused <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span> and <span class="SpellE"><u>Gallego's</u></span><u>
testimony about the ownership of that bolo by <span class="SpellE">Clarito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fabria</span> is unworthy of credence be</u><u><span style="">cause of his affinity to said Mauricio <span class="SpellE">Labis</span> by marriage</span></u><span style="">.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gaid</span> and Demosthenes <span class="SpellE">Dadolo</span> are
not entitled to belief as is that of the Chief of Police Gregorio Salas because
it appears that these witnesses were never investigated by said Chief at all
although according to him, he saw them there immediately after the in<span style="">cident and he went back to the place the next
day to look for eyewitnesses but could only find the prosecution witnesses <span class="SpellE">Ahenor</span> <span class="SpellE">Pagasihan</span>, Vidal <span class="SpellE">Masong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span>
Martinez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Moreover, if the Chief of
Police believed that <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span>

Justice of the Peace of El Salvador on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="7" month="8"><span style="">August 7, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
the actuations of said Chief of Police in connection with this case are
susceptible of suspicion for his failure to take immediate steps to insure the

trial court did not disbelieve <span class="SpellE">Bajuyo's</span> testimony but
rather held it <u>insufficient</u> to es</span>tablish evident premeditation.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant’s next submission that prosecution eyewit­nesses <span class="SpellE">Pagasihan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Masong</span> were not
present in the scene of the crime is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They base their claim on the testimonies of
their witnesses whom the lower court found devoid of credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the negative testimonies of these
witnesses cannot prevail over the positive statements of said prosecution
witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the testimony of prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Pagasihan</span>
cannot be given full credit in view of its serious contra­diction with his
sworn affidavit, <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span style="">5 </span>and 5-A wherein <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pagasihan</span></span><span style=""> claimed
to have seen only the chasing of Raul <span class="SpellE">Espejon</span> by <span class="SpellE">Rufo</span> <span class="SpellE">Labis</span> and that in the fight
between Mauricio <span class="SpellE">Labis</span> and the decedent, appellant <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span> did not hold the decedent but even tried to stop
the fight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course <span class="SpellE">Pagasihan</span>,
when confronted </span><span style="">with </span><span style="">said affidavit, repudiated it and claimed
that he was bribed and threatened into signing it by appellant <span class="SpellE">Labis</span>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Still, <span class="SpellE">Masong's</span> lone testimony is
sufficient to sustain appellants' conviction.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
The fatal stabbing of the decedent occurred just about five meters away from
him.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
No improper motive has been shown why he would impute actuations of serious
consequences against appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
minor flaws in his testimony he satisfactorily explained, thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">altho</span> he also saw
the chasing of Raul <span class="SpellE">Espejon</span> by <span class="SpellE">Rufo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Labis</span>, he did not mention that fact anymore in his
direct testimony since it was not the subject of the case being tried, a point
which was also noted by the trial court.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">Masong</span> stated that as of the date when he was
testifying he could no longer remember the <u>exact amount</u> of Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Fabria's</span> debt which he was trying to collect since it was
only a <u>little account</u> from his sari-sari store.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
He was not able to collect from <st1:city><st1:place>Asuncion</st1:place></st1:city>
that day since the door of her house was closed and because of the stabbing

The reason why he saw no policemen in the scene of the crime and why he was not
investigated <span class="GramE">there,</span> was because he immediately went

<p class="BODY">This brings <span class="GramE">Us</span> to the liability of
appellant <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unlike <span class="SpellE">Labis</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span>
did not advance self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His stand
was non-participation in the killing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the entire defense version of the incident was discredited by
the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even with particular
reference to appellant <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span>, We are satisfied that
the trial court did not err.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">First,
</span>it is clear from the evidence on record that <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span>'
alignment and sentiments were with <span class="SpellE">Labis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were together at the "<span class="SpellE">pahina</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
went together to the marriage celebration and then went home in company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, it strikes <span class="GramE">Us</span>
as strange behavior for appellant <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span> to act courageously
and bravely when danger is near and real, <span style="">and
</span><span style="">then to lose such courage when
danger has become less imminent and remote.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to the defense version, <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span> was
standing between <span class="SpellE">Labis</span> and the decedent, who had a
drawn </span><span style="">bolo, trying to prevent
the </span><span style="">fight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet, after </span>the decedent had
allegedly thrown his bolo at <span class="SpellE">Labis</span> and had, to all
appearances,<span style=""> </span>become unarmed, <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span> withdrew about four meters away on the conjecture
that the decedent <u>might still be possibly armed</u> with a dagger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A man sincerely desirous of putting an end to
such incident would have immediately taken advantage of the decedent's
momentary <span class="SpellE">armlessness</span> by holding him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cabiles</span></span><span style=""> </span>himself
admitted his being a cousin of the decedent.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
And besides, there were two of them - he and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Labis</span>
- who could have subdued the decedent whom they pictured as the one itching for
a fight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lastly, it appears odd why
appellant <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span> never vigorously insisted on his
innocence from the very start.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does
not appear that he ever strongly protested being placed under police custody
together with appellant <span class="SpellE">Labis</span> - who openly admitted
having stabbed the decedent - and being brought with <span class="SpellE">Labis</span>
to the municipal building for investigation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If he had no participation really, why should he be placed under arrest
like Mauricio <span class="SpellE">Labis</span>?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Francisco <span class="SpellE">Labis</span> was, allegedly, in exactly the
same situation as he was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, Francisco
<span class="SpellE">Labis</span> was never placed under police custody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These considerations are incompatible with <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span>' belated plea of innocence.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, it has been sufficiently established that
appellant <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span> seized the running decedent in such<span style=""> a </span>manner that the latter could not
even move or turn around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This enabled
the pursuing <span class="SpellE">Labis</span>, who was armed with a drawn bolo
and was barely five meters away from the decedent, to finally overtake him and
stab him at the back with hardly any risk at all. <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span>
therefore performed another act - holding the decedent - without which the
crime would not have been accomplished.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This makes him a principal by indispensable cooperation.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Consequently, appellant <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span> is also <span style="">liable for murder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As recommended by the Solicitor General, the mitigating
circumstance of voluntary surrender will be appreciated in favor of appellants <span class="SpellE">Labis</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of running away, they voluntarily
went with the policemen who took them <span style="">into
custody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With no aggravating
circumstance to offset voluntary surrender, <span class="GramE">We</span> must
impose the penalty for murder – <u>reclusion temporal</u> maximum to death - in
the minimum pe­riod, which is <u>reclusion temporal</u> maximum.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Since the resulting penalty is neither death nor <span style="">life </span>imprisonment, the Indeterminate
Sentence Law applies.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellants are therefore entitled to an indeterminate sentence, the maximum
term of which is <u>reclusion temporal</u> maximum - the penalty to be imposed
in view of the mitigating circumstance <span style="">of
voluntary surrender - and the minimum term - which </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">one </span><span style="">(1) </span><span style="">degree lower from
the penalty prescribed by the Code for murder - </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">anywhere from ten (10) years and one (1) day of </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">prision</span></u></span><u><span style=""> mayor</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">maximum to seventeen
(17) years and four (4) months </span><span style="">of
