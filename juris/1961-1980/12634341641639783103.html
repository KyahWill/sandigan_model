Hermogenes Anguluan and Angel Anguluan charged the respondent Muni­cipal Judge
Henry C. Taguba of Rizal, Cagayan with (1) con­niving with Mayor Ventura
Baloran of Rizal, Cagayan in the filing of "an imaginary, fabricated,
baseless and unfounded criminal case of Qualified Trespass" against the
complain­ant Hermogenes Anguluan and other persons as a consequence of which
the persons charged were imprisoned for three (3) days at the municipal jail of
Rizal on August 3, 4 and 5, 1976, and (2) advising the complainants and Aleco
Anguluan, Diosdado Gundan and Jose de la Cruz, to sign an affidavit in the
presence of Mayor Baloran on August 12, 1976 with­out allowing them to read the
affidavit wherein the affiants admitted having entered upon "the area
presently occupied and belonging to VENTURA B. BALORAN, a resident of Barrio
Cambabangan, Rizal, Cagayan."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This affidavit-complaint was referred to the respon­dent for

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In his comment filed on
November 19, 1976, the res­pondent denied the alleged connivance between
himself and Mayor Ventura Baloran but admitted that Criminal Case No. 216 for
Qualified Trespass was filed before him by Acting Chief of Police David G.
Duruin on June 18, 1974 and alleged that he conducted the requisite preliminary
investi­gation of the case on August 29, 1974 but issued the war­rant of arrest
only on August 3, 1976; and that respon­dent's inability to promptly rule on
the existence of pro­bable cause was due to his belief that the dispute was
more or less civil in nature and "there were sincere efforts on the part
of both parties to settle the case."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the charge that the
respondent failed to read and explain to the affiants the averments of the
affidavit, the respondent said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The Affidavit of Hermogenes An­guluan and Angel Anguluan was
prepared by somebody else.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All what I
could re­call was the Municipal Secretary in the morning whom I trusted to
serve as a bridge between the Mayor and accused approached me and asked
accommodation to mediate the differences of the par­ties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since this was the first time that a
respectable and responsible per­son made a request which request could not be
turned down considering his stature, I acceded believing that it could
terminate once and for all their squabble.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So that in the afternoon when the Mayor brought in the supposed affiants
of the affidavit in question, I thought that that was the work of the
Secretary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I instructed my clerk to
supervise the signing and unaware of the legal effects of the document, he
assured me that everything was alright.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I did that because at the time I was helpless without eyeglasses."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the alleged detention
of the complainants for three days, the respondent said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It is alleged in the Joint Affidavit of Hermogenes Anguluan
and Angel Anguluan that they were detained.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>May I <span style="">ask </span>if a Court
after conducting the requisite preliminary investigation prior to arrest is
devoid of any power to issue a Warrant of Arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The new lawyer who instigated this case
against me should study his law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law
is clear on the matter that after a Judge has asked searching questions of the
complainant and his witnesses, a Warrant of Arrest could be issued there being
findings of probable cause, which is present in the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the allegation that when I subscribed
their affidavit, I did not explain to them what was then being subscribed, I
know clearly my law on the matter and if there was mistake committed, I was
probably laboring under the im­pression that everything was in order and since
my Court and/or office was overcrowded doing plenty of work and forgot my
eyeglasses then at home I mislooked and overlooked important items that should
at the first place given close scrutiny.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But while I admit slight oversight on minor mat­ters, I deny vigorously that
I con­nived with certain parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
cannot sacrifice the immense prestige of a judge in a small municipality for
the sake of temporary friendship and narrow convenience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My oath as such has always served as my
guidepost for discipline, excellence and fairness."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In a Resolution dated
June 19, 1978, this Court re­ferred the case to Executive Judge Alberto Gampoña
of the Court of First Instance of Cagayan, at Tuao, Cagayan for investigation,
report and recommendation.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Judge Gampoña submitted his Report and

<p class="BODY"><span style="">During the investigation
on September 14, 1978 conducted by Judge Gampoña, the complainant, Hermogenes

his complaint against the respondent.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On October 16, 1978,
complainants' counsel appeared on the scheduled hearing without the
complainants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said counsel informed the
investigating judge about his clients' desire to withdraw the complaint.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

motion to withdraw the complaint was filed by complainants' lawyer, Atty.
Nelson C. Villaflor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To said motion was
attached the affidavit of complainant, Hermogenes Anguluan, explaining the
non-appearance of the other complainant, Angel A. Anguluan, whose whereabouts
are not known to him and alleging that the administrative matter was being
withdrawn because the affidavit-complaint "does not </span>in <span style="">any way substantiate a good cause of
action" and the complainants' "evidence on hand will not suffice our
charge </span>x x x."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding the above-stated motion to withdraw, Alberto
Gampoña examined the records of the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He found that the respondent judge had committed gross negligence in the
performance of his judicial functions in that the res­pondent gave due course to
the complaint for Qualified Tres­pass in Criminal Case No. 216 filed on June
18, 1974; that <span style="">it </span>was clear from
the complaint and the supporting affida­vits that the crime charged therein had
already prescribed; that moreover, although the preliminary examination was
conducted on August 29, 1974, the warrant of arrest was issued only on August
3, 1976, after the lapse of more than two (2) years from date the complaint was
filed; and that finally, the respondent admitted that he failed to explain the
contents of the affidavit which was subscribed and sworn to on August 12, 1976
before him by complainant Hermogenes An­guluan and four other persons, the
dismissal of Criminal Case No. 216 being based on said affidavit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The findings of Judge Alberto Gampoña are supported by the facts
of record.</p>

<p class="BODY">The criminal complaint filed by the Acting Chief of Police, David
G. Duruin, in Criminal Case No. 216 before the Municipal Court of Rizal,
Cagayan, presided by the res­pondent judge reads as follows:</p>

P200.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The act of entering a fenced

<p class="BODY">It is alleged in the criminal complaint filed by the Acting Chief
of Police that the crime was committed on Decem­ber 10, 1973.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The criminal complaint was filed only on June
18, 1974.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent judge should
have known immediately by simply reading the criminal complaint that the crime
charged had prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent
judge displayed gross ignorance of the law in giving due course to the criminal
complaint as a result of which the persons accused were detained for three
days.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the preliminary examination was conducted on August 29,
1974, the warrant of arrest was issued only on August 3, 1976.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The failure of the respondent judge <span style="">to </span>issue the warrant of arrest within
a reasonable time is suspicious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
respondent judge was either ignorant of his duty or he was impelled by an
ulterior motive.</p>

<p class="BODY">And finally, the respondent judge admitted that he did not
explain the affidavit to the affiants before he administered the oath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His excuse that he could not read without his
eyeglasses is asinine, <span style="">to say </span>the
least.</p>

justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is for this <span style="">reason</span> <span style="">that</span> <span style="">the motion to withdraw
