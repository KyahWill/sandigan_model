Case No. SD-3 (72)] by Judge <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span> should be set aside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The following are not in dispute:</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Lorenzo Gloria was accused with two others before the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Guimba</span> Branch, of Theft of large cattle in three
separate cases under an Information which alleged that in March, 1971, in <span class="SpellE">Guimba</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>,
the accused stole certain <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span> belonging to
Jacinto Sebastian, Simeon <span class="SpellE">Makasiki</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>, respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the Presiding Judge, Hon. <span class="SpellE">Placido</span>
Ramos, found a variance between the allegations in the <span class="SpellE">Informations</span>
and the proof submitted in that the alleged theft was committed on <st1:date month="4" day="18" year="1971">April 18, 1971</st1:date>, in <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, and that the stolen <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span>
belonged <span style="">to <span class="SpellE">Donato</span>
<span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Judge accordingly convicted appellant of "<u>Theft of large cattle
belonging to <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>
committed on </u></span><st1:date month="4" day="18" year="1971"><u><span style="">April 18, 1971</span></u></st1:date><u><span style=""> in <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span></span></u><span style="">," and sentenced him to an indeterminate
penalty of FIVE (5) YEARS, FIVE (5) MONTHS and TEN (10) DAYS of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span></u>,
as minimum, to TEN (10) YEARS, EIGHT (8) MONTHS of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u>
mayor</u> as maximum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision it was expressly stated
that the judgment <u>operated as a bar to Lorenzo Gloria's prosecution in a
criminal case for theft of large cattle then pending preliminary investigation
before the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>.<o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing decision of Judge Ramos was appealed to the Court
of Appeals under CA-G.R. Nos. 13626-13628-CR, with appellant raising the
principal issue that the trial Court erred in convicting him of a crime not
charged in the respective <span class="SpellE">Informations</span> filed against
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal was certified to this
Court by the Court of Appeals as it in­volved purely a question of law and it
was docketed here under G.R. L-37176-78.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the meantime however
another case of theft of large cattle </span>was filed against appellant
Lorenzo Gloria before Branch VI (<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>) in which he was accused of <u>having
stolen certain <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span> on </u><st1:date month="4" day="18" year="1971"><u>April 18, 1971</u></st1:date><u> belonging to <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> in <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>[Criminal
Case No. SD-3 (72)] Lorenzo Gloria <u>pleaded double jeopardy</u> invoking the
judgment of conviction rendered by the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Guimba</span> Court</st1:address></st1:street> for the same
offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plea was discarded by Judge
<span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span> who
reasoned out that the subject matter of the second Information was entirely
distinct and different from the first complaint filed before the <span class="SpellE">Guimba</span> Branch, and that the decision of the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Guimba</span> Court</st1:address></st1:street> was not yet final
as the same was pending appeal before the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>
convicted and sentenced Lorenzo Gloria for theft of large cattle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This decision of Judge <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>
was appealed to the Court of Appeals under <st1:place><st1:city>CA-G.R.</st1:city>
 <st1:postalcode>14345</st1:postalcode></st1:place> which was also certified to
Us by reason of the issues involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is this appeal which is now the subject of this Decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the
above-mentioned cases, Lorenzo Gloria withdrew his appeal in G.R.
L-37176-78.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Our Resolution of <st1:date month="7" day="8" year="1977">July 8, 1977</st1:date>, the withdrawal of appeal
was approved.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question which confronts Us is whether or not the decision
handed down by Judge <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span> in Criminal Case No.
SD-3 (72) places <span style="">the appellant Lorenzo
Gloria in jeopardy of a second conviction for the same offense of theft of
large cattle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><u>Nemo</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">debet</span>
<span class="SpellE">bis</span> <span class="SpellE">puniri</span> pro <span class="SpellE">uno</span> <span class="SpellE">delicto</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An accused shall not be twice put in jeopardy
of punishment for the same offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
is one of the basic rights guaranteed in the Philippine Constitution,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
which finds its roots in centuries - old struggle of man for freedom against
"the constant menace of a never-ending charge" which results in <span class="SpellE">harrassment</span> to one's peace of mind and continuous threat to
one's physical liberty.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is legal jeopardy when for the <u>same offense</u>
presently charged in a criminal case the following conditions are present: <u>previous</u>
acquittal, conviction, dismissal or termination without express consent of an
accused under a valid complaint or information, before a court of competent
jurisdiction, and after arraignment and entry of plea to the charge.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The parties now concede that the first conviction was based on a
valid complaint and rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever ground there was for challenging
that first conviction was waived by the accused-appellant when he withdrew his
appeal thereby rendering the decision of Judge Ramos final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is in issue is whether or not the first conviction is for <u>an
offense identical</u> to that charged in the second case filed with the Court
of First Instance in <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span> City for which
appellant has also been sentenced.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General representing the People submits that the
respective <span class="SpellE">Informations</span> in the two cases show that
they allege or charge different offenses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We hold, however, that <u>the two convictions cover one and the same
offense</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">If We will be guided solely by the wordings in the Information
filed before the <span class="SpellE">Guimba</span> Court, it would indeed appear
that appellant was <span style="">accused of theft of
large cattle belonging to Jacinto Sebastian, Simeon <span class="SpellE">Makasiki</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>;
however, the <u>reality is</u> that the evi­dence adduced in that first case
proved that two <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span>, "one male and </span>one
female", were stolen by appellant on April 18, 1971, from <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> in <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
accusation was therefore deemed amended by the evidence adduced by the People
for which reason Judge Ramos convicted appellant herein of <u>theft of large
cattle belonging to <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>
committed on </u><st1:date month="4" day="18" year="1971"><u>April 18, 1971</u></st1:date><u>,
in <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span></u>, the Judge stating at the same time that said
conviction barred the other criminal case under preliminary investigation at
the time before the Municipal Judge of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Information filed in Criminal Case No. SD-3 (72) before
the Court of First Instance in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, Lorenzo Gloria was accused of
theft of two <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span>, "one male and one
female", belonging to <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>
committed on <st1:date month="4" day="18" year="1971">April 18, 1971</st1:date>,
in <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence
submitted before the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Guimba</span>
  Court</st1:address></st1:street> was the same evidence offered before the
Court in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> resulting in appel­lant's
conviction by the latter for theft of large cattle as charged in the
Information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is significant and
decisive of the issue before Us is that there is <u>nothing in the record to show</u>
that the <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span> subject of the second charge <u>were
different from</u> the <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span> object of the <span style="">first conviction nor <u>that they were taken
on distinct occasions</u> to warrant a conclusion that two separate acts or
offenses of theft were consummated and being prosecuted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Undoubtedly, there is here identity of offenses because (1) the
essential elements of theft of large cattle in the first case constituted the
same essential elements of the offense charged in the second and (2) the
evidence supporting conviction upon the first indictment was the same evidence
which warranted conviction upon the second, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:
that two <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span> - "one male and one
female" - belonging to <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> were stolen from the latter's house in <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, on <st1:date month="4" day="18" year="1971">April
 18, 1971</st1:date>, by the herein appellant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, all the necessary conditions for a plea of double jeopardy are
present and appellant comes within the Constitutional protection against being
prosecuted and convicted for the second time for the same offense.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE ABOVE</b>, We hereby set aside the decision
rendered against and the sentence imposed on the herein appellant, Lorenzo
Gloria, by the Court of First Instance in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
