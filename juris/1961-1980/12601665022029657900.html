<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This Court, by resolution, 
ordered that these three cases be considered together, and the parties were 
allowed to file only one brief for the three cases.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On January 14, 1963, the 
President of the respondent <span class="SpellE">Feati</span> University Faculty 
Club PAFLU—hereinafter referred to as Faculty Club—wrote a letter to Mrs. 
Victoria L. <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, President of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Feati</span> University—hereinafter referred to as 
University—informing her of the organization of the Faculty Club into a 
registered labor union. The Faculty Club is composed of members who are 
professors and/or instructors of the University. On </span><st1:date month="1" day="22" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 22, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
President of the Faculty Club sent another letter containing twenty six demands 
that have connection with the employment of the members of the Faculty Club by 
the University, and requesting an answer within ten days from receipt thereof. 
The President of the University answered the two letters, requesting that she be 
given at least thirty days to study thoroughly the different phases of the 
demands. Meanwhile counsel for the University, to whom the demands were 
referred, wrote a letter to the President of the Faculty Club demanding proof of 
its majority status and designation as a bargaining representative. On February 
1, 1963, the President of the Faculty Club again wrote the President of the 
University rejecting the latter's request for extension of time, and on the same 
day he filed a notice of strike with the Bureau of Labor alleging as reason 
<span class="SpellE">therefor</span> the refusal of the University to bargain 
collectively. The parties were called to conferences at the Conciliation 
Division of the Bureau of Labor but efforts to conciliate them failed. On 
February 18, 1963, the members of the Faculty Club declared a strike and 
established picket lines in the premises of the University, resulting in the 
disruption of classes in the University, Despite further efforts of the 
officials from the Department of Labor to effect a settlement of the differences 
between the management of the University and the striking faculty members no 
satisfactory agreement was arrived at. On </span><st1:date month="3" day="21" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 21, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
President of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> certified to the Court of 
Industrial Relations the dispute between the management of the University and 
the Faculty Club pursuant to the provisions of Section 10 of Republic Act No. 
875.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In connection with the dispute 
between the University and the Faculty Club and certain incidents related to 
<span class="GramE">said</span> dispute, various cases were filed with the Court 
of Industrial Relations - hereinafter referred to as CIR. The three cases now 
before this Court stemmed from those cases that were filed with the 
CIR;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><em><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Case No. G. R. No. 
L-21278</span></em><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="5" day="10" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">May 
10, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
the University filed before this Court a "petition for certiorari and 
prohibition with writ of preliminary injunction", docketed as G. R. No. L-21278, 
praying: (1) for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining 
respondent Judge Jose S. Bautista of the CIR to desist from proceeding in CIR 
Cases Nos. 41-IPA, 1183-MC, and V-30; (2) that the proceedings in Cases Nos. 
41-IPA and 1183-MC be annulled; (3) that the orders dated March 30, 1963 and 
April 6, 1963 in Case No. 41-IPA, the order dated April 6, 1963 in Case No. 
1183-MC, and the order dated April 29, 1963 in Case No. V-30, all be annulled; 
and (4) that the respondent Judge be ordered to dismiss said cases Nos. 41-IPA, 
1183-MC and V-30 of the CIR.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On May 10, 1963, this Court 
issued a writ of preliminary injunction, upon the University's filing a bond of 
P1,000.00, ordering respondent Judge Jose S. Bautista, as Presiding Judge of the 
CIR, until further order from this Court, "to desist and refrain from further 
proceeding in the premises (Cases Nos. 41-IPA, 1183-MC and V-30 of the Court of 
Industrial Relations).<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style21"><sup>[1]</sup></span>" On December 4, 
1963, this Court ordered the injunction bond increased to P100,000.00; but on 
January 23, 1964, upon a motion for reconsideration by the University, this 
Court reduced the bond to P50,000.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">A brief statement of the three 
cases—CIR Cases 41—IPA, 1183—MC and V-30—involved in the Case G. R. No. L-<span class="GramE">21278,</span> is here necessary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">CIR Case No. 41-<span class="GramE">IPA<span style="font-style: normal;">,</span></span></span></em><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> relates to the case in 
connection with the strike staged by the members of the Faculty Club. As we have 
stated, the dispute between the University and the Faculty Club was certified on 
</span><st1:date month="3" day="21" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 21, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> by 
the President of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> to the CIR. On the strength of 
the presidential certification, respondent Judge Bautista set the case for 
hearing on </span><st1:date month="3" day="23" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 23, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
During the hearing, the Judge endeavored to reconcile the parties, and it was 
agreed upon that the striking faculty members would return to work and the 
University would readmit them under a <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">status quo</span></em> arrangement. On that very 
same day, however, the University, thru counsel filed a motion to dismiss the 
case upon the ground that the CIR has no jurisdiction over the case, because (1) 
the Industrial Peace Act is not applicable to the University, it being an 
educational institution, nor to the members of the Faculty Club, they being 
independent contractors; and (2) the presidential certification is <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of Section 10 of the Industrial Peace Act, as the 
University is not an industrial establishment and there was no industrial 
dispute which could be certified to the CIR. On </span><st1:date month="3" day="30" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 
30, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
the respondent Judge issued an order denying the motion to dismiss and declaring 
that the Industrial Peace Act is applicable to both parties in the case and that 
the CIR had acquired jurisdiction over the case by virtue of the presidential 
certification. In the same order, the respondent Judge, believing that the 
dispute could not be decided promptly, ordered the strikers to return 
immediately to work and the University to take them back under the last terms 
and conditions existing before the dispute arose, as per agreement had during 
the hearing on March 23, 1963; and likewise enjoined the University, pending 
adjudication of the case, from dismissing any employee or laborer without 
previous authorization from the CIR. The University filed on </span><st1:date month="4" day="1" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 1, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> a 
motion for reconsideration of the order of </span><st1:date month="3" day="30" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 30, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> by 
the CIR <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">en banc</span></em>, and at the 
same time asking that the motion for reconsideration be first heard by the CIR 
<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">en banc</span></em>. Without the motion 
for reconsideration having been acted upon by the CIR <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">en banc</span></em>, respondent Judge set the case 
for hearing on the merits for </span><st1:date month="5" day="8" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">May 8, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. The 
University moved for the cancellation of said hearing upon the ground that the 
court <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">en banc</span></em> should first 
hear the motion for reconsideration and resolve the issues <span class="GramE">raised</span> therein before the case is heard on the merits. This 
motion for cancellation of the hearing was denied. The respondent Judge, 
however, cancelled the scheduled hearing when counsel for the University 
manifested that he would take up before the Supreme Court, by a petition for 
certiorari, the matter regarding the actuations of the respondent Judge and the 
issues <span class="GramE">raised</span> in the motion for reconsideration, 
specially the issue relating to the jurisdiction of the CIR. The order of 
</span><st1:date month="3" day="30" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 30, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> in 
Case 41-IPA is one of the orders sought to be annulled in the case, G. R. No. 
<span class="GramE">L-21278.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Before the above-mentioned order 
of </span><st1:date month="3" day="30" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 30, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> was 
issued by respondent Judge, the University had employed professors and/or 
instructors to take the places of those professors and/or instructors who had 
struck. On April 1, 1963, the Faculty Club filed with the CIR in Case 41-IPA a 
petition to declare in contempt of court certain parties, alleging that the 
University refused to accept back to work the returning strikers, in violation 
of the return-to-work order of March 30, 1963. The University filed, on 
</span><st1:date month="4" day="5" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 5, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, its 
opposition to the petition for contempt, denying the allegations of the Faculty 
Club and alleging by way of special defense that there was still the motion for 
reconsideration of the order of </span><st1:date month="3" day="30" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 30, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
which had not yet been acted upon by the CIR <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">en banc</span></em>. On </span><st1:date month="4" day="6" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 
6, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
the respondent Judge issued an order stating that "said replacements are hereby 
warned and cautioned, for the time being, not to disturb nor in any manner 
commit any act tending to disrupt the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of 
the order of </span><st1:date month="3" day="30" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 30, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
pending the final resolution of the same."<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style31"><sup>[2]</sup></span> On </span><st1:date month="4" day="8" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 8, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
replacing professors and/or instructors concerned filed, thru counsel, a motion 
for reconsideration by the CIR <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">en 
banc</span></em> of the order of respondent Judge of </span><st1:date month="4" day="6" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 
6, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
This order of </span><st1:date month="4" day="6" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 6, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> is 
one of the orders that are sought to be annulled in case G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-21278.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">CIR Case No. 
1183—MC</span></em><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> relates 
to a petition for certification election filed by the Faculty Club on March 8, 
1963 before the CIR, praying that it be certified as the sole and exclusive 
bargaining representative of all the employees of the University. The University 
filed an opposition to the petition for certification election and at the same 
time a motion to dismiss said petition, raising the very same issues raised in 
Case No. 41-IPA, claiming that the petition did not comply with the rules 
promulgated by the CIR; that the Faculty Club is not a legitimate labor union; 
that the members of the Faculty Club cannot unionize for collective bargaining 
purposes; that the terms of the individual contracts of the professors, 
instructors, and teachers, who are members of the Faculty Club, would expire on 
March 25 or 31, 1963; and that the CIR has no jurisdiction to take cognizance of 
the petition because the Industrial Peace Act is not applicable to the members 
of the Faculty Club nor to the University. This case was assigned to Judge <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> Villanueva of the CIR. Before Judge Villanueva 
could act on the motion to dismiss, however, the Faculty Club filed on April 3, 
1963 a motion to withdraw the petition on the ground that the labor dispute 
(Case No. 41-IPA) had already been certified by the President to the CIR and the 
issues raised in Case No. 1183-MC were absorbed by Case No. 41-IPA. The 
University opposed the withdrawal, alleging that the issues raised in Case No. 
1183-MC were separate and distinct from the issues raised in Case No. 41-IPA; 
that the questions of recognition and majority status in Case No. 1183-MC were 
not absorbed by Case No. 41-IPA; and that the CIR could not exercise its power 
of compulsory arbitration unless the legal issue regarding the existence of 
employer-employee relationship was first resolved. The University prayed that 
the motion of the Faculty Club to withdraw the petition for certification 
election be denied, and that its motion to dismiss the petition be heard. Judge 
<span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> Villanueva, finding that the reasons stated 
by the Faculty Club in the motion to withdraw were well taken, on 
</span><st1:date month="4" day="6" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 6, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
issued an order granting the withdrawal. The University filed, on 
</span><st1:date month="4" day="24" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 24, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, a 
motion for reconsideration of that order of </span><st1:date month="4" day="6" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 6, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> by 
the CIR <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">en banc</span></em>. This order 
of </span><st1:date month="4" day="6" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 6, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> in 
Case No. 1183-MC is one of the orders sought to be annulled in the case, G. R. 
No. <span class="GramE">L-21278, now before Us.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><em><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">CIR Case 
No.</span></em></span><em><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
V-30</span></em><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> relates to 
a complaint for indirect contempt of court filed against the administrative 
officials of the University. The Faculty Club, through the Acting Chief 
Prosecutor of the CIR, filed with the CIR a complaint, docketed as Case No. 
V-30, charging President Victoria L. <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, Dean 
Daniel <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>, Executive Vice-President Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Maslog</span>, and Assistant to the President Jose Segovia, as 
officials of the University, with indirect contempt of court, reiterating the 
same charges filed in Case No. 41-IPA for alleged violation of the order dated 
</span><st1:date month="3" day="30" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 30, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
Based on the complaint thus filed by the Acting Chief Prosecutor of the CIR, 
respondent Judge Bautista issued on April 29, 1963 an order commanding any 
officer of the law to arrest the above named officials of the University so that 
they may be dealt with in accordance with law, and at the same time fixed the 
bond for their release at P500.00 each. This order of </span><st1:date month="4" day="29" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 
29, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
is also one of the orders sought to be annulled in the case, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-21278.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The principal 
allegation of the University in its petition for certiorari and prohibition with 
preliminary injunction in Case G. R. No.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> L-21278, now before Us, is that 
respondent Judge Jose S. Bautista acted without, or in excess of, jurisdiction, 
or with grave abuse of discretion, in taking cognizance of, and in issuing the 
questioned orders in, CIR Cases Nos. 41-IPA, 1183-MC and V-30. Let it be noted 
that when the petition for certiorari and prohibition with preliminary 
injunction was filed on May 10, 1963 in this case, the questioned orders in CIR 
Cases Nos. 41-IPA, 1183-MC and V-30 were still pending action by the CIR 
<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">en banc</span></em> upon motions for 
reconsideration filed by the University.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On June 10, 1963, the Faculty 
Club filed its answer to the petition for certiorari and prohibition with 
preliminary injunction, admitting some allegations contained in the petition and 
denying others, and alleging special defenses which boil down to the contentions 
that (1) the CIR had acquired jurisdiction to take cognizance of Case No. 41-IPA 
by virtue of the presidential certification, so that it had jurisdiction to 
issue the questioned orders in said Case No. 41-IPA; (2) that the Industrial 
Peace Act (Republic Act 875) is applicable to the University as an employer and 
to the members of the Faculty Club as employees who are affiliated with a duly 
registered labor union, so that the Court of Industrial Relations had 
jurisdiction to take cognizance of Cases Nos. 1183-MC and V-30 and to issue the 
questioned orders in those two cases; and (3) that the petition for <span class="SpellE">certiorari</span> and prohibition with preliminary injunction was 
prematurely filed because the orders of the CIR sought to be annulled were still 
the subjects of pending motions for reconsideration before the CIR <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">en banc</span></em> when said petition for 
certiorari and prohibition with preliminary injunction was filed before this 
Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><em><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Case G. R. No. 
L-21462</span></em><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This case, G. 
R. No.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
L-21462, involves also CIR Case No. 1183-MC. As already stated Case No. 1183-MC 
relates to a petition for certification election filed by the Faculty Club as a 
labor union, praying that it be certified as the sole and exclusive bargaining 
representative of all employees of the University. This petition was opposed by 
the University, and at the same time it filed a motion to dismiss said petition. 
But before Judge <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> Villanueva could act on the 
petition for certification election and the motion to dismiss the same, Faculty 
Club filed a motion to withdraw said petition upon the ground that the issues 
raised in Case No. 1183-MC were absorbed by Case No. 41-IPA which was certified 
by the President of the Philippines. Judge <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> 
Villanueva, by order of </span><st1:date month="4" day="6" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 6, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
granted the motion to withdraw. The university filed a motion for 
reconsideration of that order of </span><st1:date month="4" day="6" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 6, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> by 
the CIR <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">en banc</span></em>. That motion 
for reconsideration was pending action by the CIR <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">en banc</span></em> when the petition for

<span class="GramE">As earlier stated this Court, in Case G. R. No.</span>

that is, after this Court has issued the writ of preliminary injunction in Case 
G. R. No. L-21278, the CIR <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">en

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On July 8, 1963, the University 
filed before this Court a petition for certiorari, by way of an appeal from the 
resolution of the CIR <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">en 
banc</span></em>, dated June 5, 1963, denying the motion for reconsideration of 
the order of April 6, 1963 in Case No. 1183-MC. This petition was docketed as G. 
R. No. <span class="GramE">L-21462.</span> In its petition for certiorari, the 
University alleges (1) that the resolution of the Court of Industrial Relations 
of June 5, 1963 was null and void because it was issued in violation of the writ 
of preliminary injunction issued in Case G. .R. No.L-21278; (2) that the issues 
of employer-employee relationship, the alleged status as a labor union, majority 
representation and designation as bargaining representative in an appropriate 
unit of the Faculty Club should have been resolved first in Case No. 1183-MC 
prior to the determination of the issues in Case No. 41-IFA and therefore the 
motion to with-draw the petition for certification election should not have been 
granted upon the ground that the issues in the first case have been absorbed in 
the second case; and (3) the lower court acted without or in excess of 
jurisdiction in taking cognizance of the petition for certification election and 
that the same should have been dismissed instead of having been ordered 
withdrawn. The University prayed that the proceedings in Case No. 1183-MC and 
the order of </span><st1:date month="4" day="6" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 6,

1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
issued therein be annulled, and that the CIR be ordered to dismiss Case No. 
1183-MC on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Faculty Club filed its 
answer, admitting some, and denying other, allegations in the petition for 
certiorari; and specially alleging that the lower court's order granting the 
withdrawal of the petition for certification election was in accordance with 
law, and that the resolution of the court <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">en banc</span></em> on June 5, 1963 was not a 
violation of the writ of preliminary injunction issued in Case G. R. No.L-21278 
because said writ of injunction was issued against Judge Jose S. Bautista and 
not against the Court of Industrial Relations, much less against Judge <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> Villanueva who was the trial judge of Case No. 
1183-MC.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This case, G. 
R. No.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
L-21500, involves also CIR Case No. 41-IPA. As earlier stated, Case No. 41-IPA 
relates to the strike staged by the members of the Faculty Club and the dispute 
was certified by the President of the Philip pines to the CIR. The University 
filed a motion to dismiss that case upon the ground that the CIR has no 
jurisdiction over the case, and on March 30, 1963 Judge Jose S. Bautista issued 
an order denying the motion to dismiss and declaring that the Industrial Peace 
Act is applicable to both parties in the case and that the CIR had acquired 
jurisdiction over the case by virtue of the presidential certification; and in 
that same order Judge Bautista ordered the strikers to return to work and the 
University to take them back under the last terms and conditions existing before 
the dispute arose; and enjoined the University from dismissing any employee or 
laborer without previous authority from the court. On </span><st1:date month="4" day="1" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 
1, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
the University filed a motion for reconsideration of the order of

1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> by 
the CIR <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">en banc</span></em>. That motion 
for reconsideration was pending action by the CIR <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">en banc</span></em> when the petition for 
certiorari and prohibition with preliminary injunction in Case G. R. No. L-21278 
was filed on </span><st1:date month="5" day="10" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">May 10, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. As 
we have already stated, this Court in said case G. R. No.L-21278, issued a writ 
of preliminary injunction on May 10, 1963 ordering respondent Judge Jose S. 
Bautista, until further order from this Court, to demist and refrain from 
further proceeding in the premises (Cases Nos. 41-IPA, 1183-MC and V-30 of the 
Court of Industrial Relations).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On July 2, 1963, the University 
received a copy of the resolution of the CIR <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">en banc</span></em>, dated May 7, 1963 but actually 
received and stamped at the Office of the Clerk of the CIR on June 28, 1963, 
denying the motion for reconsideration of the order dated March 30, 1963 in Case 
No. 41-IPA.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On July 23, 1963, the University 
filed before this Court a petition for certiorari, by way of ah appeal from the 
resolution of the Court of Industrial Relations <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">en banc</span></em> dated May 7, 1963 (but actually 
received by said petitioner on July 2, 1963) denying the motion for 
reconsideration of the order of March 30, 1963 in Case No. 41-IPA. This petition 
was docketed as G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-21500.</span> In its petition for 
certiorari the University alleges (1) that the resolution of the CIR <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">en banc</span></em>, dated May 7, 1963 but filed 
with the Clerk of the CIR on June 28, 1963, in Case No. 41-IPA, is null and void 
because it was issued in violation of the writ of preliminary injunction issued 
by this Court in G. R. No. L-21278; (2) that the CIR, through its Presiding 
Judge, had no jurisdiction to take cognizance of Case No. 41-IPA and the order 
of March 30, 1963 and the resolution dated May 7, 1963 issued therein are null 
and void; (3) that the certification made by the President of the Philippines is 
not authorized by Section 10 of Republic Act 875, but is <span class="SpellE">violative</span> thereof; (4) that the Faculty Club has no right to 
unionize or organize as a labor union for collective bargaining purposes and to 
be certified as a collective bargaining agent within the purview of the 
Industrial Peace Act, and consequently it has no right to strike and picket on 
the ground of petitioner's alleged refusal to bargain collectively where such 
duty does not exist in law and is not enforceable against an educational 
institution; and (5) that the return-to-work order of March 30, 1963 is improper 
and illegal. The petition prayed that the proceedings in Case No. 41-IPA be 
annulled, that the order dated March 30, 1963 and the resolution dated May 7, 
1963 be revoked, and that the lower court be ordered to dismiss Case 41-IPA on 
the ground of lack of jurisdiction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On September 10, 1963, the 
Faculty Club, through counsel, filed a motion to dismiss the petition for 
certiorari on the ground that the petition being filed by way of an appeal from 
the orders of the Court of Industrial Relations denying the motion to dismiss in 
Case No. 41-IPA, the petition for certiorari is not proper because the orders 
appealed from are interlocutory in nature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This Court, by resolution of 
</span><st1:date month="9" day="26" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 26, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
ordered that these three cases (G.R. Nos. L-21278, L-21462 and L-21500) be 
considered together and the motion to dismiss in Case G. R. No. L-21500 <span class="GramE">be</span> taken up when the cases are decided on the merits after 
the hearing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Brushing aside certain technical 
questions raised by the parties in their pleadings, <span class="GramE">We</span> 
proceed to decide these three cases on the merits of the issues 
raised.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The University has raised several 
issues in the present cases, the pivotal one being its claim that the Court of 
Industrial Relations has no jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter 
in CIR Cases 41-IPA, 1183-MC and V-30, brought before it, upon the ground that 
Republic Act No. 875 is not applicable to the University because it is an 
educational institution and not an industrial establishment and hence not an 
"employer" in contemplation of said Act; and neither is Republic Act No. 875 
applicable to the members of the Faculty Club because the latter are independent 
contractors and, therefore, not employees within the purview of the said 
Act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In support of the contention that 
being an educational institution it is beyond the scope of Republic Act No. 875, 
the University cites cases decided by this Court: Boy Scouts of the Philippines 
<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. Juliana <span class="SpellE">Araos</span>, L-10091, Jan. 29, 1958; University of San Agustin 
<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. CIR et al., L-12222, May 
28, 1958; <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Chinese High School <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. Philippine Land-Air-Sea Labor 
Union, PLASLU, L-12015, April 22, 1959; La <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> 
College, et al., <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. CIR, et 
al., L-13282, April 22, 1960; University of the Philippines, et al., <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. CIR et al., L-15416, April 28, 
1960; Far Eastern University <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. CIR, L-17620, August 31, 1962. We 
have reviewed these cases, and also related cases subsequent thereto, and <span class="GramE">We</span> find that they do not sustain the contention of the 
University. It is true that this Court has ruled that certain educational 
institutions, like the University of Santo Tomas, University of San Agustin, La 
<span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> College, and other juridical entities, 
like the Boy Scouts of the Philippines and Manila Sanitarium, are beyond the 
purview of Republic Act No. 875 in the sense that the Court of Industrial 
Relations has no jurisdiction to take cognizance of charges of unfair labor 
practice filed against them, but it is nonetheless true that the principal 
reason of this Court in ruling in those cases that those institutions are 
excluded from the operation of Republic Act 875 is that those entities are not 
organized, maintained and operated for profit and do not declare dividends to 
stockholders.

Since the University of San Agustin is not an institution established for profit

this Court, <span class="SpellE">apeaking</span> thru Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Montemayor</span>, answered the query in the negative in the

<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">'The main issue involved in the 
present case is whether or not a charitable institution or one organized not for 
profit but for more elevated purposes, charitable, humanitarian, etc., like the 
Boy Scouts of the Philippines, is included in the definition of "employer" 
contained in Republic Act 875, and whether the employees of said institution 
fall under the definition of "employee" also contained in the same Republic Act. 
If they are included, then any act which may be considered unfair labor 
practice, within the meaning of said Republic Act, would come under the 
jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations; but if they do not fall 
within the scope of said Republic Act, particularly, its definitions of employer 
and employee, then the Industrial Court would have no jurisdiction at 
all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">'On the basis of the foregoing 
considerations, there is every reason to believe that our labor legislation from 
Commonwealth Act No. 103, creating the Court of Industrial Relations, down 
through the Eight Hour Labor Law, to the Industrial Peace Act, was intended by 
the Legislature to apply only to industrial employment and to govern the 
relations between employers engaged in industry and occupations for purposes of 
profit and gain, and their industrial employees, but not to organizations and 
entities which are organized, operated, and maintained not for profit or gain, 
but for elevated and lofty purposes, such as, charity, social service, education 
and instruction, hospital and medical service, the encouragement and promotion 
of character, patriotism and kindred virtues in youth of the nation, 
etc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">'In conclusion, we find and hold 
that Republic Act No. 875, particularly, that portion thereof regarding labor 
disputes and unfair labor practice, does not apply to the Boy Scouts of the 
Philippines, and consequently, the Court of Industrial Relations had no 
jurisdiction to entertain and decide the action or petition filed by respondent 
<span class="SpellE">Araos</span>. Wherefore, the appealed decision and resolution 
of the CIR are hereby set aside, with costs against 
respondent.'<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"There being a close analogy 
between the relation and facts involved in the two cases, we cannot but conclude 
that the Court of Industrial Relations has no jurisdiction to entertain the 
complaint for unfair labor practice lodged by respondent association against 
petitioner and, therefore, we hereby set aside the order and resolution subject 
of the present petition, with costs against respondent 
association."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>

to the education of the youth. The Court of First Instance of Manila in its 
decision in Civil Case No. 28870, which has long become final and consequently 
the settled law in the case, found as established by the evidence adduced by the 
parties therein (herein petitioner and respondent labor-union) that while the 
University collects fees from its students, all its Income is used for the 
improvement and enlargement of the institution. The University declares no 
dividend, and the members of the corporation who founded it, as ordained in its 
articles of incorporation, receive no material compensation for the time and 
sacrifice they render to the University and its students. The respondent union 
itself in a case before the industrial Court (Case No. 314-MC) has averred that 
'the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">University</span></st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Sto</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. Tomas, like the San <span class="SpellE">Beda</span> College, is an educational institution operated not for 
profit but for the sole purpose of educating young men.' (See Annex 'B' to 
petitioner's motion to dismiss.). It is apparent, therefore, that on the face of 
the record the University of Santo Tomas is not a corporation created for profit 
but an educational institution and therefore not an industrial or business 
organization."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is noteworthy that the cases 
of the University of San Agustin, the University of Santo Tomas, and La <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> College, cited above, all involve charges of 
unfair labor practice under Republic Act No. 875, and the uniform rulings of 
this Court are that the Court of Industrial Relations has no jurisdiction over 
the charges because said Act does not apply to educational institutions that are 
not operated or maintained for profit and do not declare dividends. On the other 
hand, in the case of Far Eastern University <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. CIR et al, G. R. No. L-17620, 
</span><st1:date month="8" day="31" year="1962"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 31, 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
this Court upheld the decision of the Court of Industrial Relations finding the 
Far Eastern University, also an educational institution, guilty of unfair labor 
practice. Among the findings of fact in said case was that the Far Eastern 
University made profits from the school year 1952-1953 to 1958-1959. In 
affirming the decision of the lower court, this Court had thereby ratified the 
ruling of the Court of Industrial Relations which applied the Industrial Peace 
Act to educational institutions that are organized, operated and maintained for 
profit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is also noteworthy that in the

Tomas, and La <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> College, this Court was not unanimous in the 
view that the Industrial Peace Act (Republic Act No. 875) is not applicable to 
charitable, eleemosynary or non-profit organizations—which include educational 
institutions not operated for profit. There are members of this Court who hold 
the view that the Industrial Peace Act would apply also to non-profit 
organizations or entities—the only exception being the Government, including any 
political subdivision or instrumentality thereof, in so far as governmental 
functions are concerned. However, in the Far Eastern University case this Court 
is unanimous in supporting the view that an educational institution that is 
operated for profit comes within the scope of the Industrial Peace Act. We 
consider it a settled doctrine of this Court, therefore, that the Industrial 
Peace Act is applicable to any organization or entity—whatever may be its 
purpose when it was created—that is operated for profit or 
gain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Does the University operate as an 
educational institution for profit? Does it declare dividends for its 
stockholders? If it does not, it must be declared beyond the purview of Republic 
Act No. 875; but if it does, Republic Act No. 875 must apply to it. The 
University itself admits that it has declared dividends<span class="GramE">.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style21"><sup>[</sup></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style21"><sup>3]</sup></span> 
The CIR in its order dated March 30, 1963 in CIR Case No. 41-IPA—which order was 
issued after evidence was heard, also found that the University is not for 
strictly educational purposes and that "It realizes profits and parts of such 
earning is distributed as dividends to private stockholders or individuals 
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A and also 1 to 1-F, 2-x 3-x and 4-x)<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style21"><sup>[4]</sup></span> Under this circumstance, and in consonance 
with the rulings in the decisions of this Court, above cited, it is obvious that 
Republic Act No. 875 is applicable t o herein petitioner <span class="SpellE">Feati</span> University.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">But the University claims that it 
is not an employer within the contemplation of Republic Act No. 875, because it 
is not an industrial establishment. At most, it says, it is only a lessee of the 
services of its professors and/or instructors pursuant to a contract of services 
entered into between them. We find no merit in this claim. Let us clarify who is 
an "employer" under the Act. Section 2 (c) of said Act 
provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Sec. 
2.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
Definitions.—<span class="GramE">As</span> used in this Act—<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(c) The term employer includes 
any person acting "in the interest of an employer, directly or indirectly, but 
shall not include any labor organization (otherwise than when acting as an 
employer) or any one acting in the capacity or agent of such labor 
organization."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It will be noted that in defining 
the term "employer" the Act uses the word "includes", which it also used in 
defining "employee" (Sec. 2[d], and "representative" (Sec. 2 [h] ); and not the 
word "means" which the Act uses in defining the terms "court" (Sec. 2 [a]), 
labor organization" (Sec. 2 [e] ), "legitimate labor organization (Sec. 2[f]), 
"company union" (Sec. 2 [g]), "unfair labor practice" (Sec. 2 [<span class="SpellE">i</span>] ), "supervisor" (Sec. 2 [k] ), "strike" (Sec. 2[l]), and 
"lockout" (Sec. 2 [m]). A methodical variation in terminology is manifest. This 
variation and distinction in terminology and phraseology cannot be presumed to 
have been the inconsequential product of an oversight; rather, it must have been 
the result of a deliberate and purposeful act, more so when we consider that as 
legislative records show, Republic Act No. 875 had been meticulously and 
painstakingly drafted and deliberated upon. In using the word "includes" and not 
"means", Congress did not intend to give a complete definition of "employer", 
but rather that such definition should be complementary to what is commonly 
understood as employer. Congress intended the term to be. understood in a broad 
meaning because, firstly, the statutory definition includes not only "a 
principal employer but also a person acting in the interest of the employer"; 
and, secondly, the Act itself specifically enumerates those who are not included 
in the term "employer", namely: (1) a labor organization (otherwise than when 
acting as an employer), (2) anyone acting in the capacity of officer or agent of 
such labor organization (Sec. 2 [c]), and (3) the Government and any political 
subdivision or instrumentality thereof insofar as the right to strike for the 
purpose of securing changes or modifications in the terms and conditions of 
employment is concerned (Section 11). Among these statutory exemptions, 
educational institutions are not included; hence, they can be included in the 
term "employer". This Court, however, has ruled that those educational 
institutions that are not operated for profit are not within the purview of 5 
Republic Act No. 875<span class="GramE">.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style21"><sup>[</sup></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style21"><sup>5]</sup></span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As stated above, Republic Act No. 
875 does not give a comprehensive but only a complementary definition of the 
term "employer." The term encompasses those that are in ordinary parlance 
"employers." What is commonly meant by "employer"? The term "employer" has been 
given several acceptations. The lexical definition is "one who employs; one who 
uses; one who engages or keeps in service;" and "to employ" is "to provide work 
and pay for; to engage one's service; to hire." <span class="GramE">(Webster's New 
Twentieth Century Dictionary, 2nd ed., 1960, p. 595).</span> The Workmen's 
Compensation Act defines employer as including "every person or association of 
persons, incorporated or not, public or private, and the legal representative of 
the deceased employer" and "includes the owner or lessee of a factory or 
establishment or place of work or any other person who is virtually the owner or 
manager of the business carried on in the establishment or place of work but 
who, for reason that there is an independent contractor in the same, or for any 
other reason, is not the direct employer of laborers employed there." <span class="GramE">(Sec. 39 (a) of Act No. 3428.).</span> The Minimum Wage Law states 
that "employer includes any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest 
of the employer in relation to an employee and shall include the Government and 
the government corporations". (Rep. Act No. 602, Sec. 2 (b<span class="GramE">) 
)</span>. The Social Security Act defines employer as "any person, natural or 
juridical, domestic or foreign, who carries in the Philippines any trade, 
business, industry, undertaking, or activity of any kind and uses the services 
of another person who is under his orders as regards the employment, except the 
Government and any of its political subdivisions, branches or instrumentalities, 
including corporations owned or controlled by the Government." <span class="GramE">(Rep. Act No. 1161, Sec. 8 [c]).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
which cases involve unfair labor practices and hence within the purview of 
Republic Act No. 875, defined the term employer as 
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"An employer is one who employs 
the services of others; one for whom employees work and who pays their wages or 
salaries (Black Law Dictionary, 4th ed., p. 618).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"An employer includes any person 
acting in the interest of an employer, directly or indirectly (Sec. 2-c, Rep. 
Act 875)."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Under none of the above 
definitions may the University be excluded, especially so if it is considered 
that every professor, instructor or teacher in the teaching staff of the 
University, as per allegation of the University itself, has a contract with the 
latter for teaching services, albeit for one semester only. The University 
engaged the services of the professors, provided them work, and paid them 
compensation or salary for their services. Even if the University may be 
considered as a lessee of services under a contract between it and the members 
of its Faculty, still it is included in the term "employer". "Running through 
the word 'employ' is the thought that there has been an agreement on the part of 
one person to perform a certain service in return for compensation to be paid by 
an employer. When you ask how a man is employed, or what <span class="GramE">is 
his employment</span>, the thought that he is under agreement to perform some 
service or services for another is predominant and paramount." (<span class="SpellE">Ballentine</span> Law Dictionary, Philippine ed., p. 430, citing 
Pinkerton National Detective Agency <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">v</span></em>. Walker, 157 Ga. 548, 35 A.L.R. 557, 
560, 122 S.E. Rep. 202).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">To bolster its claim of exemption 
from the application of Republic Act No. 875, the University contends that it is 
not an industrial establishment within the scope of Sec. 2 (c) of the Act. This 
contention can not be sustained. In the first place, Sec. 2 (c) of Republic Act 
No. 875 does not state that the employers included in the definition of the term 
"employer" are only and exclusively "industrial establishments"; on the 
contrary, as stated above, the term "employer" encompasses all employers except 
those specifically excluded by the Act. In the second place, even the Act itself 
does not refer exclusively to industrial establishments and does not confine its 
application thereto. This is patent inasmuch as several provisions of the Act 
are applicable to non-industrial workers, such as Sec. 3, which deals with 
"employees right to self-organization"; Section 4 and 5 which enumerate unfair 
labor practices; Section 8 which nullifies private contracts contravening 
employee rights; Section 9 which relates to injunctions in any case involving a 
labor dispute; Section 11 which prohibits strikes in the government; Section 12 
which provides for the exclusive collective bargaining representation for labor 
organizations; Section 14 which deals with the procedure for collective 
bargaining; Section 17 which treats of the rights and conditions of membership 
in labor organizations; Sections 18, 19, 20 and 21 which provide respectively 
for the establishment of conciliation service, compilation of collective 
bargaining contracts, advisory labor-management relations; Section 22 which 
empowers the Secretary of Labor to make a study of labor relations; and Section 
24 which enumerates the rights of labor organizations. (See Dissenting Opinion

that the Industrial Peace Act "refers only to organizations and entities created 
and operated for profit, engaged in a profitable trade, occupation or industry". 
It cannot be denied that running a university engages time and attention; that 
it is an occupation or a business from which the one engaged in it may derive 
profit or gain. The University is not an industrial establishment in the sense 
that an industrial establishment is one that is engaged in manufacture or trade 
where raw materials are changed or fashioned into finished products for use. But 
for the purposes of the Industrial Peace Act the University is an industrial 
establishment because it is operated for profit and it employs persons who work 
to earn a living. The term "industry", for the purposes of the application of 
our labor laws should be given a broad meaning so as to cover all enterprises 
which are operated for profit and which engage the services of persons who work 
to earn a living.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The University urges that even if 
it were an employer, still there would be no employer-employee relationship 
between it and the striking members of the Faculty Club because the latter are 
not employees within the purview of Sec. 2 (d) of Republic Act No. 875 but are 
independent contractors. This claim is untenable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Section 2 (d) of Republic Act No. 
875 provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"(d) The term 'employee' shall 
include any employee and shall not be limited to the employee of a particular 
employee unless the act explicitly states otherwise and shall include any 
individual whose work has ceased as a consequence of, or in connection with, any 
current labor dispute or because of any unfair labor practice and who has not 
obtained any other substantially equivalent and regular 
employment."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This definition is again, like 
the definition of the term "employer" [Sec. 2(c)], by the use of the term 
"include", complementary. It embraces not only those who are usually and 
ordinarily considered employees, but also those who have ceased as employees as 
a consequence of a labor dispute. The term "employee", furthermore, is not 
limited to those of a particular employer. As already stated, this Court in the 
cases of The <span class="SpellE">Angat</span> River Irrigation System, et al., 
<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">v</span></em>. <span class="SpellE">Angat</span> River Workers' Union (PLUM) et al., supra, has defined 
the term "employer" as "one who employs the services of others; one for whom 
employees work and who pays their wages or salaries." Correlatively, an employee 
must be one who is engaged in the service of another; who performs services for 
another; who works for salary or wages. It is admitted by the University that 
the striking professors and/or instructors are under contract to teach 
particular courses and that they are paid for their services. They are, 
therefore, employees of the University.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In support of its claim that the 
members of the Faculty Club are not employees of the University, the latter 
cites as authority Francisco's Labor Laws, 2nd ed. p. 3, which 
states:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"While the term 'workers' as used 
in a particular statute, has been regarded as limited to those performing 
physical labor, it has been held to embrace stenographers and bookkeepers. 
Teachers are not included, however."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is evident from the 
above-quoted authority that "teachers" are not to be included among those who 
perform "physical labor", but it does not mean that they are not employees. We 
have checked the source of the authority, which is 31 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>., Sec. 3, p. 835, and the latter cites <span class="SpellE">Huntworth</span> v.

instructors as employees and declared Republic Act No. 875 applicable to them in 
their employment relations with their school. The professors and/or instructors 
of the University neither ceased to be employees when they struck, for Section 2 
of Rep. Act 875 includes among employees any individual whose work has ceased as 
a consequence of, or in connection with a current labor dispute. Striking 
employees maintain their status as employees of the employer. <span class="GramE">(Western Cartridge Co. v. NLRB, CCA. 7, 139 F2d 855,

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The contention of the University 
that the professors and/or instructors are independent contractors, because the 
University does not exercise control over their work, is likewise untenable. 
This Court takes judicial notice that a university controls the work of the 
members of its faculty; that a university prescribes the courses or subjects 
that professors teach, and when and where to teach; that the professors' work is 
characterized by regularity and continuity for a fixed duration; that professors 
are compensated for their services by wages and salaries, rather than by 
profits; that the professors and/or instructors cannot substitute others to do 
their work without the consent of the university; and that the professors can be 
laid off if their work is found not satisfactory. All these indicate that the 
university has control over their work; and professors are, therefore, employees 
and not independent contractors. There are authorities in support of this 
view.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It having been shown that the 
members of the Faculty Club are employees, it follows that they have a right to 
unionize in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Magna <span class="SpellE">Carta</span> of Labor (Republic Act No. 875) which provides as

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We agree with the statement of 
the lower court, in its order of March 30, 1963 which is sought to be set aside 
in the instant case, that the right of employees to self-organization is 
guaranteed by the Constitution, that said right would exist even if Republic Act 
No. 875 is repealed, and that the employees are entitled to that right 
regardless of whether their employers are engaged in commerce or not. Indeed, it 
is Our considered view that the members of the faculty or teaching staff of 
private universities, colleges, and schools in the Philippines, regardless of 
whether the university, college or school is run for profit or not, are included 
in the term "employees" as contemplated in Republic Act No. 875 and as such they 
may organize themselves pursuant to the above-quoted provision of Section 3 of 
said Act. Certainly, professors, instructors or teachers of private educational 
institutions who teach to earn a living are entitled to the protection of our 
labor laws—and one such law is Republic Act No. 875.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The contention of the University 
in the instant case that the members of the Faculty Club can not unionize and 
the Faculty Club can not exist as a valid labor organization is, therefore, 
without merit. The record shows that the Faculty Club is a duly registered labor 
organization, and this fact is admitted by counsel for the University<span class="GramE">.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style21"><sup>[</sup></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style21"><sup>6]</sup></span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The other issue raised by the 
University is the validity of the Presidential certification. The University 
contends that under Section 10 of Republic Act No. 875 the power of the 
President of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> to certify is subject to the 
following conditions, namely: (1) that there is a labor dispute, and (2) that 
said labor dispute exists in an industry that is vital to the national interest. 
The University maintains that those conditions do not obtain in the instant 
case. This contention has also no merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We have previously stated that 
the University is an establishment or enterprise that is included in the term 
"industry" and is covered by the provisions of Republic Act No. 875. Now, was 
there a labor dispute between the University and the Faculty 
Club?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Republic Act No. 875 defines a 
labor dispute as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The term 'labor dispute' 
includes any controversy concerning terms, tenure or conditions of employment, 
or concerning the association or representation of persons in negotiating, 
fixing, maintaining, changing, or seeking to arrange terms for conditions of 
employment regardless of whether the disputants stand in proximate relation of 
employer and employee."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The test of whether a controversy 
comes within the definition of "labor dispute" depends on whether the 
controversy involves or concerns "terms, tenure or condition of employment" or 
"representation." It is admitted by the University, in the instant case, that on 
January 14, 1963 the President of the Faculty Club wrote to the President of the 
University a letter informing the latter of the organization of the Faculty Club 
as a labor union, duly registered with the Bureau of Labor Relations; that again 
on January 22, 1963 another letter was sent, to which was attached a list of 
demands consisting of 26 items, and asking the President of the University to 
answer within ten days from date of receipt thereof; that the University 
questioned the right of the Faculty Club to be the exclusive representative of 
the majority of the employees and asked proof that the Faculty Club had been 
designated or selected as exclusive representative by the vote of the majority 
of said employees; that on February 1, 1963 the Faculty Club filed with the 
Bureau of Labor Relations a notice of strike alleging as reason <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> the refusal of the University to bargain 
collectively with the representative of the faculty members; that on February 
18, 1963 the members of the Faculty Club went on strike and established picket 
lines in the premises of the University, thereby disrupting the schedule of 
classes; that on March 1, 1963 the Faculty Club filed Case No. 3666-ULP for 
unfair labor practice against the University, but which was later dismissed (on 
April 2, 1963 after Case 41-IPA was certified to the CIR); and that on March 7, 
1963 a petition for certification election, Case No. 1183-MC, was filed by the 
Faculty Club in the CIR.<span class="style21"><sup>[7]</sup></span> All these 
admitted facts show that the controversy between the University and the Faculty 
Club involved terms and conditions of employment, and the question of 
representation. Hence, there was a labor dispute between the University and the 
Faculty Club, as contemplated by Republic Act No. 875. It having been shown that 
the University is an institution operated for profit, that it is an employer, 
and that there is an employer-employee relationship between the University and 
the members of the Faculty Club, and it having been shown that a labor dispute 
existed between the University and the Faculty Club, the contention of the 
University, that the certification made by the President is not only not 
authorized by Section 10 of Republic Act 875 but is <span class="SpellE">violative</span> thereof, is groundless.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Section 10 of Republic Act No. 
875 provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">To certify a labor dispute to the 
CIR is the prerogative of the President under the law, and this Court will not 
interfere in, much less curtail, the exercise of that prerogative. The 
jurisdiction of the CIR in a certified case is exclusive (<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Cement Co., Inc. <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">v</span></em>. <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>

Once the jurisdiction is acquired pursuant to the presidential certification, 
the CIR may exercise its broad powers as provided in Commonwealth Act 103. All 
phases of the labor dispute and the employer-employee relationship may be 
threshed out before the CIR, and the CIR may issue such order or orders as may 
be necessary to make effective the exercise of its jurisdiction. The parties 
involved in the case may appeal to the Supreme Court from the order or orders 
thus issued by the CIR.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">And so, in the instant case, when 
the President took into consideration that the University "has some 18,000 
students and employed approximately 500 faculty members", that "the continued 
disruption in the operation of the University will necessarily prejudice the 
thousand of students", and that "the dispute affects the national 
interest",<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style21"><sup>[8]</sup></span> and certified the dispute to 
the CIR, it is not for the CIR nor this Court to pass upon the correctness of 
the reasons of the President in certifying the labor dispute to the 
CIR.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The third issue raised by the 
University refers to the question of the legality of the return-to-work order 
(of </span><st1:date month="3" day="30" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 30, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> in 
Case 41-IPA) and the order implementing the same (of </span><st1:date month="4" day="6" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 
6, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">). 
It alleges that the orders are illegal upon the grounds: (1) that Republic Act 
No. 875, supplementing Commonwealth Act No. 103, has withdrawn from the CIR the 
power to issue a return-to-work order; (2) that the only power granted by 
Section 10 of Republic Act No. 875 to the CIR is to issue an order forbidding 
the employees to strike or forbidding the employer to lockout the employees, as 
the case may be, before either contingency had become a <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">fait accompli</span></em>; (3) that the taking in 
by the University of replacement professors was valid, and the return-to-work 
order of March 30, 1963 constituted Impairment of the obligation of contracts; 
and (4) the CIR could not issue said order without having previously determined 
the legality or illegality of the strike.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The contention of the University 
that Republic Act No. 875 has withdrawn the power of the Court of Industrial 
Relations to issue a return-to-work order exercised by it under Commonwealth Act 
No. 103 can not be sustained. When a case is certified by the President to the 
Court of Industrial Relations, the case thereby comes under the operation of 
Commonwealth Act No. 103, and the Court may exercise the broad powers and 
jurisdiction granted to it by said Act. Section 10 of Republic Act No. 875 
empowers the Court of Industrial Relations to issue an order "fixing the terms 
of employment." This clause is broad enough to authorize the Court to order the 
strikers to return to work and the employer to readmit them. <span class="GramE">This Court, in the cases of the Philippine Marine Officers

compulsory arbitration in cases of labor disputes in industries indispensable to 
the national interest when the President certifies the case to the Court of 
Industrial Relations. The evident intention of the law is to empower the Court 
of Industrial Relations to act in such cases, not only in the manner prescribed 
under Commonwealth Act 103, but with the same broad powers and jurisdiction 
granted by that act. If the Court of Industrial Relations is granted authority 
to find a solution to an industrial dispute and such solution consists in the 
ordering of employees to return back to work, it cannot be contended that the 
Court of Industrial Relations does not have the power or jurisdiction to carry 
that solution into effect. And of what use is its power of conciliation and 
arbitration if it does not have the power and jurisdiction to carry into effect 
the solution it has adopted? Lastly, if the said court has the power to fix the

30, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
it was agreed before the hearing of Case 41-IPA on </span><st1:date month="3" day="23" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 
23, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
that the strikers would return to work under the <i>status quo</i> arrangement 
and the University would readmit them, and the return-to-work order was a 
confirmation of that agreement. This is a declaration of fact by the CIR which 
<span class="GramE">We</span> cannot disregard. The faculty members, by striking, 
have not abandoned their employment but, rather, they have only ceased from 
their labor (</span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Keith</span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Theatre</span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> v. <span class="SpellE">Vachon</span>, et al., 187 A. 692). The striking faculty members 
have not lost their right to go back to their positions, because the declaration 
of a strike is not a renunciation of their employment and their employee 
relationship with the University (Rex Taxicab Co. v. CIR, et al., 40 0.6., No. 
13, 138). The employment of replacements was not authorized by the CIR. AC most, 
that was a temporary expedient resorted to by the University, which was subject 
to the power of the CIR to allow to continue or not. The employment of 
replacements by the University prior to the issuance of the order of 
</span><st1:date month="3" day="30" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 30, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> did 
not vest in the replacements a permanent right to the positions they held. 
Neither could such temporary employment bind the University to retain 
permanently the replacements.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is clear from what has been 
said that the return-to-work order cannot be considered as an impairment of the 
contract entered into by petitioner with the replacements. Besides, labor 
contracts must yield to the common good and such contracts are subject to the 
special laws on labor unions, collective bargaining, strikes and similar 
subjects (Article 1700, Civil Code).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Likewise unsustainable is the 
contention of the University that the Court of Industrial Relations could not 
issue the return-to-work order without having resolved previously the issue of 
the legality or illegality of the strike, citing as authority <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> the case of Philippine Can Company <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">v</span></em>. Court of Industrial Relations, G. R. 
No. L-3021, </span><st1:date month="7" day="13" year="1950"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 13, 
1950</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. The 
ruling in said case is not applicable to the case at bar, the facts and 
circumstances being very different. The Philippine Can Company case, unlike the 
instant case, did not involve the national interest and it was not certified by 
the President. In that case the company no longer needed the services of the 
strikers, nor did it need substitutes for the strikers, because the company was 
losing, and it was imperative that it lay off such laborers as were not 
necessary for its operation in order to save the company from bankruptcy. This 
was the reason of this Court in ruling, in that case, that the legality or 
illegality of the strike should have been decided first before the issuance of 
the return-to-work order. The University, in the case before <span class="GramE">Us</span>, does not claim that it no longer needs the services of 
professors and/or instructors; neither does it claim that it was imperative for 
it to lay off the striking professors and instructors because of impending 
bankruptcy. On the contrary, it was imperative for the University to hire 
replacements for the strikers. Therefore, the ruling in the Philippine Can case 
that the legality of the strike should be decided first before the issuance of 
the return-to-work order does not apply to the case at bar. Besides, as <span class="GramE">We</span> have adverted to, the return-to-work order of 
</span><st1:date month="3" day="30" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 30, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, now 
in question, was a confirmation of an agreement between the University and the 
Faculty Club during a pre-hearing conference on </span><st1:date month="3" day="23" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 
23, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The University also maintains 
that there was no more basis for the claim of the members of the Faculty Club to 
return to their work, as their Individual contracts for teaching had expired on 
March 25 or 31, 1963, as the case may be, and consequently, there was also no 
basis for the return-to-work order of the CIR because the contractual 
relationships having ceased there were no positions to which the members of the 
Faculty Club could return to. This contention <span class="GramE">is</span> not 
well taken. This argument loses sight of the fact that when the professors and 
Instructors struck on February 18, 1963, they continued to be employees of the 
University for the purposes of the labor controversy notwithstanding the 
subsequent termination of their teaching contracts, for Section 2(d) of the 
Industrial Peace Act includes among employees "any individual whose work has 
ceased as a consequence of, or in connection with, any current labor dispute or 
of any unfair labor practice and who has not obtained any other substantially 
equivalent and regular employment."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The question raised by the 
University was resolved in a similar case in the

take the place of the strikers, as it might see fit. This constituted 
discrimination in the hiring and tenure of the striking employees. When the

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The University, furthermore, 
claims that the information for indirect contempt filed against the officers of 
the University (Case No. V-30) as well as the order of April 29, 1963 for their 
arrest were improper, irregular and illegal because (1) the officers of the 
University had complied in good faith with the return-to-work order and in those 
cases that they did not, it was due to circumstances beyond their control; (2) 
the return-to-work order and the order implementing the same were illegal; and 
(3) even assuming that the order was legal, the same was not yet final because 
there was a motion to reconsider it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Again we find no merit in this 
claim of petitioner. We have already ruled that the CIR had jurisdiction to 
issue the order of </span><st1:date month="3" day="30" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 30, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> In 
CIR Case 41-IPA, and the return-to-work provision of that order is valid and 
legal. Necessarily the order of </span><st1:date month="4" day="6" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 6, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
implementing that order of </span><st1:date month="3" day="30" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 30, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> was 
also valid and legal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Section 6 of Commonwealth Act No. 
103 empowers the Court of Industrial Relations or any Judge thereof to punish 
direct and indirect <span class="SpellE">contempts</span> as provided in Rule 64 
(now Rule 71) of the Rules of Court, under the same procedure and penalties 
provided therein. Section 3 of Rule 71 enumerates the acts which would 
constitute indirect contempt, among which is "disobedience or resistance to a 
lawful writ, process, order, judgment, or command of a court," and the person 
guilty thereof can be punished after a written charge has been filed and the 
accused has been given an opportunity to be heard. The last paragraph of said 
section provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"But nothing in this section 
shall be so construed as to prevent the court from issuing process to bring the 
accused party into court, or from holding him in custody pending such 
proceedings."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The provision authorizes the 
judge to order the arrest of an alleged <span class="SpellE">contemner</span> 
(Francisco, et al. <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">v</span></em>. 
Enriquez, L-7058, March 20, 1954, 94 Phil., 603) and this, apparently, is the 
provision upon which respondent, Judge Bautista relied when he <span class="GramE">Issued</span> the questioned order of arrest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The contention of petitioner that 
the order of arrest is illegal is unwarranted. The return-to-work order 
allegedly violated was within the court's jurisdiction to 
issue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Section 14 of Commonwealth Act 
No. 103 provides that in cases brought before the Court of Industrial Relations 
under Section 4 of the Act (referring to strikes and lockouts) the appeal to the 
Supreme Court from any award, order or decision shall not stay the execution of 
said award, order or decision sought to be reviewed unless for special reason 
the court shall order that execution be stayed. Any award, order or decision 
that is appealed is necessarily not final. Yet under Section 14 of Commonwealth 
Act No. 103 that award, order or decision, even if not yet final, is <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, and the stay of execution is discretionary with 
the Court of Industrial Relations. In other words, the Court of Industrial 
Relations, in cases involving strikes and lockouts, may compel compliance or 
obedience of its award, order or decision even if the award, order or decision 
is not yet final because it is appealed, and it follows that any disobedience or 
non-compliance of the award, order or decision would constitute contempt against 
the Court of Industrial Relations which the court may punish as provided in the 
Rules of Court. This power of the Court of Industrial Relations to punish for 
contempt an act of non-compliance or disobedience of an award, order or 
decision, even if not yet final, is a special one and is exercised only in cases 
involving strikes and lockouts. And there is reason for this special power of 
the industrial court because in the exercise of its jurisdiction over cases 
involving strikes and lockouts the court has to issue orders or make decisions 
that are necessary to effect a prompt solution of the labor dispute that caused 
the strike or the lockout, or to effect the prompt creation of a situation that 
would be most beneficial to the management and the employees, and also to the 
public—even if the solution may be temporary, pending the final determination of 
the case. Otherwise, if the effectiveness of any order, award, or decision of 
the industrial court in cases involving strikes and lockouts would be suspended 
pending appeal then it can happen that the coercive powers of the industrial 
court in the settlement of the labor disputes in those cases would be rendered 
useless and nugatory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The University points to Section 
6 of Commonwealth Act No. 103 which provides that "Any violation of any order, 
award, or decision of the Court of Industrial Relations shall after such order, 
award or decision has become final, conclusive and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> constitute contempt of court", and contends that 
only the disobedience of orders that are final (meaning one that is not 
appealed) may be the subject of contempt proceedings. We believe that there is 
no inconsistency between the above-quoted provision of Section 6 and the 
provision of Section 14 of Commonwealth Act No. 103. It will be noted that 
Section 6 speaks of order, award or decision that is <span class="SpellE"><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">executory</span></em></span>. By the provision of 
Section 14 an order, award or decision of the Court of Industrial Relations in 
cases involving strikes and lockouts are immediately <span class="SpellE"><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">executory</span></em></span>, so that a violation 
of that order would constitute an indirect contempt of 
court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We believe that the action of the 
CIR in issuing the order of arrest of </span><st1:date month="4" day="29" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 29, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> is 
also authorized under Section 19 of Commonwealth Act No. 103 which provides as 
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We hold that the CIR acted within 
its jurisdiction when it ordered the arrest of the officers of the University 
upon a complaint for indirect contempt filed by the Acting Special Prosecutor of 
the CIR in CIR Case V-30, and that order was valid. Besides those ordered 
arrested were not yet being punished for contempt; but, having been charged, 
they were simply ordered arrested to be brought before the Judge to be dealt 
with according to law. Whether they are guilty of the charge or not is yet to be 
determined in a proper hearing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Let it be noted that the order of 
arrest dated </span><st1:date month="4" day="29" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 29, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> in 
CIR Case V-30 is being questioned in Case G. R. No.L-21278 before this Court in 
a special civil action for certiorari. The University did not appeal from that 
order. In other words, the only question to be resolved in connection with that 
order in CIR Case V-30 is whether the CIR had jurisdiction, or had abused its 
discretion, in issuing that order. We hold that the CIR had jurisdiction to 
issue that order, and neither did it abuse its discretion when it issued that 
order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

6, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
The ground of the Faculty Club in asking for the withdrawal of that petition for 
certification election was because the issues involved in that petition were 
absorbed by the issues in Case 41-IPA. The University opposed the petition for 
withdrawal, but at the same time it moved for the dismissal of the petition for 
certification election.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is contended by the University 
before this Court, in G. R. No. L-21462, that the issues of employer-employee 
relationship between the University and the Faculty Club, the alleged status of 
the Faculty Club as a labor union, its majority representation and designation 
as bargaining representative in an appropriate unit of the Faculty Club should 
have been resolved first in Case No. 1183-MC prior to the determination of the 
issues in Case No. 41-IPA, and, therefore, the motion to withdraw the petition 
for certification election should not have been granted upon the ground that the 
issues in the first case were absorbed in the second case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We believe that these contentions 
of the University in Case G. R. No. L-21462 <span class="GramE">have</span> been 
sufficiently covered by the discussion in this decision of the main issues 
raised in the principal case, which is Case G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-21278.</span> After all, the University wanted CIR Case 1183-MC 
dismissed, and the withdrawal of the petition for certification election had in 
a way produced the situation desired by the University. After considering the 
arguments adduced by the University in support of its petition for <span class="SpellE">certierari</span> by way of appeal in Case G. R. No. L-21278, <span class="GramE">We</span> hold that the CIR did not commit any error when it granted 
the withdrawal of the petition for certification election in Case 1183-MC. The 
principal case before the CIR is Case No. 41-IPA and all the questions relating

threshed out, and decided, in that case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

denying the motion for the reconsideration of that order of March 30, 1963, in 
CIR Case No. 41-IPA. We have already ruled that the CIR has jurisdiction to

hold that the CIR did not err in issuing that order of March 30, 1963 and in
