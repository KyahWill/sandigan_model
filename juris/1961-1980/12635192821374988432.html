<p class="BODY">Respondent University <span style="">of
the </span>Philippines - hereinafter referred to as U. P. - is a non-stock and
non-profit corporation duly established in accordance with Act <span style="">No. </span>1870 of the Philippine
Legislature, as amended, to provide advanced instruction in literature,
philosophy, sciences and arts, and to give professional and technical
training.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Philippine Legislature, on
<st1:date month="2" day="8" year="1930">February 8, 1930</st1:date>, approved
Act No. 3608 granting <span style="">and </span>ceding
to the U.P. such portion or portions of the public domain, not exceeding 10,000
hectares, to be held and administered as a permanent endowment for the
additional support and maintenance of said institution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said Act 3608 provides <span style="">that </span><span style="">the </span>control and administration of the land or lands thus granted
are vested permanently in the Board of Regents of the U.P., but the Board is
not empowered to sell or alienate all or any portions of these lands without
the previous consent of the Philippine Legislature; that the income, receipts
and profits derived from the administration of the land grants shall form part
of the general fund of the U.P. and be subject to appropriation by the Board of
Regents and devoted only for the purposes for which the U.P. was established;
and that such portion or portions of these lands which are not developed,
cultivated, leased, or otherwise disposed of, after the lapse of ten years from
the time when such lands had been ceded, conveyed and transferred, shall revert
to the public domain and shall be open for settlement and disposition in
accordance with the pro<span style="">visions </span>of
the Public Land Act.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to the provisions of Act No. 3608 the U.P., in 1940,
took possession of about 5,000 hectares of public land located in <span class="SpellE">Balactasan</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Basilan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, and that area is now known as
the "U.P. - <span class="SpellE">Basilan</span> Land Grant".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The U. P. converted major portions of that
land into plantations dedicated to the raising of agricultural crops such as
coffee, rubber, cacao, etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of the
income realized from the cultivation of the land inured to the benefit of any
private individual or private institution, the same have been wholly and
exclusively devoted to the purposes for which the U.P. was created.</p>

<p class="BODY">From 1940 to 1955 the property in question was not placed in the <span style="">list </span>of real property for tax
assessment purposes, and was not subjected to the payment of real property
tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a letter dated <st1:date year="1955" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1955</st1:date>, <st1:place><st1:placename>petitioner</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> Treasurer and Assessor of <span class="SpellE">Basilan</span> City - hereinafter referred to as City
Treasurer-Assessor - for the first time, asked the U.P. to justify its claim of
tax exemption on the land comprised in the U.P. - <span class="SpellE">Basilan</span>
Land Grant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter the U.P. received
a copy of land tax declaration No. 7245 from the City Treasurer-Assessor with a
notice that the tax due thereon in the amount of P7,936.70 is based on the
assessed value of the land grant fixed at P792,670.00, and that the tax
liability commenced with the year 1956.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Demands by the City Treasurer-Assessor for the payment of the real
property tax in question followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
U. P. at first resisted the demands for payment, but when the City
Treasurer-Assessor threatened to adopt drastic measures in order to enforce tax
collection the U.P. paid under protest the amount of P7,936.70 and P2,066.40 on
<st1:date year="1956" day="10" month="7">July 10, 1956</st1:date>, and the
amount of P8,585.18 on <st1:date year="1957" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime U.P. requested the Sec<span style="">retary of Justice for opinion as </span>to
whether or not the land comprised in the U.P. - <span class="SpellE">Basilan</span>
Land Grant is exempt from the payment of real property tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Secretary of Justice rendered an opinion
that the property in question is not subject to the payment of real property
tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the strength <span style="">of the opinion </span>of the Secretary of
Justice <span style="">the </span>U.P. refused to make
further payments of real property tax and then requested the City Treasurer-Assessor
<span style="">to cancel </span>the assessment of real
estate tax on the land grant and to refund the amount it had already paid as
real property taxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The City
Treasurer-Assessor denied the request for <span style="">cancellation
</span>and refund, and on <st1:date year="1960" day="24" month="6">June 24,
 1960</st1:date> he demanded from the U.P. the payment of the sum of P56,191.80
representing alleged unpaid realty taxes <span style="">on
</span>the land grant, including penalties.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On July 14, 1960 the </span>U.P.
appealed to <span style="">the </span>Board of
Assessment Appeals of <span class="SpellE">Basilan</span> City from the decision
of the City Treasurer-Assessor denying its request for the <span style="">cancel</span>lation of the assessment and for
the refund of taxes paid, <span style="">but </span>the
Board of Assessment Appeals, in its Resolutions Nos. 1 and 2, both dated August
1, 1960, dismissed the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date month="8" day="25" year="1960">August 25, 1960</st1:date>, the U.<span style="">P., </span><span style="">without paying </span>under protest <span style="">the </span>current taxes assessed on the land grant, appealed to the
Court of Tax Appeals from the decision or the Board of Assessment Appeals of <span class="SpellE">Basilan</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
appeal before the Court of Tax Appeals was docketed as C.T.A. Case No. 936, and

</span>On </span><st1:date year="1962" day="26" month="9">September 26, 1962</st1:date>,
<span style="">the </span>Court of Tax Appeals
rendered a <span style="">decision, </span>the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads as follows:</p>

the petitioner University of the Philippines the amounts of P7,936.70,
P2,066.40 and P8,585.16, or a total of P18,588.26, representing realty taxes illegally
collected, without special pronouncement as to costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Herein petitioners, the City Treasurer and Assessor of <span class="SpellE">Basilan</span> City, the Board of Tax Appeals of <span class="SpellE">Basilan</span> City, and <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Basilan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
have appealed to this Court from the decision of the Court <span style="">of </span>Tax Appeals.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The petitioners contend that the Court of Tax
Appeals should not have entertained the appeal of the U.P. from the decision of
the Board of Assessment Appeals of <span class="SpellE">Basilan</span> City
because the U.P. did not first pay under protest the real estate taxes that had
been assessed against it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioners invoke the provision of Section 54 of Commonwealth Act 470, known
as the Assessment Law, the pertinent portion or which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"Sec. </span>54.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="">Restriction

paid, under <span style="">protest, </span>the taxes
assessed against him,...."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The contention of the <span style="">petitioners
cannot be </span>sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals is defined in Section 7 of Republic
Act 1125 - the act creating the Court <span style="">of
Tax Appeals - the pertinent portion of which reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Assessment Appeals in cases involving the assessment and <span style="">taxation </span>of real property or other
matters arising under the Assessment Law, including rules and regulations
relative thereto."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is clear from the
above-quoted provision of Section 7 of R.A. 1125 that any decision of the
provincial or city board of assessment appeals relating to the assessment and
taxation of real property is <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to the Court
of Tax Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no provision in
</span><span style="">R.A. </span><span style="">1125 which imposes the condition, or </span><span style="">the prerequisite, </span><span style="">that before the Court of Tax Appeals
entertains any appeal from the decision of the provincial or city board of
assessment appeals that the taxes assessed against the appealing taxpayer
should first be paid under protest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Let it be noted that
before the enactment of R.A. 1125, an appeal from the decision </span><span style="">or the </span><span style="">provincial or city board of </span>assessment appeals could be brought
to the Secretary of Finance, as provided in Sec. 18 of Commonwealth Act No. 470
(the Assessment Law).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no
provision in C.A. 470 requiring previous payment under protest of real or
property tax due before the Secretary of Finance could entertain any appeal
from the decision of the provincial or city board of <span style="">tax appeals (now </span><span style="">known
as </span><span style="">board of </span>assessment
appeals).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>R.A. <span style="">1125 has modified, or impliedly amended, the provision of C.A. 470
regarding appeal from the decision of the provincial or city board of tax
appeals (now board of assessment appeals) to the </span>Secretary of
Finance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under R.A. 1125 it is the Court
<span style="">of Tax Appeals that has now exclusive
jurisdiction to review decisions of provincial or city board of assessment </span>appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The provision of Section
54 of C.A. 470, invoked by </span>the petitioners, refers to judicial
proceedings before the <span style="">regular court
questioning the validity or reasonableness of a tax assessed under the
Assessment Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before the passage </span>of
R.A. 1125 the validity or reasonableness of the assessment of any tax may be
brought before the regular courts in ordinary judicial proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was the procedure contemplated in the
provisions of Section 54 of C.A. 470.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But after the enactment of R.A. 1125 the validity or reasonableness of
the assessment and taxation of real property may be assailed only before the
Court of Tax Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, before
the question regarding the assessment and taxation of real property is brought
to the Court of Tax Appeals the matter must first be acted upon by the
provincial or city assessor, as the case may be, and that an appeal from the
action of the provincial or city assessor had been brought to the proper board
of assessment appeals; and the taxpayer who is not satisfied with the decision
of the board of assessment appeals elevates the case to the Court of Tax
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As We have adverted to R.A.
1125 does not impose the condition of payment under protest of real estate
taxes due before the Court of Tax Appeals could entertain the appeal from the
decision of the provincial or city board of assessment appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before the passage of R.A. 1125 the
impeachment of a realty tax before the court is conditioned upon prior payment
under protest of the taxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
after the passage of R.A. 1125 the taxpayer does not go to the regular courts
to assail the validity of the assessment and taxation of real property but to
the Court of Tax Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the recent case of the Board of Assessment Appeals of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> Mining Co. Inc. and Court of Tax Appeals, G.R. No.
L-28034, February 27, 1971, this Court affirmed the decision of the Court of
Tax Appeals <span style="">which ruled that said court
can entertain and give due </span>course to an appeal assailing the legality
and validity of a real property tax assessment without paying first the disputed
real property tax as required by Section 54 of the Assessment Law (C.A.
470).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the question that may be
brought before the city or provincial board of assessment appeals is one that
relates to the reasonableness or legality of the realty tax that is assessed
against a taxpayer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be unjust
to require the realty owner to first pay the tax, which he precisely questions,
before he can lodge an appeal to the Court of Tax<span style=""> Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We </span>believe that
it was not the intendment of R.A. 1125 that in questioning before the Court of
Tax Appeals the validity or reasonableness of <span style="">the assessment approved by </span>the city or provincial board of <span style="">assessment </span>appeals <span style="">the </span>taxpayer should first pay the tax
arising from the questioned assessment.</p>

<p class="BODY">We reiterate what We <span style="">said
</span>in the case of the Board of Assessment Appeals of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>
Mining <span style="">Co. </span>Inc. et al., <u>supra</u>
that in so far as an appeal from the decision or resolution of the provincial
or city board of assessment appeals Section 54 of C.A. 470 does not apply, and
that said section is impliedly repealed by Sections 7, 11 and 21 of R.A. 1125.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The petitioners also contend that the land
grant to the U.P. is not exempt from taxation because Act No. 3608 did not
provide that said land grant shall be exempt from the payment of real estate
taxes, such that the provision of Section 1, of Republic Act No. 104 should apply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said Section provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- All
corporations, agencies <span style="">or
instrumentalities owned or controlled by </span>the Government shall pay such
duties, taxes, fees and other charges upon their transaction, business,
industry, sale or income as are imposed by law upon individuals, associations
or corporations engaged in any taxable business, industry or activity, except <span style="">on </span>goods or commodities imported or
purchased and sold or distributed for relief purposes as may be determined by
the President of the Philippines”.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This contention of the petitioners is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The above-cited Section 1 of <span style="">R.A. 104 refers to corporations, agencies or
instrumentalities owned or controlled by the Government which exercise
proprietary functions and are engaged in business for profit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That provision of </span>the law <span style="">can not be applied to the U.P. because this
institution performs a function imposed upon it by the government in the
implementation of a provision of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The U.P. received this land grant pursuant to
Act No. 3608 of the Philippine Legislature, </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">it is specifically
provided in Section 4 of said Act that "All incomes, receipts and profits
derived from the administration from these land grants shall form part of the
general funds of the University of the Philippines and be </span><span style="">subject </span><span style="">to appropriation by the Board of Regents of said institution and
devoted only for the purposes for which said University was established."
It is also provided in said Act that "the control, and administration of
these </span><span style="">land grants </span><span style="">is vested </span><span style="">permanently in </span><span style="">the Board
</span>of Regents of the University <span style="">of
the Philippines:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>, </span><u>however</u>,
that said control and administration shall not empower said Board to sell or
alienate all or any portion of these lands <span style="">without the </span>previous consent of the Philippine Legislature. . .
." The law further provides that "such portion or portions of the
land herein granted which are not developed, cultivated, leased or otherwise
disposed of, after the lapse of ten years from the date in which such lands
have been ceded, conveyed <span style="">and </span>transferred
in accordance with this Act shall revert to the public domain. . . ."
These provisions of Act 3608 are indicative of the ownership by the State of
the land grants in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is very apparent that the purpose of the law in bestowing to <span style="">the U.P. an </span>endowment in the form of a
grant of land from the public domain was to provide the U.P. with a piece of
public property in order to raise additional income to support the U.P. in
performing the functions for which it was established by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every income derived from this land grant
goes to the general fund of the U.P.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
U.P. <span class="SpellE">Basilan</span> Land Grant is part of the property
administered by the Board of Regents of the U.P. and the land grant is
exploited in order to derive income to augment the funds of the U.P.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The U.P. is an instrumentality of the government
of the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
performing a governmental function, and the property it possesses and
administers, through its <span class="SpellE">governning</span> body which is the

review upon appeal of decisions of provincial or city board of assessment
appeals involving assessment and taxation of real property.</p>

<p class="BODY">This contention is also untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe that the power of the Court of Tax
Appeals to order the refund of realty taxes collected on the basis of the
assessment that said court declared invalid is incidental to its exclusive
appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal "decisions of provincial or
city Boards of Assessment Appeals in cases involving the assessment and taxation
of real property or <u><span style="">other </span>matters
arising under the Assessment Law</u>. . ."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
This incidental jurisdiction is embraced within the phrase "other matters
arising under the Assessment Law".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the law vested <span style="">the </span>Court
of Tax Appeals with the power to declare an assessment illegal or unreasonable,
in <span style="">the </span>exercise of its appellate
jurisdiction, it follows <span style="">that said
court </span>is also given the power to grant <span style="">the </span>relief arising from its finding <span style="">that the </span>appealed assessment is illegal or unreasonable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law could not have intended that after
the Court of Tax Appeals had decided that a tax assessment is invalid or
unreasonable the aggrieved taxpayer would <span style="">still
</span>have to go to another court to seek the refund of the realty taxes
illegally collected from him on the basis of the assessment that was declared
invalid or unreasonable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To hold the
view that the Court of Tax Appeals, after declaring a tax assessment <span style="">invalid, cannot </span>order <span style="">the refund </span>of <span style="">the </span>taxes illegally collected under the invalid assessment but
has to order the aggrieved taxpayer to go to the regular courts to seek a refund,
would be to sanction mul<span style="">tiplicity of
suits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly Congress, in enacting
R.A. </span>1125, did not intend to promote multiplicity of suits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as the principal jurisdiction of the
Court of Tax Appeals is <span style="">to </span>review
the decision of the provincial or city board of assessment appeals, it is
incident to the exercise of that principal jurisdiction to grant a <span style="">relief </span>based on the decision made in
the exercise of <span style="">that </span>jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The provincial or city board <span style="">of </span>assessment appeals has no power to
order the refund of <span style="">realty taxes
paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has only the </span>power, upon
appeal from <span style="">the action of the
provincial or city </span>assessor, to determine whether or not the assessment
made by the assessor is valid or reasonable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But the appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals, from the decision of the
provincial or city board of assessment appeals, involving the validity <span style="">or reasonableness of an assessment may </span>carry
with it a prayer for refund of the taxes illegally collected on the basis of
the questioned assessment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span style="">that </span>case the Court of Tax Appeals, in
<span style="">the exercise of its appellate </span>jurisdiction,
may also order the refund of <span style="">the taxes
collected on </span>the basis of <span style="">the </span>assessment
that it declared invalid or unreasonable.</p>

<blockquote>"While a court may be expressly granted the incidental powers
necessary to <span class="SpellE">effecutate</span> its jurisdiction, a grant of
jurisdiction, in the absence of prohibitive legislation, implies the necessary
and usual incidental powers essential to effectuate it (In re Stinger's Estate,

regularly constituted court has power to do all things that are reasonably

<p class="BODY">This question, of whether or not the Court of Tax Appeals has the
power to order the refund of taxes collected in connection with a tax
assessment case brought before it by way of an appeal from the decision of the
provincial or city board of assessment appeals, has been squarely settled in
the decision of this Court in the recent case of Ramon A. Gonzales, et al. vs.
Province of Iloilo, G.R. No. L-24663, <st1:date month="3" day="31" year="1971">March
 31, 1971</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
This Court, speaking thru Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>,
among others, held:</p>

<blockquote>"After reexamination and thorough analysis and consideration
of the law and precedents on the question, the Court therefore states, for the
guidance of bench and bar, that the Court of Tax Appeals, to the exclusion of
the courts of first instance, has special and exclusive appellate jurisdiction
over all cases where a real estate assessment is disputed as unjust, erroneous
and improper, illegal or void, or excessive or unreasonable, after recourse to
the corresponding board of assessment appeals has failed, and even though the
disputed real estate tax has been paid.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Court has therefore adopted the more simple test that
where an assessment is disputed for whatever ground or reason, be it that the
assessment is unjust, erroneous or improper, illegal or void, or excessive or
unreasonable, the action challenging the assessment, after first exhausting the
administrative remedy of appeal to the assessment appeals board, and regardless
of whether the corresponding real estate tax has been paid and a refund sought,
pertains to the exclusive and special jurisdiction of the tax court to the exclusion
of the courts of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
in the recently decided case of Board of Assessment Appeals of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> Mining Co. and Court of Tax Appeals, the Court upheld
the jurisdiction of the <span style="">tax </span>court
to rule upon the legality and validity of the disputed real estate assessment,
rejecting the contention therein that the property owner should first pay the
questioned realty tax before lodging an appeal from the assessment appeals
board's adverse decision to the <span style="">tax
court.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Where the realty assessment alone is disputed, since the tax
has not yet been paid, the tax court in its decision would rule upon the
correctness and <span style="">validity </span>of the
assessment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the tax has in
addition already been paid and <span style="">a<i> </i></span>refund
thereof is sought, the tax court, if it rules against the correctness and
validity of the assessment, would in addition order the refund of the tax paid
by the property owner.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as the claim for refund of realty taxes paid by the U.P.
in the case now before Us is based and dependent on the outcome of its appeal
from the decision of the city Board of Assessment Appeal of <span class="SpellE">Basilan</span>
City, <span style="">and </span>the Court of Tax
Appeals had ruled <span style="">that the assessment
on </span>the U. P. <span class="SpellE">Basilan</span> Land Grant is illegal,
the Court of Tax Appeals had not committed an error when in its decision it
