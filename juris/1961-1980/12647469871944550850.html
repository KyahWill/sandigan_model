<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This appeal (in f<i>orma <span class="SpellE">pauperis</span></i>), certified here by the Court of Appeals, is 
from the order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> dismissing appellants' complaint in Civil Case No. 
3315 for recovery of damages for the death of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Capuno</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The case arose from a vehicular 
collision which occurred on </span><st1:date month="1" day="3" year="1953"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 3, 
1953</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> in 
<span class="SpellE">Apalit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>. Involved 
were a Pepsi-Cola delivery truck driven by Jon <span class="SpellE">Elordi</span> 
and a private car driven by <span class="SpellE">Capuno</span>. The collision 
proved fatal to the latter as well us to his passengers, the spouses <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Buan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rizalina</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="1" day="5" year="1953"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 
5, 1953</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
<span class="SpellE">Elordi</span> was charged with triple homicide through 
reckless imprudence in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> (Criminal Case No. 1591). The information was 
subsequently amended to include claims for damages by the heirs of the three 
victims. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="10" day="1" year="1953"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 
1, 1953</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
while the criminal case was pending, the Intestate Estate of the <span class="SpellE">Buan</span> spouses and their heirs filed a civil action, also for 
damages, in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> 
against the Pepsi-Cola Bottling Company of the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and Jon <span class="SpellE">Elordi</span> (Civil Case No. 838). Included in the complaint was a 
claim for indemnity in the sum of P2<span class="GramE">,623.00</span> allegedly 
paid by the Estate to the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Capuno</span> under the 
Workmen's Compensation Act. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the criminal case both the 
heirs of <span class="SpellE">Capuno</span> and the Estate of <span class="SpellE">Buan—the</span> former being <span class="GramE">appellants</span> 
herein— were represented by their respective counsel as private prosecutors: 
Attorney Ricardo Y. Navarro and Attorneys Jose W. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> and <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span>. In view of the filing of the civil action, the 
accused Jon <span class="SpellE">Elordi</span> moved to strike out the appearances 
of these private prosecutors in the criminal case. Grounds for the motion were 
(1) that as far as the <span class="SpellE">Capuno</span> heirs were concerned 
they no longer had any interest to protect in the criminal case since they had 
already claimed and received compensation for the death of their decedent; and 
(2) that on the part of the Estate of <span class="SpellE">Buan</span> its right 
to intervene in said case had been abated by the civil action. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The appearance and intervention 
of Attorneys <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span> was disallowed by the Court in an order dated 
</span><st1:date month="9" day="23" year="1953"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 23, 
1953</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, and 
that of Attorney Navarro was <span class="SpellE">dissallowed</span> in an 
amending order dated </span><st1:date month="10" day="23" year="1954"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 23, 
1954</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. No 
appeal was taken from either of the two orders. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="6" day="11" year="1958"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 
11, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
the parties in Civil Case No. 838 entered into a "Compromise and Settlement." 
For P290<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> the <span class="SpellE">Buan</span> 
Estate gave up its claims for damages, including the claim for reimbursement of 
the sum of P2,623.00 previously paid to the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Capuno</span> "under the Workmen's Compensation Act." The Court 
approved the compromise and accordingly dismissed the case on the following June 
17. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">At that time the criminal case 
was still pending; judgment was rendered only on </span><st1:date month="4" day="15" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 
15, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
wherein the accused <span class="SpellE">Elordi</span> was acquitted of the 
charges against him. Prior thereto, or on </span><st1:date month="9" day="26" year="1958"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 26, 
1958</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
however, herein appellants commenced a civil action for damages against the 
Pepsi-Cola Bottling Company of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and Jon <span class="SpellE">Elordi</span>. This is the action which, upon <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' motion, was dismissed by the Court a quo in its 
order of </span><st1:date month="2" day="29" year="1960"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 29, 
1960</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
from which order the present appeal has been taken. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The grounds upon which <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> based their motion for dismissal and which the 
Court found to be "well-taken" were: (1) that the action had already prescribed; 
and (2) that <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> had been released from 
appellants' claim for damages by virtue of the payment to the latter of the sum 
of P2,623.00 by the <span class="SpellE">Buan</span> Estate under the Workmen's 
Compensation Act, which sum, in turn, was sought to be recovered by the said 
Estate from <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in Civil Case No. 838 but 
finally settled by them in their compromise. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The ruling of the court below on 
both points is now assailed by appellants as erroneous. In our opinion the 
question of prescription is decisive. There can be no doubt that the present 
action is one for recovery of damages based on a <i>quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span></i>, which action must be instituted within four (4) 
years (Article 1146, Civil Code). Appellants originally sought to enforce their 
claim ex-<span class="SpellE">delicto</span>, that is, under the provisions of the 
Penal Code, when they intervened in the criminal case against Jon <span class="SpellE">Elordi</span>. The information therein, it may be recalled, was 
amended precisely to include an allegation concerning damages suffered by the 
heirs of the victims of the accident for which <span class="SpellE">Elordi</span> 
was being prosecuted. But appellants' intervention was subsequently disallowed 
and they did not appeal from the Court's order to that effect. And when they 
commenced the civil action on 'September 26, 1958 the criminal case was still 
pending, showing that appellants then chose to pursue the remedy afforded by the 
Civil Code, for otherwise that action would have been premature and in any event 
would have been concluded by the subsequent judgment of acquittal in the 
criminal case. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In filing the civil action as 
they did appellants correctly considered it as entirely independent of the 
criminal action, pursuant to Articles 31 and 33 of the Civil Code, which read: 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Art. 31. When the civil action 
is based on an obligation not arising from the act or omission complained of as 
a felony, such civil action may proceed independently of the criminal 
proceedings and regardless of the result of the latter."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Art. 33. In cases of defamation, 
fraud, and physical injuries, a civil action of damages, entirely separate and 
distinct from the criminal action may be brought by the injured party. Such 
civil action shall proceed independently of the criminal prosecution, and shall 
require only a preponderance of evidence."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The term "physical injuries" in 
Article 33 includes bodily injuries causing death (<span class="SpellE">Dyogi</span> <i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>, G.R. No. 
L-9623, </span><st1:date month="1" day="22" year="1957"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Jan. 22, 
1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
Vol. 22, L.J. p. 175). In other words the civil action for damages could have 
been commenced by appellants immediately upon the death of their decedent, <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Capuno</span>, on 
</span><st1:date month="1" day="3" year="1953"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 3, 
1953</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> or 
thereabouts, and the same would not have been stayed by the filing of the 
criminal action for homicide through reckless imprudence. But the complaint here 
was filed only on </span><st1:date month="9" day="26" year="1958"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 26, 
1958</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, or 
after the lapse of more than five years. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the case of 
<span class="SpellE">Diocesa</span> <span class="SpellE">Paulan</span>, et al. 
<i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span>, 
et al, G. R. No.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> L-10542, promulgated July 31, 
1968, this Court held that an action based on a <i>quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span></i> is governed by Article 1150 of the Civil Code as 
to the question of when the prescriptive period of four years shall begin to 
run, that is, "from the day (the action) maybe brought,” which means from the 
day the <i>quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span></i> occurred or was committed. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The foregoing considerations 
dispose of appellants' contention that the four-year period of prescription in 
this case was interrupted by the filing of the criminal action against Jon <span class="SpellE">Elordi</span> inasmuch as they had neither waived the civil action 
nor reserved the right to institute it separately. Such reservation was not then 
necessary; without having made it they could <span class="SpellE">file—as</span> 
in fact they <span class="SpellE">did—a</span> separate civil action even during 
the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the criminal case (<span class="SpellE">Pachoco</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Tumangday</span>, 108 Phil., 
238; <span class="SpellE">Azucena</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Potenciano</span>, 
L-14028, June 30, 1962); and consequently, as held in <span class="SpellE">Paulan</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span>, supra, "the 
institution of a criminal action cannot have the effect of interrupting the 
institution of a civil action based on a <i>quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span></i>." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As to whether or not Rule III, 
Section 2, of the Rules of Court, which requires the reservation of the right to 
institute a separate and independent civil action in the cases provided for in 
Articles 31, 32, 33, 34, and 2177 of the Civil Code, affects the question of 
prescription, we do not now decide. The said rule does not apply in the present 
case. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Having found the action of 
appellants barred by the statute of limitations, we do not consider it necessary 
to pass upon the other issues raised in their brief. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The order appealed from is 
affirmed, without costs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><i><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Bengzon</span></i></span><i><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, C.J., <span class="SpellE">Batitista</span> Angelo, Conception, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span></span></i><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, <span class="SpellE"><i>Bengzon</i></span><i>, J.P. </i>and <span class="SpellE"><i>Zaldivar</i></span><i> JJ.</i>, concur.
