				<H3>SANTIAGO RICE MILL, ET AL., PETITIONERS, VS. SANTIAGO LABOR UNION ALIAS MAGAT LABOR UNION, RESPONDENT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Santiago Rice Mill is a business enterprise engaged in the buying and milling 
of palay. This mill is owned and operated by King Hong Co., Inc., a corporation 
organized under our laws, with principal office in Manila, and a branch office 
at Santiago, Isabela, where the mill and warehouse were situated.
<p>On June 21, 1952, the Santiago labor union, composed of workers of said rice 
mill, filed before the Court of Industrial Relations a petition for overtime 
pay, differential pay, vacation and sick leave pay, and other privileges for the 
benefit of the workers, which was later amended on September 2, 1952. In the 
amended petition, the union prayed for payment of P100,816.36 representing 
overtime services allegedly rendered to the company; P19,350.00 representing 
differential pay for services rendered during the nights, Sundays and legal 
holidays; P3,360.00 representing differential pay under the Minimum Wage Law, 
plus attorney's fees and costs.</p>
<p>On October 27, 1952, the company filed its answer to the amended complaint 
alleging, among others, that the court had no jurisdiction to arbitrate and pass 
upon petitioners' demand as the workers Involved had been fully paid for their 
services, that the provisions of the Minimum Wage Law had been complied with; 
and that vacation and sick leave with pay are being paid to permanent employees. 
And on November 3, 1952, the union filed a motion praying for reinstatement of 
workers that had been laid off, as well as for the punishment of the officials 
of the company for contempt.</p>
<p>On September 19, 1958, after a protracted hearing during which scores of 
witnesses and voluminous exhibits were presented, the court, thru Judge Emiliano 
C. Tabigne, rendered decision dismissing the petition of the union for lack of 
merit and want of jurisdiction; but, upon a motion for reconsideration, the 
Court of Industrial Relations <i>en banc</i>, by a split decision of 3-2 vote, 
issued a resolution reversing the decision of the trial judge. The dispositive 
part of said resolution reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"WHEREFORE, the respondents are hereby ordered to pay the overtime claim of 
both male and female claimants herein computed at their basis pay for each 
period in question; the legal premium for night, Sunday and holiday work or 
services rendered by the male claimants herein computed also on the proven basic 
wage or salary at the time in question; to pay the overtime claim of their 
drivers computed on their respective monthly salaries; to pay the differentials 
due each of the women claimants on their wages from August 4, 1951 at the rate 
of P2.00 daily and P3.00 daily from August 4, 1952; and to reinstate the 
claimants both male and female, who have testified and proved their having been 
illegally laid-off, with the right of respondents to deduct from the back wages 
due each claimant any amount earned during the period of the illegal 
dismissal."</p></blockquote>
<p>The company interposed the present petition for review.</p>
<p>Petitioner poses in this appeal the following issues: (1) the Court of 
Industrial Relations erred in ruling that it has jurisdiction to act on the 
claims herein despite the failure of the union to allege that the existing labor 
dispute between the parties "is causing or likely to cause a strike or lockout 
or a possibility thereof is imminent or expected"; (2) the Court of Industrial 
Relations erred in granting the claims of the union despite the overwhelming, 
clear and convincing evidence presented by the company in said court and the 
unreliability of the evidence presented by the union; and (3) the Court of 
Industrial Relations erred in not finding that the claimants who had testified 
were employed on the "pakiao" basis and therefore are not entitled to overtime 
compensation or differential pay under the Minimum Wage Law.</p>
<p>Anent the first issue, petitioner contends that in H. E. Heacock Company vs. 
National Labor Union,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> this Court 
ruled, that for the Court of Industrial Relations to have jurisdiction of any 
labor dispute under Section 4, Commonwealth Act No. 103, as amended, arising 
from difference concerning wages, compensation, dismissals, lay-offs, suspensoin 
of laborers, hours of labor, or conditions of employment, between the employers 
and employees, besides other jurisdictional requirements that the law 
prescribes, <i>there must be an allegation by the complaining party that the 
labor dispute is causing or likely to cause a strike or lockout or a possibility 
thereof</i> is imminent or expected from the violation or failure of the party 
charged to comply with tha provisions of the law involved. Since there is no 
such allegation in the petition filed herein by respondent union, the same lacks 
an essential ingredient that may give the industrial court its jurisdiction to 
take cognizance of the petition. Yet, said court, despite the absence of such 
allegation, declared itself with jurisdiction to act on the present case.</p>
<p>It appears, however, that the second amended petition filed by the union 
contains paragraphs 14 and 15 which we hereunder copy for ready reference:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"14. That to enable them to continue and prolong their illegal and wrongful 
exploitation of their workers, respondents have unlawfully interfered with the 
union activities of their workers to be investigated by the local constabulary 
and securing false affidavits or sworn statements from them which were filed 
with this Court, but even to that of maliciously prosecuting their leaders and 
dismissing without just cause the workers who persist in their union activities 
of demanding immediate amelioration of the working and living conditions of the 
workers;</p>
<p>"15. That to promote a more harmonious relations between respondents and 
their workers, petitioner as the sale collective bargaining agent or 
representative of the workers in respondent rice mill demands that close shop 
agreement be executed by and between petitioner and respondents under the 
supervision of this Court containing among others the following: Non-employment 
in respondent rice mill of non-union workers and/or employees; free medical and 
dental services for all workers; vacation and sick have with pay for all 
workers; compulsory group insurance; correct and prompt payment of compensation 
to injured workers; payment of wages and salaries on time and discontinuance of 
practice of selling rice and other prime commodities on credit but at higher 
price as substitute for paying wages and salaries on time; 50% premium for 
overtime services; 100% premium for night, Sunday and legal holiday work; strict 
compliance with the 8 Hour, Minimum and other labor laws; check-up for union 
dues and fees; prohibition against dismissing workers and employees without 
previous hearing and without just cause; and creation of an arbitration board to 
settle differences between management and labor as well as pass upon propriety 
of dismissing any worker and employee;"</p></blockquote>
<p>The paragraphs abovequoted, it is true, do not allege in so many words that 
the dispute or differences that had existed between the company and its workers 
ig one that is likely to cause a strike or lockout or a possibility thereof is 
imminent, but it can be clearly inferred that such dispute or differences are so 
serious that the break between them or of their labor relationship is expected 
or imminent considering the attitude of the company in interfering with the 
union activities of its workers to the extent of securing false affidavits to 
serve as basis of certain malicious prosecution against their leaders aside from 
the tenacious refusal of the company to attend to their demands for improvement 
of their working conditions as warranted by the 8-hour, minimum or other labor 
laws. As a matter of fact, as the record seems to reveal, many of the workers 
affiliated with the petitioning union were laid-off as a consequence of said 
union activities thereby giving rise to the present petition for indemnity and 
reinstatement. It is for this reason that the industrial court considered it to 
be merely a matter of form to aver in a specific manner that the existing labor 
dispute "is likely to cause a strike or lockout", or that one is imminent or 
expected, it being sufficient that from the factual allegations appearing in the 
petition such is clearly deducible. (Section 4, Commonwealth Act No. 103). And, 
as the industrial court has properly observed, "with the dismissal of the 
members of herein petitioner, after they had tiled the original petition in 
these cases and the service to respondent rice mill of the labor demands 
(Exhibits 'E' or 'G'), and which dismissal was made the subject of the complaint 
and the motion for reinstatement with pay, <i>it became unnecessary</i> for 
petitioner to still allege in the second amended petition that the labor dispute 
complained of 'is causing or is likely to cause' a strike or lockout or a 
possibility thereof was imminent or expected from the violation or failure of 
the respondents to comply with the provisions of the 8-Hour, Minimum and other 
labor laws, inasmuch as the workers had already been dismissed so that it was no 
longer within their power to call and stage a strike and neither was there any 
necessity for respondents to lockout any of them."</p>
<p>Finally, we have the circumstance that while this case was pending trial 
before the industrial court Republic Act No. 875, known as the Magna Carta of 
Labor, was enacted on June 17, 1953, and before this case came to a decision, 
several cases had been decided by this Court wherein it was laid down as a 
constant and decisive ruling that where the employer-employee relationship is 
still existing or is sought to be reestablished, as when there is a petition for 
reinstatement, the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over the claim 
if it arises out of, or is in connection with, the provisions of the Minimum the 
time has come for the court to Mew the case in line charge of unfair labor 
practice,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and so we may say that Wage 
Law, or the Eight-Hour Labor Law, or involves a with the spirit of the new law, 
since the transitory provision contained in the new Act does not require that 
the pending cases be decided in accordance with Commonwealth Act No. 103 
(Section 27, Republic Act 875), even if it enjoins the judges to make every 
attempt to help the parties reach a just and speedy solution by mutual 
agreement, which is the main objective of the new Act. The industrial court, 
therefore, did not err in assuming jurisdiction over the present case.</p>
<p>With regard to the second and third issues, we note that they merely involve 
questions of fact which, under our law and jurisprudence, may not now be 
inquired into in this appeal, unless it is shown that they are not supported by 
substantial evidence. Here, it is true, there is an attempt to prove that such 
is the case, by pointing out that the industrial court considered favorably the 
claim of the union by relying merely on the evidence of the union and ignoring 
the so-called overwhelming and convincing evidence of the employer. But such 
attempt must fail, not only because of the careful and painstaking evaluation of 
the evidence made by the court itself but also because of the refutation and 
discussion made of such evidence by counsel for the union.</p>
<p>Thus, in discussing the issues raised in connection with the evidence 
submitted by both parties, the industrial court made the following comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A check and comparison with the corresponding transcript of the stenographic 
notes of the testimony of each of the witnesses referred to and relied on by the 
decision reveals, however, that what appeared as seemingly inconsistent or 
contradictory statements are due mainly to omissions of vital portions of the 
pertinent testimony as reproduced in the said memorandum to probably support 
counsel's contention. This is specially, but not solely manifest in its 
quotation of the alleged testimonies of witnesses Segundino S. Mailem during the 
hearing on March 13, 1953; Anastacio Manafigan during the hearing on March 18 
and 23, 1953; and Alfredo Taguba during the hearing on January 16, 1957. While 
it is true, as usual and ordinary in any case, that inconsistencies and 
contradictions also occurred in the testimonies of the witnesses of the 
petitioner, it is also very evident that those contradictions and 
inconsistencies are due only to lapse of memory specially since the facts they 
were testifying to occurred some years before they were called to testify and 
that most if not all said witnesses appeared from the manner they answered 
questions as not only having also low degree of intelligence but also of not 
having had the benefit of education. However, on the whole, their testimonies 
have substantially supported the stand of petitioner on the main issues involved 
in its different claims and inasmuch as the contradictions, which in most cases 
were also rectified either directly or indirectly, referred to minor and most 
often immaterial and collateral issues which could not and should not influence 
the decision in these cases, we find the evidence of petitioner not only more 
reliable and dependable than that of the respondents' but also of having 
sufficiently and substantially established and sustained its major claims. And 
if the failure and refusal of respondents' counsel to furnish petitioner's 
counsel with a copy of their aforesaid memorandum of September 2, 1957 and the 
fact of its having misguided the aforesaid decision are taken into 
consideration, indeed the said decision should be reversed by this Court <i>en 
banc</i> on the ground that its findings of facts are not totally supported by 
the evidence presented during the hearing of these cases."</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, with regard to the union's claim that the company made its laborers 
work 24 hours daily, including Sundays and holidays, during the period in 
question, and not only for 8 hours daily, except Sundays and holidays, as 
claimed by the company, the industrial court made the following evaluation of 
the evidence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the appreciation of the testimonies of said four witnesses, none of whom 
was shown to have any interest at stake in these cases, we find no reason to 
doubt their sincerity and truthfulness as none of them is party in these cases. 
On the other hand, aside from the fact that all the witnesses presented by 
respondents to support their claim that they operated their rice mill on 
strictly 8 hours operation daily and only during ordinary work days by observing 
operation hours of 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. are all 
permanent employees who are under the control of respondents yet irreconciliable 
contradictions in their respective testimonies on the important point of 
respondents' contention rendered their theory unreliable, unbelievable and 
untenable. These fatal contradictions appeared in the testimonies of Antonio 
Ricafrente (Hearing on June 20, 1955) and Tan Pieng (hearing on August 22, 1956) 
who both testified that the operation of the rice mill was from 8:00 to 12:00 in 
the morning and from 1:00 to 5:00 in the afternoon but were both contradicted by 
Gregorio Caringo (hearing on June 17, 1955) and Primitivo Crystal (hearing on 
July 6, 1955), both of whom testified on the other hand that the rice mill 
actually operated from 7:00 to 11:00 in the morning and from 1:00 to 5:00 in the 
afternoon. Another witness of respondents, Anastacia Cortez Paseua, contradicted 
the above four witnesses of respondents in their contention that the rice mill 
operated and remained open up to 5:00 p.m., for according to her (hearing on 
August 23, 1955) the rice mill operated up to 4:00 p.m. only and closed at said 
time.</p>
<p>"Such serious contradictions can only mean that respondents are not telling 
the truth, for clearly they cannot be mistaken on such important parts of their 
daily work. This is further strengthened by the testimony of Antonio Ricafrente, 
one of the respondents' machine tenders and aparatistas, who admitted (hearing 
on July 6, 1955) that they were three machine tenders and aparatistas (Gregorio 
Garingo, Cornelio Ramos and he) in said rice mill who each worked 8 hours daily 
one after the other so that no two of them worked at the same time or turn, thus 
unwittingly admitting that the rice mill actually operated during the period in 
question the whole 24 hours daily which is the sum total of the 8 hours each of 
them worked separately and at different periods."</p></blockquote>
<p>The company, it is true, made an effort to prove that its rice mill operated 
only 8 hours daily by presenting some books covering its purchases and sales and 
income showing the volume of work done during the period in question from which 
it draws the conclusion that having in mind such volume and the capacity of the 
mill it could not have been possible for the company to operate the mill for 24 
hours daily, as claimed. But the industrial court refuted such claim in the 
following wise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * This finding also took into consideration respondents contention, as 
sought to be proved by the books of purchases and sales as well as incomes of 
the rice mill, that the rice mill did not need to operate 24 hours daily because 
as its records show it did not have sufficient stock of palay, corn and peanuts 
to mill if it were to operate that long with its milling capacity that has been 
increased to 350-400 cavans of clean rice in 8 hours operation only. Precisely, 
respondents' own admission of having employed no less than 20 agents or buyers 
of these cereals and their big warehouse aside from the warehouses of their 
buyers wherein they stored said cereals which were all milled in said rice mill; 
the unusually big hauling capacity of their trucks that hauled said cereals that 
even went as far as some towns of Cagayan province; and the three high power 
machines used to provide motive power to the rice cono, corn mill and peanut 
sheller which have been mechanically installed so that the three can be pulled 
by only one of said machines or engines, these facts only prove that the books 
of the said rice mill did not really reflect the true and actual transactions of 
respondents and at the same time pointed out the fact that all the equipment and 
materials of respondent rice mill were all geared to a 24 hours operation daily. 
As correctly observed by the Supreme Court in the case of Collector of Internal 
Revenue vs. Aurelio P. Reyes, G. R. No. L-11534 &amp; L-11558, promulgated 
November 25, 1958: 'Books of account do not prove per se that they are 
veracious; in fact they may be more consistent than truthful.' " 
</p></blockquote>
<p>And anent the claim of the company that the women winnowers were employed not 
on the daily wage basis but on piece work, the same was likewise rejected by the 
industrial court because it considered the evidence submitted by the union 
overwhelming. The following is the observation of the industrial court:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * On this point, the testimony of Mariano de la Cruz (hearing on January 
17, 1957); Urbana Tapiador (hearing on February 13, 1957); Natividad Malgapo 
(hearing on April 18, 1955); Maria Pasion (hearing on April 18, 1955); Segundino 
S. Mailem (hearing on March 13, 1953 and on June 9, 1955); and of the women 
claimants presented to prove and establish this claim of petitioner have 
convincingly substantiated that these women were indeed employed on the daily 
wage basis and not on the piece work as found by the decision. The very 
contention of respondents that on the piece work basis each woman working 8 
hours only could easily earn a minimum of P4.00 daily only gave credence to 
petitioner's claim that these women were paid on the daily wage since 
respondents failed to show why they would prefer to pay on the piece work and 
pay P4.00 for work that they could easily pay at P2.50 only, the rate they paid 
the daily wage male workers at the time. Another piece of evidence against 
respondents' contention is their admission that to both the male daily wage 
workers and said women winnowers, respondent rice mill issued a 'chapa' or badge 
which is a piece of metal to indicate the wage or pay of their labor whereas in 
the case of the piece work ('pakiao') male workers no such 'chapa' or badge was 
ever issued. This only shows again that the women winnowers were employed and 
paid under similar conditions and terms as the male daily wage 
workers."</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally, with regard to the claim for reinstatement of the laborers who had 
been laid-off, the industrial court found that their lay-off was caused not 
because of the stoppage of work due to the installation of the company's corn 
mill but rather as a reprisal for their union activities in an effort to compel 
them to desist therefrom and be more cooperative with the company.</p>
<p>The foregoing findings of fact, we repeat, cannot now be looked into 
considering that they are supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the resolution appealed from is affirmed, with costs against 
petitioners.</p> <i>Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala,</i> and
