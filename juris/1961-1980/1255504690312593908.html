				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner Santiago Vicente had
been in the employ of respondent as plant mechanic since July, 1952, with a
monthly salary of P150.00. On <st1:date year="1957" day="30" month="3"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 30, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, while he was in the performance
of his duties, going up a ladder to clean a boiler gauge, he fell, his chest
and the back of his head hitting a cement wall. He became unconcious
immediately after the fall, but regained the same, after an hour or so, and
continued to work. At the end of two weeks after the said fall, or on April 
29, 1957, he informed the respondent, thru Manager Gonzalo Puyat, that he was
not feeling well. He exhibited some loss of memory; he could not work normally
because he could not remember what he was going to do with the work. Mr. Puyat
recommended him to Dr. Limson of the Philippine General Hospital (PGH), for
treatment. From </span><st1:date year="1957" day="29" month="4"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 29, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, he was confined at the PGH, until
</span><st1:date year="1957" day="1" month="8"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 1, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. Petitioner's illness was diagnosed as cerebral
vascular disease, atherosclerotic with infraction and focal cerebralotrophy
Exh. B, Annex C of petition. From May 9 to May 13, 1958, petitioner was again
hospitalized, as his illness grew progressively worse and was then diagnosed as
"cerebral atrophy with encephalopathy probably secondary to cerebral
arterios clerosis". He was still having purposeless movements on the right
lower extremity, amnesic of past events and could recall only the immediate
past. <o:p></o:p></span><p></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">During the period of confinement,
petitioner filed a claim for compensation (Form No. 1), under Act No. 3428, as
amended (R03-WC Case No, 298), with the Regional Office No. 3, of the
Department of Labor, for the injury and consequent disability, resulting from
the accident met on March 30, 1957. On October 31, 1957, respondent company
filed its Employer's Report of Accident or Sickness (Form No. 3), claiming that
it did not have knowledge of the injury or the accident. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The hearing Officer rendered
judgment, the pertinent portions of which recite— <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"When Mr. Santiago Vicente
suffered the fall in March 30, 1957 while working' in the respondent's shop he
already had the 'cerebral arteriosclerosis'. And since, according to Dr.
Apostol, this disease was due to the <i>hardening of the brain arteries which
is the manifestation of the aging process</i>, it could not therefore be held
traceable to the fall. Claimant merely imagined that his present loss of memory
and involuntary movements of extremities was directly caused by his fall in
March 30, 1957, when all the time the cause of such sickness <i>existed even
before the accident</i>. Even Dr. Ceasar Catindig presented by claimant as his
witness who was consulted by Mr. Vicente in November, 1958, agreed with Dr.
Apostol that claimant's arteriosclerosis <i>was a part of the aging process</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Premises considered we find that
the illness on which the claim is based and resulting disability was not
directly traceable to the fall which hit the claimant's head in March 30, 1957
while in the course of his employment. The <i>cerebral arteriosclerosis was
part of the aging process and existed as early as January, 1957—long
before the accident. The loss of brain substance and hardening of the brain
arteries had no casual relation whatsoever with the accident that befell the
claimant</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Wherefore, we regret to have
to decree the dismissal of the instant claim for Insufficiency of evidence to
support the issuance of an award. Without costs."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</blockquote>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On August 5, 1960, the Commissioner
of the WCC affirmed the decision of the hearing officer, stating among others,
the following— 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In this case, the claimant
    was able not only to continue his work after his accidental fall without any
    ill effects whatsoever, but also for so many days thereafter. He allegedly
    exhibited loss of memory only after the lapse of more than two weeks after the
    accident. Consequently, we are impelled to conclude that the manifestations of
    the illness of the claimant <i>which disabled him for labor was the result of
    the natural progress of his cerebral arteriosclerosis and not due to any
    aggravation caused by his accidental fall</i>."<o:p>
  </o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner moved for a

</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On February 21, 1960, the WCC, en
bane, denied the motion for reconsideration, neither did it allow petitioner to
present additional evidence or to hold a joint examination of claimant. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The case is now before this Court
on a Petition to Review on Certiorari, claimant raising four (4) issues, which
may be summed up into the single proposition of whether or not the Alleged
pre-existing illness of petitioner of cerebral vascular disease, atheroclerotie
with infraction and focal cerebrolotrophy (hardening of the cerebral arteries),
was <i>aggravated</i> by the accident in question. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Commission, in refusing to
award compensation to petitioner relied mainly on the findings of the PGH that
the principal complaint of petitioner when admitted at the Hospital on April
29, 1957, was "Uncontrollable movements of the right lower extremity"
which allegedly started four (4) months before his admission, or in January
1957. The Commission concluded that disability which manifested itself and
prevented petitioner from performing his work, was independent from the
accident; rather it was the natural progress of his illness of <i>cerebral
arteriosclerosis</i>. Upon the other hand, petitioner contends that his illness
and subsequent disability were the direct result of the accident and/or <i>aggravated</i>
by it and that the conclusions of the Commission are not supported by the
evidence on record. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Workmen's Compensation Act,
among others, provide— <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Sec. 2, <i>Grounds for
Compensation</i>. —When an employee suffers personal injury from any
accident arising out of and in the course of his employment, or contracts
tuberculosis or other illness directly caused by such employment, or either
aggravated by or the result of the nature of such employment, his employer
shall pay compensation * * *."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</blockquote>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><br>
<span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The findings of the
Commission seem conclusive to the effect that on March 30, 1957, the petitioner
while in the act of going up the ladder to clean a boiler gauge of
respondent's machine, fell therefrom, causing his chest and back of his head to
strike the cement wall. Respondent and the Commission asserted that there was
no injury, basing such conclusion on the fact that immediately after the fall
(an hour or so after), the petitioner continued to work and it was only until
after two weeks that he complained to the management. The conclusion seem to be
off tangent to the testimonial evidence presented during the hearing, and to
the very nature of things. When claimant-petitioner was confined at the PGH for
the second time (May 9, 1958 to May 13, 1958), the illness was found to be
"cerebral atrophy with encephalopathy probably secondary to cerebral
arteriosclerosis." Dr. Apostol, explaining the cause or causes of the
illness, testified— <br>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Dr. Apostol, on the same point,
gave a clear answer in stating— <o:p></o:p></span><br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">And it has been said:<br>
  
  

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"<span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">* * *</span> Nevertheless, in the
presence of arteriosclerosis, each <i>trivial injury</i>, even a severe strain,
may have serious results <span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">* *</span>.” (Reed and Emerson, op. cited, p. 99).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The above testimonies and authority
bring to the fore, the probability that the encephalopathy suffered by
petitioner was the necessary result of the accident or <i>that same accident
was the cause of the aggravation of the arterios clerosis which in turn
developed into encephalopathy</i>. It can be concluded that had petitioner not
met the accident, be could not have suffered the arteriosclerosis of such
degree, which is abnormal to a person of his age, such disease "being very
rare in the young (like petitioner who was 48 at the time of accident), and
common to those over 50 years (Textbook of Medicine, Cevil and Loeb, 1254). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Respondent WCC pointed out that the
arteriosclerosis of petitioner was already in existence before the accident,
and it could be independent to the accident. Granting the same to be true,
still the WCC erred in not awarding compensation. The pre-existence of an
illness is not a ground for disallowance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Commission, in trying to
disassociate the accident from the illness and subsequent disability, expressed
the opinion that immediately after the fall there were no outward
manifestations that an injury was suffered, This may be true, but whether the
effects of the accident were immediately manifest did not preclude the presence
of internal injury. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

  accident and the Illness and yet the illness be the result of the accident? No
  time can be arbitrarily sot down. Many persons who at first suffer a little,
  later develop very serious symptoms. If it be shown that, <i>notwithstanding
  the existence of arteriosclerosis, the man was in good condition, and that
  dating from the accident mental and physical decay began, it is reasonable to
  suppose that the injury was the exciting cause</i>," (Osler &amp; McCrae,
  Modern Medicines Its Theory and Practice, p. 649).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Indeed, there was no visible lesion
shown on the petitioner's anatomy. But here is a person who had been sound and
healthy, for five (5) years during his employment with respondent company; and
soon after his severe fall, he was already suffering from an illness
which crippled him for work. Even a severe strain may have serious results.
There was the smoke, there must have been a fire; the effect itself, showed the
cause; the occurrence told its own tale. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The petitioner's claim should be
upheld, not only because the presumption of compensability was not destroyed by
respondent company's evidence, but also because the Workmen's Compensation Act
is a social legislation designed to give relief to the workman who has been the
victim of an accident in the pursuit of his employment and must be liberally
construed, to attain the purpose for which it has been enacted (Eneria <i>vs.</i>
Atlantic Gulf &amp; Pacific Co., of Manila, 38 Off. Gaz., Sept. 15, 1951). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Having reached the above
conclusion, it is not deemed necessary to pass upon other issues raised in the
appeal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In view hereof, the decision of the Workmen's
Compensation Commission, dismissing petitioner's claim for compensation for
alleged insufficiency of evidence, is hereby reserved, and another entered,
ordering respondent Gonzalo Puyat &amp; Sons, Inc., to pay petitioner such
compensation as the law provides after a computation thereof shall have been
made by the respondent Commission. With costs against respondent company. <o:p></o:p></p>
