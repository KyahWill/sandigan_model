				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Solicitor General has appealed from the decision of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> granting <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> petition for naturalization (Case No. 753). The
case was submitted without <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> brief in reply
to that of appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, a citizen of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Republic</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Nationalist China</st1:placename></st1:place>, was born of
Chinese parents in <span class="SpellE">Binondo</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
on <st1:date year="1921" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1921</st1:date>, and
baptized in the <st1:place><st1:placename>Chinese</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place>
of <span class="SpellE">Binondo</span> under the name of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Jao</span> <span class="SpellE">Teck</span> Chuan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He took his primary course in De La Salle
College of Manila and his secondary and collegiate courses in the <st1:place><st1:placename>Far</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Eastern</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype></st1:place>
where he obtained his degree of Bachelor of Science in Commerce.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1951" day="28" month="4">April
 28, 1951</st1:date> he married Susan Ng <span class="SpellE">Siok</span> Kun,
also a Chinese citizen, with whom he has four children, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Andrew, Alexander, Margaret and Melanie, the
first two being enrolled at the De La Salle College and the other two at St. <span class="SpellE">Scholastica</span> College, both in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since 1956 petitioner and his wife have been
residing in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>, where he is
employed as salesman in the Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Leyson</span> Brokerage,
as a solicitor in the office of Santiago Go, Commercial Broker, and in the <span class="SpellE">Lianga</span> Bay Logging Company, Inc., with a monthly salary of
P550.00, P500.00 and P75.00, respectively, or a total of P1<span class="GramE">,125.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two witnesses, <span class="SpellE">Honorato</span>
<span class="SpellE">Suson</span> and <span class="SpellE">Facundo</span> O. Perez,
vouched for his good moral character.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue to be resolved is whether or not petitioner has
satisfactorily shown that he has all the qualifications and none of the
disqualifications for naturalization.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first objection raised by the Solicitor General <span class="GramE">is that</span> although according to petitioner he was known in
school as Anthony <span class="SpellE">Jao</span> he was never officially
registered under this name, nor was it included in the publication of the
notice of his petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not
consider this objection of sufficient importance, since petitioner was baptized
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Jao</span> <span class="SpellE">Teck</span> Chuan, and
this is the name given in his petition as well as in the published notices
thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General next draws attention to the evidence of
petitioner's good moral character and conduct.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is a well settled rule that the evidence on this point must embrace
the entire period of the applicant's residence in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(Lim vs. Republic, L-22437, June 21, 1966; Republic vs. Hon. Andres Reyes,
L-20602, December 24, 1965; <span class="SpellE">Vy</span> <span class="SpellE">Tian</span>
alias <span class="SpellE">Si</span> Un vs. Republic, L-19918, July 30,
1965).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two character witnesses in
this case testified that they first came to know the petitioner in 1946, when
he was already 25 years <span class="GramE">old,</span> and even then used to
meet him only occasionally, until he transferred to <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place> in 1956.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently they are not in a position to vouch for petitioner's
irreproachable conduct for the entire period required by law (Ng vs. Republic,
L-21179, January 22, 1966; King vs. Republic, L-19082, September 29, 1966),
especially while he was staying in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
and for a time in <st1:city><st1:place>San Juan</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The notice of the petition for naturalization was published in
"La <span class="SpellE">Prensa</span>", a newspaper of general
circulation in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no showing that the said newspaper
was also of general circulation in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
and <st1:city><st1:place>San Juan</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
where petitioner, as heretofore stated, spent the greater part of his
youth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the law in
requiring publication of the notice of the petition is to apprise the public in
general that petitioner has applied for citizenship, so that persons who know
him or otherwise may have derogatory information about him may bring the same
to the attention of the corresponding authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the acquisition of citizenship by
naturalization is of public interest, involving as it does the conferment of
political and economic rights and privileges.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Wherefore</b>, the decision appealed from is set aside and the
petition is dismissed, without prejudice to the filing of another application
by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to
costs.</p>
