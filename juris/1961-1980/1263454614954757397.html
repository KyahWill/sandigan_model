				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">What is to be determined in
this appeal is the correctness of a lower court decision absolving from
liability defendants Atlas Trading Development </span>Corporation (herein­<span style="">after referred to as Atlas) and Alto Surety
&amp; Insurance Company (hereinafter referred to as Alto), the former under </span>a
contract <span style="">for the sale of galvanized
steel sheets and the </span>latter under a performance bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the plaintiff-appellant is the National Marketing
Corporation, the action was originally started by its pre­decessor Philippine
Relief and Trade Rehabilitation Administration (hereinafter referred to as the <span class="SpellE">Pratra</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its
complaint dated June 14, 1950, it alleged:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On July 21, 1948, defend­ant Atlas offered to sell to <span style="">the plaintiff 8,000 metric tons </span>of
galvanized sheets at the price of U.S. $247 per ton of 1,000 kilos, CIF Manila,
to be shipped beginning August, 1948;<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">on July 24, 1948, the plaintiff made an
order and agreed to purchase the galvanized </span>sheets offered by defendant
Atlas with the condition that the seller should furnish a performance bond in
favor of the plaintiff in the amount of <span style="">P100,000.00;</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> on August 5, 1948, the plaintiff and
defendant Atlas as sales </span>brokers for West India Commercial Corp. of New
York City, <span style="">N. Y., </span>U. <span style="">S. A., </span>executed a contract of purchase
and sale wherein the said defendant obligated itself to sell 8,000 metric tons
of galvanized steel sheets, at the price of U. S. $247 per ton of 1,000 kilos
CIF Manila;<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
under the afore­mentioned contract, defendant Atlas obligated itself to furnish
in <span style="">favor </span>of <span class="SpellE">Pratra</span>
a performance bond in the sum <span style="">of
P100,000.00 to guarantee the faithful compliance </span>of all the terms and
conditions of the said contract, with defendant Alto as surety;<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
in compliance with its undertakings in the contract, <span style="">the </span>plaintiff on August 26, 1948, opened <span style="">a </span>letter of credit with the Philippine National Bank for the
amount of U. <span style="">S. </span>$1,976,000.00 in
favor of the West India Commercial Corp. of New York, United States.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Neither defendant Atlas nor its supposed principal the West India
Commercial Corp. of <st1:state><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:state>
delivered the 8,000 metric tons of galvanized steel sheets involved in the
contract.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The aforementioned contract having provided that in case of violation of any of
its terms and conditions, the buyer will be entitled to recover liquidated
damages in the amount of 20% of the total contractual value of the merchandise
therein described, U. S. $1,976,000.00, 20% of which is U.S. $395,200.00 or
P790,400.00,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">plaintiff</span> sought to recover the
same from Atlas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It likewise <span style="">prayed</span> that defendants Alto be
condemned to pay the plaintiff the amount of P10<span style="">0</span>,000.00, the amount of the performa<span style="">n</span>ce bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the answer of defendant Atlas, filed on July 15, 1950, it
admitted making the offer, adding however that <span style="">plaintiff </span><span style="">was </span>duly
informed that it was acting in <span style="">its
repre­sentative capacity;</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>that an order to purchase the
galvanized steel sheets was in fact made by plaintiff;<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
that such a contact of purchase and sale as set forth in paragraph 4 of the
complaint<span style=""> was</span><span style=""> </span>in fact
executed, although the date of the execution was not on August 5, 1948 but on
August 21, 1948, with the further allegation that its terms and conditions were
"modified, altered and supplemented by another agreement dated August 20,
1948;" that while there was opened on Augusta 26, 1948, <span style="">a </span>letter of
credit for the amount of U. S. $1,976,000.00 in favor of West India Commercial
Company of New York, U. S. A. by the Philippine National Bank, acting on
plaintiff's application, such letter of credit being in favor of the
beneficiary, West India Commercial Company of New York, U.S.A., it could not be
utilized in view of what <span style="">was </span>considered
“serious dis­crepancies between the terms of the said letter of credit and the
contract;" no delivery of the 8,000 metric tons of galvanized steel
sheets, was made as there was no obligation to do <span style="">so, </span>but <span style="">even </span>if it
arose, "delivery was made impossible by the prior rescission of the
contracts by plaintiff."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
It further <span style="">set </span>up five special
defenses and a counterclaim for P100,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant Alto denied the allegations of the complaint on the ground
that it had no knowledge or information suffi­cient to form a belief as to what
was therein contained ex­cept the execution of the bond for and on behalf of
the West India Commercial Corporation of New York to guarantee the latter's
performance of its obligation, if any, under the contract which, having been
executed and acknowledged on August 21, 1948 and not on August 5, 1948 as
alleged, could not be the basis of any obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the assumption how­ever that the latter
contract could be the one referred to in the bond, it alleged that it did <span style="">so </span>for and on behalf of the West India
Commercial Corporation of New York to guarantee the performance of its
obligation, if <span style="">any, </span>and that it
never incurred any obligation at all under the contract which was the basis of
the complaint "as it was never a party to it, nor did it authorize any one
to obligate it in any manner whatsoever," and that plaintiff "having
discharged the West India Commercial Corporation of New York from liability on
said contract, [defendant Alto] is and must likewise be discharged, the
obligation of the surety being merely accessory to<span style=""> </span>that of the principal."</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the lower court promulgated a decision on <st1:date year="1962" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1962</st1:date> dismissing the
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In absolving defend­ant
Atlas, it held that it "was duly authorized to act <span style="">as </span>agent or broker of the West India Commercial Company in
entering into the contract of purchase and sale."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Even if its liability could be held to be direct, the <span class="SpellE">Pratra</span>,
having demanded payment of damages from West India Commercial Cor­poration ands
not from it, waived whatever claim it might have against Atlas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The above circumstances taken in connection
with what the lower court found to be <span style="">a
</span>discrepancy in the letter of credit in favor of the West India Commercial
Cor­poration, which it held to be a condition <span style="">precedent </span>for the obligation of the
latter under such contract to arise, such discrepancy consisting of no period
of grace of 60 days for delivery having been provided for, although
subsequently corrected but only after the first delivery was "already
impossible physically for the West India Commercial Company <span style="">to </span>make on time" led it to
conclude that for all legal intents and purposes, such contract of purchase and
sale "had not been operative up to the time it was rescinded by the <span class="SpellE">Pratra</span> on September 23, 1948, due to the failure of the
latter to perform the condition precedent of establishing <span style="">a s</span>ufficient letter of <span style="">credit."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
No liability could therefore attach <span style="">to </span>defendant
Atlas.</p>

<p class="BODY">The same conclusion was reached as far as <span style="">defendant </span><span style="">Alto </span>was
concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"As to the defendant Alto <span style="">Surety, we hold </span>that judgment cannot
be rendered against <span style="">it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alto</span> Surety posted its bond for the
West India <span style="">Commercial Corporation </span>and
not for the defendant Atlas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And <span style="">as </span>the West India Commercial
Corporation <span style="">is </span>not a party in
this suit, there is nothing for the Alto Surety to answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case against the Alto Surety and
Insurance Co., Inc., <span style="">is </span><span style="">also </span>dismissed."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The facts as found by the lower court are <span style="">in </span>accordance with the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lay as applied cannot be characterized as erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment must be affirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY">It being undisputed that no such delivery of the 8,000 metric
tons of galvanized steel sheets contracted for was ever made, the decisive
question is whether liability could <span style="">he </span>deemed
to have arisen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the answer were in
the affirmative the next question would be, who is to be held accountable?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant Atlas was absolved from any
responsibility by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
justified the non-delivery because of the discrepancy between what was provided
for in the contract of the purchase and sale<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
and the letter of credit,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
which under the contract had to be opened.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As noted in the Brief submitted by Atty. Domingo Zavalla for defendant
Atlas, distinguished for its clarity and lucidity, the failure of the letter of
credit to comply with what <span style="">was </span>agreed
upon is very apparent and noticeable.”<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the contract, the shipment of the galvanized steel sheets could be
made during a period from August, 1948 to February, 1949 with <span style="">a grace </span><span style="">of </span>60 days, i.e., “all shipments within 60 days of the above
schedule would be accepted as good delivery."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
The letter of credit on the other hand did not provide for such a period of
grace of 60 days for late shipment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
corrected letter of credit was received by them West <span class="SpellE">lndia</span>
Corporation only on <st1:date year="1948" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1948</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the first shipment was supposed to have
been made in August, it was impossible for the West India Commercial
Corporation to make it on time.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
the above circumstances the correctness of the assertion in a radiogram of West
India Commercial Corporation sent to defendant Atlas stating that serious
discrepancy "from contact" would prevent it from "using letter
of credit in present form" cannot be denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a decision of this Court,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
it was held that the failure to open a letter of credit within <span style="">a </span>period
agreed upon suffices to prevent a binding juridical the from being
created.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That case, dealing with offer
and <span style="">acceptance,
reiterated the principle that to bind the <span class="SpellE">offeror</span>,
"the <span class="SpellE">offeree</span> </span>must comply with the
conditions of the offer." The situation before us deals with a perfected
contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here the time element does not
enter into the failure of one party to live up to the terms of the contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was manifest was the discrepancy between
what was agreed upon in the contract and the letter of credit, <span style="">the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of </span>which requires that "all
conditions contained [in <span style="">it] </span>be strictly complied with, however
onerous they may be."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
The above principle is deemed "absolutely necessary for the protection of
the banking and mercantile community.” There is a New York Supreme Court
decision to the effect that a "material variance between the letter of
credit and the sales agreement would excuse non-performance by the seller."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Plaintiff-appellant must
have been mindful of the force </span>end <span style="">applicability
of the above controlling principle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
its </span><span style="">Brief, </span>Its <span style="">sought to avoid its application by alleging
that </span>by i<span style="">t</span>s <span style="">very nature </span><span style="">"a </span><span style="">letter </span><span style="">of credit </span><span style="">cannot contain all the particulars nor can it embody all the agreements
previously entered into by the parties for the terms and con­</span><span style="">ditions of their agreement are already
contained in separate documents."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Plaintiff-appellant would then allege that </span><span style="">no such </span><span style="">period </span><span style="">of allowance or
grace for the late shipment was provided for because </span>the same was
already embodied in the contract of purchase and sale, Exhibit C.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
Such an argument is far from persuasive.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>An authoritative excerpt from <span class="SpellE">Zollman</span> on Banks
and Banking argues to <span style="">the </span>contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Where, therefore, legal relations arise from a letter of credit,
such letter contains the <span style="">entire
contract </span>of the parties, and their resulting obligations should be
measured by its provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
constitutes <u>the</u> complete <span style="">agreement,
and is in</span>dependent of the contract sale between the buyer and the
seller, <span style="">and is </span><span style="">unaffected by any breach of contract on the
part of the seller or the buyer or by any controversy which may</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">arise
between the buyer and seller or </span><span style="">by
</span><span style="">any other tran­saction between
the buyer and seller.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It
</span><span style="">follows then that the lower
court was correct in holding that no liability was incurred under the contract

being the case, the <span style="">question of whether

need not be <span style="">passed upon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As for the surety,
