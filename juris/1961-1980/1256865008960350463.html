				<H3>RAMCAR INCORPORATED, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. DOMINGO GARCIA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br> D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In May 1959, Domingo Garcia obtained the services of Ramcar Inc. for the 
repair of his two cars. The total cost of the repair, in labor and material, 
amounted to P1,610.82, which, according to their agreement, was payable within 
the first 10 days of the month. As Domingo Garcia failed to pay his obligation, 
despite demands, Ramcar Inc. on October 9, 1959, filed an action in the 
Municipal Court of Manila for the recovery of said amount. Judgment was entered 
in favor of Ramcar Inc., against Garcia who appealed to the CFI of Manila (being 
Civ. Case No. 41853). The lower court set the hearing of the case on January 28, 
1960. On January 27, 1960, appellant's motion to postpone, as his counsel had to 
appear in a hearing in Pampanga—Crim. Case No. 3297, was denied. The lower court 
forthwith received plaintiff's evidence; in the absence of the defendant and 
entered judgment, condemning defendant to pay the amount of P1,610.82 at 12% 
interest per annum from October 9, 1959, until fully paid, plus 25% of the said 
sum as attorney's fees and the costs in both instances. Defendant's motion for 
new trial was denied. He directly appealed to this Court, alleging that (1) the 
lower court erred, in ordering him to pay, on the basis of the evidence 
presented by appellee, in view of article 1715, in relation to article 1169 of 
the new Civil Code; and (2) the decision of the trial court is contrary to 
law.
<p>The position of the appellant may be stated as follows:</p>
<p>The contract between the parties is one for lease of work or service to 
execute a piece of work (Art. 1644 N.C.C.). Appellant in paragraph 3 of his 
answer avers—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Defendant denies the allegations in Paragraph 4 of the complaint, the truth 
being that if he is at all indebted to the plaintiff, his obligation has not 
become due and demandable for the reason that <i>plaintiff has not complied with 
defendant's request to correct defects in the repair services done by 
it</i>."</p></blockquote>
<p>Under the contract, it was appellee's obligation to do the work or repair 
without defects that would destroy or lessen the valued or fitness of the cars 
of their ordinary or stipulated use, pursuant to the provisions of Article 1715 
N.C.C. which provides—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ART. 1715. The contractor shall execute the work in such a manner that it 
has the qualities agreed upon and has no defects which destroy or lessen its 
value or fitness for its ordinary or stipulated use. Should the work be not of 
such quality, the employer may require that the contractor remove the defect or 
execute another work. If the contractor fails or refuses to comply with this 
obligation, the employer may have the defect removed or another work executed, 
at the contractor's cost."</p></blockquote>
<p>As the principal issue raised by the pleadings was whether the repairs made 
by the appellee were not defective, the appellee has the burden of proof 
(<i>onus probandi</i>) of establishing that the repairs were not defective.</p>
<p>In other words, defendant-appellant contends that plaintiff-appellee runs the 
risk of losing its case, if it fails to prove that the repairs were without 
defect, considering the provision of said article 1715; that plaintiff merely 
proved the allegations in its complaint, in the absence of the defendant, 
notwithstanding the allegation in his answer that the repairs were defective and 
as appellee had failed to prove that it performed the repairs without any 
defect, appellant's obligation to pay such repairs is not yet due and 
demandable. Defendant-appellant in support of this theory, cites Art. 1169 N. C. 
C., which provides that in reciprocal obligations, neither party incurs in delay 
if the other does not comply or is not ready to comply in a proper manner with 
what is incumbent upon him.</p>
<p>The plaintiff in a civil case, is called upon only to prove the material 
allegations in his complaint constituting his cause of action. In the case at 
bar, plaintiff's cause of action relates to the prestation of repair services to 
the appellant for which the latter in turn obligated himself to pay for the 
value thereof. Appellee proved his allegations, it is not enough that a 
defendant interposes an affirmative or special defense, in order to relieve him 
of his liability to the plaintiff; he must establish by preponderant evidence 
such affirmative defense (Kesler Electric Co. vs. Rodriguez, 44 Phil., 19; 
Alvarez vs. Vargas, 35 Phil., 1). Although appellant herein, filed his answer, 
alleging that the repairs made by the appellee were defective, he presented no 
evidence in support of the same, because he failed to appear at the trial. The 
legal issue is not whether the repairs made were defective but rather the 
determination of who has the burden of proving that the repairs were defective. 
The burden of proof lies on the party who would be defeated, if no evidence were 
given on either side (sec. 70, Rule 123). The plaintiff herein having proven its 
case, the defendant would run the risk of being defeated, if he did not prove 
his allegation. It is true that defendant-appellant's averment to the effect 
that the repair services were defective, is a negative one, but defendant has 
asserted the affirmative of this issue, hence, he should be made to prove it. It 
stands to reason that the burden of proof lies on the party who substantially 
asserts the affirmative of the issue, upon the principle that the suitor who 
relies upon the existence of a fact should be called upon to prove that 
fact.</p>
<p>Article 1715 in conjunction with Art. 1169 of the N.C.C., may be available 
only under certain established facts; that is, the proof of the defects in the 
work, which in the instant case, appellant has failed to do. The trial court 
found that plaintiff did in fact render repair services to the defendant, and in 
the absence of proof to the contrary, such repair services are deemed 
satisfactory. The law presumes that appellee acted in accordance with his 
commitments, and that the repairs were regularly done (Sec. 69, pars. p &amp; q 
Rule 123). And since, in the case at bar, defendant-appellant presented no 
evidence, he is not justified in invoking the aforecited provisions. Verily, the 
findings of the lower court, as to facts are now considered final and 
conclusive.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from being in accordance with the evidence and the law 
on the matter, is hereby affirmed in toto, with costs against the 
defendant-appellant.</p>
