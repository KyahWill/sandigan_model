strike down the power of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>
to proceed with its Civil Case 1087.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioners R.B. Industrial Development Company, Limited (<u>Industrial</u>,
for short) and Ray N. <span class="SpellE">Kittiltsvedt</span>, with vehemence
say, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span><u>,</u> that private
respondent Eastern Timber Corporation (hereinafter referred to simply as <u>Eastern</u>)
has no cause of action against them; and, that the lower court is without
jurisdiction to take cognizance of said case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners expressed grave concern over the great probability that the
lower court would issue an injunction to prevent Industrial from logging within
the forest area covered by its concession.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We, accordingly issued a cease-and-desist order upon petitioners'
application.</p>

<p class="BODY">The present controversy has its roots in facts now to be recited.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ray N. <span class="SpellE">Kittilstvedt</span> was granted by the
Bureau of Forestry a forest concession in <span class="SpellE">Cabadbaran</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, with an area of 6,850 hectares under Ordinary
Timber License 1286-'59 (New) dated January 22, 1959 <u>to</u> <u>expire</u> <u>on</u>
<u>June</u> <u>30</u> <u>1959.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Said</u>
<u>license</u> <u>was</u> <u>on</u> <u>its</u> <u>face</u> <u>non</u>-<u>transferable</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet, on <st1:date year="1959" day="22" month="12">December 22, 1959</st1:date>, i.e., five months and twenty-nine days
after the license <u>expired</u>, Eastern, at the time still in the process of
organization,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
became <span class="SpellE">Kittilstvedt</span> assignee of the lapsed license
aforesaid in exchange for 400 shares with a par value of P40,000 of <span class="SpellE">Eastern's</span> capital stock.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Soon thereafter, that is, on <st1:date year="1960" day="30" month="3">March
 30, 1960</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Kittilstvedt</span> sold his 400
shares in Eastern for the same consideration of P40,000 to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Democrito</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>O.</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Plaza</st1:placetype></st1:place>, now <span class="SpellE">Eastern's</span>
stockholder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of interest is that
immediately after the transfer of the license, <span class="SpellE">Kittilstvedt</span>
was made vice-president of Eastern.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Claim is now advanced that <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of the fact
that <span class="SpellE">Kittilstvedt</span> is supposed to own 96.15% of the
paid-up, capital stock,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
he (vice-president) did not share in the corporation's management.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Kittilstvedt's</span> timber license was,
extended on March 6, 1963, denominated as Ordinary Timber License 878-'63 in
his name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was again renewed, likewise
in his name, on <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1965</st1:date>,
this time as Ordinary Timber License 847-61566.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While the license appears in <span class="SpellE">Kittilstvedt's</span>
name, averment is made by Eastern that the expenses for the renewal of the
license such as application fees license fees, forestry bonds and other
incidental expenses were paid for by Eastern.</p>

<p class="BODY">The day following the issuance of the last renewed license
(847-61566), or on <st1:date year="1965" day="28" month="10">October 28, 1965</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Kittilstvedt</span> transferred the same to Industrial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Industrial thus obtained its own Ordinary Timber License
981-103166 (New).</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 21, 1965, Eastern lodged a complaint with the
Director of Forestry against R. B. Mining Co., Ltd. (instead of Industrial) and
<span class="SpellE">Kittilstvedt</span>, praying for (1) the cancellation of the
ordinary timber license allegedly issued in the name of R.B. Mining Co., Ltd.,
and (2) the issuance in lieu thereof of another license in the name of Eastern;
and (3) in the meantime, for an order stopping R.B. Mining Co., Ltd. or any
person to conduct logging operations within the forest area covered by Ordinary
Timber License 981-103166 (New).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
remedy pursued in the Bureau of Forestry was thereafter abandoned.</p>

<p class="BODY">Came the court case (Civil Case 1087) filed on <st1:date year="1966" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1966</st1:date> in the court of first
instance adverted to at the beginning of this opinion.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
This time, Eastern sued <span class="SpellE">Kittilstvedt</span> and Industrial
asking for the following <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) preliminary injunction to stop logging
operations in the area under Industrial's timber license; (2) nullification of
the transfer of <span class="SpellE">Kittilstvedt</span> to Industrial; (3) decla­ration
that plaintiff is the owner of the said timber license appearing in the name of
Industrial; (4) directing defendants to transfer said license in <span class="SpellE">Eastern's</span> name; and, (5) accounting by defendants of logs
and forest products, damages, attorneys' fees, and costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">This complaint was met by defendants' motion to dismiss mainly
upon the two grounds heretofore mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court held in abeyance resolution on the motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants moved to reconsider.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, on <st1:date year="1967" day="2" month="5">May 2, 1967</st1:date>,
the trial court issued an order<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
(1) denying the motion to reconsider; (2) denying plaintiff's <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> motion to declare defendants in default; (3)
ordering defendants to answer the complaint within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period; and (4) setting for hearing on <st1:date year="1967" day="5" month="6">June
 5, 1967</st1:date> plaintiff's urgent motion for preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1967</st1:date>,
defendants went to the Court of Appeals on certiorari (<st1:place><st1:city>CA-G.R.</st1:city>
 <st1:postalcode>31431</st1:postalcode></st1:place>-R).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since jurisdiction was the main question
involved therein, cognizable only by the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals,
on <st1:date year="1967" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1967</st1:date>, dismissed
the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on June 5, 1967, at a time when the certiorari
petition was pending consideration by the Court of Appeals, respondent judge
issued two orders:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the <u>first</u>,
declaring defendants in default and denying their counsel's request to defer
the proceed­ings, and giving leave to plaintiff to present evidence before the
deputy clerk of court; the <u>second</u>, authorizing the deputy clerk of court
to receive plaintiff's evidence in connection with the latter's (<span class="SpellE">Eastern's</span>) application for a preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants below, Industrial and <span class="SpellE">Kittilstvedt</span>,
lost no time in coming to this Court on certiorari and prohibition aforesaid.</p>

<p class="BODY">We will now proceed to discuss the legal issues tendered by the
petition and the return, and the written arguments of the parties.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. The forefront question is whether or not Eastern, plaintiff
below (respondent here), has a cause of action against defendants (herein
petitioners) Industrial and <span class="SpellE">Kttlilstvedt</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, indeed, if Eastern did not have a cause
of action, it would be futile to proceed any further.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Eastern's</span> cause of action is anchored
on the deed of assign­ment and affidavit both executed by <span class="SpellE">Kittilstvedt</span>
on December 29, 1959 conveying to Eastern all his rights under Ordinary Timber
License 1286-'59 (New).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But did Eastern
acquire any right under these documents to entitle it to sue for the
performance of any <span class="SpellE">prestation</span> <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>
by <span class="SpellE">Kittilstvedt</span>?</p>

<p class="BODY">Our answer is <u>No</u>. <u>First</u>, the license had already
expired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no license to
transfer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Second</u>, the license
itself says that such license is non-transferable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And Eastern is duty bound to be guided by
that prohibition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Third</u>, the
conveyance was illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>dolo</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>malo</u></span><u> non</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>oritur</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>actio</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A party to an illegal contract cannot come to
court and ask to have his illegal objects carried out.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Forestry Administrative Order No. 21, dated <st1:date year="1954" day="18" month="9">September 18, 1954</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
expressly prohibits such transfer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
order reads:</p>

<blockquote>"The transfer, sale or conveyance of any license, permit or

requirements of the law and the rules and regulations <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>
promulgated by the Director of Forestry; and <u>provided</u> <u>further</u>,
that there is no evidence that such transfer, sale or conveyance is being made
for purposes of speculation".<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Forestry administrative Order No. 21 was issued by the Secretary
of Agriculture and Natural Resources upon recommendation of the Director of
Forestry on authority of Sections 79(b) and 1817 of the Revised Administrative
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judicial test has since recognized
that administrative orders of this nature have the force and effect of law.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Why then should transfer of licenses be regulated by the Bureau
of Forestry?</p>

<p class="BODY">We look at Forestry Administrative Order No. 21 just
transcribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We perceive that it is not
without reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By Section 1824 of the
Revised Administrative Code, the governing principle is that the public forests
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
"shall be held and administered for the protection of the public
interests, the utility and safety of the forests, and the perpetuation thereof
in productive condition by wise use".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is but an echo of Section 1817 of the same Code which, speaking of
regulations of the Bureau of Forestry, states that such "regulations of
the Bureau of Forestry, with the approval of the Department Head first had,
shall, among other things, contain provisions deemed expedient or necessary to
secure the protection and conservation of the public forests in such manner as
to insure a continued supply of valuable timber and other forest products for
the future, and regulating the use and occupancy of the forests and forest
reserves, to the same end".</p>

<p class="BODY">We have recently said that there is the pressing need for forest
preservation, conservation, protection, development and reforestation.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
"And, it is to be observed that in the adminis­trative order heretofore
adverted to, there is a discernible purpose at once laudable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With tremendous profits that logging
operations may bring, the probability of the government having to cope with
unscrupulous loggers is not altogether remote.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The transfer, sale or conveyance of forest concessions, so the rule
says, should <u>not</u> be "<u>made</u> <u>for</u> <u>purposes</u> <u>of</u>
<u>speculation</u>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One without a
legitimate purpose to operate a logging concession may obtain a license to be
able to peddle it and thus make the proverbial quick peso.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is the other concessionaire already
with a license covering a sufficient area, who may be driven by greed to
acquire more with detriment to public interests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is it then too far-fetched to say that it is
the bounden duty of those called upon to enforce our forest laws to minimize,
if not totally curb, the activities or emergence of those speculators and dummies?</p>

<p class="BODY">It is within the area of the State's concern to encourage the
exploitation of our natural resources by honest, qualified licensees who are
willing and able to exert their utmost efforts and dare the risks and
privations concomitant to the opening of frontiers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like­wise, it is the State's responsibility
to see to it that benefits accrue both to the concessionaire and the country in
general.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not out of place then to
say that the law may grant or withhold the transfer of timber licenses.</p>

<p class="BODY">To repeat, Eastern seeks relief in the court below <u>upon</u> a
deed of conveyance of a forest license eleven months and seven days after the
issuance thereof, and after its term has expired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is con­trary to the prohibition in
Forestry Administrative Order No. 21.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is illegal, Eastern acquired no rights <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eastern cannot compel <span class="SpellE">Kittilstvedt</span>
to comply with the terms of that contract.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For, there is no duty where the law forbids.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
And even if we concede that the transfer were valid, the same would not produce
any effect <u>until</u> and <u>unless</u> <u>approved</u> by the Director of
Forestry and the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources.</p>

<p class="BODY">And the suit below being one for specific performance of an
illegal conveyance will not prosper for lack of cause of action.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. Eastern may complain about its investment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are in no position to bring to the surface
what has actually transpired in the relations between Eastern and <span class="SpellE">Kittilstvedt</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
observe though that the consideration in shares of stock for P40,000 was purportedly
given on <st1:date year="1959" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Quite interesting to note is that there is in
the record a statement that the same shares of stock were transferred by <span class="SpellE">Kittilstvedt</span> to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Democrito</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>O.</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Plaza</st1:placetype></st1:place> on <st1:date year="1960" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1960</st1:date> in consideration of P40,000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet, surprisingly enough, the first
payment of P10,000 (on the P40,000) was made by <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Democrito</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>O.</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Plaza</st1:placetype></st1:place> on <st1:date year="1959" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1959</st1:date> in cash, which according to the
receipt signed by <span class="SpellE">Kittilstvedt</span> was for "partial
payment of the purchase price of my 400 shares of stock with the Eastern Timber
Corporation".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That payment to <span class="SpellE">Kittilstvedt</span> of P10,000, it thus appears, <u>preceded</u> <u>even</u>
the transfer of the license and the acquisition by <span class="SpellE">Kittilstvedt</span>
the stocks sold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not escaping our notice
also is the fact that for five years, Eastern made no Move to transfer to its
name <span class="SpellE">Kittilstvedt</span> license.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, by its own representations to the Bureau
of Forestry and to this Court, Eastern says that it spent "for the renewal
of the license such as application fees, license fees, forestry bonds and other
incidental expenses involved in the renewal of the O. T. License issued to <span class="SpellE">Kittilstvedt</span>".<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
It is a wonder, too, why, despite his clear majority in stockholdings, <span class="SpellE">Kittilstvedt</span> would complain of being shut off from <span class="SpellE">Eastern's</span> management, when he can easily dispose of the
other directors or whip them into line.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conduct observed by the parties but emphasizes the unique
relationship between <span class="SpellE">Kittilstvedt</span> and Eastern and the
latter's stockholders.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Those</u> <u>are</u> <u>matters</u> <u>that</u> <u>should</u> <u>first</u>
<u>be</u> <u>looked</u> <u>into</u> <u>by</u> <u>the</u> <u>Bureau</u> <u>of</u>
<u>Forestry</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the Bureau of
Forestry, on the basis of its findings of act, must first rule on whether or
not transfer license should be allowed, and its conclusions if favorable must
be approved by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>It is only after all these shall have happened
- and they have not that Eastern can lay claim, if any it has, to the transfer
of the license in its name.</p>

<p class="BODY">And again we say that Eastern has no cause of action.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. We now come to the jurisdictional issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The thrust of the <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>
sought by Eastern is that it be declared owner of the timber license now in the
name of Industrial, and that, in consequence, the transfer thereof; ay <span class="SpellE">Kittilstvedt</span> to Industrial be annulled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the question of whether or not Industrial's
timber license should be cancelled and a new one issue in <span class="SpellE">Eastern's</span>
name in lieu thereof is one, <u>upon</u> <u>the</u> <u>facts</u> <u>of</u> <u>record</u>,
beyond the reach of the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a
prerogative is vested Bureau of Forestry by Section 1816 of the Revised
administrative Code.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This <span class="SpellE">codal</span> provision reads:</p>

<blockquote>SEC. 1816. <u>Jurisdiction of Bureau of Forestry</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The Bureau of Forestry shall have
jurisdiction and authority over the demarcation, protection, manage­ment,
reproduction, reforestation, occupancy, and use of all public forests and
forest reserves and over the granting of licenses for game, and fish, and for
the taking of forest products, including stone and earth, <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>".</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A doctrine long recognized is that where the law confines in an
administrative office the power to determine particular questions or matters,
upon the facts to be presented, the jurisdiction of such office shall prevail
over the courts.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent Eastern had gone to the Bureau of Forestry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It withdrew its complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eastern may not go to the courts of justice
which have no jurisdiction in the first instance to approve the alleged
transfer and to direct the issuance of the license in favor of Eastern.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this stage, the jurisdiction of the court
may not be invoked.</p>

<p class="BODY">Absent a cause of action and the lower court's jurisdiction,
there was grave abuse of discretion in that court's refusal to dismiss the case
under review.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the reasons given, the petition for certiorari and prohi­bition
is hereby granted; the writ of preliminary injunction heretofore issued is made
permanent; and the respondent judge or whoever takes his place is hereby
directed to dismiss Civil Case 1087 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, entitled "Eastern Timber Corporation,
