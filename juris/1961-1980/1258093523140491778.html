				<H3>PHILIPPINE ENGINEER'S SYNDICATE, INC., PETITIONER, VS. FLORA S. MARTIN AND WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal by certiorari from a decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission 
awarding compensation or death benefits to claimant Flora S. Martin.<p></p>
<p>The facts are set forth in said decision, from which we quote:
</p><blockquote>
<p>"Aurelio Martin, the deceased husband of the claimant was employed by the 
respondent as a hatching plant operator at the Bi√±ga-Hydro Electric Project, at 
Tublay, Benguet, Mt. Province, on or about November, 1957, with an average 
weekly wage of P56.00. On December 2, 1957, at around 6:10 o'clock in the 
afternoon, the decedent, after coming from his work, was standing together with 
some other workers of the respondent at a certain point by the roadside near 
their place of work, waiting for the truck of the company that would convey them 
home. As the truck they were waiting for was approaching, the group signaled the 
driver to stop, but the latter did not heed their sign and continued on his way. 
As the service truck passed by, the decedent, with some others from the group 
ran after the truck, and upon overtaking it, attempted to ride on its platform. 
The decedent was able to cling at something at the right side of the truck and 
tried to leap into the platform, but in doing so, he slipped and fell to the 
ground and was ran over by the right rear wheel of the truck, causing his death. 
He was survived by his wife, the claimant herein and 2 minor children who were 
totally dependent upon him for support. Burial expenses in the amount of P200.00 
were paid by the respondent's insurance carrier. The respondent controverted the 
claim on time."</p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioner maintains: (1) that the injuries sustained in the accident, 
causing Martin's death, did not arise out of or in the course of his employment; 
and (2) that said injuries were due to his notorious negligence.</p>
<p>It appears, however, that the truck involved in the accident was a service 
truck of petitioner, furnished by the latter to convey its employees or workers 
back home from work. It is clear, therefore, that the accident arose out of or 
in the course of employment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * Off-promise injuries to or from work, in both liberal and narrow 
states, are compensable (1) if the employee is on the way to or from work in a 
vehicle owned or supplied by the employer, whether in a public (e.g., the 
employer's street car) or private conveyance. * * *." (Workmen's Compensation 
Laws by Horovitz, p. 162.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioner's allegation of notorious negligence on the part of Martin is 
predicated upon the fact that the service truck was in motion when he boarded 
it; but this fact, alone, is insufficient to justify the conclusion that he had 
been notoriously negligent. It does not appear that the truck was running at a 
great speed. On the contrary, the record shows that it was going up grade, thus 
suggesting that it must have been running slowly. Neither do the records show 
the conditions of the road or any other circumstance that may indicate clearly 
that the aforementioned laborers could not possibly or probably achieve their 
purpose. In fact, several men succeeded in boarding the truck in motion. Again, 
even if there had been some negligence on the part of the deceased, such 
negligence was not notorious in nature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Negligence to be a successful defense in a compensation case, must be more 
than simple or contributory. (Irineo Banaag vs. Virginia Tanghuping, et al., G. 
R. No. L-7209, December 2, 1953.)"</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *<br> </p>
<p>"Notorious negligence is something more than simple or contributory 
negligence. As a result, failure to avoid a known danger by a laborer engrossed 
in his work who momentarily forgets it is not negligence. Also, failure to 
exercise incessant vigilance in avoiding a known danger is not negligence. The 
reason for such holdings is the very obvious deduction that no man in his senses 
would deliberately court death. (Flores vs. Mindanao Lumber Co., G. R. No. 
43096, dated May 28, 1935.)"</p></blockquote>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against 
petitioner, Philippine Engineer's Syndicate, Inc. It is so ordered.</p> <i>Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, Paredes, 
Dizon,</i> and <i>De Leon, JJ., </i>concur. </div>
