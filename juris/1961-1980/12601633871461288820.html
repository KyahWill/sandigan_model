				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal by certiorari to review the decision of the respondent 
Workmen's Compensation Commission dated February 4, 1960, as well as its 
resolution <i>en banc</i> of April 12, 1960.
<p>From the records, it appears that on December 2, 1952, a claim for death 
benefits under the Workmen's Compensation Act (Act No. 3428, as amended) was 
filed by respondent Natalia Arguelles Vda. de Naval (for herself as widow of the 
deceased Fabian Naval, and for and in behalf of her 2 minor children with said 
deceased, namely, Elmer and Evelyn Naval) against the Dahican Lumber Company. 
When the claim was transmitted to the company, it elicited an answer to the 
effect that it (company) was denying liability for the death of Fabian Naval, on 
the ground that he (Naval) was laid off from the service on July 31, 1952 and, 
since he died on August 10, 1952, his "death occurred when there was no longer 
any employer-employee relation between him and the company."<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span></p>
<p>On November 5, 1953, Dahican Lumber Company informed respondent Commission 
that it was under receivership, and pointed to herein petitioner George H. Evans 
as the receiver duly appointed by the Court of First Instance of Manila in Civil 
Case No. 20987. Thereafter (or on April 22, May 5, and August 5, 1955), 
respondent Commission, acting: through Referee Patricio Dionisio, advised 
petitioner to take cognizance of the claim for compensation filed against the 
company by respondent Vda. de Naval.</p>
<p>On August 24, 1955, petitioner's counsel replied to the referee in a letter 
of this tenor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. Your letter of 5 August 1965 was referred to us by Mr. George H. Evans 
(herein petitioner), receiver of Dahican Lumber Company.</p>
<p>"2. It is respectfully suggested that hearing of this claim be had by your 
Office to determine the merit or lack of merit of this claim. If, after said 
hearing your Office finds this claim meritorious, and an award is decreed, such 
award will then be submitted to the Court for consideration with a view to it 
being consolidated with the claims of other persons and entities against the 
Dahican Lumber Company in the receivership proceedings.</p>
<p>"3. Please let us know of such action as you may decide to take in the 
premises."</p></blockquote>
<p>Acting upon this suggestion, the referee set the case for hearing on 
September 21, 1955, notice thereof having been sent to respondent Vda. de Naval 
and to petitioner's counsel. The scheduled hearing was, however, postponed, 
first to September 26, 1955, and then to October 7, 1955. On November 4, 1955, 
the referee issued an order (copy of which was received by petitioner on 
November 16, 1955) stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">"ORDER</p>
<p>"The parties in this case are hereby ordered to appear before the Public 
Defender at Daet, Camarines Norte when summoned by said official, to submit 
their respective evidence.</p>
<p>"Notify (1) Mrs. Natalia Arguelles Vda. de Naval c/o Joaquin Gosilater, Daet, 
Camarines Norte; (2) The Receiver Mr. George Evans [herein petitioner], 233 
David St., Manila; and (3) Baradi and Gallardo Law Offiee, 804-806 Wilson Bldg., 
Manila.</p>
<p>"SO ORDERED."</p></blockquote>
<p>Without notifying petitioner to appear before him, the Public Defender at 
Daet, on January 28 and 30, 1956, conducted a hearing of the case, pursuant to 
the abovequoted order of the referee. On April 25, 1956, the referee rendered a 
decision against Dahican Lumber Company, in favor of respondent Vda. de Naval, 
the dispositive part of which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS and considering further the fact 
that the allegations of the claimant widow (herein respondent Vda. de Naval) 
were corroborated by the foreman of the deceased and by a log-contractor of the 
Company (Dahican Lumber Company), there is no alternative but to consider this 
compensation case as, compensable.. It is hereby ordered, therefore, that the 
Company should be held responsible to the claimant widow and her children, by 
paying them the amount of 50 <i>per centum</i> of the deceased's regular weekly 
wages. Computing it for the whole period of 208 weeks, as provided by law, the 
dependents are entitled to P2,184.00, as compensation payable in lump sum, less 
the 8 <i>per centum</i> provided by Section 22 of Act 3428, as amended, or 
P2,009.28. The Company is also ordered to pay to the widow the amount of P200.00 
as burial expenses and to pay to this Commission the amount of P21.00, as 
provided by Section 55 of the Compensation Law, as amended.</p>
<p>"Let the parties concerned be served with a copy of this Decision for their 
information and guidance.</p>
<p>"SO ORDERED."</p></blockquote>
<p>From November 16, 1955, the date when petitioner received a copy of the 
aforequoted order (dated November 4, 1955) of the referee requiring the parties 
'to appear before the Public defender at Daet, Camarines Norte, when summoned by 
said official, to submit their respective evidence", until June 12, 1959 (a 
period of 3 years, 6 months, and 28 days), petitioner received no notice, order, 
or other communication from respondent Commission regarding the case. It was 
only on said date (June 12, 1959) that petitioner received the following letter 
dated June 4iÂ» 1959, from respondent Commission:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Our records do not reveal that the decision dated April 26, 1956 of the 
defunct Workmen's Compensation Commission in the above-entitled case requiring 
you to pay the claimant the amount of P2,209.28 has ever been complied with.</p>
<p>"In this connection, it is requested that said amount together With the sum 
of P21.00 fee as required by Section 55 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as 
amended, be remitted to this Office within ten (10) days from your receipt 
hereof, otherwise we shall much to our regret, issue a writ of execution to 
enforce the aforesaid decision.</p>
<p>"However, if direct payments have been made to the claimant, kindly submit to 
this Commission within the above-mentioned period corresponding proof thereof 
together with said fee."</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon receipt of said letter, petitioner's counsel, on June 13, 1959, wrote to 
respondent Commission the following letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. The Receiver, George H. Evans (herein petitioner), has referred to us 
your letter of 4 June 1959, wherein you referred to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'* * * the decision dated <i>April 26, 1956</i>, of the defunct Workmen's 
Compensation Commission in the above-entitled ease requiring you to pay the 
claimant the amount of P2,209.28 has ever been complied with.'</p></blockquote>
<p>and this is to advise (that) <i>we never received way notice of said alleged 
decision</i>.</p>
<p>"2. <i>The last notice we received in this case was dated 4 November</i> 1955 
and read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">'ORDER</p>
<p>'The parties in this case are hereby ordered to appear before the Public 
Defender at Daet, Camarines Norte when summoned by said official, to submit 
their respective evidence.</p>
<p>'Notify (1) Mrs. Natalia Arguelles Vda. de Naval, c/o Joaquin Gosilater, 
Daet, Camarines Norte; (2) The Receiver Mr. George Evans, 233 David St., Manila; 
and (3) Baradi and Gallardo Law Office, 804-806 Wilson Bldg., Manila.</p>
<p>'SO ORDERED.</p>

<p>"3. <i>No notice of trial or hearing was ever received and we repeat, no 
notice of the decision was ever served</i>.</p>
<p>"4. Please review the record and furnish us <i>proof</i> that (a) notice of 
trial or hearing was duly served and (b) notice of decision of 26 April 1956 was 
duly served. Without such <i>proof</i>, any trial or hearing and any decision, 
is null and void." (Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>On October 27, 1959, respondent Commission sent to petitioner's counsel, a 
letter of this tenor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In connection with your letter, informing us of the fact that you have not 
received a copy of the Decision dated April 25, 1956, rendered by the defunct 
Workmen's Compensation Commission on the above-entitled case, we are furnishing 
you herewith a true copy of the same."</p></blockquote>
<p>On November 4, 1959, petitioner filed with respondent Commission a petition 
for review of said decision of the referee (dated April 26, 1956), on the ground 
that it "is null and void and, therefore, contrary to law." On February 4, 1960, 
respondent Commission affirmed said decision of the referee, in a decision which 
in part reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In this case, we find that the employer has failed to establish his right to 
controvert the claim within the period required by law. It has also failed to 
answer any defenses which could be lawfully considered in his favor to defeat 
the claim. The mere allegation that at the time of death of the employee, he was 
no longer under its employ is totally inadequate. The proven fact is that the 
worker's illness was contracted in the course of his employment and by reason of 
his work long before the severance of the employer-employee relationship duo to 
circumstances not imputable to the fault of the employee. And, since the cause 
of action accrued at the time when the employer-employee relationship was still 
subsisting, the claim must, as it should, prosper. In this case, tfte facts show 
direct causal relation between the worker's illness and his employment, and the 
referee's decision is supported by both the evidence and the applicable law.</p>
<p>"WHEREFORE, the decision under review should be, .as it is hereby, affirmed 
and the respondent ordered to pay, in addition to what has been adjudged against 
it by the referee, the sum of P5.00 for this review.</p>
<p>"SO ORDERED."</p></blockquote>
<p>On March 8, 1960, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration of said 
decision, on the grounds that (1) it is contrary to law; (2) Dahican Lumber 
Company is in receivership proceedings, and cannot be reached by the Workmen's 
Compensation Commission except through the court having jurisdiction over said 
receivership; and "ail proceedings to date have been without due and proper 
notice to the court having jurisdiction and, therefore, are null and void. "Said 
motion for reconsideration was denied by respondent Commission in its resolution 
<i>en banc</i> of April 12, 1960. Hence, this appeal.</p>
<p>The appeal is meritorious. As already stated, since November 16, 1955, when 
petitioner received from the referee of respondent Commission, notice of order 
directing him "to appear before the Public Defender at Daet, Camarines Norte, 
<i>when summoned by said official</i>", to submit evidence in connection with 
respondent's Vda. de Naval's claim for compensation against the Dahican Lumber 
Company, of which he (petitioner) is the receiver, no notice or communication 
whatsoever has been received from the said Public Defender at Daet or the 
referee of the Cormmssion regarding the hearing of the case on January 28 and 
30, 1956 and the rendering of a decision thereon on April 25, 1956, awarding the 
sum of P2,209.28 as compensation to respondent Vda. de Naval. Neither copy nor 
notice of said decision of the referee was ever served on petitioner or his 
counsel. It was only on June 12, 1959 when petitioner received respondent 
Commission's letter dated June 4, 1959, requiring him to comply with the 
aforesaid decision of the referee of April 26, 1956 that petitioner, learned for 
the first time that the claim has been heard and decided. In the circumstances, 
petitioner was clearly deprived of his day in court. Consequently, all 
proceedings had by respondent Commission in connection with the case, are null 
and void and without any legal effect.</p>
<p>As to respondent Commission's claim that petitioner's failure to establish 
his right to controvert the claim within the period required under Section 45 of 
the Workmen's Compensation Act, namely, to submit a report of Naval's death 
within 14 days from date thereof, or within 10 days after acquiring knowledge of 
the same, resulted in the admission of liability for said claim, we note that 
Naval was laid off from the service of Dahiean Lumber Company on July 31, 1952. 
He died on August 10, 1952. Hence, the company was not in a position to know of 
the death of Naval. Besides, it occurred 10 days after the employerâemployee 
relationship between him and the company had been severed. In the circumstances, 
Dahican Lumber Company was not in law bound to submit the required report of 
Naval's death within the aforesaid period. On the other hand, the records shtow 
that when respondent Vda. de Naval's claim for compensation was transmitted to 
the company, the latter reasonably answered that it was not liable for the death 
of Fabian Naval, for the reason that he (Naval) was laid off from the service of 
the company on July 31, 1952 and, since he died on August 10, 1952, said death 
occurred when "there was no longer any employer-employee relationship" between 
him and the company. This, to our mind, constituted sufficient controversion of 
the claim in question by the company. Petitioner was thereafter, accordingly, 
entitled to be duly notified of all proceedings taken in connection with said 
claim.</p>
<p>Petitioner's claim that he could not be sued before the Workmen's 
Compensation Commission as receiver of Dahican Lumber Company, without first 
obtaining permission from the court (Court of First Instance of Manila in Civil 
Case No. 20967) having jurisdiction of the receivership proceedings is without 
merit since it was petitioner himself who, through his counsel, suggested (in 
his letter of August 24, 1955 quoted earlier in this opinion) that the claim be 
heard by the Commission for determination of its merits. Furthermore, under 
Section 7, Rule 61 of the Rules of Court, "subject to the control of the court 
in which the action is pending, a receiver shall have the power to bring and 
defend, as such, actions in his own name." (See Cahilo <i>vs</i>. De Guzman, et 
al., 106 Phil., 520; Somes <i>vs</i>. Government of P. I., 62 Phil., 432.)</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision and resolution of respondent Workmen's Compensation 
Commission appealed from are hereby set aside, and the case is remanded to 
respondent Commission for further proceedings after due notice to the parties. 
No costs. It is so ordered.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes,
