				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">This is an appeal taken by
defendants <span class="SpellE">Sencio</span> Gutierrez, Jose </span><span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dondo</span> Cabral, from a
decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, <span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">finding them guilty of the crime of murder, with
which they are charged, and sentencing each of them to life imprisonment, with
the accessory penalties provided by law, to indemnify, jointly and severally,
the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Liberato</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabuena</span>
in the sum of P6,000, and to pay the costs proportionately.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">It is not disputed that on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="29" month="12"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">December

</span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">Municipality</span></st1:placetype><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;"> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">Gandara</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">, </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">Province</span></st1:placetype><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;"> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">Samar</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">, multiple wounds which produced his death that
same evening, in consequence of the resulting internal hemorrhage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only issue in this case is the identity
of his killers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">It is not disputed that
earlier that evening, <span class="SpellE">Liberato</span> had taken</span> his
dinner in his house, in said barrio, together with his <span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">children, and <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> <span class="SpellE">Dequito</span>,
</span>Tito <span class="SpellE">Julaton</span> and <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mañoso</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
first to finish his meal was Tito <span class="SpellE">Julaton</span>, who
presently left the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No sooner had
he done so, however, than he met Ely <span class="SpellE">Colili</span>, <u>alias</u>
Elias <span class="SpellE">Colili</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, a fight ensued between them, in the course of which both were
wounded, although the injuries sustained by Ely were so serious that he was
left prostrate on an embankment near said house.</p>

<p class="BODY">It turns out that that evening, it about 8 o'clock, Ely, together
with herein defendants, <span class="SpellE">Sencio</span> Gutierrez, Jose <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dondo</span> Cabral - all of
them residents of the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Buenavista</span>, <span class="SpellE">Gandara</span>, <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> - had gone to the
house of <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span> <span class="SpellE">Versoza</span>,
about 80 meters away from that of <span class="SpellE">Liberato</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After drinking wine in <span class="SpellE">Ilde­fonso's</span>
house, Ely departed from the same, whereupon he seemingly met Tito, with the
result already adverted to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon, news
about their fight reached Ely's companions, defendants herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a conflict between the version of
the prosecution and that of the defense as to what transpired thereafter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the government at is to the effect that,
immediately after the encounter between Tito and Ely, the defendants, armed with
bolos, came to the place where Ely was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dondo</span> Cabral then held, as a torch, a small bottle with a
lighted wick.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants asked <span class="SpellE">Liberato</span> to help borrow a hammock, so that Ely could be
placed thereon and thus be brought to <span class="SpellE">Buenavista</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After <span class="SpellE">Liberato</span> had
gotten the hammock, he helped the defendants pick up Ely from the
aforementioned embankment and brought him to the yard of <span class="SpellE">Liberato's</span>
residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then <span class="SpellE">Liberato</span>
proceeded to tie both ends of said hammock to a bamboo pole, but, then, <span class="SpellE">Sencio</span> Gutierrez stabbed him on the back, followed by <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> who hacked him on the shoulder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Liberato</span> ran
away, defendants pursued and overtook him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, they attacked <span class="SpellE">Liberato</span> with their
respective bolos, thereby inflicting upon him the following injuries:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Penetrating wound
thru and thru on the center of the chest vertically to the right side of the
back 9-1/2 inches depth; 1-1/2 inches length; 1 inch width affecting the right <span class="SpellE">pectorales</span> major muscle, lower lobe of the right lung and
the right auricle of the heart.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two penetrating
wounds of the same dimensions in the abdomen in the <span class="SpellE">epigastric</span>
region 5-1/2 inches length; 4-1/2 inches width with transverse colon of the
large intestine protruding out of the wounds.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Penetrating wound
at the back 7-1/2 inches length; 3-1/2 inches width; 2 inches depth.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Penetrating wound
at the back 7-1/2 inches length; 1/2 inch width; 1 inch depth.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Penetrating wound
on the left shoulder 5-1/2 inches length; 2-1/2 inches width; 2-1/2 inches
depth.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Penetrating wound
on the right arm 1/2 inch width; 1 inch length; 1 inch depth.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Penetrating wound
in the left thigh 3 inches depth; 1-1/2 inches length; 1/2 inch depth.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"8.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Penetrating wound
in the frontal region 3 inches length; 1/2 inch width; 1/2 inch depth.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"9.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Penetrating wound
in the parietal region 2 inches length; 1 inch width; 1/4 inch depth.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"10.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wound in the left
forefinger 1 inch length; 1/4 inch width; 1/2 inch depth.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"11.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wound in the left
hand 1-1/2 inches length; 1/2 inch width.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“12.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wound in the left arm
2-1/2 inches length; 1 inch width; 1 inch depth."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, the defense would have us believe that,
instead of leaving <span class="SpellE">Versoza's</span> house, upon hearing that
Ely had been wounded, and trying to look for him, in order to find out what
they could do for him, <span class="SpellE">Versoza</span> closed his house,
possessed by fear, and the defendants remained therein for three (3) hours,
after which they returned to their respective homes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense, likewise, intimated that <span class="SpellE">Liberato</span> and Ely were wounded in the course of a free-for-all
fight between them and Tito <span class="SpellE">Julaton</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court rejected this version of the defense and accepted
that of the prosecution, and the record before us does not justify our
disturbing the conclusion thus reached by His Honor, the Trial Judge, who,
having observed the behavior of the witnesses, was in a far better position
than We are to pass upon their credibility.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the theory of the defense - based upon defendants
testimony, that of their host, <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span> <span class="SpellE">Versoza</span>, and one <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> <span class="SpellE">Villaescosa</span> - is inherently incredible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since Ely was, not only the defendants'
barrio mate, but, also, with them when they went to <span class="SpellE">Himay</span>,
shortly before the occurrence, it is only natural that they should
instinctively try to go to him, upon learning that he had been wounded, in
order to extend such assistance as was necessary and possible, to save his
life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the story given by the
witnesses for the prosecution is more in consonance with human nature and the
ordinary course of events.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, again, although sought to be given the semblance of an
alibi, the theory of the defense cannot properly be so characterized, for the
house of <span class="SpellE">Versoza</span> - where defendants claimed to be
when <span class="SpellE">Liberato</span> was mortally wounded and remained up to
three (3) hours later - was only a few meters away from the scene of the
occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, it was not
impossible for the defendants to have been physically in the place where <span class="SpellE">Liberato</span> was wounded and at the time when his injuries were
inflicted.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
As a matter of fact, <span class="SpellE">Versoza's</span> testimony, seeking to
bolster up defendants' contention, was discredited by defendant <span class="SpellE">Dondo</span> Cabral, who, furthermore, confirmed the version of
the prosecution witnesses to the effect that, holding a torch, he went to the
embankment where Ely was, seriously wounded, and then brought him home to the
barrio of <span class="SpellE">Buenavista</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Needless to say, the semi-alibi set up by the defense cannot
prevail over the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mañoso</span> and Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Tabuena</span>, who
positively identified the defendants herein as the persons who inflicted the
wounds sustained by <span class="SpellE">Liberato</span>, the number, location
and nature of which wounds fully corroborated the testimony of said witnesses
for the prosecution.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, the latter had every opportunity to recognize <span class="SpellE">Liberato's</span>
assailants, his injuries having been inflicted in their (<span class="SpellE">Liberato</span>,
Benjamin and <span class="SpellE">Prudencio's</span>) yard, where they were,
during a moonlit night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, <span class="SpellE">Dondo</span> Cabral carried a torch, thus making it easier for
Benjamin and <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> to recognize him and his
co-defendants, who were admittedly with him that evening.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mañoso</span> and Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Tabuena</span> were
a housemate and son, respectively, of the deceased does not suffice to
discredit them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, their
natural interest in securing the conviction of his killers would deter them
from implicating persons other than the culprits, for, otherwise, the latter
would thereby gain immunity.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon rendition of the decision appealed from, defendants filed a
motion to reopen the case for the purpose of introducing the testimony of Ely <span class="SpellE">Colili</span>, which the lower court denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is now pointed out as an error to
justify a reversal of said decision; but said motion was and is clearly
untenable, for Ely's testimony is concededly corroborative<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
and not newly discovered.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> In
fact, counsel for the defense in the lower court expressly <u>waived</u> the
introduction of said testimony upon the ground that it is merely cumulative in
nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the granting of a
new trial is addressed to the sound discretion of the lower court, which does
not appear to have abused it.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that <span class="SpellE">Liberato</span> sustained
several wounds, some of which were inflicted from behind and that he was, in
effect, attacked simultaneously by the defendants herein, all of them armed
with bolos, whereas <span class="SpellE">Liberato</span> had none, we agree with
the lower court that the defendants had acted with, at least, abuse of superior
strength, if not treachery-which, under the circumstances, would absorb the
abuse of superior strength - and that, accordingly, the crime committed is that
of murder.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
No modifying circumstance having attended its perpetration, the lower court
correctly imposed the prescribed penalty in its medium period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In line, however, with People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pantoja</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
the indemnity imposable upon the defendants should be increased from P6,000 to
P12,000.</p>

<p class="BODY">With this modification as to the indemnity, the decision appealed
from should, therefore, be, as it is hereby affirmed in all other respects,
with costs against the defendants-appellants, <span class="SpellE">Sencio</span>
Gutierrez, Jose <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dondo</span>
Cabral.</p>
