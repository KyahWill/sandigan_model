known as Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Alegarme</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The main evidence for the
prosecution consisted of </span><span style="">appel­lant'</span><span style="">s alleged confession, Exhibit D, and the
testimony of one </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Es</span><span style="">telita</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Canencia</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter said that, in the evening of
January 19, 1961, she and <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Alegarme</span>,
with a number of other </span><span style="">per­sons,
</span><span style="">attended the religious services
held in a chapel in <span class="SpellE">Dagohoy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dumalinao</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">connection with the town </span><span style="">fiesta </span><span style="">therein; that, after the aforementioned services, she, <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ale</span><span style="">garme</span></span><span style="">, his son, Felipe <span class="SpellE">Alegarme</span>,
one <span class="SpellE">Camila</span> or <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Alegar</span><span style="">me</span></span><span style="">, and four (4) other persons, proceeded to go home, </span><span style="">walking in </span><span style="">single file, with <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Alegarme</span>
at the head thereof, carrying lighted <span class="SpellE">Petromax</span> lamp;
that, as they reached a place where </span><span style="">there </span><span style="">were banana </span><span style="">groves or </span><span style="">clumps </span><span style="">of banana trees on the road </span><span style="">side, she </span><span style="">saw, in one of
said groves or </span>clumps, <span style="">two
persons, </span><span style="">whom </span><span style="">she recognized as defendants <span class="SpellE">Teotimo</span> and Adolfo <span class="SpellE">Alegarme</span>; </span><span style="">that </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Teotimo</span></span><span style=""> then had a gun aimed at <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>, whereas
Adolfo held </span><span style="">an </span><span style="">unsheathed bolo; that as the gun was fired, <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> fell down </span><span style="">slow­ly </span><span style="">to the ground;
that, thereupon, the other members of his group scampered away and sought
cover; that she, likewise, did so, </span><span style="">behind
</span><span style="">another banana grove, from which
she saw the defendants </span><span style="">ap­proach
</span><span style="">the prostrate body of </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Basilio</span></span><span style="">; </span><span style="">that Adolfo asked <span class="SpellE">Teotimo</span>
whether <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> was still alive or not; that <span class="SpellE">Teotimo</span> replied </span><span style="">in the </span><span style="">negative, </span><span style="">whereupon he and Adolfo went away; and that </span><span style="">there </span><span style="">was a </span><span style="">land conflict between <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alegarme</span>, on </span><span style="">the one </span><span style="">hand, and the </span><span style="">defendants, on the other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">His </span><span style="">Honor, the trial Judge found this testimony
unworthy </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">credence, because:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"After a perusal of the record, the Court finds <span style="">insincerity </span>in
the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Canencia</span>
– something not easily described, but readily recognized – <span style="">that carried conviction to the mind of the
court that she was not swearing to the truth.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus she testified </span>that the firing of the gun did not take place
until after one minute from the moment she saw the gun aimed at the deceased,
yet she failed to shout a warning to the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, she declared that the wife of <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>, the deceased, asked her on <st1:date year="1961" day="5" month="2">February 5, 1961</st1:date>, to narrate the incident;
however, she did not <span style="">execute </span>any
affidavit because she was not called for investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pressed to tell the truth, she affirm­ed that
she did not tell the wife of <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> about the
incident, but perhaps Felipe, the son of the deceased, did.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Realizing that her answers have placed the
cause of the prosecution, in a precarious position, she vain­ly attempted to
put a bright aspect of an otherwise dark situation by finally declaring that
she narrated the incident to the wife of <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> when
they met on <st1:date year="1961" day="5" month="2">February 5, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, asked whether she told the incident to
anybody else aside from the wife of <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>, she
declared that she did not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But conscious
of her falsehood, she rectified her answer by admitting with temerity that she
passed on the infor­mation to ones, Major <span class="SpellE">Alegarme</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These circum­stances show that the witness
was testifying with hesitation, labored and confused <span style="">explanations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her reticence in </span>revealing
the truth of the incident until the last hour on trial is indeed extra-ordinary
<span style="">and </span><span style="">labors </span>under grave suspicion <span style="">because if she <span style="">really had an intimate knowledge of the facts of the incident, </span></span><span style="">she could </span>have made a timely
revelation of what she saw and could have testified with that character of
singleness, certainty and clearness.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Moreover, Patrolman Arsenal as a <span style="">prosecu­</span>tion witness testified that Felipe, the son of the
deceased, who was with his father on the fateful night of January 19, 1961,
told him that the deceased was in company <span style="">with </span><span class="SpellE">Marcial</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Patrolman Arsenal further testified that he
included in his list of witnesses <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Canencia</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, Patrolman <span style="">Arsenal </span>has
not investigated <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span>, <span class="GramE">nor</span>
<span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Canencia</span> about
this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is interesting to note
that when this <span style="">case was </span>filed
on <st1:date year="1961" day="27" month="1">January 27, 1961</st1:date>, <span style="">the police authorities </span><span style="">a <span class="SpellE">D<span style="">umalinao</span></span></span> had no inkling that she will <span style="">be </span>a witness for<span style="">&nbsp; </span>prosecution because her name does not appear
in the list of witnesses <span style="">in the crim</span><span style="">inal </span><span style="">complaint.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Canencia</span> explained that her failure to reveal the incident
and <span style="">p</span>erpetrators of the crime to
the authorities was because she was not called for investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This pretension of <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Canencia</span> as to her failure to reveal the incident is
as <span style="">thin </span>as
the cobwebs to support the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
should be remembered that it was Felipe, the son of the deceased, who supplied
Patrolman Arsenal with the names of the companions of his father that night of <st1:date year="1961" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Patrolman Arsenal went to the scene of crime
in the morning of <st1:date year="1961" day="20" month="1">January 20, 1961</st1:date>,
and conducted an investi­gation but nobody could shed light to the commission
of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it is true as testified
by <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> that she was together with the deceased
that night of <st1:date year="1961" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1961</st1:date>,
and she was included in the list of Patrolman Ar­<span style="">senal </span>as one of the witnesses, then why was she not investigated,
nor was she listed in the criminal complaint as one of the prosecution
witnesses?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For an answer, the record is
very revealing on the point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Felipe, the
son of the deceased, who furnished the police with the names of the companions
of his father, subscribed to his affidavit before the.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justice of the Peace on <st1:date year="1961" day="27" month="1">January 27, 1961</st1:date>, exactly a week after the
incident in question and Felipe must have had ample time to reflect and re­call
the companion of his father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Felipe,
however, mentioned only seven persons including himself as the companions of
his father and <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Canencia</span>
was not one of them (Exhibit 2).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
wonder <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Canencia</span>
could not consistently testify, as to whether or not she narrated the incident
to the wife of <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>, nor could <span style="">she </span>have informed the police of the
perpetrators of the crime, because as the Court finds, she was not in the group
that accompanied the deceased in going home from the chapel that fateful night
of January 19, 1961.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Furthermore, the records show that one, Capt. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Alegarme</span></span><span style=""> an u</span>ncle of the herein accused, has
another brother, who is the husband of <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Canencia</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated
otherwise, <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Canencia</span>
is the sister-in-law of Capt. <span class="SpellE">Alegarme</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused Adolfo <span class="SpellE">Alegarme</span>
testi­fied that h believed Capt. <span class="SpellE">Alegarme</span> is behind
this case because there are land conflicts between Capt. <span class="SpellE">Alegar­me</span>
and his<span style=""> </span>(<span class="SpellE">accused's</span>)
father and between Capt. <span class="SpellE">Ale­garme</span> and <span class="SpellE">Teotimo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records
further reveal that when the accused brothers were brought before the <span style="">chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Dumalinao</span>,
the Chief of Police nodded his head and remarked: 'So you are here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was inform­ed by Capt. <span class="SpellE">Alegarme</span>
that you pretended to be tough guys of your locality.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Canencia</span> when ask­ed if she revealed her knowledge of the
incident to any­body aside from the wife of the <span class="GramE">deceased,</span>
declared that she also informed Capt. <span class="SpellE">Alegarme</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is interesting to note in this connection
that as insinuated by the defense, Capt. <span class="SpellE">Alegarme</span> has
always been together with the pro­secution witnesses and present when this case
was call­ed for trial on various occasions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And while Capt. <span class="SpellE">Ale­garme</span> as a rebuttal
witness explained that his interest in the case was to secure justice, the
deceased being his nephew, all of the foregoing circumstances taken to­gether
as a whole tend to, confirm the testimony of the accused, Adolfo <span class="SpellE">Alegarme</span> that his uncle, Capt. <span class="SpellE">Alegarme</span>,
is behind his being prosecuted in this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From the foregoing circumstances and, the fact that <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Canencia</span> is not only the sister-in-law but a tenant
as well of Capt. <span class="SpellE">Alegarme</span>, who appears to have an
unusual interest in the case, it is evident that </span><span style="">she </span><span style="">has an incentive to
exaggerate or give false color to her testimony to please her brother-in-law
and landlord.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as the facts,
disclose, she has, borrowing the words of a learned authority, 'a disposition
to see and report matters as they are wished for rather than as they are.' <span class="GramE">(11 </span></span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE"><span style="">Moore</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE"><span style=""> on Facts, 1225).</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court, there­fore, is of the opinion that <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Canencia</span> is a bias­ed witness." <span class="GramE">(pp.
134-138, rec.).</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the other hand,
appellant repudiated his alleged </span><span style="">confes</span><span style="">sion, Exhibit D, alleging that it had been
secured through duress, in addition to setting up an alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He, Adolfo <span class="SpellE">Alegarme</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Dioscoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Alagenio</span> and
Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Pial</span> testified that the four (4) of them,
together with Adolfo's wife and their child had spent the evening of January </span><span style="">19</span><span style="">,
to 20, </span>1961, <span style="">in the house of
Adolfo, who had asked their help </span><span style="">because
</span><span style="">said child was very ill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants further testified that, upon
learning, the next morning, about <span class="SpellE">Basilio's</span> death,
Adolfo conveyed the </span>news <span style="">to his
sister, who, in turn, relayed it to appellant herein, </span>and <span style="">then the three (3) of them proceeded to the
scene of the crime, </span>where <span style="">they
found Patrolman Arsenal and many people around <span class="SpellE">Basilio's</span>
</span>body <span style="">that Arsenal said he would
help them locate the killer, and then </span>brought <span style="">them to the <span class="SpellE"><u>poblacion</u></span>, where, upon
seeing the defendants, the </span>Chief of Police, <span class="SpellE">Eutiquio</span>
<span style="">S. </span><span class="SpellE">Codilla</span>,
remarked: "So you are here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
informed by Captain <span class="SpellE">Alegarme</span> that you pretended to be
tough guys of this locality;" that as Arsenal and Adolfo left the place to
buy something, there was a commotion in the place where appel­lant had been
left; that when Adolfo and Arsenal returned thereto, <span class="SpellE">Codilla</span>
was beating up appellant, who had bruises and contusions on his face; that <span class="SpellE">Codilla</span> continued manhandling appellant, where­as Arsenal
proceeded to box him; that <span class="SpellE">Codilla</span>, likewise, pulled
Adolfo by the left hand and boxed him on the left eye; that, then, defendants
were detained in the municipal jail, where <span class="SpellE">Codilla</span>
warned them he would kill them should they not admit their guilt; that, later
on, appellant was brought to the office of <span class="SpellE">Codilla</span>,
who produced the <span style="">statement, Exhibit D,
already typewritten, in English; that, without translating its contents into
the native dialect, <span class="SpellE">CodilIa</span> </span>bade him to sign
it, if he wanted to be spared of further maltreatment; that appellant obeyed
because his whole body was already aching; and that, when he was brought to
Justice of the Peace, <span class="SpellE">Inocentes</span> L. Fernandez,
appellant refused to sign Exhibit D.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the lower court did not believe the evidence in sup­port
of the defendants' contention, it <span style="">has
been established, </span>through the testimony of said Judge Fernandez, that
appellant was brought before him by <span class="SpellE">Codilla</span>, so that
he (appellant) may swear to the truth of the contents of Exhibit D; that as
said officer proceeded to read Exhibit D and translated its contents into the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> dialect, h<span style="">e
</span>noticed that there was, at the foot thereof, a signature; that since the
same had to be affixed in his presence, Judge Fernandez cross­ed out said
signature, and then bade appellant to sign the document; and that, appellant
replied he would "think it over," and, hence, <span style="">the </span>Judge wrote, on the lower left margin of <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
D, the words "accused not willing to sign in my presence" and then
placed his initials <span style="">thereon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This notwithstanding, His Honor, the trial Judge, convicted <span style="">appellant herein upon the theory that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>the confession of the accused, as affirm­ed
by Patrolman Arsenal, Chief of Police <span class="SpellE">Codilla</span> and by
a witness for the defense, Justice of the Peace Fernandez, which, as the Court
finds was not vitiated by co­ercion, is confirmed by the undisputed facts of
record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the corpus <span class="SpellE">delicti</span> has <span style="">been </span>fully
established can not be denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The death
of the victim, <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ale­garme</span>,
is admitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition thereto, the
Court finds grave and conclusive circumstantial evidence, based upon proven
facts, such as the land conflict between the accused and Pablo <span class="SpellE">Diano</span>, wherein the deceased was a witness in favor of <span class="SpellE">Diano</span>; the repeat­ed intimation of accused <span class="SpellE">Teotimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Alegarme</span> to <span class="SpellE">Generose</span> <span class="SpellE">Diano</span>, wife of Pablo <span class="SpellE">Diano</span>, that he will chop to pieces his brother, <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>; the information given by the accused to Patrolman
Arsenal that his shotgun (<span class="SpellE">paliuntod</span>) used in the
killing of his brother was hid­den by the cliff and his wife knew where it
could be found; the fact that his wife got the shotgun from where it was hidden
and surrendered the same to Patrolman Arsenal upon demand; and that while
accused <span class="SpellE">Teotimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Alegarme</span>
denied having given such information to Patrolman Arsenal about his wife
knowing where the shotgun was kept, accused failed to deny ownership of the gun
in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While these circumstances
standing alone by themselves may be insufficient to convict the accused <span class="SpellE">Teotimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Alegarme</span> of the crime of
murder; however, they certainly do serve to embark the question of his
innocence with uncertainty and suspicion, and when taken in connection with his
confession, positively inspire be­lief in the truth of said confession and is,
therefore, sufficient to warrant the conviction of the accused <span class="SpellE">Teotimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Alegarme</span> of the crime
herein charged."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, Arsenal testified that, while he was
investigating the occurrence, at the scene of the crime, on January 20, 1961,
at about 8:30 a.m., the defendants arrived, accompanied by a woman; that
defendants, who were then crying, inquired about the identity of the killer;
that Adolfo was then brandishing a bolo whereas appellant had a bolo tucked in
his waist; that Arsenal bade them to throw their <span class="SpellE">boloes</span>
away, and defendants obeyed that when Arsenal invited them to come with him to
the municipal building, they gladly did so ; that the three (3) of them
proceeded to the boarding house or restaurant in which <span class="SpellE">Codilla</span>
stayed where they had their dinner; that, thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Codilla</span>
bade Arsenal to buy cigarettes, bringing Adolfo <span class="SpellE">Alegarme</span>
with him which Arsenal did; that upon his return, together with Adolfo <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Alegarme</span></span><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Codilla</span> </span>told
them that <span class="SpellE">apellant</span> had confessed hi<span style="">s </span>guilt; that Arsenal then patted
appellant on the shoulder and in­quired of him why he had not admitted his
guilt at the scene of <span style="">the occurrence;
that appellant explained that he was ashamed </span>to <span style="">confess in the presence of other people; that appellant further
confided that he had hid the gun, with which <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>
had been killed, in a thickly wooded place near his (appellant's) house, known
to his wife; that, subsequently, Arsenal went to appellant' s house and bade
his wife to produce the gun; that, there­upon, appellant's wife went out and
returned later with a box containing a dismantled shot gun, Exhibit A, which
was later as­sembled by the police.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Codilla</span>, in turn, said, that, when
Arsenal and Adolfo <span class="SpellE">Ale­garme</span> left to buy cigarettes,
he (<span class="SpellE">Codilla</span>) asked appellant why he <span style="">had killed his </span>brother <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>; that, thereupon, appellant cried and then answered
that he "could no longer endure," because he had "already spent
a lot of money" in his suit against <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>, who
had "squatted our land;" that, upon the return of Arsenal and Adolfo <span class="SpellE">Alegarme</span>, he (<span class="SpellE">Codilla</span>) bade
Arsenal to place the de­fendants under detention, in jail; and that the next
day, he (<span class="SpellE">Co­dilla</span>) took appellant's statement Exhibit
D.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Codilla</span> and Arsenal
are of doubtful veracity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the
prosecution, in the lower court, would have us believe that, upon the departure
of Arsenal and Adolfo <span class="SpellE">Alegarme</span>, to buy cigarettes,
and without any preliminary steps or questions, <span class="SpellE">Codilla</span>
asked appellant, point blank, why he had killed <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alegarme</span>, and that appellant, in turn, readily
admitted that he had done so because he "could no longer en­dure"
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To say the least, this is
unnatural.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, it is
inconsistent with several facts established by the very pro­secution, namely:
1) that defendants went to the scene of the oc­currence, while policeman
Arsenal was investigating the same; 2) <span style="">that
</span>defendants were then crying and armed with <span class="SpellE">boloes</span>,
at the same time inquiring about the identity of their brother's as<span style="">sassin; 3) that Arsenal evidently felt that
defendants were so ex­cited and bent on avenging the death of their brother
that he deem­ed it best to disarm them; and 4) that defendants were, in
Arsenal' s own words, </span><u><span style="">glad</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">to
go with him to the municipal building, where further investigations were
supposed to be conducted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although, each
one of these circumstances, when considered singly and in­dependently of the
others, could possibly be of <span class="SpellE">artificious</span> nature and <span class="GramE">be</span> compatible with a guilty conscience, they strongly
suggest </span>the <span style="">contrary, when put
together and considered collectively.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">If at all, the one direct <span class="GramE">question,</span>
allegedly propounded by <span class="SpellE">Codilla</span> to appellant –
without any <span style="">feelers or preliminaries, </span>and
<u><span style="">without any evidence whatsoever, at
that time</span></u><span style="">, that he had </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">commi</span><span style="">ted</span></span><span style=""> the crime charged – as to why he had killed <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>,
</span><span style="">sug­gests </span><span style="">that <span class="SpellE">Codilla</span> had,
seemingly, prejudged appellant guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">This </span><span style="">is corroborated by the fact that <span class="SpellE">Codilla</span> had
ordered Arsenal to take Adolfo with him, on the pretext of buying cigarettes, </span><span style="">for the now </span><span style="">obvious purpose to be, alone with appellant, so that nobody – except <span class="SpellE">Codilla</span> and appellant can now testify on how he (appellant)
had been "persuaded" to make his alleged confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It </span><span style="">may </span><span style="">not be amiss to
point, out that the litigation, between the deceased and the defendants,
concerning a land, had been decided <u>before</u> </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">occurrence </span><u><span style="">in favor</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">of
the</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">latter, who, accordingly, had no reason </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">take the law into their hands.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's alleged shotgun, Exhibit A, does not suffice <span style="">to </span>justify the decision appealed from,
there being no competent <span style="">evi­dence </span>that
the cartridge found at, the scene of the crime and <span style="">the </span>shots that had killed <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> had
come from said firearm, the only evidence connecting the latter with the former
being the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span>, which admittedly is
incredible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the de­fense,
particularly, appellant's wife, denied <span style="">that </span>she had delivered <span style="">to </span>Arsenal said <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Exh</span></span><span style="">. <span class="GramE">A, <span style="">which, by the way, is a home-made </span><span style="">dis­mantled </span><span style="">shotgun.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At any rate, the </span><span style="">circumstances
surrounding the </span><span style="">case mani­festly
preclude a finding of appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, based upon the same evidence, the
lower court acquitted Adolfo <span class="SpellE">Alegarme</span>, and the brief
for the prosecution </span><span style="">frank­ly </span><span style="">admits "that the evidence for the
prosecution failed to produce (the) moral certainty" necessary to convict
appellant herein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b style=""><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, as recommended by the Solicitor General, </span>the decision appealed
from should be, as it is hereby, reversed, <span style="">and </span>the <span style="">case </span>against appellant <span class="SpellE">Teotimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Alegarme</span>, accordingly, dis­missed, with costs <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.</p>
