of the decision of the respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Commission
setting aside the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Section, Regional
Office No. 4, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> awarding to
petitioner the sum of P6,000.00 for his disability benefits and the sum of
P61.00 as decisional fees pursuant to Section 55 of the Workmen's Compensation
Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Antonio <span class="SpellE">Gallemit</span> was first
employed with the respondent Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(Board of Liquidators) on <st1:date year="1955" day="30" month="6">June 30,
 1955</st1:date> as clerk-helper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From
said position he was promoted to typist-clerk I, bookkeeper and Accountant I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the course of his employment with
respondent Republic (Board of Liquidators), he was afflicted with <span class="SpellE">monary</span> tuberculosis which constrained him to apply for
frequent sick leaves until such time that his rapidly deteriorating health
forced him to retire on <st1:date year="1972" day="15" month="9">September 15,
 1972</st1:date> at the age of 51 years old.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His physician, Dr. Magdalena Reyes diagnosed his illness as moderately
advanced PTB.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His salary when he retired
was P494.00 a month.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1974</st1:date>
petitioner filed a claim for compensation benefits with the Workmen's
Compensation Section, Regional Office No. 4 (W.C.C. Case No. R04 150223).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim was set for hearing and based on
the evidence presented, the hearing officer of the Regional Office rendered a
decision on <st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1975</st1:date>
ordering the respondent Republic (Board of Liquidators) to pay petitioner the
sum of P6,000.00 as disability benefits and the sum of P61.00 as administrative
fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General did not move
to reconsider the decision of the hearing officer of the Regional Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact on <st1:date year="1975" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1975</st1:date>, the Assistant Solicitor General
recommended payment of the disability benefits to petitioner as ordered in the
aforesaid decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Later on <st1:date year="1975" day="10" month="12">December 10,
 1975</st1:date>, the Office of the Solicitor General filed a Petition for
Relief from Judgment stating that since the Office of the Solicitor General was
not furnished a copy of the Notice of Sickness and Claim for Compensation, the
Regional Office did not acquire jurisdiction over the respondent Republic
(Board of Liquidators).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It therefore
prayed that the decision of the Regional Office <span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1975</st1:date>
be set aside for having been rendered without jurisdiction properly acquired
over the respondent Republic (Board of Liquidators).</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 19, 1976, a decision of the respondent Commission was
rendered setting aside the decision of the Regional Office of October 14, 1975
and dismissing the claim of petitioner on the ground that the Notice of
Sickness and Claim for Compensation filed with the Regional Office was not
transmitted to the Board of Liquidators and to the Office of the Solicitor
General.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the ruling of the respondent Commission,
petitioner has come to this Court raising the issue as to whether or not the
respondent Commission has committed a grave abuse of discretion in dismissing
the claim of petitioner for alleged lack of jurisdiction due to the failure of
the Regional Office to transmit to the respondent Board of Liquidators a copy
of the Notice of Sickness and Claim for Compensation and to furnish the
Solicitor General a copy of the said Notice of Sickness and Claim for
Compensation.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that under Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation
Act<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
it is required that the Notice of Sickness and Claim for Compensation be given
to the employer but according to Section 27 of the same Act,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
there is already sufficient notice so as not to bar the proceeding even if
there was a failure or delay in giving such notice to the employer provided it
is shown that the employer, his agent or representative had knowledge of the
illness of the employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case
before Us, there can be no dispute that the respondent has knowledge of the
illness of the petitioner or that it was fully aware of the poor condition of
his health, because for several times petitioner had applied for sick leaves
due to illness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, when the head
of the respondent office acted on his application for sick leaves, he must have
been duly informed, and therefore, has knowledge of the illness of the
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is here, no doubt,
sufficient compliance with the requirements of Section 27 of the Workmen's
Compensation Act regarding the giving of Notice of Sickness and Claim for
Compensation to the employer.</p>

<p class="BODY">But what is objected to is the fact that the Regional Office with
whom petitioner has filed his claim for compensation did not furnish a copy of
the Notice of Claim to the respondent Republic (Board of Liquidators).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will be noted from Section 1, Rule 8 of
the Rules of the Workmen's Compensation Commission that: -</p>

<blockquote>"Upon the filing of the claim, the unit shall immediately
transmit a copy thereof by personal delivery or by registered mail to the
employer who shall in a letter of transmittal be required to submit within ten
(10) days from notice, the report of the accident or illness of the claimant
employee or the deceased laborer, if no such report has as yet been submitted
in accordance with the provisions of Sections 37 and 47 of the Act."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Then pursuant to a circular issued by the
Workmen's Compensation Commission on January 22, 1973, it is so provided that
"In all claims for compensation against the Republic of the Philippines,
the Chief of the Workmen's Compensation Section or Unit shall see to it that a
copy of the Notice and Claim for Compensation is transmitted to the Office of
the Solicitor General in his capacity as counsel for the National Government
even if the claim is <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Violation of this mandatory requirement may
subject the offices to administrative action as hinted in the case of Republic
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(Department of Justice vs. WCC &amp; <span class="SpellE">Cleofe</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Azaña</span>, G.R. No. 29019, May 18, 1972). From the wordings of
both Section 1, Rule <span style="">8 </span>of the
Workmen's Compensation Commission and its Circular of <st1:date year="1973" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1973</st1:date>, what is required is that a copy
of the Notice of Sickness and Claim for Compensation be sent to the Solicitor
General by the Unit or Section.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It s
doubted whether the failure of the Unit or Section to comply with this
requirement will render its decision invalid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At most, it will subject the head of the unit or section to
administrative action but it can't nullify its decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To hold that failure to send a copy of the
Notice of Sickness and Claim for Compensation to the Solicitor General will
render the decision of the Regional Office null and void, will place the
laborer at a disadvantage contrary to the avowed objectives of Act 3428, as
amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As held in the <span class="SpellE">Azaña</span> case, disregard by the officer concerned of the
provisions of law governing the transmittal of claims against the government shall
not prejudice the claimant worker or employee.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, the judgment of the respondent

Sec. 24. <u><span style="">Notice of the injury and
claim for compensation</span></u><span style="">. - </span>No
Compensation proceeding under this Act shall prosper unless the employer has
been given notice of the injury as soon as possible after the same was
received, and unless a claim for compensation was made not later than two
months after the date of the injury, or in case of death, not later than three
months after death, regardless of whether or not compensation was claimed by
the employee himself. Such notice may be given and such claim made by any
person considering himself entitled to the compensation or by any other person
in his behalf. In case medical, surgical and hospital services and supplies
have been furnished voluntarily by the employer, notice of the injury within
the time limit above mentioned shall not be necessary, and if the employer has
voluntarily made the compensation payments, the claim for compensation to be
made within the time limits above established shall no longer be necessary.</p>
