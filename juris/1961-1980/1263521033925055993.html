				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of Tax Appeals in
C.T.A. Case No. 1105 sentencing petitioner to pay respondent Commissioner of
Internal Revenue or his authorized representative the sum of P78<span class="GramE">,670.55</span> <span style="">as defi</span>ciency
franchise tax and surcharge.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The material facts </span>are
not disputed, the case having been submitted for decision on <span style="">the pleadings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">According to the record, petitioner, a holder of a legislative
franchise (Act No. 2701) authorizing it to operate and maintain an electric
light, <span style="">heat and </span>power system in
the City of <span class="SpellE">Dumeguete</span>, Oriental <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>,
realized more than two million pesos as gross receipts from the op­eration of
its electrical plant during the period from April 1, 1952 to December 31, 1959,
having paid thereon the 2% franchise tax prescribed in its <span style="">franchise (Section 8 </span>of Act 2701)
instead of the 5% franchise tax prescribed in Section 259 of the National
Internal Revenue Code, as amend­ed by Republic Act 418. Accordingly, on <st1:date year="1960" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1960</st1:date>, the respondent
Commissioner assessed and demanded from peti­tioner the payment of the sum of
P62<span class="GramE">,936.44</span> as deficiency franchise tax, plus the sum
of P15,734.11 as 26% surcharge, <span style="">or a
total sum of P78,670.55. Upon denial of petitioner's request far a
reconsideration of the assessment it inter­posed an appeal to the Court of Tax
Appeals where, as already stated, the parties submitted the case for deci­sion
on the pleadings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter the Court
of Tax Appeals rendered the appealed decision, and subsequently also denied the
motion for reconsideration seasonably filed by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner contends (First Assign­ment of
Error) that the Court of Tax Appeals erred in holding that it should pay the 5%
franchise tax prescribed in Section 259 of the National Internal Revenue Code
in­stead of the 2% tax provided for in its franchise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is its contention in this connection that
our ruling in <span class="SpellE">Hoa</span> <span class="SpellE">Hin</span> Co.,
Inc. (G.R. Nos. L-9616 and L-11783, May 25, 1959) and <span class="SpellE">Lealda</span>
Electric Co., Inc. (G.R. L-16428, April 30, 1963) does not apply to the instant
case because its franchise is different from the franchises of the taxpayers
involved in said cases.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We find petitioner's contention to be without merit, it appearing
that the provisions concerning the imposition and collection of taxes contained
<span class="GramE">in</span> the franchises in­volved in the two cases mentioned
above and in the present case are substantially the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 7 of Act No. 1256 (<span class="SpellE">Hoa</span> <span class="SpellE">Hin</span> Franchise) pro­vides:</p>

<blockquote>"The grantee of this license, his lessees, grantees, or
successors in interest, shall pay annually to the Government of the Philippine
Islands one-half of one per centum per annum of the gross receipts derived from
the operation of said slipway or ma­rine railway from and after the date of the
acceptance or this license.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said payment
shall be made in the fifteenth day of Jan­uary of each and every year for the
year preceding and any accredited officer of the Insular Government shall, upon
demand, have the right to examine and inspect the books of the grantee, his
successors or assigns, for the purpose of ascertaining the gross receipts of
the said slipway or marine railway for any year; but nothing in this section
shall be construed to interfere with the rights of the municipal, provin­cial
or Insular Government to assess taxes upon the land in question or improvements
thereon, nor shall it affect the right of <span style="">the
Government to assess and collect any business or income tax on his
business." <span class="GramE">(Italics ours.)."</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is obvious that the section of the law quoted above does not
contain any provision to the effect that the franchise tax imposed upon the
grantee shall be "in lieu of all taxes of every name and nature –
municipal, provincial or central –, upon its capital stock, franchise, right of
way, earnings, and all other property owned or operated by the grantee under
this concession or franchise." For this reason, <span class="GramE">We</span>
ruled that the franchise holder <span class="SpellE">Hoa</span> <span class="SpellE">Hin</span> was subject to the higher rate of franchise tax
prescribed in Section 259 of the Tax Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Stating the reasons in support of our ruling, <span class="GramE">We</span>
said:</p>

<blockquote>"While the then Philippine Commission fixed the yearly tax to
be paid to the Govern­ment by the original grantee, his successor and assigns
at the rate of 1/2 of 1% of the gross earnings derived from the operation of
the slipway or marine railway, the grantor reserved its right to assess and
collect other business or income tax on the grantees' business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 259 of the National Inter­nal Revenue
Code, as amended, provides that 'whichever is higher between the rate im­posed
by the special charter of the grantee and the National Internal Revenue Code,
shall apply to and be imposed upon, and paid by, the grantee of the
franchise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rate imposed by Section
259 of the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended, being higher than that
imposed in the petitioner's charter, Act No. 1256, <span class="GramE">the</span>
petitioner has to pay the rate imposed by Section 259 of the National Inter­nal
Revenue Code, as amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The rule in Manila Railroad Company v. Rafferty, 40 Phil. 224;
Philippine Railway Company v. Collector of Internal Revenue, G.R. No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-3859, </span><st1:date year="1952" day="25" month="3"><span class="GramE">25 March 1952</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">; <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> Electric Company v. David, <span style="">49 Off.</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Gaz</span></span><span class="GramE">. 1385; and <span class="SpellE">Carcar</span> Electric and Ice Plant v. Collector of Internal
Revenue, 53 Off.</span> <span class="SpellE">Gaz</span>. 1068, cannot be invoked
by the petitioner, because in the grantee's respective franchises there is a
provision that 'Such annual payments, when promptly and fully made by the
grantee shall be in lieu of all taxes of every name </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">nature-- municipal, provincial or central —<span class="GramE">,upon</span>
its capital stock, franchise, right of way, earnings, and all other property
owned or oper­ated by the grantee under this concession or franchise.' The
petitioner's franchise, Act No. 1256, does not embody such exemption
clause." <span class="GramE">(Italics ours.)."</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the <span class="SpellE">Lealda</span> case, the relevant
provision of the taxpayer's franchise (Act No. 2475) reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">Entendiendose</span>, <span class="SpellE">que</span> en <span class="SpellE">consideracion</span> del <span class="SpellE">privilegio</span> <span class="SpellE">concedido</span> <span class="SpellE">por</span> <span class="SpellE">Ia</span>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's franchise does not, as the franchises involved in
Has <span class="SpellE">Hin</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lealda</span> did not,
contain any provi­sion to the effect that the payment of the franchise tax
therein prescribed shall be "in lieu of all taxes of every name and nature
— municipal, provincial or central —, upon its capital stock, franchise, right
of way, earnings, and all other property owned or operated by the grantee under
this concession or franchise," The absence of such provi­sion clearly
indicates - as We held in the two cases men­tioned heretofore - that
petitioner's franchise is not a bar to the imposition of a higher rate of
franchise tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, Section 259
of the Tax Code which applies to franchises existing at the time of its
enactment as well as to future <span class="GramE">franchises,</span> <span style="">should apply to petitioner herein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's second contention is that the Court of Tax Appeals
erred in holding that petitioner's franchise was deemed amended by Section 259
of the Tax Code, said franchise being in the <span style="">nature </span>of a contract between the State and the franchise holder.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is enough to say in this connection that peti­tioner's
franchise (Article 11, Act No. 2701) allows amendments or even repeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner and its predecessor in interest,
the original grantee "La Electra" were fully aware of and accepted
this condition, and have no reason <span style="">to
complain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's last contention is that the Court of Tax Appeals
erred in requiring it to pay deficiency taxes, with penalties, for the years
already barred by prescrip­tion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the facts disclosed by the record, this point merits no
extensive discussion as it appears that peti­tioner did not raise the defense
of prescription neither in the Bureau of Internal Revenue, nor in the Court of
Tax Appeals, nor in the petition for review filed in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the settled law in this jurisdiction
that prescription as a defense is deemed waived if not seasonably raised
(Section 2, Rule 9, Rules of Court; Republic of the Philippines vs. <span class="SpellE">Mambulao</span> Lumber Company, et al., G.R. No. L-18942, <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="11">November 30, 1962</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's contention that the defense of prescription assumed
a subsidiary and alternative role because of the prayer for general relief made
in its petition for review in <span style="">the Court
</span>of Tax Appeals is, likewise, without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well known is the rule that the prayer for
relief made in a pleading (complaint or petition for review) does not form part
of the body thereof where the ultimate facts constituting the cause <span style="">of action or </span>defense must be set
forth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only legal effect of a prayer
for general <span style="">relief is to authorize the </span>court,
upon rendering <span class="GramE">judgment,</span> to grant such relief as may
be justified by the pleadings and the evidence, although such relief was not
one of those <span style="">specifically </span>prayed
for in the winning party's affirmative pleading.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from being in accordance
with law, the same is hereby affirmed, <span style="">with
</span>costs.</p>
