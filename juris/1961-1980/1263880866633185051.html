				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In 1966 the Court of Agrarian Relations at <st1:place><st1:placename>Angeles</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> rendered a judgment sustaining
the right of Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>, Jose <span class="SpellE">Lansangan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Godofredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Paguio</span>, Lucia Garcia and <span class="SpellE">Horacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bundoc</span> to a reduction of rentals (CAR Case No. 62-P '65)
and to a <span class="SpellE">reliquidation</span> of the <span class="SpellE">palay</span>
harvests from the <st1:place><st1:placetype>land</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Jose
  L. C. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals affirmed that decision but required the
Agrarian Court to receive evidence on the amount of allowable rentals and the
excess rentals which <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> should reimburse to the
said lessees (<span class="SpellE">Lansangan</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>,
CA-<span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. No. 39402-R). </p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing, the <st1:street><st1:address>Agrarian Court</st1:address></st1:street>
rendered a supplemental decision dated <st1:date year="1970" day="25" month="2">February
 25, 1970</st1:date>, fixing the rentals and ordering <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
to deliver to the five (5) <span class="SpellE">aforenamed</span> lessees 660 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span> and 22 kilos of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> or
their equivalent in money.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <st1:street><st1:address>Agrarian Court</st1:address></st1:street>
in its order of <st1:date year="1970" day="3" month="4">April 3, 1970</st1:date>,
directed the execution of the said judgment pending appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> assailed that
order in the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
Appellate Court in its decision upheld the order of execution (<span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Lansangan</span>, CA-<span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. No. 45121-R, March 25, 1971).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> appealed on <st1:date year="1971" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1971</st1:date> to this Court from the said
decision of the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
appeal was submitted for decision on <st1:date year="1972" day="28" month="3">March
 28, 1972</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 25, 1975 the Court of Appeals decided <span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span> appeal from the supplemental decision of the Court
of Agrarian Relations dated February 25, 1970 (<span class="SpellE">Lansangan</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, CA-<span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. No.
44941-R).</p>

<p class="BODY">The question is whether the decision of the Court of Appeals in
the main case, affirming the supplemental decision of the <st1:street><st1:address>Agra­rian
  Court</st1:address></st1:street>, rendered moot the instant appeal of <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> from the prior decision of the Court of Appeals,
upholding the execution pending appeal of the said supplemental decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <st1:street><st1:address>Agrarian Court</st1:address></st1:street>
in its manifestation of <st1:date year="1977" day="10" month="3">March 10, 1977</st1:date>
alleged that <span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span> petition for review in the
instant <span style="">case was rendered academic by
the decision of the Court of Appeals in the main case, CA-<span class="SpellE">G.R</span>.
No. 44941-R.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> in his comment
of March 26, 1977 contended that this case had not become moot because he
raised the question of whether the Agrarian Court has jurisdiction to render
the oft-mentioned supplemental decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are of the opinion that this case has become moot because the
said supplemental decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the cliché goes, <span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span>
petition herein has no more leg to stand on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The jurisdictional issue raised by him is frivolous or insubstantial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the <st1:street><st1:address>Agrarian Court</st1:address></st1:street>,
in its order of <st1:date year="1976" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1976</st1:date>,
directed the issuance of an alias writ of execution to enforce the said
supplemental decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span> petition for prohibition in this Court, wherein he
assailed that order, was dismissed for lack of merit in the resolution of <st1:date year="1977" day="16" month="2">February 16, 1977</st1:date> (L-44554, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> vs. German).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant case is dismissed with costs
against the petitioner.</p>
