<p class="PONENTE">CONCEPCION, <i>C.J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, Morales Development Co., Inc. - hereafter referred to
as Morales - seeks the review on certiorari of a decision of the Court of
Appeals reversing that of the Court of First Instance of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Hermenegildo</span> <span class="SpellE">Deseo</span>
and Socorro <span class="SpellE">Deseo</span>, respondents herein and plaintiffs
below, brought this action to annul a sale to Morales of lot No. 2488 of the
Cadastral Survey of <span class="SpellE">Catanauan</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, and to secure the registration of a deed of
conveyance of said lot in their (<span class="SpellE">Deseos</span>') favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lot No. 2488 used to belong to Enrique P. <span class="SpellE">Montinola</span>
and was covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-15687 of the Register of
Deeds of said province, in his name.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Alleging that his owner's duplicate copy of said certificate had been
lost, <span class="SpellE">Montinola</span> succeeded in securing, from the Court
above mentioned, an order for the issu­ance of a second owners duplicate, with
which he managed to sell the lot, on September 24, 1954, to <span class="SpellE">Pio</span>
Reyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon registration of the deed of
sale to the latter, said TCT No. T-15687 was cancelled and, in lieu thereof,
TCT No. 21036, in the name of Reyes, was issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1954" day="18" month="11">November
 18, 1954</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Lupo</span> <span class="SpellE">Abella</span>,
married to <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> Aguilar - hereafter referred to as
the <span class="SpellE">Abellas</span> - purchased the land from Reyes,
whereupon the deed of conveyance, executed by Reyes, was regis­tered and the <span class="SpellE">Abellas</span> got TCT No. 21037 in their name, upon can­cellation
of said TCT No. 11036.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About seven (7)
months later, or on <st1:date year="1955" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1955</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">Abellas</span> sold the land, for P7,000, - of which
P4,500 was then paid - to the <span class="SpellE">Deseos</span>, who immediately
took possession of the property.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears, however, that the first owner's duplicate of TCT No.
T-15687 was either never lost or subsequently found by <span class="SpellE">Montinola</span>,
who, making use of it, mortgaged the lot in question, before <st1:date year="1956" day="21" month="2">Febru­ary 21, 1956</st1:date>, to the Philippine
National Bank, for P700.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, on the
date last mentioned, <span class="SpellE">Montinola</span> sold the property to
Morales, for P2,000, from which the sum due to the Bank was deducted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon presentation of the deed of sale in
favor of Morales, the latter was ad­vised by the office of the Register of
Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> that said TCT No. T-15687 had already
been cancelled and the property sold, first, to <span class="SpellE">Pio</span>
Reyes, and, then, to the <span class="SpellE">Abellas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, Morales filed a petition for the
annulment and cancellation of the second owner's copy of TCT No. T-15687.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due notice to Reyes and the <span class="SpellE">Abellas</span>, but <u>not</u> to the <span class="SpellE">Deseos</span>,
said petition was granted on <st1:date year="1956" day="12" month="3">March 12,
 1956</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having been unable, in view of these developments, to register
the deed of conveyance executed by the <span class="SpellE">Abellas</span>, the <span class="SpellE">Deseos</span> commenced, in the court aforementioned, the present
action against Morales, for the annulment of the subsequent sale thereto by <span class="SpellE">Monti­nola</span>, and the registration of said deed of conveyance
in their (<span class="SpellE">Deseos</span>') favor, alleging that the same
enjoys preference over the sale to Morales, the <span class="SpellE">Deseos</span>
having, prior thereto, bought lot No. 2488 in good faith and for value, and
having been first in possession of said lot, likewise, in good faith.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, Morales claimed to have a better right upon
the ground that it (Morales) had bought the property in good faith and for
value, relying upon the <u>first</u> owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. T-15687,
unlike the <span class="SpellE">Deseos</span>, whose predecessor in interest, <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> Reyes, had relied upon the <u>second</u> owner's
duplicate, which - Morales alleged - had been secured fraudulently, and that
the sale to Reyes and that made by the latter to the <span class="SpellE">Abellas</span>
are null and void, because both sales took place under suspicious
circumstances, so that - Mo­rales concluded - they (Reyes and the <span class="SpellE">Abellas</span>) were not purchasers in good faith and for value.</p>

<p class="BODY">After appropriate proceedings, the court of first instance sus­tained
the contention of Morales and rendered judgment in its favor, which, on appeal
taken by the <span class="SpellE">Deseos</span>, was reversed by the Court of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of the latter's decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the judgment appealed from is hereby reversed and
another one entered in favor of the plaintiffs (<span class="SpellE">Deseos</span>)
and against the defendant (Morales) declaring said plaintiffs to be the lawful
and absolute owners of Lot No. 2488 of the Cadas­tral Survey of <span class="SpellE">Catanauan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, covered by
Trans­fer Certificate of Title No. T-21037 of the Office of the Register of
Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>; declaring the deed of sale executed
by Enrique P. <span class="SpellE">Montinola</span> in favor of defendant
covering the same property as null and void; ordering the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> to register the deed of sale executed by the spouses
<span class="SpellE">Lupo</span> <span class="SpellE">Abella</span> and <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> Aguilar in favor of the plain­tiffs dated June 16,
1955, marked Exhibit A, without cost, not having prayed for in the brief for
the ap­pellants."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present petition for review on certiorari by Morales,
which insists that the Court of Appeals should have upheld its (Mora­les')
contention adverted to above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We,
however, find therein no merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Morales maintains that the sale by <span class="SpellE">Montinola</span>
to Reyes and that later made by Reyes to the <span class="SpellE">Abellas</span>
are "suspicious"; that, conse­quently, Reyes and the <span class="SpellE">Abellas</span> were not purchasers in good faith and for value;
and that these two (2) premises, in turn, lead to the con­clusion that both
sales are "null and void."</p>

<p class="BODY">This syllogism is obviously faulty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The major premise thereof is based upon the
fact that the consideration stated in the deeds of sale in favor of Reyes and
the <span class="SpellE">Abellas</span> is P100.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is not unusual, however, in deeds of conveyance adhering to the
Anglo-Saxon prac­tice of stating that the consideration given is the sum of
P1.00, although the actual, consideration may have been much more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More­over, assuming that said consideration
of P1.00 is suspicious, this circumstance, alone, does not necessarily justify
the inference that Reyes and the <span class="SpellE">Abellas</span> were not
purchasers in good faith and for value.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither does this inference warrant the conclusion that the sales were
null and void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, bad faith and inadequacy of the
monetary consideration do not render a conveyance inexistent, for the
assignor's liberality may be sufficient cause for a valid con­tract<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>,
whereas fraud or bad faith may render either <span class="SpellE">rescissible</span>
or <span class="SpellE">voidable</span>, although valid until annulled, a
contract concerning an object certain, entered into with a cause and with the
consent of the contracting parties, as in the case at bar<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is more, the aforementioned conveyance may not be annulled, in the
case at bar, inasmuch as Reyes and the <span class="SpellE">Abellas</span> are
not parties therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, the <span class="SpellE">Deseos</span> had
bought the land in ques­tion for value and in good faith, relying upon the
transfer certifi­cate of title in the name of their assignors, the <span class="SpellE">Abellas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sale by
the latter to the former preceded the purchase made by Morales, by about eight
(8) months, and the <span class="SpellE">Deseos</span> took immediate possession
of the land, which was actually held by them at the time of its con­veyance to
Morales by <span class="SpellE">Montinola</span>, and is in the possession of the
<span class="SpellE">Deseos</span>, up to the present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, again, TCT No. T-15687, in the name of <span class="SpellE">Montinola</span>, had been cancelled over a year <u>before</u> he
sold the property to Morales, who, in turn, <u>was informed</u> of this fact,
when it sought to register the deed of conveyance in its favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted, also, that TCT No. 21037,
in the name of the <span class="SpellE">Abel­las</span>, on which the <span class="SpellE">Deseos</span> had relied in buying the lot in dispute, has not
been ordered cancelled.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the object of this litigation is a registered land and the
two (2) buyers thereof have so far been unable to register the deeds of
conveyance in their respective favor, it follows that "the owner­ship"
of said lot "pertain(s)" - pursuant to Article 1544 of our Civil Code<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> -
to the <span class="SpellE">Deseos</span>, as the only party who took possession
there­of in good faith.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Morales argues that it was not enough for the <span class="SpellE">Deseos</span>
to have gone to the office of the Register of Deeds and found therein that
there were no flaws in the title of the <span class="SpellE">Abellas</span>, and
that the <span class="SpellE">Deseos</span> should have, also, ascertained why
the <span class="SpellE">Abellas</span> had paid only P1.00 to Reyes, and why the
latter had paid the same amount to <span class="SpellE">Montinola</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To begin with, the <span class="SpellE">Deseos</span>
did not know that said sum was the consi­deration paid by the <span class="SpellE">Abellas</span> to Reyes and by Reyes to <span class="SpellE">Montinola</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the <span class="SpellE">Deseos</span>
were not bound to check the deeds of conveyance by Reyes to the <span class="SpellE">Abellas</span>, and by <span class="SpellE">Montinola</span> to
Reyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having found that the owner's
duplicate copy of TCT No. 21037, in the name of the <span class="SpellE">Abellas</span>,
was a genuine copy of the original on file with the Office of the Register of
Deeds, the <span class="SpellE">Deseos</span> were fully justified in relying
upon said TCT No. 21037, and had no legal obligation to make further in­vestigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thirdly, were we to adopt the process of reasoning advocated by
Morales, the result would still be adverse thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, if it were not sufficient for the <span class="SpellE">Deseos</span> to verify in said office the genuine­ness of the
owner's duplicate of TCT No. 21037, much less would Morales have been justified
in relying upon <span class="SpellE">Montinola's</span> copy of TCT No. T-15687
in his name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, had Morales, at
least, gone to the Office of the Register of Deeds - as the <span class="SpellE">Deseos</span>
did - before pur­chasing the property in dispute, Morales would have found out,
not only that TCT No. T-15687 had long been <u>cancelled</u>, but, also, that
the property had been <u>previously sold</u> by <span class="SpellE">Montinola</span>
to Reyes and by Reyes to the <span class="SpellE">AbeIlas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, the negligence of Morales was the
proximate cause of the resulting wrong, and, hence, Morales should be the party
to suffer its consequences.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></p>
