				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, dated April 20,
1967, dis<span style="">missing the petition for a
writ of <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u>, filed by herein petitioner-appellant </span>Simon
Luna -- herein<span style="">after </span>referred to
simply <span style="">as </span>petitioner -- who was
charged with murder in Criminal Case No. 655-New of the same court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The criminal action <span style="">was </span>commenced
by T-Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Can­dido</span> <span class="SpellE">Patosa</span>,
PC investigator of <span class="SpellE">Tandag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, by filing with respondent Municipal Judge
Lorenzo M. Plaza, of the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Tandag</span>,
criminal case No. 1138 charging the accused, herein petitioner, with the crime
of murder. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Supporting the complaint <span style="">were sworn statements of </span>the witnesses
for the prose<span style="">cution, in </span>the form
of questions and answers taken by T-Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Patosa</span>, and
subscribed and sworn to before the respondent Judge at <span style="">the time of the filing of the com</span>plaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Judge examined the
'prosecution witnesses by reading to them "all over again the questions
and answers" in their statements in writing, and <span style="">the witnesses-affiants declared </span><span style="">before </span><span style="">said Judge that </span>the
questions were propounded by T-Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> <span class="SpellE">Patosa</span>, <span style="">and that </span>the
answers were made by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The affiants
further declared before respondent Judge that their answers were true, and were
freely and voluntarily made; <span style="">that they
fully understood </span>the questions and answers, and that they were willing
to sign <span style="">their respective af</span>fidavits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The affiants <span style="">signed their respective affidavits in the </span>presence of the
respondent Judge, who also signed after the usual procedure of <span style="">administering the oath.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the answers of the <span style="">affiants to the questions contained in </span>their <span style="">sworn statements, </span>together with the <span style="">post-mortem and autopsy </span>report on the
dead body of the victim <span style="">Jaime Diaz Ng, </span>the
certificate <span style="">of </span>death, the sketch
showing the position of the victim and the accused, and Exhibits 6, 7, 8, 12,
and 13 of <span style="">herein respondents, the
respondent Judge opined that there was reasonable ground to believe that </span>the
crime <span style="">of murder had been committed and
the accused was probably guilty thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent Judge issued the order and warrant of arrest, specifying
therein that no bail should be accepted for the provisional </span>release <span style="">of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February 20, 1967, upon motion of
petitioner that </span>he be admitted to bail upon the ground that the evidence
of <span style="">guilt </span><span style="">was </span>not strong, respondent Judge
issued an order <span style="">granting bail, fixing
it at P30,000.00; which order, however, </span>respondent Judge later revoked,
and petitioner was denied bail.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The case was subsequently
remanded to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, after petitioner filed a waiver of his right
to preliminary investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1967" day="9" month="3"><span style="">March 9,
 1967</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>respondent
Provincial Fiscal <span style="">filed an information
charging herein petitioner with </span>the <span style="">crime of murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner
was detained in the provincial jail of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> under the custody of
respondent Provincial Warden.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On April 5, 1967, petitioner filed a petition for a writ of <u>habeas</u>
<u>corpus</u> with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, therein docketed as Special Proceedings No.
105-New, claiming that he was being deprived of liberty without due process of
law, on the ground that the imprisonment and detention was the result of a
warrant of arrest issued by respondent Judge in violation of Republic Act No.
3828, and praying for the annulment of the order for his arrest and his discharge
from confinement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Herein respondents filed their answer, alleging that Republic Act
No. 3828 had been substantially complied with; that a motion to <span class="GramE">quash,</span> and not a petition for <u>habeas</u> <u><span style="">corpus</span></u><span style=""> </span>was the proper remedy; and that petitioners application for
bail constituted a waiver of the right to question the validity of the arrest.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> rendered its decision, dated <st1:date year="1967" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1967</st1:date>, holding that
respondent Municipal Judge had substantially complied with Republic Act No.
3828, and consequent­ly denied the application for the writ of <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u>,
and dismissed the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence this appeal.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, in his assignment of errors, claims that the trial
court erred, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In giving absolute
credence to the oral testimony of the respondent Judge to the effect that he
adopted and made his own the questions and answers taken by T-Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Patosa</span>, PC Investigator, one of the prosecution witnesses,
because the records show the contrary;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In denying the writ
of <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u> and in dismissing the petition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of his
first assignment of error, petitioner contends that Republic Act No. 3828
imposes on <span style="">a </span>municipal judge,
before <span style="">he </span>can issue a warrant of
arrest, two specific duties, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
personally examine the complainant and witnesses with "searching questions
and answers'', which means that the judge must cross-examine them in case their
affidavits are presented; and (2) said examination must be reduced to writing
and form part of the records of the <span style="">case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The record of the instant case,
according to petitioner, does not show that said examination was performed by
respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner urges that
the absence of any document in the record that shows that respondent Judge had
performed the examination is positive proof that respondent Judge did not
perform his duty, notwithstanding his testimony before the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>,
during the hearing of this case, to the effect that he adopted the questions
propounded to each of the prosecution witnesses by T-Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Patosa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner maintains <span style="">that this testimony, being </span>self-serving intended to <span style="">cover up the failure to comply with the </span><span style="">law, </span><span style="">should not have been believed by </span>the Court <span style="">of First Instance, </span>and said court
thereby committed error when, believing said testimony, it found that there had
been substantial compliance with the requirement that the municipal judge
should personally examine the witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">Petitioner </span>further
maintains that assuming that the adoption of the questions made by T-Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Patosa</span> constituted substantial compliance with the
requirement that the judge should examine the witnesses by asking searching
questions, still the second requirement, that of reducing to writing the said
procedure of adoption, has not been complied with; and so, Republic Act No.
3828 was still <span style="">violated, and the
issuance of the warrant of arrest </span><span style="">was
in violation </span><span style="">of said Act and the
Constitution and constituted denial of due process.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner </span>contends
that the trial court erred in giving absolute credence to the testimony of <span style="">respondent </span>Municipal Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Regarding credibility of witnesses, this
Court has consistently held that, as a general rule, the lower court's findings
<span style="">as </span><span style="">to the credibility </span>of witnesses will
not be interfered with by appellate courts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, in the <span style="">case </span>of People <span style="">vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Sinaon</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
this <span style="">Court said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Time and again, <span style="">we </span>have
held that as a rule where the issue is one of <span style="">credibility </span>of witnesses, appellate courts will not generally
disturb the findings of the trial court, considering that it is in <span style="">a </span>better position to decide the
question, having seen and heard the <span style="">wit</span><span style="">nesses themselves </span>and <span style="">observed their deportment and manner of
testifying during the trial, unless </span>there is a <span style="">showing that it has overlooked certain facts of substance and value,
that if considered, might affect the result of the case."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner has appealed
"from the decision/order" of the trial court "to the Honorable
Supreme Court of the Philippines, on the ground that the same </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">contrary to law and the Philippine Constitution"
and prayed that "all the records of the proceeding and the evidence, oral
and documentary, be transmitted or forwarded to the Honorable Supreme Court x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>".</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Since petitioner appealed directly to this

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The findings of facts of
the trial court are found in the following portion of the decision appealed
from, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"There is no dispute that there is <span style="">a </span>valid complaint charging the accused Simon Luna, the herein
petitioner with the crime of Murder filed with the respondent Judge authorized
to conduct <span style="">the examination of the
witnesses for the prosecution for the purpose of determin</span>ing <span style="">the existence of probable cause before the
issuance of the corresponding </span>warrant of arrest; that the complaint <span style="">is </span><span style="">supported by the statements of the witnesses
under oath in writing in the form of questions and answers and other documents
attached to the complaint; that before the issuance of the </span>corresponding
warrant <span style="">of arrest, the respondent judge
personally examined the witnesses for the prosecution on their statements taken
by T-Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> <span class="SpellE">Patosa</span> by
reading the questions and answers all over again to the </span><span style="">affiants who </span><span style="">confirmed to the respondent Judge that the </span>statements contained
in <span style="">their sworn </span><span style="">statements are true; that being satisfied
that the questions and answers contained in the sworn statements </span><span style="">taken by </span><span style="">T-Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Patosa</span> partake of the nature of his
searching questions and answers </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">required
by law, the respondent Judge adopted them </span>as <span style="">his own personal examination of the wit</span>nesses <span style="">for the purpose of determining the </span>existence
<span style="">of probable cause, the order and the
warrant of arrest were issued to take </span><span style="">the accused into custody for the commission </span><span style="">of the offense charged (Exhibits
"H", "H-1", "I" and "I-1" -
petitioner); and that the petitioner </span><span style="">waived his right to the </span><span style="">prelimin­</span><span style="">ary investigation (Exhibit "12" -
respondent) and applied to be admitted to bail."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner, however,
claims that the failure of respondent Judge to put in writing that he adopted
the questions asked by T-Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Patosa</span> and his failure
to ask "searching questions" violated Republic Act No. 3828.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Republic Act No. 3828,
approved </span><st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="6"><span style="">June 22, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, in­serted in section 87 (c) of the
Judiciary Act of 1948 the following paragraph:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"No warrant of arrest
shall be </span>issued by any justice of the peace in any criminal case filed
with him <span style="">unless he first examines the
witness or witnesses personally, and the examination shall be under oath and
reduced to writing </span><span style="">in the form
of searching questions and answers."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Before </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">municipal judge may issue a warrant of arrest, the following conditions
must first </span><span style="">be ful­filled:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) he must examine the witnesses personally;
(2) the examination must </span><span style="">be
under oath; (3) the exami</span><span style="">nation
must be reduced to writing in the form of searching questions and answers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were these condi</span><span style="">tions fulfilled in the instant case?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The first condition was fulfilled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court found as a fact <span style="">that "the </span>respondent judge personally
examined the witnesses for the prosecution x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>;" that respondent judge adopted as his own personal
examination the questions asked by T-Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Patosa</span> as
appearing in the written statements, which he read over again to the witnesses
together with the answers given therein, asking the witnesses whether said ans<span style="">wers were theirs, and </span>whether the same
answers were true, to which the witnesses answered in the affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Republic Act No. 3828 does not prohibit the
municipal <span style="">Judge from adopting the </span>questions
asked by a previous investigator.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that the sworn statements<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
of the witnesses state at the beginning that the sworn statement <span style="">was "taken </span>by T-SGT <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Patosa</span>", and does
not state that it was taken by the respondent municipal Judge himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This circumstance <span style="">is </span>explained by the fact that <span style="">said </span>written
statements already taken by T-Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Patosa</span> were
delivered to respondent Municipal Judge who adopted the questions therein in
his examination, because he considered them <span style="">searching questions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respond</span>ent
Judge presumably did not consider it necessary to change the introductory
remarks in each of the written statements.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But that he made the examination personal­ly cannot be doubted; it is so
stated in the order dated <st1:date year="1967" day="18" month="2">February 18,
 1967</st1:date>, which recites:</p>

<blockquote>"After examining the witnesses personally and under oath there
is reasonable ground to believe that an offense for murder <span style="">has </span>been
committed and that the <span style="">accused, </span>Simon
Luna, is probably guilty thereof." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The ruling in <span class="SpellE">Doce</span> vs. Branch II of the Court of </span>First Instance of
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, et al.,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
wherein this Court <span style="">held that the warrant
of arrest issued therein was irregularly issued is not applicable to the case
at bar for the simple reason that the facts are different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court in that case said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"There is merit in the assertion that the warrant of arrest
was irregularly <span style="">issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Section 87 of the
Judiciary Act as amended by Republic Act <span style="">3828
requires that the Municipal Judge issuing the same, </span><u><span style="">personally</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">examine under oath the
witnesses, and by </span><u><span style="">searchi</span></u><u><span style="">ng</span></u><span style=""> questions and answers which are to be reduced to writing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, instead of searching questions and
answers, we have only the affidavits of respondent and her one witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, said affidavits were sworn to
before Judge <span class="SpellE">Cabungcal</span>, not before Judge <span class="SpellE">Juntereal</span> who issued the warrant of arrest."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the instant case, </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">stated above, the respondent Municipal Judge personally examined under
oath the witnesses by asking questions, that were adopted from a previous
investigation, and considered by him as sufficiently searching and </span><span style="">which </span><span style="">questions and the answers thereto were in writing and sworn to before
him prior to his issuance of the order of arrest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The second condition
required by Republic Act No. 3828 for the issuance of a warrant of arrest was
also ful­filled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court found
that the complaint was ''supported by statements of the witnesses under
oath." The record also shows the following documents to have been
subscribed and sworn to before respondent Judge namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit B, sworn statement of herein
petitioner Simon Luna y <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>; Exhibit </span>C, <span style="">sworn statement of <span class="SpellE">Euseb­<span style="">io</span></span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Corpuz</span></span><span style="">; Exhibit D, sworn statement of Bruno M. <span class="SpellE">Zafra</span>;
Exhibit E, sworn statement of <span class="SpellE">Martiliano</span> J. Bautista;
Exhibit F, sworn statement of Jose F. Suarez; and Exhibit G, sworn statement of
<span class="SpellE">Janedina</span> Diaz y <span class="SpellE">Bandoy</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The third condition
required by Republic Act No. 3828 was likewise fulfilled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The examination of the witnesses was written
down, in the form of searching questions and </span><span style="">answers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The</span><span style=""> term "searching questions and,
answers" means only, taking into consideration the </span>purpose of the
preliminary examination which is to de­termine "whether there is a
reasonable ground to be­lieve that an offense has been committed and the
accused is probably guilty thereof so that a warrant of arrest may be issued
and the accused held for trial"<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>,
such questions as have tendency to show the commission of a crime and the
perpetrator thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What would be
searching questions would depend on what is sought to be inquired into, such
as:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the nature of the offense, the date,
time, and place of its commission, the possible motives for its commission; the
subject, his age, education, status, financial and social circumstances, his
attitude toward the investigation, social attitudes, opportunities to commit
the offense; the victim, his age, status, family responsibilities, financial
and social circumstances, characteristics, etc.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The points that are the subject of inquiry may differ from case to
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The questions, therefore, must to
a great degree depend upon the Judge making the investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the court <u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> <u>quo</u> </span>found that respondent
Judge was "satisfied that the questions and answers contained <span style="">in </span>the
sworn statements taken by T-Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Patosa</span> <span style="">partake </span>of the <span style="">nature </span>of <span style="">his </span>searching
questions and answers as required by law," so the respondent Judge adopted
them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's further contention that the issuance of the warrant
of arrest was a violation of the Consti­tution and of procedural due process is
likewise untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constitution, in
Section 1 (3), Article III, provides that no warrant shall issue but upon
probable cause, to be determined by the judge after examination under oath or
affirmation of the complainant and the <span style="">wit­nesses
</span>he may produce.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
constitutional requirement of examination of witnesses under oath was, as shown
above, fulfilled. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The existence of
probable cause depended to a large degree upon the finding or opinion of the
judge conducting the examination.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent Judge found that there was a probable cause, as stated in his
order of arrest, that "after examining the witnesses personally and under
oath there is <span style="">a reasonable ground </span>to
<span style="">believe that an </span>offense of
murder has been committed and that the accused, Simon Luna, <span style="">is </span>probably guilty thereof."</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's last contention that the warrant of arrest issued
was a violation of procedural due process because of the alleged defective
preliminary examination has no leg to stand on, in view of what we have
hereinbefore stated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, this
Court has held that preliminary examination is not an essential part of due
process of law.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Preliminary examination may be con­ducted by the municipal judge, prior to the
issuance of the warrant of arrest, either in the presence, or in the absence,
of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that
herein petitioner waived the preliminary investigation before respondent
Municipal Judge, and instead, he filed a petition for bail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition for bail was at first granted by
respondent Judge, but later the order granting bail was revoked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This conduct of petitioner indicates that he
had waived his objection to whatever defect, if any, in the preliminary
examination conducted by respondent Judge prior to the issuance of the warrant
of arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, petitioner has no
substantial -- much less legal ground to complain that he was denied the due
process of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find that the trial Judge committed no error when he held
that, based upon the facts shown during the hearing of this case, respondent
Municipal Judge had substantially complied with the requirements of the <span style="">law </span>specifically Republic Act 3828 --
before issuing the warrant of arrest in this <span style="">case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the light of what
has been said above, it appears clear that petitioner's second assignment of error,
that the trial court erred in denying the writ of <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u>,
is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, Section 4 of
Rule 102 of the Rules of Court provides in part, as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 4.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>When writ not allowed or discharge
authorized</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it appears that the
person alleged to be restrained of his liberty is in the custody of an officer
under process issued by a court or judge x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> and that the court or judge had jurisdiction to issue the
process x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> or make the
order, the writ shall not be allowed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">All the conditions, in
the afore-quoted Section </span>4, set forth to deny the writ, are present in
the instant case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is shown that
petitioner is detained and is in <span style="">the
custody of the respondent Provincial Warden by virtue of the order of arrest
dated </span><st1:date year="1967" day="18" month="2"><span style="">February 18, 1967</span></st1:date><span style="">, and the order dated </span><st1:date year="1967" day="21" month="2"><span style="">February 21, 1967</span></st1:date><span style="">, of respondent Judge, to confine petitioner
in the provincial jail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not
disputed by petitioner that respondent Judge had jurisdiction to issue the
warrant of arrest and the order </span><span style="">of
</span><span style="">commitment under the provisions
of </span><span style="">Sec</span><span style="">tion 47, Republic Act No. 409, </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">amended by Republic Act No. 1201, although petitioner did question the
validity of the warrant of arrest for allegedly having been issued in violation
of Republic Act No. 3828 -- which claim We have found to be untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the trial Judge did not commit
an error in denying the writ of <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u> prayed for.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At any rate, We believe
that, if at all, the remedy available to the petitioner herein, under the
circumstances stated in this opinion, is not a petition for a writ of <u>habeas</u>
<u>corpus</u> but a petition to quash the warrant of arrest or </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">petition for a reinvestigation of the case by the respondent Municipal
Judge or by the Provincial Fiscal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We wish </span><span style="">to stress, however, that what has been stated
in this opinion is certainly not intended to sanction the return to the former
practice of municipal judges of simply relying upon affidavits or sworn state­ments
that are made to accompany the complaints that are filed before them, in
determining whether there is a probable cause for the issuance of a warrant of
arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That practice is precisely what
is sought to be voided by the amendment of Section 87 </span><span style="">(c) </span><span style="">of Republic Act 296 (Judiciary Act of 1948) which requires that before
a mu­nicipal judge issues a warrant of arrest he should first satisfy himself
that there is a probable cause </span><span style="">by
</span><span style="">examining the witnesses
personally, and that the examination must be under oath and reduced to writing
in the form of searching questions and answers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is obvious that the purpose of this amendment is to prevent the issuance
of a warrant of arrest against a person based simply upon affidavits of
witnesses who made, and swore to, their statements before a person or persons
other than the judge before whom the criminal complaint </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We </span><span style="">wish </span><span style="">to emphasize strict compliance by municipal or city judges of the
provision of Section 87 (c) of the Judiciary Act of 1948, as amended by
Republic Act 3828, in order to avoid malicious and/or unfounded criminal
prosecution of persons.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case now before
Us, while it is true that the respondent Municipal Judge did not himself
personal­ly cause to be reduced to writing in the form of ques­tions and
answers the examination of witnesses presented before him by the person who
filed the criminal complaint, We are satisfied that, as shown by the evidence,
respond­ent Judge had personally examined the witnesses under oath and that the
questions asked by the Judge and the answers of the witnesses were reflected in
writings which were actually subscribed and <span class="SpellE">sworned</span>
to before him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, <span class="GramE">We</span> are of the considered view that no substantial right of
the petitioner had been violated because, as hereinbefore adverted to,
petitioner waived his right to preliminary investigation after he was arrested,
and </span><span style="">he </span><span style="">took the step of applying for bail before
respondent Municipal Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These </span><span style="">acts </span><span style="">of the petitioner subsequent to his arrest constitute an implied
admission on his part that there was a probable cause for the issuance of the
warrant of arrest against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those
acts of the petitioner constitute a waiver of whatever irregularity, if any
there was, that attended his arrest.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
