decision of the trial Judge, Hon. <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Tabigne</span>, as follows:<span style="">&nbsp;

the desire of the Phil­ippine American Embroideries, Inc. that your union

that it represents the majority of the collective bargaining unit it seeks to
repre­sent, that is, all the employees of the Philippine American Em­broideries,

3, 1960 and January 24, 1961)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners do not dispute the facts above set forth, but aver
that the resolution fails to state and consider other facts likewise
indubitable and non-controversial, and indis­pensable for a just and legal
determination of the issues in­volved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These other facts, indeed, while related in the de­cision of the trial
Judge and elaborated upon in his dissent to the resolution of the Court <u>en</u>
<u>banc</u>, are not only unchallenged but appear to be borne out by the
record.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first material finding in the resolution of the Court <u>en</u>
<u>banc</u> is that contained in number 3, to the effect that "it has been
the practice to lay off employees who could not fulfill their quotas." The
statement is plain enough, but stripped of the other relevant facts and
circumstances it fails to picture the situation in proper perspective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those facts and circumstances are stated in
the decision of the trial Judge, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Regarding the alleged lock-out, the Court is also convinced
that there was no such lock-out as claimed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The principal witnesses for the complainant, <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ros</span> and <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Rayala</span>, testified as to the alleged incidents that led to
the laying-off of members of the complainant union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They claimed that since the start of the
operation of the machine-made department in 1956, the company resorted to the
practice of laying-off workers, after giving them warnings of 15 days or one
month, for their failure to meet their quotas, and that only those who were
industrious and able to meet or fulfill their quotas, were not laid-off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this point <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ros</span> testified as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those who were given warning, who became
candidates for lay­ing off were given opportuni­ty to fulfill or make their
quota, were they not?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
after making their quota or fulfilling their quota, they were not
laid-off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is it not?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
they were not laid off because they were able to meet the quota.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But for a certain period of fifteen (15) days
or one month when they were given warning.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
during that period of fifteen (15) days or one month when they were given time
to fulfill their quota and they were able to meet their quota, they were not
laid off?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
others who were laid off were laid-off because they were unable to make their
quota.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is that not a fact?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is clear from the above testimony that
the practice of the company in laying-off workers started in 1956, and indeed,
the reasons <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> were justified for, as admitted
by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Ros</span>, only those who were not industrious and
unable to fulfill their quotas were laid-off.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such practice was not motivated by the union activities and/or
affiliations of said workers."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Relative to findings Nos. 4, 5 and 6 in the resolution under
review, the following additional facts found by the trial Judge In his decision
are relevant and material:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that since
the early part of 1958 the workers in the "machine-made" department
of petitioner company - the department making scalloped handkerchiefs - had
been informed by management about the losses incurred in its operation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Witness <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span> <span class="SpellE">Ros</span> so testified, and admitted on cross-examination that it
was precisely to avoid financial collapse and closure of the de­partment that
the employees were given quotas, and that the matter had been the subject of
conferences between manage­ment and representatives of said employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The unfavorable situation continued
nevertheless:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the financial statements
presented in evidence show a loss of P62,444.55 in 1957 and a loss of
P45,872.47 in 1958, or a total of P108,317.03.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of these facts, significantly omitted in the
resolution of the Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>, the real reasons behind the
closure of the "machine-made" department and the formation of the
respondent union are brought into clearer focus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision to close could not have been so
sudden as the resolution said it was:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the adverse financial condition of that department had lasted almost two
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span> <span class="SpellE">Ros</span> in fact discloses
that the employees organized themselves by affiliating with the Embroidery and
Garment Workers' <st1:place>Union</st1:place> "in order to prevent their
lay-off due to the cessation of work."</p>

<blockquote>'Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But the fact remains that it was only in
October 1958 that you decided to organize a labor union by affiliating with the
Embroidery &amp; Garment Workers' Union?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was because, as you stated, you were afraid to be laid off?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir, we were afraid.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
you thought that you can prevent the lay-off of you and your companions by
affiliating with the Embroidery &amp; Garment Workers Union?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 17 and 18, <st1:date year="1959" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1959</st1:date>); p. 12, Annex "A",
Petition)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The respondent union was organized in the last week of October
1958.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner company was advised
thereof by letter on October 31, and received the union's collective bargaining
proposals on the following November 3.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> found (finding No. 7, supra) that in the
afternoon of the same day, Nov. 3, the management announced the closure of the
"machine-made" department and the opening of a new one - the Knitting
Glove Department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The employees who were
dis­missed by reason of the closure were told to file applications with the new
department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court was of the
opinion, how­ever, that there was no bona-fide closure of the business because
the company "continued to make scalloped handkerchiefs by transferring the
pieces of machinery to various places in the provinces." This apparently
was the basis of the Court's conclusion that the real reason for the dismissal
of the employees in the "machine-made" department was their union
activities.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is with respect to the finding that the company continued to
make scalloped handkerchiefs that there exists a divergence among the members
of the industrial Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence is
that the machines were leased to independent contractors in the provinces; but
whether they turned out scalloped handkerchiefs or infant wear<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
with those machines is quite unimportant insofar as the charge of unfair labor
practice is concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it is a fact
that the "machine-made" department had been suffering financial
reverses in its operation; and it is also a fact that the employees had been
forewarned of its closure unless the situation improved, and that when such
closure became unavoidable the employees, without forming a local union of
their own, hurriedly affiliated themselves with respondent Embroidery and
Garment Workers Union as a means of preventing the loss of their jobs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following observations of the trial Judge, Hon. <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Tabigne</span>, in his
dissenting opinion are apropos:</p>

<blockquote>"Even on the assumption that the
workers in the department were already members of a labor union at the inception
of the operation of the business in 1956, it cannot deter or prevent the
decision of respondent to close the business if to proceed any further will
only mean financial ruin or busi­ness collapse.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What more in a case like the one at bar when it is distinct­ly shown
that the motive of the complain­ing witnesses to suddenly join the union, after
respondent company had already decided to close the department, was to prevent
respondent from proceeding with its decision to close and to secure for
themselves a continuing employment?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is very clear from the records that the decision to close the department was
for a justifiable and legitimate reason.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To attribute the closing of the machine made depart­ment and the
consequential separation of the employees affected therein, to the affiliation
of the complaining witnesses to the complainant union is to subscribe to the
illegal mo­tive or purpose of the complainants and disregard entirely the
legitimate and legal ground which motivated respondent company in closing the
department, for I believe, no authority or law can stop an employer from
closing operation of its business when it is on the red, much less are the
employees empowered, by reason of their union affiliation or color, to compel
the company to continue operation just so to secure for them (laborers or
employees) continuous employment" (Pages 8-9, <span class="SpellE">Tabigne</span>,
J.-Dissenting, Annex "B" of Petition)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The presentation of proposals for purposes of collective bargaining
on <st1:date year="1958" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1958</st1:date> could not
have been the motive for the closure of the "machine-made" department
on the same day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was then no
existing labor dispute; indeed the company learned of the formation of the
union only three days before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no
conceivable reason why such a drastic step as the complete cessation of
operations should be resorted to as a measure of retaliation against the
employees for their supposed union activities when there were yet no such
activities to speak off.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, there was a demand for collective bargain­ing
contained in the letter of <st1:date year="1958" day="3" month="11">November 3,
 1958</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the company did
not ignore it, or refuse to bargain at all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What it did was to ask the union to prove that it counted with a
majority of the employees, and to secure from the Court of Industrial Relations
a certification to that effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was
not only the legally approved procedure, but was dictated by the fact that the
company had an existing collective bargaining agreement with another union,
namely, the "<span class="SpellE">Kapisanang</span> <span class="SpellE">Manggagawa</span>
<span class="SpellE">sa</span> Phil-American Embroideries, Inc."</p>

<p class="BODY">Finding Nos. 11 and 12 of the Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> are
that the employees who had lost their jobs unconditionally offered to work but
that the company refused their collective offer and insisted that they submit
their applications individually.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This,
according to the majority of the lower Court, constitu­ted unfair labor
practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conclusion is
non-sequitur.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfair labor practice can
hardly be inferred from a willing­ness to accept applications for work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dissent of the trial Judge states the
matter quite clearly:</p>

<blockquote>"Even with respect to Exhibit 'D' petitioner, which was also
marked Exhibit "2" for respondent company, a letter by the former to
the latter dated April 4, 1959, the complaining witnesses did not ask for
reinstatement to their former position in the Machine-Made Department which was
closed on November 3, 1958, but they only requested to be employed in the Knit­ting
Glove Department which is the newly created department of respondent company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For clarity, the last paragraph of Exhibit
'D', petitioner, is quoted hereunder:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Lastly, may I be honored with a reply regarding your acceptance of
their services should there be vacancies in order that the same may be
immediate­ly transmitted to them.'</p>

<blockquote>From the foregoing, it is an implied if not
an expressed admission by complainants, through their own counsel, that there
was no room or legal ground for reinstatement to the already de­funct
department from where they originally worked but that they only wanted to be
employed in the Knitting Glove Department of the respondent company, and while
jobs cannot be pro­mised to everybody, the complainants were advised to file
their correspond­ing applications and if they are found to be qualified, they may
be accommodated to fill any vacancy" (p. 15, <span class="SpellE">Tabigne</span>,
J.- Dissenting, Annex "B" of Petition)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>Considering all the undisputed facts</b>, both as stated in
the resolution of the Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> and in the dissent thereto,
we are convinced that petitioner company was not guilty of unfair labor
practice as charged, and that the closure of its department where the members
of respondent union were employed was not an act of discrimination or a means
of dismissal but rather the result of continued losses in operations - a ground
that is entirely justified by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The resolution appealed from is reversed and set aside, and the
complaint is dismissed, with costs.</p>
