				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal from the order of the Court of First Instance
of Manila, dated <st1:date month="1" day="29" year="1963">January 29, 1963</st1:date>,
in its Civil Case No. 52946, dismissing the complaint upon the ground that the
action in the first two causes of action had prescribed and that it had no
jurisdiction over the third cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that plaintiff Federico Fernandez <span style="">was </span>employed as salesman by defendant
P. <span class="SpellE">Cuerva</span> &amp; Co. from March, 1949 to October,
1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After his separation from the
service, plaintiff filed <span style="">a claim, </span>on
<st1:date month="7" day="26" year="1960">July 26, 1960</st1:date>, before
Regional Office No. 4 of the Department of <span style="">Labor,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>docketed as L. S. Case No. 2940, to
recover un­paid salaries and commissions, and separation pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of said case, or on
<span style="">December 17, 1962, </span>plaintiff
again instituted a similar complaint against the same defendant with the Court
of First Instance of Manila (Civil Case No. 52946) alleging, among others, that
he was employed by defendant company as salesman in March, 1949 with a salary
of P200.00 per month; that beginning June, 1955 until the termination of his
services in October, 1959, his salary was in­creased to P300.00 monthly and was
given, in addition, a commission of 10% on his sales; that the increase of
P100.00 <span style="">a </span>month
and the 10% commission were not <span style="">actually
received </span>by him <span style="">as </span>there was a verbal understanding be­tween him and defendant
company that the same would <span style="">be retained
</span>by the latter as bond or deposit for the goods being handled by the
former; and that because plaintiff was separated from service in October, 1959,
he sought to recover the sum of P5,300.00 representing the P100.00 monthly
deductions from his salary; P4,770.00 cor­responding to his 10% commissions
that were withheld, and P1,500.00 <span style="">as </span>separation
pay, or the total sum of P11,570.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These three items were respectively the subject mat­ter of the first,
second and third causes of action of the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="1" day="2" year="1963">January 2, 1963</st1:date>,
defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint upon the grounds that the
actions <span style="">had </span>prescribed and that
the court had no jurisdiction over the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court below, after allowing the par­ties to submit their respective
memorandum on the ques­tions of prescription and jurisdiction, dismissed the c<span style="">ase, </span>in an order issued on January 29,
1963, holding that because the claim of plaintiff in the first <span style="">two causes of action amounting to </span>P10,070.00
represented the <span style="">sum </span><span style="">total of unauthorized</span> deductions from
his salaries and withheld commissions, under Section 10, paragraph (f) of
Republic Act No. 602, otherwise known as the Mini­mum Wage Law, the action to
recover the same was already barred under Section 17 of said Act inasmuch as it
was not brought within three years from the time the right of action accrued;
and that because the remaining claim of plaintiff was limited to his separation
pay amounting only to P1,500.00, the action to collect the same was not within
the original jurisdiction of the court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 1, 1963, plaintiff moved to reconsider the
above-mentioned order, advancing <span style="">as </span>his
main argument the fact that his having filed a similar claim with Regional
Office No. 4 of the Department of Labor had sus­pended the running of the
prescriptive period insofar as his claim for refund of unauthorized deductions
and with­held commissions was concerned - which were the subject matters of the
first and second causes of action that were dismissed by the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant filed an opposition to the
motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an order
dated <st1:date month="2" day="15" year="1963">February 15, 1963</st1:date>,
the court denied plaintiff's motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this appeal by <span style="">the </span>plaintiff direct to this Court on
purely questions of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are in accord with the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> that the law
applicable to the case at bar is Republic Act 602 because the bond or deposit
sought <span style="">to </span>be recovered by
appellant was actually the sum total of the unauthorized deductions from his
salaries and withheld <span style="">commissions under Section </span>10 thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Section 17 of <span style="">said </span>law, "any action * * * to enforce any <span style="">cause </span>of
action under this Act may be <span style="">commenced within three years after </span>the <span style="">cause </span>of action accrued, and every
such action shall be for­ever barred unless commenced within three years<span style=""> </span>after the cause of action
accrued." <span style="">Since </span><span style="">a </span>right of action <span style="">ac­</span>crues only from the moment the right <span style="">to commence </span>the
ac­<span style="">tion comes
into existence, and prescription begins to run </span>from that time,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
the question to be resolved is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When did
the right of action of plaintiff accrue?</p>

<p class="BODY">To answer the foregoing query<span style="">, </span>it is<span style=""> </span>meet to recall that while the amounts withheld <span style="">by </span>defendant were actually deductions
from plaintiff's salaries and un­paid commissions, they were, however,
constituted as a bond or a deposit to answer for any liability that he might
incur in connection with the goods handled by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bond and/or deposit <span class="GramE">was</span>
thus answerable for mer­chandise entrusted to plaintiff during the period of
his employment with defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was,
therefore, not fea­sible for plaintiff to demand every month or every payday,
or during the period of his employment with the com­pany the return or refund
of those amounts withheld as contended by defendant, because the undertaking
for which the bond or deposit was constituted was still subsisting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so the right of plaintiff to commence an
action for the return or refund of the amounts representing such bond or
deposit would accrue only when the same <span style="">was
</span>no longer needed, and the time when it was no longer needed only came in
October, 1959 when plaintiff was separated <span style="">from the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Having
ceased to be employed by the defendant, the bond put up by plaintiff thereby
became unnecessary or useless.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would seem, however, that even if <span class="GramE">We</span>
count from October, 1959 in computing the prescriptive period, plain­tiff's
action to recover the amount held by defendant as bond is already barred
because more than three years had elapsed by the time plaintiff instituted the
present case in the court below on <st1:date year="1962" day="17" month="12">December
 17, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record, how­ever,
shows that on <st1:date month="7" day="26" year="1960">July 26, 1960</st1:date>,
plaintiff filed a si­milar claim against the defendant with Regional Office No.
4 of the Department of Labor.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, the question posed <span style="">is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Did the filing by
plaintiff of <span style="">that claim with the
regional of­fice of the Department </span>of Labor suspend the running of the
period of prescription?</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Defendant answers the
question in the negative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
defendant does </span>not question the applicability to the case at bar of
Article 1155 of the Civil Code, which provides that the "prescription of
actions is interrupted when they are filed before the Court,"
nevertheless, it contends that inasmuch as plaintiff's claim was lodged with
the regional office of the Department of Labor, which is not a court, the same
could not be considered <span style="">a </span>judi­cial demand that would suspend the running of the pres­criptive
period.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span>do not agree
with defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is </span>true that the claim filed by
plaintiff with the regional office of the Department of Labor is not a judicial
demand in the strict sense of the term "judicial demand" because the
same was not instituted in a court of justice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Judicial notice, however, should be taken that on December 10, 1956,
Reorganization Plan No. 20-A was promulgated pursuant to Republic Act 997, and
under Section 25 of said reorganiza­tion plan each regional office of the
Department of Labor <span style="">was </span>vested
with original and exclusive jurisdiction over all cases affecting all money
claims arising from viola­tions of labor standards on working conditions such <span style="">as </span>unpaid wages, underpayment,
overtime and separation pay, etc., to the exclusion of courts.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, when plaintiff wanted to
enforce his claim after his dismissal from the service in October, 1959, he had
no choice but to file the same with regional Office No. 4 of the Department of
Labor which was the agency then empowered to take cognizance of the claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could not institute the action to recover
his claim in the court of justice because of the provisions of Reorganization
Plan No. 20-A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At least it may be said
that on <st1:date month="7" day="26" year="1960">July 26, 1960</st1:date>, when
plaintiff filed his claim with Regional Office No. 4 of the Department of
Labor, he acted in accordance with the procedure that was then prescribed under
authority of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the
circumstances, <span class="GramE">We</span> believe that the filing by plaintiff
of his claim before the regional office of the Department of La­bor had the
attributes of a judicial demand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And We
say this because under the provisions of Section 25 of Reorganization Plan No.
20-A each regional office of the Department of Labor was invested with
jurisdiction, similar to that of a court, to receive, determine, and adjudicate
money claims arising out of employer-employee relations as specified in said
section.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We quote Section 25 of
Reorganization Plan No. 20-A:</p>

<blockquote>"Each Regional Office shall have <u>original</u> and <u>exclusive
</u>jurisdiction over all cases affecting <span style="">all money claims arising </span>from violations of labor standards on
working conditions, including but not restrictive to:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>unpaid wages, underpayment, overtime,
separation pay, and maternity leave of employees/laborers, and unpaid wages,
overtime, separa­tion pay, vacation pay, and payment for medical services of
domestic held." (Em­phasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It can be gathered from a reading of the above-quoted Section 25
of Reorganization Plan No. 20-A that some sort of judicial powers was conferred
upon the regional offices of the Department of Labor over money claims
mentioned in said section.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, it
can be considered that filing a money claim before a regional office of the
Department of Labor pursuant to Section 25 of Reorganization Plan No. 20-A is
like filing a complaint in court to enforce said money claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe that the filing of a claim before
an administrative agency which is vested with authority to decide said claim
would pro­duce the effect of a judicial demand for the purpose of interrupting
the running of the period of prescription.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The purpose of the law on prescription and the statute of limitations <span style="">i</span>s<span style=""> </span>to protect the person who is diligent and vigilant in asserting
his right, and conversely to punish the person who sleeps on his right.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, it cannot be said that in the case before Us the plaintiff had slept on
his right, because shortly after he was separated from the service by the
defendant he filed his <span style="">claim </span>before
the agency of the government that was at <span style="">the time clothed with exclusive authority </span>to pass upon his claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have taken note of the fact that on <st1:date month="6" day="30" year="1961">June 30, 1961</st1:date>, Section 25 of Reorganization
Plan No. 20-A had been declared unconstitutional by this Court in the case of <span class="SpellE">Corominas</span>, et <span style="">al. </span>v.
The Labor Standards Commission, et al., <u>supra</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears, however, that the plaintiff had
filed his claim before Regional Office No. 4 of the Department of Labor on <st1:date month="7" day="26" year="1960">July 26, 1960</st1:date>, or about one year before
said Section 25 had been declared unconstitutional.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The circumstance that Section 25 of <span style="">Reorganization Plan </span>No. 20-A had been
declared unconstitutional should not be counted against the defendant in the
present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of Manila
Motor Co., Inc. v. Flores, 99 Phil., <span style="">738,
this Court upheld the right of a party under the Moratorium Law which had
accrued in his favor before said </span>law was declared unconstitutional by
this Court in the <span style="">case </span>of <span class="SpellE">Rutter</span> v. Esteban, 93 Phil., 68.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, in its decision in the Manila
Motor case, quoted the following doctrine:</p>

<blockquote>"[t]here are several instances wherein
courts, out of equity, have relaxed its operation (cf. notes in Cooley's Consti­tutional
Limitations 8th ed., p. 383 and Notes 53 A.L.R., 273) or qualified <span style="">its </span>effects 'since the actual
existence of a statute prior to such declaration is an operative fact, and may
have consequences which cannot justly be ignored' (Chicot County vs. <span class="SpellE">Baster</span>, 308 U.S., 371) and a realistic approach is eroding
the general doctrine (Warring vs. <span class="SpellE">Colpoys</span>, 136 Am.
Law Rep., 1025, 1030)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">We believe that it is only fair and just
that the fore­going doctrine should be applied in favor of the plain­tiff in
the present case.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have noted in the record that it was precisely because Section
25 of Reorganization Plan No. 20-A was declared unconstitutional by this Court
on June 30, 1961 that the plaintiff, without awaiting the action of Region­al
Office No. 4 of the Department of Labor on the claim that he filed on July 26,
1960, instituted his action in the present <span style="">case </span>in the court below on December
17, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The move of plaintiff was
precisely intended to protect his right of action from the adverse effect of
the deci­sion of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Regional Office No. 4 of the Department of Labor dismissed plaintiff's claim on
Jan­uary 16, 1963 upon the ground that it had no more juris­diction to pass
upon the claim as a result of the ruling of this Court in the <span class="SpellE">Corominas</span> case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that from October, 1959 when plaintiff was separated
from the service up to July 26, 1960 when he filed his claim with Regional
Office No. 4 of the <span style="">De­partment of</span>
Labor only <span style="">eight </span>months had
elapsed, and that since July 26, 1960 until the filing of the complaint in the
court below on December 17, 1962 the running of pres­criptive period was deemed
interrupted, it <span style="">is </span>clear that
plaintiff's action to enforce his claim was not yet bar­red by the statute of
limitations when he filed his com­plaint in the court below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff's action may be considered as
brought before the court still within the period of three years from the time
his right of ac­tion accrued in accordance with the provisions of Sec­tion 17
of Republic Act 602 (Minimum Wage Law).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Only about nine months of the three-year period provided in Section 17
of Republic Act 602 may be considered as hav­ing lapsed when plaintiff
commenced his action in the court below.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And considering further that the amount sought to be recovered in the
complaint is more than P10,000.00, it follows that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
has the exclusive and original jurisdiction to entertain the action of the
plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court, therefore,
erred when it dismissed plaintiff's complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order appealed from is set aside, and this
case is remanded to the court below for further proceedings, with costs against
the defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">FERNANDO, <i>J</i>.:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The opinion of the Court
penned by Justice <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>, notable for its thorough
and comprehensive character, deserves full concurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That I readily give.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In view however of what for me is the full acceptance
by this Court that a legislative or executive measure sub­sequently annulled on
constitutional grounds, while neces­sarily devoid as a <u>source</u> of legal
right, should be considered as </span><span style="">a
</span><u><span style="">fact</span></u><span style=""> from which legal consequences may attach, I
would like to add a few words.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Where the assailed
legislative or executive act is found by the judiciary to be contrary to the
Constitution, it is null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">As the new Civil Code puts it:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"When the courts declare a law to be inconsistent with the Consti­tution,
the former shall be void and the latter shall govern.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Administrative or executive acts,
orders and regulations shall be valid only when they are not contrary to the <span style="">laws </span>or the Constitution." <a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The above provision of the Civil Code reflects the orthodox view that an
unconstitutional act, whether <span class="SpellE">legisIative</span> or
executive, is not a <span style="">law, </span>confers
no rights, imposes no duties, and affords no protection.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>This doctrine admits of
qualifications, however.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the
American Supreme Court stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The
actual existence of a statute prior to such a determination [of
constitutionality], is an operative fact and may have consequences which cannot
always be erased by <span style="">a </span>new
judicial declaration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The effect of the
subsequent ruling as to invalidity may have to be considered in various
aspects, - with respect to particular regulations, individual and corporate,
and particular conduct, private and official."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The orthodox <span style="">views </span>finds
support in the <span style="">well-settled </span><span style="">doctrine that
</span>the Constitution is supreme and provides the measure for the validity of
legislative or executive acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly
then, neither the legislative nor the <span style="">executive </span>branch, and for that matter, much <span style="">less, </span>this
Court, has power under the Constitution to act contrary to <span style="">its term.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Any attempted exercise of power in
violation of its pro­visions is to that extent unwarranted and null.</p>

<p class="BODY">The growing awareness of the role of the judiciary as the
governmental organ which has the final say on whether or<span style=""> </span>not <span style="">a </span>legislative
or executive measure is valid leads to <span style="">a
</span>more appreciative attitude of the emerging concept that a declaration of
nullity may have legal <span style="">consequences
which </span>the more orthodox view would deny.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That for <span style="">a </span>period of
time such a statute, treaty, executive order, or ordinance was in "actual
existence" appears to be indisputable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is more appropriate and logical then than to consider it as
"an operative <span class="GramE">fact.</span>"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> v.
Hill,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Manila Motor, Co. v. <st1:place>Flores</st1:place>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
and now this decision, such <span style="">a </span>view
has much more than propriety and logic in its favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is now settled law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is as it ought to be.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that it <span style="">is </span>one
<span style="">of </span>the basic presuppositions of
our constitutional polity, that the act of any branch of <span style="">the government is subject to judicial
scrutiny, the effect of which maybe to invalidate it for being
unconstitutional, it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">far from realistic, to </span><span style="">say </span><span style="">the least, to disregard completely its existence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More specifically, as the then Justice, now
Chief Justice, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> noted, while the validity
of Reorganization Plan </span><span style="">No. </span><span style="">20-A was debatable; it was nevertheless
"presumed valid until otherwise held by final judgment of a competent
court." Both reason and authority thus concur in the view that to treat
the matter as if such an executive regulation had never been would be far from
satisfying the ends of justice, not to say common sense.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> To <span class="GramE">repeat</span>, the

The <span class="SpellE">Corominas</span> decision, L-14837, <st1:date year="1961" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1961</st1:date>, is now authority for the
nullification as being un­constitutional of Section 25 of Reorganization Plan
No. 20-A granting to regional offices original and exclusive jurisdiction <span style="">over </span>money
claims of laborers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Originally, it
appeared to have limited itself to declaring such grant "null and void, *
* * having been made without authority of Republic Act No. 997." The later
case of Miller v. <span class="SpellE">Mardo</span>, L-15138, <st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="7"><span class="GramE">July</span> 31, 1961</st1:date>
expanded the ground for invalidity to include <span style="">a </span>violation of <span style="">constitutional precepts.</span></p>
