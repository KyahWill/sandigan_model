H.S. Reyes, Inc. as having a better right than the <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
Bros. Inc. and the Ayala Auto Parts Company, appellants herein, to the proceeds
of motor insurance policy A-0615, in the sum of P2,002.73, issued by the State

the H.S. Reyes, Inc.</p>

<p class="BODY">Enrique <span style="">Mora, </span>owner
of an Oldsmobile sedan model 1956, bearing plate No. QC-8088, mortgaged the
same to the H.S. Reyes, Inc., with the condition that the former would insure
the automobile, with the latter as beneficiary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The automobile was thereafter insured on June 23, 1959 with the State
Bonding &amp; Insurance Co. <span style="">Inc. </span>and
motor car insurance policy A-0615 was issued to <span class="SpellE">Enriqueta</span><span style=""> </span>Mora, the pertinent provisions of

<p class="BODY"><span style="">During the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the insurance contract, the car met with an
accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The insurance company then
assigned the accident to the H.H. Bayne Adjustment Co. for investigation and
appraisal of the damage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Enrique Mora,
without the knowledge and consent of the H.S. Reyes, Inc., authorized the <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Bros. Inc. to furnish the labor and materials,
some of which were supplied by the Ayala Auto Parts Co.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the cost of labor and materials, Enrique </span>Mora
<span style="">was billed at P2,102.73 through the
H.H. Bayne Adjustment Co.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The insurance
company, after claiming a franchise in the amount of P100, drew a check in the
amount of P2,002.73, </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">proceeds of the insurance policy, payable to
the order of Enrique Mora or H.S. Reyes, Inc., and entrusted the check to the
H.H. Bayne Adjustment Co. for disposition and delivery to the proper
party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, the car was </span>delivered
to Enrique Mora without the consent of the H.S. Re­yes, Inc., and without payment
to the <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Bros. Inc. and the Ayala Auto Parts
Co. of the cost of repairs and materials.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the theory that the insurance proceeds should be paid
directly to them, the <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Bros. Inc. and the
Ayala Auto Parts Co. filed on May <span style="">8,
1961 </span>a complaint with the Mu­nicipal Court of Manila against Enrique
Mora and the State Bonding &amp; Insurance Co. Inc. for the collection of the
sum of P2,002.73.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The insurance company
filed its answer with a counterclaim for <span class="SpellE">interpleader</span>,
requiring the <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Bros. Inc. and the H.S.
Reyes, Inc. to interplead in order to deter­mine who has a better right to the
insurance proceeds in ques­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Enrique
Mora was declared in default for failure to ap­pear at the hearing, and
evidence against him was received <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">parte</span></u></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>However,
the counsel for the <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Bros. Inc., Ayala Auto
Parts Co. and State Bonding &amp; Insurance Co. Inc. sub­mitted a stipulation
of facts, on the basis of <span style="">which </span>the
Muni­cipal Court rendered a decision declaring the H.S. Reyes, <span style="">Inc. </span>as having a better right to the
disputed amount, and ordering the State Bonding &amp; Insurance Co. Inc. to pay
to the <span class="SpellE">H.S.Reyes</span>, Inc. the said sum of
P2,002.73.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this decision, the
herein appellants elevated the case to the Court of First Instance of Manila
before which the stipulation of facts was reproduced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On October 19, 1962 the latter court rendered
a decision, affirming the decision of the Municipal Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Bros.
Inc. and the Ayala Auto Parts Co. moved for reconsideration of the decision,
but the trial court denied the motion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue raised is whether there is <span class="SpellE">privity</span>
of contract between the Bonifacio Bros. Inc. and the Ayala Auto Parts Co. on
the one hand and the <span style="">insurance </span>company
on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellants argue that
the insurance company and Enrique Mora are parties to the repair of the car as
well as the towage thereof performed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The authority for this assertion is to be found, it is alleged, in
paragraph <span style="">4 </span>of the insurance
contract which provides that "the insured may authorize the repair of the
Motor Vehicle necessitated by damage for which the company may be liable under
the policy provided that (a) the estimated cost of such repair does not exceed
the Authorized Repair Limit, and (b) a de­tailed estimate of the cost is
forwarded to the company without delay." It <span style="">is </span>stressed that the <span class="SpellE">H.H.Bayne</span>
Adjustment Company's recommendation of payment of the appellants' bill for
materials and repairs for which the latter drew a check for P2,002.73 in­dicates
that Mora and the <span class="SpellE">H.H.Bayne</span> Adjustment Co. acted for
and in representation of the <span style="">insurance
company.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This argument <span style="">is, </span>in
our view, beside the point, because from the undisputed facts and from the
pleadings it will be seen that the appellants' alleged cause of action rests
exclusively upon the terms of the insurance contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellants seek to recover the insurance
proceeds, and for this purpose, they rely upon paragraph <span style="">4 </span>of the insurance contract <span style="">document executed by and between the State
Bonding &amp; Insurance Company, Inc. and Enrique Mora.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellants are not mentioned in the
contract as parties thereto; nor is there any clause or provision thereof from
which we can infer that there </span><span style="">is
</span><span style="">an obligation on the part of the
insurance company to pay the cost of repairs directly to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is fundamental that contracts take effect
only </span>between <span style="">the parties
thereto, except in some specific instances provided by law where the contract
contains some stipulation in favor of a third person.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Such stipulation is known as
stipulation <u><span style="">pour</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>autrui</u></span>
or a provision in favor <span style="">of a third
person not a </span>party to the contract.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">Under this doctrine, a third
person is allowed to avail himself of a benefit granted to him by the terms of
the contract, provided that the </span>contracting parties <span style="">have </span>clearly <span style="">and </span>deliberately conferred a favor upon such person.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Consequently, a third person not <span style="">a </span><span style="">party to the contract has </span>no <span style="">action against the parties thereto, and
cannot generally demand the enforcement of the same.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The question of whether a third person has
an <span class="SpellE">enforcible</span> interest in a contract, must be settled
by determining whether the contracting parties intended to tender him such an
interest by deliberately </span>in<span style="">serting
terms </span>in <span style="">their </span>agreement <span style="">with the avowed purpose of conferring a favor
upon such third person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this con</span>nection,
<span style="">this Court has laid down the rule that
the fairest test to determine whether the interest of a third person in a
contract is a stipulation <u>pour</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>autrui</u></span>
or merely an </span>inci<span style="">dental interest,
is to rely upon the intention of </span>the parties as disclosed by their
contract.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
In the instant case the insurance contract does not contain any words or
clauses <span style="">to disclose </span>an <span style="">intent to </span>give <span style="">any benefit to any repairmen or <span class="SpellE">materialmen</span>
in case of repair of the car in question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The parties to the insurance contract omitted such stipulation, which is
a circumstance that </span>supports the said conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the "loss
payable" clause <span style="">of the insurance
policy stipulates that "Loss, </span><span style="">if
</span><span style="">any, is payable to <span class="SpellE">H.S.Reyes</span>, Inc." indicating that it was only the <span class="SpellE">H.S.Reyes</span>, Inc. </span>which <span style="">they intended to benefit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We likewise observe from
the brief of the State Bonding &amp; Insurance Company that it has vehemently
opposed the assertion or pretension of the appellants that they are privy to
the contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it </span>were <span style="">the intention of the insurance company to
make itself liable to the repair shop or <span class="SpellE">materialmen</span>,
it could have </span>easily <span style="">inserted in
the contract a stipulation to that effect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To hold now that the original parties to the insurance contract intended
to confer upon the appellants t</span>he benefit claimed by them would require
us to ignore the indispensable requisite that a stipulation <u><span style="">pour</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>autrui</u></span> must be clearly
expressed by the parties, which we cannot do.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards paragraph 4 of the insurance contract, a perusal
thereof would show that instead of establishing <span class="SpellE">privity</span>
between the appellants and the insurance company, such stipulation merely
establishes the procedure that the insured has to follow in order to be entitled
to indemnity for repair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This paragraph
therefore should not be construed as bringing into existence in favor of the
appellants a right of action against the insurance company as such in­tention
can never be inferred <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another cogent reason for not recognizing a right of action by
the appellants against the insurance company is that "a policy of
insurance is a distinct and independent contract between the insured and
insurer, and third persons have no right either in a court of equity, or in a court
of law, to the proceeds of it, unless there be some contract of trust,
expressed or implied, by the insured and third person".<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
In this case, no contract of trust, expressed or implied exists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We, therefore, agree with the trial court
that no cause of action exists in favor of the appellants in so far as the
proceeds of <span style="">insurance </span>are
concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellants' claim, <span style="">if </span>at all, <span style="">is </span>merely equitable in nature and must be made effective through
Enrique Mora who entered into a contract with the <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
Bros. Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This conclusion is deducible
not <span style="">only </span>from the principle
governing the operation and effect of insurance contracts in general, but is
clearly covered by the express provisions of section <span style="">50 </span>of the Insurance Act which read:</p>

<blockquote>"The insurance shall be applied exclusively to the proper
interest of the person in whose name <span style="">it
is made unless otherwise specified in the policy."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">The
policy in question has been so framed that "Loss, if any, is payable to
H.S. Reyes, Inc.," which unmistakably shows the intention of the parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The final contention of the appellants is that the right of the
H. S. Reyes, Inc. to the insurance proceeds arises only if there was loss and
not where there is mere damage as <span style="">in </span>the
instant case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to say that any
attempt to draw a distinction between "loss" and "damage"
is uncalled for, because the word "loss" in insurance law <span style="">e</span>mbraces injury or damage.</p>

<blockquote>"<u>Loss in insurance, defined</u>.- <span style="">The injury or damage sustained by the insured in consequence of the
happening of one or more of the accidents or misfor</span>tune against which
the insurer, in consideration or the premium, has undertaken to indemnify the
insured." (1 <span class="SpellE">Bouv</span>. Ins. No. 1215; Black's Law
Dictionary; <span class="SpellE">Cyclopedic</span> Law Dictionary, cited in
Martin's Phil. Commercial Laws, Vol. 1, 1961 ed. p. 608)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Indeed, according to sec. 120 of the
Insurance Act, a loss <span style="">may be either </span>total
or partial.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">ACCORDINGLY</span></b><span style="">, the </span>judgment appealed from is hereby
<span style="">affirmed, </span>at appellants' cost.</p>
