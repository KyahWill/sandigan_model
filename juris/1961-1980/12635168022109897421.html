				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for review by certiorari of the decision of the Court of
Appeals in CA-G. R. No. 00779-CR.</p>

<p class="BODY">Jovencio Luansing was originally charged with rape in Criminal
Case No. 1240 before the Court of First Instance of Batangas (Lipa City
Branch).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due trial the court
dismissed the case, stating that no crime of rape was com­mitted, but directed
the Provincial Fiscal to file an in­formation for seduction against the accused
within ten (10) days from receipt of the copy of the decision, otherwise the
said accused would be discharged from custody.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On
August 15, 1958 the offended party, Felisa Hernandez, filed a complaint for
seduction against the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
basis thereof the corresponding information was filed by the Fiscal, as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 10th day of July, 1957, in the Barrio of
San Roque, Municipality of Sto. Tomas, Province of Batangas, Philippines, and
within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court the above-named accused by
means of deceit and false promise of marriage, did then and there wilfully,
unlawfully and feloniously seduce and have sexual <span style="">intercourse several times with one Felisa
Hernandez, a virgin over 12 but under 18 years of age."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This information <span style="">was
later </span>amended by the Fiscal to change the date of the alleged commission
of the crime from July 10, 1957 to July 15, 1957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the trial the private prosecutor made <span style="">a </span>reservation
to file a separate civil action and from then on the prosecution was handled
solely by the assistant Provincial Fiscal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> subsequently rendered judgment finding the
accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of seduction and sentencing
him to suffer four (4) months of <u>arresto</u> <u><span style="">mayor</span></u><span style="">; </span>to
indemnify the offended party in the sum of P2,000.00, with the corresponding
subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, but not to exceed one-third of
the principal penalty; to acknowledge his offspring with her; to give the said
offspring a monthly support of P35.00; and to pay the costs and suffer all
accessory penalties prescribed by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner seasonably appealed to the Court of Appeals, which
affirmed <u>in</u> <u>toto</u> the judgment of the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion for reconsideration having been
denied, the accused filed the instant petition for review.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner avers here:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
that the trial court acted without jurisdiction when it tried the case on the
basis of the amended information without the corresponding amended complaint of
the offended party; (2) that the trial court had no jurisdiction over the case,
it being under the jurisdiction of the municipal court; and (3) that assuming
that the trial court had jurisdiction over the case, the same was exceeded when
it awarded damages and other civil liabilities to the offended party, there
having been a reservation to file a separate civil action.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the first averment it appears that the Fiscal filed the
information for seduction on August 15, 1958, after conducting a preliminary
investigation upon the complaint presented by the offended party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On September 16 following, the Fiscal
conducted another preliminary investigation, after which he filed an amended
information changing the date of the commission of the offense from July 10,
1957 to July 15, 1957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This amended
information, petitioner argues, was a nullity since there was no corresponding
amended complaint of the offended party which would authorize another
preliminary investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The point raised is of no material consequence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The original information for seduction
alleged that the offense was committed "on or about July 10, 1957."
The phrase "on or about" <span style="">is </span>comprehensive enough to cover the change
to July 15, 1957, as the evidence in the hands of the prosecutor
indicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The substantial rights of the
accused were in no way prejudiced by the amendment.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the issue of jurisdiction, Section 44(f), Republic Act No.
296, as amended, provides that Courts of First Instance have original
jurisdiction of "all criminal cases in which the penalty provided by <span style="">law </span>is
imprisonment for more than six months, or a fine of more than two hundred
pesos," and section 87(b) of the <span style="">same </span>Act provides that Justice of the Peace
and Municipal Courts have original jurisdiction over <span style="">"all </span>offenses in which the
penalty pro­vided by Law <span style="">is </span>imprisonment for not more than six months, or a fine of not
more than two hundred pesos, or both such fine and imprisonment." The
penalty imposed by Article 338 of the Revised Penal Code for the crime of
simple seduction is <u><span style="">arresto</span></u><span style=""> <u>mayor</u></span> <span style="">the </span>duration of which is from one month and one day to six
months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, the crime of simple
seduction falls under the original jurisdiction of the Justice of the Peace or
Municipal Courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, it should not
be overlooked that persons guilty of seduction shall also be sentenced to
indemnify the offended woman, to acknowledge the offspring unless the law
should prevent him from so doing, and to give support to such offspring
(Article 345, Revised Penal Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
are inherent accessory civil liabilities when a child <span style="">is </span>born <span style="">as a </span>result of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The acknowledgment of, and the giving of
support to, the offspring are matters beyond the jurisdiction of the Justice of
the Peace or <span style="">Municipal
</span>Courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They pertain to the
Courts of First Instance (Section 44(a) and (e), Republic Act No. 296).</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been held that laws conferring jurisdiction on the
inferior courts over demands below certain amounts do not preclude <span style="">a </span>determination
of said demands in the superior court, where they are connected with larger
claims <span style="">or
with a type of demand solely within the jurisdiction of the superior
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus for instance, where an
action is within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance be­cause it
involves an issue of admiralty, the said court must be held likewise to have
jurisdiction over other causes of action joined thereto even if the amount
sought to, be col­lected <span style="">is </span>less
than the jurisdictional limit (Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. vs. Cia. General de
Tabacos de Filipinas, G. R. No. L-22625, April 27, 1967).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In like manner, since the crime of seduction
carries with it a liability, under Article 345 of the Revised Penal Code, to
acknowledge and give support to the offspring resulting from the crime -
matters beyond the jurisdiction of the Justice of the Peace or Municipal Courts
- it follows that the instant case falls within the jurisdiction of the Court
of First Instance (U.S. vs. Ber­nardo, 19 Phil. 265).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be absurd to have the prin­cipal
case of seduction tried and decided by the Municipal Court and the resulting
acknowledgment and support of the offspring by the Court of First
Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The duplication would entail
unnecessary waste of time and effort for the parties and for the courts, to the
detriment of an orderly administration of justice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It
</span><span style="">is </span><span style="">further contended that the amended information was
legally defective for failure to allege lewd design.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reliance is placed on the case of People vs.
Gilo, G. R. No. L-18202, April 30, 1964, wherein it was held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Considering that in order that <span style="">a crime </span>constituting acts of
lasciviousness may be committed it is necessary that it be alleged that it was
committed with lewd design, the latter being an indispensable element of all
crimes against chastity, such as abduction, seduction and rape, including <span style="">acts of lasciviousness x x x the words
'feloniously and criminally" that are alleged in the complaint are mere
general terms which denote the criminal intent of the accused but which do not
necessarily con­note the idea of lust needed in the com­mission of the
act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lust or lewd design is an element
that characterizes all crimes against chastity, apart from the felonious or
criminal intent of the offender, and </span><span style="">such element must be always present in order
that they may be so considered in contempla­tion of law.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In People vs. Obsania, G. R. No. L-24447, June 29, 1968, which
involved a case of rape, we had occasion to pass upon the above-quoted decision
in this wise:</p>

<blockquote>"Nothing in the foregoing statement can be reasonably
interpreted as requiring an explicit allegation of "lewd design" in a
complaint for rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold in no
uncertain terms that in a complaint for rape it is not necessary to allege
"lewd design" or "unchaste motive," for to re­quire such
averment is to demand a patent superfluity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Lascivious intent inheres in rape and the unchaste design is mani­fest
in the very act itself - the carnal knowledge of a woman through force or
intimidation, or when the woman is <span style="">deprived of reason or otherwise uncon­scious, or
when the woman is, under twelve of age."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">By the same token, "lewd design" is inherent in the
very act itself of having sexual intercourse with a chaste woman over 12 and
under 18 years of age under a false pro­mise of marriage, which act constitutes
the crime of seduction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the
Gilo case involved acts of lasciviousness, and the element of "lewd
design" must necessarily be alleged in the information, because without it
the offense would be merely unjust vexation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, petitioner contends that the trial court exceeded its
jurisdiction when it awarded damages and other civil liabilities despite the
express reservation by the offended woman, through the private prosecutor, to file
a separate civil action.</p>

<p class="BODY">On this point the Court of Appeals ruled that "if the
complainant had wanted to insist on filing a separate civil action for damages
against the appellant, she would have filed <span style="">a </span>motion to reconsider the decision <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> of September 14, 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
fact that she did not take this step is clear proof that she had previously
abandoned her reservation to file <span style="">a </span>separate civil action." We do not go
along with this pronouncement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Abandonment requires a more convincing quantum of evidence than mere
forbearance to actually file the civil action, especially considering that the
same could be filed even after the decision in <span style="">a criminal case </span>had been
rendered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the claim for damages
requires proof, and contemplates a right on the part of the defendant to
present his own rebuttal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it was,
neither the offended party nor the accused was accorded the chance to present <span style="">evidence on the point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sane is true with regard to the amount of
support for the offspring.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">Wherefore</b>, the
decision subject of review is hereby modified by eliminating the award of
damages and of support for the offspring, and affirmed in all other
respects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to costs
in this instance.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BARREDO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the decision in this case, but I wish to make it
known that as regards the legal proposition stated therein that "where an
action <span style="">is </span>within
the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance because it involves an issue of
admiralty, the said court must be held likewise to have jurisdiction over other
causes of action joined thereto even if the amount sought to be collected is
less than the jurisdictional limit", without which, I believe, the Court's
judgment can very well stand as it is, I have my own thinking and considered
opinion which I have discussed in Our decision in the case of Insurance Company
of North America vs. Osaka <span class="SpellE">Shosen</span> <span class="SpellE">Kaiska</span>
(O.S.K.-Line) et <span class="SpellE">als</span>., G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-22784.</span>
It <span style="">is </span>to
be admitted that aside from the fact that the case of Fireman's Fund Insurance
Co. v. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Cia</span></span>, General de <span class="SpellE">Tabacos</span> de Filipinas, G. R. No. L-22625, April 27, 1967,
cited in support thereof does sustain <span class="GramE">it,</span> <span style="">the said pro­position is fully in accord with
Section 5 of Rule 2, </span>particularly its second paragraph which provides
thus:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 5.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Joinder</span></span><span class="GramE"> of causes of action.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- Subject to rules regarding jurisdiction, venue and <span class="SpellE">joinder</span>
of parties, <span style="">a
</span><span style="">party may in one pleading state,
in the alter­native or otherwise, as <span class="GramE">many</span> causes of </span>action
as he may have against an oppos­<span style="">ing
party (a) if the </span>said causes of action arise out of the same contract,
transaction or relation between the <span style="">parties,
or (b) if the causes of action are for demands for money, or are of the same
nature and character.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the cases falling under clause (a) of the preceding
paragraph, the action shall be filed in the inferior court un­less any of the
causes joined falls with­in the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance, in
which case it <span style="">shall </span><span style="">be </span>filed in
the latter court.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"In the cases </span><span style="">falling under
clause (b) the jurisdiction shall be </span><span style="">determined by the aggregate amount of the demands, if for money, or by
their nature </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">charac­ter, if
otherwise."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Nonetheless, I have my observations
regarding precisely the second paragraph of this quoted provision itself which
I feel is relevant and may be of interest to the bench and the bar.</p>
