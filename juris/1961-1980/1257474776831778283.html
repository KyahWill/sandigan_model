<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Defendant <span class="SpellE">Urbano</span> <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> seeks the reversal 
of a decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, convicting him of the crime of parricide and 
sentencing him to life imprisonment, with the accessory penalties prescribed by 
law, and to indemnify the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Raymunda</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> in the sum of P6, 000, without subsidiary 
imprisonment in case of insolvency, as well as to pay the 
costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Urbano</span> <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> was married to <span class="SpellE">Raymunda</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>, who admittedly 
died, in her house, in the barrio of San Agustin, municipality of Victoria, 
<span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, in the evening of February 10 to 11, 1959, in 
consequence of four (4) stab wounds in the thorax, on the left side of the 
mammary line, aside from several injuries sustained in other parts of the body, 
The only question for determination in this case is the identity of the 
culprit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The main direct evidence for the 
prosecution consists of the testimony of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Valdoz</span>, who was about seven (7) years of age, at the time of 
the occurrence. Antonio's mother is <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>, a sister of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Raymunda</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>, with whom Antonio 
lived because she was childless. He testified that <span class="SpellE">Raymunda</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> was crying when 
appellant returned home late in the evening of February 10 to 11, 1959; that, 
soon thereafter, the spouses quarreled with each other; that, in the course of 
the quarrel, appellant held <span class="SpellE">Raymunda</span> by the neck, and 
then wounded her several times with a scythe; that, subsequently, appellant put 
off the lamp and then left; and that, overcome with fear, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Valdoz</span>, likewise, left appellant's house and went to that of 
his aunt Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span>, whom he told that <span class="SpellE">Raymunda</span> was dead already, but Magdalena bade him to sleep, 
which he did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The theory of the defense is to 
the effect that, from 8:00 p. on February 10, 1959, to 5:00 a.m., the next 
morning, appellant in the house of his brother, <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span>, about a kilometer 
away from the scene of the occurrence, helping butcher, slice and cook a pig and 
two goats, which were served during a party to celebrate the baptism of <span class="SpellE">Macario's</span> children, which took place later, on February 11, 
1959; that, when appellant reached his house, at about 6:00 a.m., he found his 
wife dead, with the injuries adverted to above; and that, sometime later, that 
same morning, lie noticed that the P200, in cash, he and his wife kept at the 
foot of a cardboard, were missing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In addition to his testimony, 
appellant introduced the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Escolastica</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Gadia</span> and Feliciano Cordova, as regards his presence 
in the house of his brother <span class="SpellE">Macario</span>, in the evening of 
February 10 to 11, 1959. Through the testimony of Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span>, he, likewise, tried to prove that Antonio <span class="SpellE">Valdoz</span> could not have witnessed the killing of <span class="SpellE">Raymunda</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>, because Antonio 
had spent said evening in her (Magdalena' s) house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The lower court gave no credence 
to these witnesses for the defense, and accepted the version of the prosecution. 
Hence, the judgment appealed from. Upon a review of the record, we find no 
plausible reason to interfere with the findings of fact and the conclusions 
reached by His Honor, the trial Judge, who was in a better position than we are 
to pass upon the veracity of the opposing witnesses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Indeed, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Valdoz</span> had, admittedly, no possible motive to falsely 
incriminate appellant herein. What is more, the former owed gratitude to the 
latter for having, in effect, adopted and treated him as his own son. Besides, 
the house of <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> 
was only a kilometer away from that of herein appellant, who could have slipped 
away from <span class="SpellE">Macario's</span> house and gone to his 
(appellant's) own house, sometime after midnight, and then, after committing the 
crime charged, returned to the house of <span class="SpellE">Macario</span>, to 
mingle with those helping in the preparations for the forthcoming baptismal 
party, and thus bolster up his alibi. Then, too, it is not unlikely that 
appellant returned home earlier than he would have us believe, and then 
committed said crime, in the manner testified to by Antonio <span class="SpellE">Valdoz</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">More important, still, is the 
fact that his (Antonio's) testimony has been corroborated by a number of 
circumstances, about which there can be no doubt. Thus, for instance, he left 
appellant's house in the evening of the occurrence, and spent part of it in 
another house. Antonio testified that he did so because of the fear generated by 
the commission, in his presence, of the crime charged. In fact, when he went to 
Magdalena's house said evening, he told her that <span class="SpellE">Raymunda</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> was dead already. 
This testimony was, in turn, confirmed by the fact that, upon seeing his mother 
the next morning - while she was proceeding to appellant's house, but before 
either she or he had reached the same - Antonio embraced her and said, weeping: 
"My Aunt <span class="SpellE">Andang</span> (<span class="SpellE">Raymunda's</span> 
nickname) is dead; my uncle <span class="SpellE">Banong</span> (appellant's 
nickname) killed her."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Soon, later, that same morning, 
Pat. Pacheco of the local police force, who investigated the occurrence, noticed 
that Antonio <span class="SpellE">Valdoz</span> was not in appellant's house and 
located him in that of his natural parents, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Valdoz</span> and <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>. As Pacheco inquired about the reason for his 
presence in the latter's house, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Valdoz</span> 
replied: "I am afraid to go back to the house" of appellant and his deceased 
wife. Pacheco asked for the reason of his fear, whereupon Antonio replied that 
"<span class="SpellE">Tatang</span> <span class="SpellE">Banong</span>" had killed 
"<span class="SpellE">Nanang</span> <span class="SpellE">Andang</span>." When 
Pacheco and Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Custodio</span>, thereafter, brought 
him to appellant's house, Antonio began to cry and told them that he was afraid. 
Prompted to explain what he was afraid of, the boy answered: "<span class="SpellE">Tatang</span> co <span class="SpellE">Banong</span> <span class="SpellE">patay</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">Nanang</span> co <span class="SpellE">Andang</span>. " Urged to- 
describe how appellant had killed his wife, Antonio answered: "<span class="SpellE">dugsol</span>, <span class="SpellE">dugsol</span>, <span class="SpellE">dugsol</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nanang</span>," meaning that he 
"stabbed, and stabbed and stabbed, auntie." As he searched appellant's house 
Pacheco found tucked into one of its walls a wet bolo or scythe (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>, C) with blood stains near the ring around the base of 
the blade. Upon seeing the scythe, Antonio said: "That is the instrument. That 
is the instrument with which my uncle stabbed my Aunt."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This, in substance, was 
reiterated by Antonio in an affidavit made that same date, before the justice of 
the peace of Victoria, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, and at the preliminary 
investigation conducted the next day. He similarly testified before Judge <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> - who presided over 
the lower court, when this case was first heard in 1961 - and, later, in 1963 - 
upon Judge <span class="SpellE">Aquino's</span> retirement - before his successor 
in office.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Again, <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>, father of the 
deceased, testified that, sometime before the occurrence, he had overheard 
appellant and his wife quarreling in their house, which was only six (6) meters 
away from his own dwelling; that, the argument between said couple was due to 
the illicit relations of appellant with his cousin and neighbor, Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span>; and that, on January 8, 1959, <span class="SpellE">Raymunda</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> reported to her 
father that, three (3) days before, she had caught appellant having carnal 
relations with Magdalena, in the latter's house, and that they threatened to 
kill her (<span class="SpellE">Raymunda</span>) if she did not stop "broadcasting" 
their affair.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In addition, the records disclose 
inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>, the following circumstances, indicating 
that the theory of the prosecution is substantially true, and that the evidence 
for the defense merits no credence, namely:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">1. An <span class="SpellE">echymosis</span> on the anterior left forearm of the deceased, 
indicating that she had struggled with her assailant, was confirmed by a scratch 
on appellant's left forearm, which he tried to explain by saying that it had 
been caused by the pig slaughtered in the house of his brother <span class="SpellE">Macario</span>;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">2. Clotted spots of blood were 
found on the left pocket of his polo shirt and on the portion of his trousers 
corresponding to his left thigh and left leg. Admittedly, the blood was that of 
the deceased, although appellant would have us believe that it was due to the 
fact that, upon finding her dead, he lifted her body and brought it to the 
living room of their house. However, said spots were caused by the spurting 
blood of a person still alive or who was dying, according to the <span class="SpellE">unimpeached</span> testimony of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Briones</span>, the municipal health officer of 
Victoria;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">3. Appellant did not report the 
death of his wife either to the authorities or even to his father-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>, whose house was 
only a few meters away from that of appellant. In fact, when <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> expressed the wish to have the death of his 
daughter investigated, appellant objected thereto, saying: "Why should you ask 
for the investigation when she is already dead?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">4. The scythe with which <span class="SpellE">Raymunda</span> had been wounded, according to Antonio <span class="SpellE">Valdoz</span>, was found washed - although still with traces of 
human blood - and tucked in a wall of appellant's house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">5. By testifying that, soon after 
he had found his wife dead, he noticed the disappearance of P200, appellant 
sought to insinuate that robbery was the motive for her assassination. However, 
he had never mentioned the alleged loss of said amount to the peace officers who 
investigated him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">6. The witnesses for the defense, 
namely, <span class="SpellE">Escolastica</span> <span class="SpellE">Gadia</span>, 
Feliciano Cordova and Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span>, were 
appellant's cousin-in-law, brother-in-law and cousin, respectively, apart from 
the fact that their testimony are contradictory in many respects. It may not be 
amiss to note, moreover, that Magdalena is the alleged mistress of appellant 
herein, who, likewise, tried to deny his relationship with <span class="SpellE">Gadia</span> and Cordova.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Being in accordance with the 
facts and the law, the decision appealed from should be, as it is hereby, 
affirmed, with costs against the appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">IT IS SO 
ORDERED.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
