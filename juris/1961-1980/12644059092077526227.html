<span class="SpellE">Gumagamof</span>, municipality of <span class="SpellE">Lala</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del Norte, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Lumayag</span> was up in a coconut tree gathering tuba while his 
wife, <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> <span class="SpellE">Pampilo</span>, 
was on the ground lighting him with the beam of a flashlight Suddenly he heard a 
thud and a shout for help. Recognizing the shout to be that of Jose <span class="SpellE">Pampilo</span>, his father-in-law, he hurriedly went down from the 
coconut tree, snatched the flashlight and, together with his wife, ran towards 
the place where the shout came from. They heard the sound of hard beating and 
the groaning of man. Pedro <span class="SpellE">Lumayag</span> then directed his 
flashlight towards and saw <span class="SpellE">Agrecio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumayag</span>, wearing a red shirt and <span class="SpellE">maong</span> pants, straddled over a person by the road with his 
hands around the person's neck. <span class="SpellE">Agrecio</span> thereupon 
jumped and ran away towards his house about 300 meters from the scene.</p>
<p>Pedro <span class="SpellE">Lumayag</span> and his wife approached the person 
lying face down and recognized him as Jose <span class="SpellE">Pampilo</span>, 
who sustained injuries in the nape and bruises in the right cheek, and was 
bleeding. One meter away from him was his hat and nearby <span class="GramE">were</span> two empty bottles of liquor.</p>
<p>The spouses, upon verifying that Jose <span class="SpellE">Pampilo</span> was 
already dead, forthwith reported the incident to the barrio lieutenant who, in 
turn, sent a rural policeman to notify the chief of police. Pedro <span class="SpellE">Lumayag</span> and his wife, accompanied by the barrio lieutenant, 
returned to the scene of the crime. They found the body of Jose <span class="SpellE">Pampilo</span> lying on its back with the hat on. The chief of 
police, several policemen and the municipal health officer arrived later.</p>
<p>Acting upon the account given by Pedro <span class="SpellE">Lumayag</span>, the 
chief of Police dispatched some policemen to summon <span class="SpellE">Agrecio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumayag</span>. The policeman 
found only <span class="SpellE">Agrecio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumayag's</span> 
wife in his house but, upon further search, found him hiding in a nearby shack 
armed with a bolo and a cane.</p>
<p>The policemen brought <span class="SpellE">Agrecio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumayag</span> to the chief of police. Asked by the chief of police 
whether or not he killed Jose <span class="SpellE">Pampilo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Agrecio</span> stated that he would <span class="GramE">answer</span> 
the question in the municipal building. Further asked what attire he had that 
afternoon, he answered that he wore a red shirt and <span class="SpellE">maong</span> pants. The red shirt and <span class="SpellE">maong</span> pants were later taken by the chief of police from 
<span class="SpellE">Agrecio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumayag's</span> house and 
brought to the municipal building.</p>
<p>The municipal health officer, in a postmortem examination of the deceased, 
found a fracture and contused wounds at the base of the skull, which may have 
been indicted by a blunt instrument, and swelling on the right side of the face, 
lower jaw and the neck.</p>
<p>In the municipal building that same evening the chief of police interrogated 
<span class="SpellE">Agrecio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumayag</span> but the 
latter refused to make a statement and instead promised to do so the following 
morning. No investigation, however, was conducted" next morning inasmuch as the 
chief of police left for <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Iligan</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> at about <st1:time hour="13" minute="0">one o'clock</st1:time> in the morning and came back only at <st1:time hour="17" minute="30">5:30</st1:time> in the afternoon. <span class="SpellE">Agrecio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumayag</span>, upon being again 
investigated by the chief of police, eventually confessed that he killed Jose 
<span class="SpellE">Pampilo</span> with a cane called "<span class="SpellE">bahi</span>". He also indicated the place where he threw the cane 
when somebody focused at him a flashlight. A policeman scoured the area 
indicated by <span class="SpellE">Agrecio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumayag</span> 
and there found the cane.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the provincial fiscal filed <span class="GramE">an 
information</span> in the Court of First Instance charging <span class="SpellE">Agrecio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumayag</span> with the crime of 
murder.</p>
<p>After entering a plea of not guilty and standing trial, <span class="SpellE">Agrecio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumayag</span> was found guilty 
by the trial court in its judgment of <st1:date month="2" day="24" year="1961">February 24, 1961</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which states:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"<b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court declares, as is hereby declared, accused <span class="SpellE">Agrecio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumayag</span> Guilty beyond 
reasonable doubt of Murder as charged, penalized under Art. 248 with the 
aggravating circumstance of treachery and <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span>, 
with the mitigating circumstance of vindication of a wrong he having been boxed 
and physically injured by the deceased, which fact, although not immediate, is 
considered by the Court as attenuating. He is, therefore, sentenced to suffer an 
imprisonment of Thirty Years of <u>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span> 
</u>and to pay the costs of this present suit. He is further sentenced to 
indemnity the heirs of the deceased SIX THOUSAND PESOS (P6<span class="GramE">,000</span>), and in case of insolvency, no further subsidiary 
imprisonment shall be imposed."</p></blockquote>
<p>Accordingly, the accused has appealed to this court.</p>
<p>For his defense of alibi the accused testified to the following: At about 
<st1:time hour="16" minute="0">four o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon of 
<st1:date month="4" day="12" year="1959">April 12, 1959</st1:date> he and his 
wife left <span class="SpellE">Gufnagamof</span> by truck for <span class="SpellE">Baroy</span>. From there they crossed 
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pangil</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>Bay</st1:placetype></st1:place> by <span class="SpellE">banca</span> to <span class="SpellE">Tangub</span> arriving at about 
<st1:time hour="18" minute="0">six o'clock</st1:time> in the evening. From the 
time of their arrival, they stayed in <span class="SpellE">Tangub</span>, 
particularly in the house of a quack doctor, <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Melbar</span>, until 
<st1:time hour="18" minute="0">six o'clock</st1:time> in the morning of 
<st1:date month="4" day="14" year="1959">April 14, 1959</st1:date>, during which 
time appellant was treated by <span class="SpellE">Melbar</span>. They returned to 
<span class="SpellE">Gumagamof</span> only on April 14, arriving there at about 
<st1:time hour="8" minute="0">eight o'clock</st1:time> in the morning, 
accompanied by <span class="SpellE">Melbar</span>, to whom the accused promised to 
give a rooster. Shortly thereafter, a policeman arrived and arrested the accused 
for the murder of Jose <span class="SpellE">Pampilo</span>.</p>
<p>The trial court did not give credence to appellant's alibi, observing that it 
was improbable for appellant to have been able to travel to <span class="SpellE">Tangub</span> if he was really sick. It also found the testimony of 
the quack doctor, in support of appellant's alibi, unreliable.</p>
<p>Appellant's afore-stated alibi cannot prevail in the face of the positive 
testimonies of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Lumayag</span> and <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> <span class="SpellE">Pampilo</span> definitely 
identifying him as the very person whom they saw on top of Jose <span class="SpellE">Pampilo's</span> prostrate body (People v. Ramos, L-17402-03, 
August 31, 1963). Furthermore, the chief of police of <span class="SpellE">Lala</span> testified that on the night of the incident he caused 
the accused to be apprehended and detained him in the municipal building for 
investigation; that in the afternoon of April 13 the accused, still under 
detention, confessed to having killed Jose <span class="SpellE">Pampilo</span> 
with a cane called "<span class="SpellE">bahi</span>" which he threw away about a 
hundred yards from the .scene of the crime. As stated, the cane was later found 
in the very place indicated by the accused.</p>
<p>Appellant further questions mug the credibility of the testimonies of Pedro 
<span class="SpellE">Lumayag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> <span class="SpellE">Pampilo</span> and the chief of police of <span class="SpellE">Lala</span>. He lays emphasis on the testimony of barrio lieutenant 
Luis <span class="SpellE">Ecat</span>, who stated that Pedro <span class="SpellE">Lumayag</span> and <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> <span class="SpellE">Pampilo</span>, in reporting, to him, could not identify the 
killer. The record of this case discloses no sufficient motive on the part of 
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Lumayag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Pampilo</span> and the chief of police to testify falsely 
against the accused. On the other hand, it has been shown by the defense that 
the deceased was hated in the community, so that a feeling of hatred may have 
influenced Luis <span class="SpellE">Ecat</span>. The trial court, at any rate, 
did not believe him. Appellate courts as a rule desist from disturbing the 
findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses, for the latter is 
in a better position to appreciate the same, having seen and heard the witnesses 
themselves and observed their behavior and manner of testifying during the 
trial. We find no reason to depart from this settled practice, since it has not 
been shown that the trial court has overlooked certain facts of substance and 
value that, if considered, might affect the result of the case (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Curiano</span>, L-15256-57, October 31, 1963).</p>
<p>Finally, appellant contends that the trial court erred in finding him guilty 
of murder in spite of the failure of the prosecution to establish treachery and 
<span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span> as qualifying circumstances. For the same 
reason, the Solicitor General recommends a judgment for homicide instead of 
murder. The information cites as qualifying circumstances "treachery, evident 
premeditation and taking advantage of <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span> to 
better insure the commission of the offense". As appellant points out, however, 
these aggravating circumstances were not proved. While there is sufficient 
evidence to establish the killing of Jose <span class="SpellE">Pampilo</span> by 
the accused, there is none, however, to show that he acted with treachery or 
evident premeditation or that he specially sought the advantage of night time to 
facilitate the crime. We may therefore apply the doctrine laid down in U.S. v. 
<span class="SpellE">Banagale</span>, 24 Phil. 69, to the effect that when the 
details and circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime are unknown, 
and there appears no evidence in the case that may indicate the situation of the 
victim when he was killed, or when it is not conclusively shown that the violent 
death of a person attended by any of the qualifying circumstances specified in 
Article 248, the crime must be classified as homicide, and not murder.</p>
<p>The record shows that on <st1:date month="7" day="8" year="1958">July 8, 
1958</st1:date>, the deceased boxed the accused several times in the face, for 
which the deceased was subsequently convicted of less serious physical injuries 
by the justice of the peace court of <span class="SpellE">Lala</span>. The 
deceased appealed to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> and at the time the accused killed the deceased the 
case was still pending therein. In view of the length of time, approximately 
nine months, between the boxing incident and the killing of Jose <span class="SpellE">Pampilo</span>, it cannot be said that the second incident was an 
immediate or a proximate vindication of the first Accordingly, the court <u>a 
quo</u> should not have considered it as a mitigating circumstances under 
paragraph 5, Article 13 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>
<p><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, appellant is hereby found guilty beyond 
reasonable doubt of the crime of homicide without any mitigating or aggravating 
circumstances, and condemned to suffer an indeterminate sentence of six (6) 
years and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u> mayor</u> 
as minimum to fourteen (14) years, and eight (8) months and one (1) day of 
<u>reclusion temporal</u> as maximum, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in 
the amount of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, and to pay the cost. It is so 
ordered.</p>
