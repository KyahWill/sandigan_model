				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for mandamus to compel the respondent judge to take 
cognizance of petitioner's request for a new certificate of title.
<p>On January 6, 1960, herein petitioner filed in the respondent's court a 
petition "for amendment of title" wherein she alleged: that she was the 
registered owner of a parcel of land in Quezon City under Transfer Certificate 
of Title No. 19979 in the name of "Florentina Mata de Stuart, Filipino, of age, 
married to Eugenio Stuart etc."; that the latter died in 1950, and was survived 
by their four children namely P. M. Stuart del Rosario, Josefina S. del Rosario, 
Bernardo Stuart del Rosario and Jose Stuart del Rosario; and that the said 
children recognizing that the land belonged to her as paraphernal property, 
signed the quitclaim deed annexed to the petition. Wherefore, she prayed for an 
order to the Register of Deeds for Quezon City for the corresponding amendment 
on said Transfer Certificate of Title No. 19979 or a new certificate in her 
name, Florentina Mata de Stuart, Filipino, of age, widow.</p>
<p>The Court denied the petition, expressing the opinion that the case was not 
one contemplated in Sec. 112 of Act No. 496, because the petition in effect 
calls for a declaration that the property in question is a paraphernal property 
of the petitioner. Her motion to reconsider having failed, petitioner instituted 
this petition for mandamus to compel the respondent to assume jurisdiction over 
the petition.</p>
<p>We think the Court took a restricted view of its powers. Under Art. 112 of 
Act 496, a registered owner may at any time, apply for relief by petition to the 
court upon the ground that * * *. "The registered owner has been married, or if 
registered as married, that the marriage has been terminated." And the court 
shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the petition "after notice to all 
parties in interest * * * to order the entry of a new certificate."</p>
<p>It may be true that the grant of the petition and the issuance of a new 
certificate as requested, amounts to a declaration that the property is 
paraphernal; but that is no objection since even under the present certificate, 
in the name of "Florentina Mata de Stuart, Filipino, of age, married to Eugenio 
Stuart" the property appears to be paraphernal property.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Where all the properties in question are registered in the name of 'M. R. 
married to R. L.,' such circumstance indicated that the said properties belong 
to the registered owner, M. R., as her paraphernal properties, for if they were 
conjugal, the titles covering the same should have been issued in the names of 
R. L. and M. R. The words "married to R. L." written after the name of M. R. in 
each of the titles are merely descriptive of the civil status of M. R., the 
registered owner of the properties covered by said titles'. (Litam, et al. vs. 
Espiritu et al., 100 Phil., 364; Castillo, Digest of Supreme Court Decisions, 
1956.)"</p></blockquote>
<p>For these reasons, the petition is granted, and the respondent is ordered to 
take cognizance of the aforesaid petition filed in this court. No costs.</p>
<p><i>Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Paredes,</i> and 
<i>Dizon, JJ.</i>, concur.</p></div>
