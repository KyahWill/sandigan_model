				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioning union filed two complaints for unfair labor practice
against respondent company, alleging dismissal of twenty-seven of its employees
for union activities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent court,
in its decision of <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="1">January 4, 1965</st1:date>,
ordered the reinstatement of nineteen (19), with back wages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of the remaining eight (8), two had died, one
had found employment elsewhere, and one bad retired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other four are Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Palaganas</span>, Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Elbanbuena</span>,
Jesus <span class="SpellE">Galang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span>
Villa­nueva.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Palaganas</span>
was not ordered reinstated, while <span class="SpellE">Elbanbuena</span> <span class="SpellE">Galang</span> and Villanueva, although reinstated, were not
granted back wages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The instant petition
for review was filed by the union with respect to these four, the prayer being
for the reinstatement of <span class="SpellE">Palaganas</span> with back wages
and for the award of back wages to the three others.</p>

<p class="BODY">The burden of petitioner's argument is that these four employees
were similarly situated as the nineteen who received the full benefits of the
decision, and therefore, must be treated in the same manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not altogether correct, as the
decision itself reveals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court's
finding with respect to <span class="SpellE">Palaganas</span> is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Palagana's</span> case as told by
respondent was a little different.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, he was on the payroll of the Company on the off-and-on
basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he went on a leave of
absence and since then he was unheard of until the respondent ultimately
decided to erase his name in their roster."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner points to the case of five of the nineteen employees
ordered reinstated with back wages, who "simply failed to return after the
expiration of their leave of absence," and contends that the same relief
must be awarded to <span class="SpellE">Palaganas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a demonstrable difference between
their situation and his, for they were working on a regular and continuous
basis; and with respect to Jose Pineda, who was also reinstated despite the
fact that he was working off and on, the Court did not find that he took a
leave of absence and then failed to return thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any <span class="GramE">event</span>,
insofar as <span class="SpellE">Palaganas</span> is concerned, the elimination of
his name from the company's roster on the ground that he remained unheard from
after his leave of absence expired can hardly be considered as an unfair labor
practice which would justify reinstatement, let alone back wages.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Elbanbuena</span>, his
claim for reinstatement was dismissed "as it appears that he was
reinstated and is still in the service." The denial of back wages to him,
however, was erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court found:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"right now (as of the date of the
decision) Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Elbanbuena</span> is still in the service,
but complainant's evidence clearly showed that he was laid off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Probably he was re­called since the
presentation of complainant's evidence." It is not disputed that he was
out of work from January 9 to <st1:date year="1960" day="3" month="11">November
 3, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent company
says that for all that appears he might have been on extended leave of absence
with­out pay during that period, and that it was incumbent upon petitioner to
prove otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To our mind, the
categorical finding of the court that he had been laid off sufficiently rules
out the speculative possibility referred to by respond­ent company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if the other regular employees who failed
to return after the expiration of their leaves of absence were granted back
wages, justice dictates that <span class="SpellE">Elbanbuena</span> should be
entitled to the same benefits.</p>

<p class="BODY">The claim of Jesus <span class="SpellE">Galang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> Villanueva for back wages was correctly dismissed by
the court because "they were not laid off; and (they) have already
returned to work upon the expiration of their leaves of absence and have been
thereafter continuously working in their former positions." This <span class="GramE">is a</span> factual finding that is not disputed, nor has evi­dence
of any lay-off of these two employees been brought to our attention.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is modified by
ordering the payment of back wages to Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Elban­buena</span>
for the period from January 9 to <st1:date year="1960" day="3" month="11">November
 3, 1960</st1:date>, and affirmed in all other respects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
