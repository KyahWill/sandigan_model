 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, dismissing an
amended petition for declaratory relief seeking a judicial declaration of
illegality of the construction placed by respondent Rice and Corn Board of its
Resolution No. 10 </span>in connection with Section 2-A of Commonwealth Act No.
108.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was sought, without success,
was a ruling that peti­tioner Universal Corn Products, Inc. could retain its
co-petitioners, all aliens, in its employ, contending that a dismissal from
employment on the strength of the aforesaid construction by respondents would
be to give it a retroactive, and under the circumstances, an un­constitutional
effect.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The amended petition of
February 8, 1961 after the averments as to the petitioners and respondents
alleged that pursuant to the power vested in respondent Rice and Corn Board by
Section 6 of Republic Act No. 3018, Resolution No. 10 was promulgated dated
November 21, 1960, a particular regulation of which specifically provides:
"No person who is not a citizen of the Philippines shall </span>be
employed in any capacity in any Filipino-owned establish­ment engaged in any of
the lines of activity in the rice and/or corn industry except technical
personnel whose employment may be authorized by the President of the
Philippines upon recommendation of the Rice and Corn Board.”<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Then <span class="GramE">came</span> a paragraph that petitioner Universal Corn
Products, Inc. "is a corporation the capital stock of which is wholly
owned by citizens of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and is engaged in certain lines of activity covered by Republic Act No. 3018
and Resolution No. 10 of the Rice and Corn Board."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
It was then stated that all its employees numbering over 200 are Filipinos,
with the exception of co-petitioners, then holding the positions of executive
vice-president, comptroller, sales manager, chief warehouseman, assistant plant
superintendent, cashier, and sales supervisor,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and that such alien employees "have been with the Universal Corn Products,
Inc. long before the enactment into law of Republic Act No. 3018 and the
promulgation of Resolution No. 10 of the Rice and Corn Board."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The next two paragraphs would impugn the construction placed on Resolution No.
10 for its retroactivity insofar as it would be made to apply to the alien
petitioners with the result that their dismissal would be called for and for
its unconstitutionality insofar as such individuals and other persons similarly
situated would be deprived of their means of livelihood without due process of
law and would be denied the equal protection of the law. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The amended petition next stressed the pro­priety
of <span style="">a </span>judicial
declaration as to the interpretation that must be placed on the aforesaid
Resolution No. 10 and Section 2-A of Commonwealth Act No. 108 to avoid the
taint of retroactivity and unconstitutionality.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondents, the National
Rice and Corn Board and its chairman </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">well as members, in their answer of </span><st1:date year="1961" day="9" month="3"><span style="">March 9, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">effect admitted the
allegations of the petition but denied the legal conclusion asserted by
petitioners to flow <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More specifically, they disputed the alleged
retroactive character of the construction, the truth according to them being
that regardless of the date of employment, "upon the passage of Republic
Act No. 3018 </span>and the regulation in question," which is <span style="">a </span>mere reproduction
<span style="">of Section 2-A of Commonwealth Act No.
108 as amended by Republic Act No. 134 "employment of aliens in the

by the lower court in the decision, now the subject of this appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The decision must be
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no valid ground for
reversal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention that the
interpretation by respondents of Resolution No. 10 and Section 2-A of
Commonwealth Act No. 108 suffers from the vice of retroactivity or afflicted
with the taint of unconstitutionality is far from persuasive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the question of the
retroactivity of the construction placed by respondent Rice and Corn Board on
its Resolution No. 10 in connection with Section 2-A of Commonwealth Act No.
108, it is undeniable of course that if such be the case petitioners could
successfully impugn the appealed decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">early as 1913, this Court with Justice
Moreland </span><span style="">as </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">ponente</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">announced:
"It is a rule of statutory construction that all statutes are to be
construed </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">having only a prospective operation unless
the purpose and intention of the Legislature to give them a retrospective
effect is expressly declared or </span><span style="">is
</span><span style="">necessarily implied from the
language used.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">In every </span><span style="">case of doubt, the doubt must be re­solved against the retrospective
effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cases supporting this rule
are almost without number."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Subsequently in 1925, this Court through
Justice Malcolm reiterated the doctrine.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus: "A sound canon of statutory construction is that </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">statute operates prospectively only and never retroactively, unless the
legislative intent to the contrary is made manifest either by the express terms
of the statute or by necessary implication.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Following the lead of the United States Supreme Court and putting the
rule more </span><span style="">strongly, </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">statute ought not to receive </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">construction making it
act retroactively, unless the words are so clear, strong, and imperative that
no other meaning can be annexed to them, or unless the intention of the legis­lature
cannot be otherwise satisfied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No court
will hold </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">statute to be
retroactive when the legislature has not said so."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> That </span><span style="">is still the rule; it has stood the test of time.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It suffices to refer to
the pertinent provision </span><span style="">of
Republic Act </span><span style="">No. 3018 to show
that the imputation of </span><span style="">retroactivity
lacks </span><span style="">support in law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The act was approved on August 2, 1960 and
made to </span><span style="">take effect </span><span style="">on January 1, 1961, except as to certain
provisions specifically desig­nated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>More precisely, with reference to rules and regu­lations, it is provided
that they could be issued by the Rice and Corn Board within thirty (30) days
from the date of approval, namely, August 2, 1960; such rules and regu­lations
which may be necessary to carry out its provision shall take effect fifteen
(15) days after their publication in </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">newspaper of general circulation printed in Manila.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Barely two months ago, where it was shown that

speaking through Justice J.B.L. Reyes, sustained the Court of Tax Appeals in

to the former: "Lastly, appellant would have us declare the penal
provisions of Republic Act No. 1180 in the nature of an <u>ex</u> </span><u><span style="">post</span></u><i><span style=""> </span></i><u><span style="">facto</span></u><span style=""> law and, therefore, unconstitutional, if
applied to his case, upon the argument that although he was not yet engaged in
the retail business on May 15, 1954, he was issued </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">license to engage therein and had entered the
retail business on May 22, 1954, prior to the approval of the Act on June 19,
1954; and yet his having so engaged, although legal at its inception has been
penalized and made criminal by the law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We also find this argument unattainable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>An <u>ex</u> </span><u><span style="">post</span></u><span style=""> <u>facto</u> law is one that 'makes an act
done before the passage of a law, innocent when done, criminal and punish (<span class="SpellE">es</span>) such act * * (<span class="SpellE">Mekin</span> v. Wolfe,
2 Phil. 74).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Applied to appellant's
case, Republic Act No. 1180 does not penalize </span>this alien appellant for
having engaged in the retail business prior to its approval; what the law
penalizes is his having done so <u>thereafter</u>." According to the
latter: "The next issue raised by defense counsel refers to the
proposition that even assuming that Republic Act No. 1180 is constitutional,
yet the same does not apply to the accused inasmuch as he has<span style=""> </span>obtained his permit and license to
engage in the retail trade <u>before</u> said law was approved and <u>before</u>
it became effective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no merit in
this contention because the acts constituting the crime for which appellant has
been convicted in the case at bar were all executed <u>after</u> the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> <span style="">of
Republic Act No. 1180, and by no means can We consider appellant's conviction
as the result of the application to him of an <u>ex</u> <u>post</u> <u>facto</u>
law."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners are vocal in
their fears that to construe Resolution No. 10 in connection with Section 2-A
of Commonwealth Act No. 108 </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">to require the dismissal of alien personnel
would be to run the risk of an unconsti­tutional interpretation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such doubts and misgivings are
unjustified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">A </span><span style="">recent decision of this Court, King v. <span class="SpellE">Hernaez</span>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> of far-reaching significance, ought to have
stilled such misplaced apprehension.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus: "It is hard to see how </span><span style="">the nationalization </span><span style="">of
employment in the Philippines can run counter to any provision of our
Constitution con­sidering that its aim is not exactly to deprive a citizen </span>of
a right that he may exercise under it but rather to promote, enhance and
protect those that are expressly accorded to a citizen such <span style="">as </span>the right to life, liberty and
pursuit of happiness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
nationalization of an economic measure when founded on grounds of public policy
cannot be branded <span style="">as </span>unjust,
arbitrary or oppressive or contrary to the Constitution because its aim is
merely to further the material progress and welfare of the citizens of the
country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is what we expressed in no
uncertain terms in the <span class="SpellE">Ichong</span> <span style="">case </span><span style="">when we declared
constitutional </span>the nationalization of the retail trade.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, we said there that it is <span style="">a </span>law 'clearly <span style="">in </span>the interest of the public, <span style="">nay </span>of the national security itself,
and indisputably falls within the scope of police power, through which and by
which the State insures its existence and security and the supreme welfare of
its citizens.' True, this fundamental policy was expressed in a decision the
subject of which concerns the constitutionality of the Retail Trade Act, but
since the Anti-Dummy Law is but a mere complement of the former in the sense
that it is designed to make effective its aims and purposes and both tend to
accomplish the same objective either by excluding aliens from owning any retail
trade or by banning their employment if the trade is owned by Filipinos, and
the target of both is 'the removal and eradication of the shackles of foreign
economic control and domination' thru the nationali­zation of the retail trade
both in ownership and employment, the pronouncement made in one regarding its
constitutionality applies equally if not with greater reason to the other both
being complementary one to the other.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, in nationalizing employment <span style="">in </span>retail trade the right of choice of an employer <span style="">is </span>not impaired but its sphere is
merely limited to the citizens to the exclusion of those of other
nationalities."</p>
