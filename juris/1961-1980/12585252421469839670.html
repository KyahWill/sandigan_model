<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The plaintiffs <span class="SpellE">Keater</span> Huang, et al., on February 2, 1966, filed an "amended 
bill of costs" in civil case 24091 of Branch III of the Court of First Instance 
of Manila, praying therein that the same be assessed and taxed as costs against 
the defendant Associated Realty Development Co., Inc., and that an <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">alias </span></em>writ of execution be issued for 
the satisfaction thereof. The Clerk of said court, on March 23, 1966, issued a 
"taxation of costs", but because this did not include the sum of P206.85, 
representing the premium on an attachment bond paid to the Associated Ins. &amp; 
Surety Co., Inc., the plaintiffs appealed to the Judge of said Branch III of the 
Court of First Instance, contending that the sum in question should have been 
allowed as part of the costs. In his order of </span><st1:date month="5" day="30" year="1960"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">May 
30, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
the Judge sustained the position taken by the Clerk of Court. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">From that order, the plaintiffs 
have appealed to this Court after their motion for reconsideration thereof was 
denied. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The counsel for the defendant, on 
</span><st1:date month="9" day="20" year="1966"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 20, 
1966</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the order in question is not 
<span class="SpellE">appealable</span>, citing section 1-(<span class="SpellE">i</span>) of Rule 50, in relation to section 1 of Rule 56, Revised 
Rules of Court. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The order appealed from reads as 
follows: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"It appearing 
that from the taxation of the <span class="SpellE">costs.dated</span> 
</span></span><st1:date month="3" day="23" year="1966"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 23, 
1966</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> made by the Clerk of Court, the

No.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> A-5070202 
in the sum of P24.00 with the Supreme Court has not been included and since such 
kind of fee is allowed as costs under Sec. 11 (c), Rule 42 of the Rules of 
Court, said docket fee is hereby ordered included in the taxation of costs and 
to that effect, the taxation of costs made by the Clerk should be amended so 
that the grand total thereof shall be P243.00. The <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">premium in the attachment bond and appeal bond paid 
by the plaintiffs are not allowed as costs and hence the Court denies the same.” 
(<span class="GramE">underlining</span> ours.) 
</span></em><o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is our view that the motion to 
dismiss the appeal may not be sustained on the ground invoked by the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>. The quoted order is not interlocutory because it 
definitely ruled as not allowable costs the sum paid by the appellants as 
premium on the attachment bond. There is nothing more that needs to be done with 
the claim in the lower court. The order puts an end to the litigation, and, in 
the absence of a timely appeal, may be executed in the ordinary <span class="GramE">course</span> of law. We therefore hold that the order of 
</span><st1:date month="5" day="30" year="1966"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">May 30, 
1966</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> is 
<span class="SpellE">appealable</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The issue proposed to be taken up 
on appeal is, whether the amount paid as premium on the attachment bond in 
connection with civil case 24091 is taxable as costs. We hold the contrary, 
because under the clear provisions of section 10 of Rule 142, Revised Rules of 
Court (sec. 10 of Rule 131, old Rules of Court, which is a reproduction of sec. 
492 of the Code of Civil Procedure), it is unmistakably not one of the 
enumerated items that may be recovered as costs by a prevailing party against a 
losing party in an action or proceeding in the Court of First Instance. We 
hereunder quote section 10 of Rule 142: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Costs in Courts of First Instance.</span></em>- In 
an action or proceeding pending in a Court of First Instance, <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">the prevailing party may recover the following 
costs, and no other: </span></em><o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(a) For the complaint or answer, 
fifteen pesos; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(b) For his own attendance, and 
that of his attorney, down to and including final judgment, twenty pesos; 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(c) For each witness necessarily 
produced by him, for each day’s necessary attendance of such witness at the 
trial, two pesos, and his lawful traveling fees; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(d) For each deposition lawfully 
taken by him, and produced in evidence, five pesos; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(e) For original documents, 
deeds, or papers of any kind produced by him, nothing; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(f) For official copies of such 
documents, deeds, or papers, the lawful fees necessarily) paid for obtaining 
such copies; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(g) The lawful fees paid by him 
in entering and docketing the action or recording the proceedings, for the 
service of any-process in action, and all lawful clerk's fees paid by 
him,”(underscoring ours) <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Hunter, Kerr &amp; Co. vs. 
Murray, 48 Phil. 499, 505, cited by the appellants in their opposition to the 
motion to dismiss, is completely irrelevant in this case. The pertinent portion 
of the decision reads as follows: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"As to the costs and legal 
expenses entitled to preference under section 79 of Act No. 1956, section 492 of 
the Code of Civil Procedure enumerates the lawful costs which may be recovered, 
<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">and section 79 of Act No. 1956 <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> authorizes the payment of lawful expenses, among 
which the premium paid upon the bond, which the law requires before an 
attachment bond may be issued, may very well be included. </span></em>The only 
costs and lawful expenses, therefore, to which the appellant is entitled in the 
Court of First Instance of Manila are: x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>; <span class="GramE">For</span> the premium upon the bond, 
P211.06; x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." (<span class="GramE">underscoring</span> ours) <o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Hunter, Kerr &amp; Co. vs. Murray 
was an insolvency proceeding, and it was by express mandate of section 791 Act 
1956, otherwise known as "The Insolvency Law”, that this Court considered the 
premium paid on the attachment bond as one which may well be included as part of 
costs. Thus, section 79 provides: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"When an attachment has been made 
and is not dissolved before the commencement of proceedings in insolvency, or is 
dissolved by an undertaking given by the defendant, if the claim upon which the 
attachment suit was commenced is proved against the estate of the debtor, the 
plaintiff may prove the legal costs and disbursements of the suit, and of the 
keeping of the property, and the amount thereof shall be a preferred debt." 
<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The premium paid on the 
attachment bond in the present case sought to be included as part of costs arose 
from civil case 24091 which is not an insolvency proceeding; for this reason 
section 79, Act 1956, may not be invoked as authority for its recovery. All, 
therefore, that the appellants may recover as costs are only those allowed by 
section 10 of Rule 142 of the Rules of Court, and no more; no exercise in mental 
dexterity can read into the ambit of the said section the sum paid as premium on 
the attachment bond. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This appeal should, therefore, be 
dismissed outright on the ground that it is manifestly and palpably frivolous 
and completely devoid of merit. On the face of the record on appeal before us as 
well as the pleadings filed by both parties, there is absolutely no prospect 
"that the order in question will be reversed or even modified, in view of the 
unequivocal provisions of section 10 of Rule 142 of the Rules of Court governing 
costs which the prevailing party may recover in the Court of First Instance. 
Permitting this appeal to continue is purposeless; it can only result in a 
needless waste of time and effort and useless expense on the part of the parties 
and of this Court. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On at least three previous 
occasions, this Court summarily dismissed the appeal on the self-same ground: 
that the appeal was manifestly frivolous and completely devoid of merit. Thus: 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> 
<span class="SpellE">x</span> Although, as a general rule, an appeal should not be 
dismissed on a ground which goes to the merits of the cause or to the right of 
plaintiff or defendant to recover, yet, in exceptional instances, an appellate 
court may order the dismissal when the appeal appears to be manifestly and 
palpably frivolous. And where, as in the instant case, the dismissal has been 
ordered by the trial court, it will not be disturbed in the appellate court if 
the latter finds the appeal to have been interposed ostensibly for delay. 
<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">It has been held that a frivolous appeal 
is one presenting no <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> question, or one so 
readily recognizable as devoid of merit on the face of the record that there is 
little, if any, prospect that it can ever succeed.</span></em> The instant case 
is one such instance in which the appeal is evidently without merit, taken 
manifestly for delay." (De la Cruz, et al. vs. Blanco, et al., 73 Phil. 596) 
(<span class="GramE">underscoring</span> ours) <o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In refusing to approve the record 
on appeal, the respondent Judge seems to have labored under the impression that 
the appellant and herein petitioner was appealing from the court's decision of 
September 12, 1947, this, judging from the ground or reason given for the 
refusal, namely, that the record on appeal was filed beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period. But in reality the appeal was being 
taken from the order of </span><st1:date month="1" day="8" year="1948"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 8, 
1948</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
denying the petition to set aside the decision of </span><st1:date month="9" day="12" year="1947"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 12, <span class="GramE">1947</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> ,</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> a petition presumably based on 
section 2, Rule 38 of the Rules of Court. That order of denial was, of course, 
proper and complete, the respondent Judge was bound to approve it and he may be 
compelled to do so by a writ of mandamus. So, strictly and legally speaking, the 
present petition for mandamus may be granted. However, before acting upon the 
petition, <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">we may inquire into the facts 
involved in order to determine whether once the writ of mandamus is granted and 
the case is brought up here on appeal, the appellant has any chance, even 
possibility of having the basic decision of the trial court of September 12, 
1947, set aside or modified; for if the appellant has not that prospect or 
likelihood, then the granting of this writ of mandamus and the consequent appeal 
would be futile and would mean only a waste of time to the parties and to this 
Court. </span></em>This inquiry can easily be made from a copy of the record on 
appeal now before us as well as the pleadings filed by both parties." (<span class="SpellE">Paner</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>, 87 Phil. 271, 
274.) (<span class="GramE">underscoring</span> ours) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Company vs. <span class="SpellE">Ballesteros</span>, et al., G.R. 
No.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> L-19161, 
April 29, 1966, this Court, citing De la Cruz vs. Blanco and <span class="SpellE">Quevedo</span>, <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">supra, 
</span></em>and <span class="SpellE">Paner</span> <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs.</span></em> <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>, 
<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">supra</span></em>, denied a petition for 
mandamus to set aside an order dismissing an appeal and to order the respondent 
court to give due course to said appeal, after having found that the issues to 
be taken up in the intended appeal are no longer <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> questions which would justify the issuance of 
the peremptory writ, for there was no possible doubt pursuant to the provisions 
of law therein involved, that the plaintiffs in that case (respondents in the 
petition for <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">mandamus</span></em>) were 
entitled to the judgment rendered in their favor which was the subject of the 
intended appeal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The issues proposed to be taken 
up on appeal, as set forth in the petition, are whether or not <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Abello</span> acted with 
reckless negligence while driving petitioner's bus at the time of the accident, 
and whether or not petitioner may be held liable on account of such negligence, 
considering that he was not its employee. These are no longer <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> questions which would justify our issuing the 
peremptory writ prayed for. The first is a question of fact on which the 
affirmative finding of respondent court is not <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> by <span class="GramE">Us</span>; and the second is 
one as to which there can be no possible doubt in view of the provisions of the 
Civil Code and of the Motor Vehicle Law hereinbefore cited. There would be no 
point in giving the appeal due course.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">ACCORDINGLY,</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> the instant appeal is hereby
