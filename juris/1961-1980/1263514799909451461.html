<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1964</st1:date>,
petitioner herein, Rev. Fr. Luis R. <span class="SpellE">Ayo</span>, Jr.,
Catholic parish priest of <span class="SpellE">Capalonga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte, applied, from the Bureau of Private
Schools, for a permit to open a first year high school in said
municipality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Ernesto F. <span class="SpellE">Jalgalado</span>, Director of the <span class="SpellE">Capalonga</span>
Institute, which is authorized to operate a school in the same place, opposed
said application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1964</st1:date>, said Bureau gave due
course thereto, subject to certain conditions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The application was, however, denied, on <st1:date year="1964" day="13" month="4">April 13, 1964</st1:date>, because some of these conditions – namely,
completion of a school building and other facilities necessary for the
operation of a school – had not, as yet, been fulfilled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A reconsideration of the decision of the Bureau
to this effect having been denied, Fr. <span class="SpellE">Ayo</span> filed, on <st1:date year="1964" day="21" month="7">July 21, 1964</st1:date>, a second petition for
reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, or on July 14, 1964, <span class="SpellE">Jalgalado</span>
had commenced, in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>
Norte, presided over by respondent Judge, Hon. <span class="SpellE">Melquiades</span>
G. <span class="SpellE">Ilao</span>, Civil Case No. 1606 of said court, against
Fr. <span class="SpellE">Ayo</span>, to restrain him from constructing the school
building necessary to house the <span class="SpellE">Capalonga</span> Parochial
School, from advertising or announcing the opening thereof for the school year
1964-1965 and from enrolling students <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, as
well as to recover P19<span class="GramE">,900.00</span> as damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Jalgalado</span>,
likewise, prayed for a writ of preliminary injunction, which Judge <span class="SpellE">Ilao</span> issued <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>
the next day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="7">July 28, 1964</st1:date>, Fr. <span class="SpellE">Ayo</span>
filed an urgent motion to dissolve said writ and set the motion for hearing on <st1:date year="1964" day="1" month="8">August 1, 1964</st1:date>; but, Judge <span class="SpellE">Ilao</span> postponed the hearing to another date.</p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as the school year was about to begin, and Fr. <span class="SpellE">Ayo</span> knew that he could not possibly get a school permit
unless the school building was completed, on August 4, 1964, he commenced the
present action for <i style="">certiorari</i> against
<span class="SpellE">Jalgalado</span>, and Judge <span class="SpellE">Ilao</span>,
to annul and set aside all proceedings before the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="6" month="8">August
 6, 1964</st1:date>, upon the posting of a bond in the sum of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, we issued a writ of preliminary injunction
restraining the enforcement of the writ issued by Judge <span class="SpellE">Ilao</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition before us is predicated upon the theory that the
latter had committed a grave abuse of discretion in issuing said writ, because <span class="SpellE">Jalgalado's</span> complaint in the lower court did not set forth
a cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, <span class="SpellE">Jalgalado</span> based his complaint upon the allegation that the <span class="SpellE">Capalonga</span> Institute, of which he was a Director had a
permit to operate a school in <span class="SpellE">Capalonga</span>, and that, in
consequence of the fact that Fr. <span class="SpellE">Ayo</span> was
"advertising thru various catholic organizations, as well as thru his
authorized representatives, that the <span class="SpellE">Capalonga</span>
Parochial School would open its door to first year high school students, in the
school year 1964-1965, despite the fact that its application for a permit <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> had been denied by the Bureau of Private Schools,
on April 13, 1964, "not a single student" had "enrolled in the <span class="SpellE">Capalonga</span> Institute for the First Year, for the reason that
said municipality" is "predominantly composed of Roman
Catholics."</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted, in this connection, that, acting upon Fr. <span class="SpellE">Ayo's</span> second request for reconsideration, dated July 21,
1964, said Bureau gave due course to this request and submitted the matter to
the Department of Education, which, in turn, granted said request and issued
Temporary Permit No. 755, series of 1964, authorizing the <span class="SpellE">Capalonga</span>
Parochial School to open and conduct the "first year of the secondary
course (day)," from August 3, 1964 to August 2, 1965, subject to some
conditions, one of which was that "the building now Under construction x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> should be completed within
the first semester" of said school year.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Meanwhile, the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Capalonga</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Parochial School</st1:placetype></st1:place> was allowed to
hold its classes in Fr. <span class="SpellE">Ayo's</span> convent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming that <span class="SpellE">Jalgalado</span>
had a right to restrain Fr. <span class="SpellE">Ayo</span>, as long as he did
not have the necessary authority from the aforementioned Bureau, such right was
extinguished when Fr. <span class="SpellE">Ayo</span> obtained said temporary
permit No. 755, series of 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, the issue raised by <span class="SpellE">Jalgalado's</span> complaint in
Civil Case No. 1606 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>
Norte has thereby become moot.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, however, the authority of <span class="SpellE">Jalgalado's</span>
school to operate as such in <span class="SpellE">Capalonga</span> did not confer
upon him any exclu­sive right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence,
<u>he</u> had <u>no</u> cause of action against Fr. <span class="SpellE">Ayo</span>
for announcing that he would open and operate a parochial school in <span class="SpellE">Capalonga</span>, and for undertaking the construction of a school
building <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, even if Fr. <span class="SpellE">Ayo</span>
had not, as yet, secured the permit necessary for such parochial school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Jalgalado</span> could
have reported said announcement to the Bureau of Private Schools, for such
action as it may deem proper; but, he had no right to sue <u>directly</u> Fr. <span class="SpellE">Ayo</span>, who had no legal obligations towards <span class="SpellE">Jalgalado</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The latter's allegation to the effect that not a single student
had <span class="SpellE">renrolled</span> in his school for the first year
secondary course, because of the announcement that the Parochial School would
be open – as it eventually opened legally – for first year students during the
school year 1964-1965, did not suffice to give <span class="SpellE">Jalgalado</span>
a cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no
allegation that, in the absence of such announcement, said students would have
enrolled in <span class="SpellE">Jalgalado's</span> school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse still, his complaint suggests the contrary,
for said school is non-sectarian, whereas <span class="SpellE">Jalgalado's</span>
complaint alleges that the inhabitants of <span class="SpellE">Capalonga</span>
are "predominantly Roman Catholics".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At any rate, since Fr. <span class="SpellE">Ayo</span> had the requisite
building permit, Judge <span class="SpellE">Ilao</span> obviously committed a
grave abuse of discretion in issuing the writ prohibiting the construction – or
completion – of said <span class="GramE">building.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the writ of preliminary injunction issued by
Judge <span class="SpellE">Ilao</span> is, accordingly, annulled, and the
preliminary injunction issued by this Court hereby made permanent.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Reyes, J.B.L., <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>, J.P., <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span> Fernando, <span class="GramE">JJ.,</span><span style="font-style: normal;"> concur.</span></span><br>
