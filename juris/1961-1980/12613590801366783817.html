				<BR><BR><div align=""><div align="justify"><br><p>Appeal by the Philippines International Surety Co., Inc. from a decision of 
the Court of Tax Appeals.</p>
<p>From June to August, 1955, four (4) shipments of goods, consigned to Pablo 
Gonzales, arrived at the Port of Manila, on board S.S. Bronnyvile, without the 
release certificate required by Central Bank Circulars Nos. 44 and 45. 
Consequently, said goods were subjected, by the Acting Collector of Customs for 
said port, to seizure proceedings, during the pendency of which the merchandise 
were, later, ordered released to Gonzales, under bonds issued by appellant 
surety. After due hearing, said officer rendered a decision, on April 4, 1960, 
ordering the forfeiture of said goods—upon the ground that the importation 
thereof had been made in violation of the Circulars above referred to and, 
accordingly, of the aforementioned bonds and sentencing Gonzales and the surety 
to pay, jointly and severally, the amounts thereof, aggregating P53,434.06. On 
appeal, taken by Gonzales, this decision was affirmed by the Commissioner of 
Customs. The surety appealed from the latter's decision to the Court of Tax 
Appeals, which, in due course, dismissed said appeal upon the ground that said 
surety has no legal capacity to interpose the aforementioned appeal, and that 
the same is without merit. Hence, this appeal by the surety, who maintains that 
the Court of Tax Appeals has erred on both counts.</p>
<p>With respect to petitioner's capacity to appeal from the decision of the 
Commissioner of Customs, we note that the petition for review filed by the 
surety with the court of Tax Appeals is based upon two (2) grounds, namely: (1) 
that the Collector of Customs had not furnished a copy of its decision to 
Gonzales; and (2) that Central Bank Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 are allegedly null 
and void.</p>
<p>According to the decision rendered by the Commissioner of Customs—on appeal 
taken, <em>not</em> by the <em>surety</em>, who did <em>not</em> appeal from the 
decision of the Collector of Customs, but by the <em>importer</em>, Gonzales—the 
latter had limited himself to assailing the validity of the aforementioned 
Circulars of the Central Bank. In other words, Gonzales had not impugned the 
decision of the Collector of Customs upon the ground of lack of notice, alleged 
by the surety, thus showing, either that Gonzales had really received—as the 
surety, evidently, had—notice of said decision, as indicated by the fact that he 
had appealed therefrom, or that he had waived said notice, which <em>it is his 
privilege to renounce</em>. Hence, the surety had no right to invoke in support 
of its own appeal, said alleged lack of notice to the <em>importer</em>, not 
only because his acts proved that there had been such notice, but, also, that 
<em>he</em> had <em>waived</em> it, by appealing from the decision of the 
Collector of Customs, <em>and</em> by <em>not</em> interposing an appeal from 
the decision of the Commissioner of Customs, thereby allowing the same to become 
<em>final and executory</em>, insofar as he is concerned. It may not be amiss to 
add that lack of notice of a decision to a given party affects, <em>not</em> the 
<em>validity</em> of said decision, but its <em>finality</em> insofar as such 
party is concerned, in the sense that his period to appeal does not begin to run 
until said notice, and that the decision cannot be executed against him until 
after the expiration of the period aforementioned.</p>
<p>It should, also, be pointed out that, as regards the surety herein, which had 
<em>not</em> appealed from the decision of the Collector of Customs, the same 
had become <em>final and executory</em> upon expiration of the reglementary 
period to appeal therefrom. Although the appeal taken from said decision by the 
<em>importer</em> might have, perhaps, inured to the benefit of the surety, 
<em>if</em> the result of the appeal had been <em>favorable</em> to said 
importer, the fact is that he had <em>failed </em>in his appeal. Hence, there is 
no legal ground by which the surety may justify its alleged right to appeal from 
the decision of the Commissioner of Customs, based upon an alleged violation, 
<em>not</em> of its rights as a <em>surety</em>, but of those of the 
<em>importer</em>, as such.</p>
<p>It is true that a solidary debtor may "avail himself of all defenses which 
are derived from the nature of the obligation and of those which are personal to 
him or pertain to his share" (Article 1222, Civil Code of the Philippines). 
What, then, is the nature of the obligation of the surety in the case at bar? 
Pertinent parts of its bond provide:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"x x x WHEREAS, the Collector of Customs is willing to release and deliver 
the above mentioned ___________ to the Principal upon the filing of a surety 
bond in the amount of ___________ Philippine Currency, representing the local 
appraised value of the merchandise to guaranty the payment of the amount that 
the Bureau of Customs or the courts of the Philippines may decide to collect, 
depending upon the final outcome of the seizure proceedings: </p>
<p>"WHEREAS, the Principal and the Surety both agree to be bound, as they hereby 
do bind themselves, their heirs, executors, administrators, sucessors and 
assigns, jointly and severally, for the payment of the obligation herein 
mentioned; and</p>
<p>"WHEREAS, the parties hereto have agreed that the Collector of Customs, the 
Commissioner of Customs, or any of their subordinates, shall not be held liable 
in any manner for the delivery of said merchandise;</p>
<p>"NOW, THEREFORE, the conditions of this obligation are such that, in the 
event that it should be finally decided that the merchandise herein mentioned 
should be forfeited to the government, and/or that a fine or surcharge should be 
imposed,the entire amount of this bond, in case of forfeiture, or the 
corresponding amount of the fine or surcharge, as the case may be, shall be paid 
in CASH to the Bureau of Customs PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if within thirty (30) 
days from demand for payment of the liability herein mentioned the said 
liability is not paid, and it should be found necessary to file an action in 
court to effect the collection thereof, a penalty of FIVE HUNDRED PESOS 
(P500.00) in addition shall be imposed, otherwise, this obligation shall be void 
and of no effect."</p></blockquote>
<p>Pursuant thereto, the surety bound itself to pay the sum of money specified 
in the bond, "in the event that it should be finally decided that the 
merchandise herein mentioned should be forfeited to the Government". Thus, the 
surety guaranteed, <em>not the legality</em> of the importation, but, merely the 
<em>payment of the appraised value</em> of the goods imported and released, in 
the event aforementioned. As a consequence, the surety would have a right to 
object and appeal if it were made to pay, either an amount exceeding its bond, 
or without a previous decree of forfeiture of the merchandise. The bond did not, 
however, give the surety a right to question the <em>legality of the 
seizure</em> or that of the aforementioned Circulars of the Central Bank. 
Indeed, the surety in the case at bar, stands in substantially the same 
position, legally, as the surety of the accused in a criminal case who is 
released on bail. Surely, such surety can not intervene in the proceedings, 
before the trial court, to establish the guilt or innocence of the accused 
and/or appeal from its judgment convicting him as charged.</p>
<p>At any rate, the authority of the Central Bank to issue Circulars Nos. 44 and 
45, and the validity of these Circulars,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> as well as the propriety of the decree of 
confiscation and forfeiture of the goods imported in violation thereof<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> are now well settled.</p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is hereby 
affirmed, with costs against the Philippines International Surety Co., Inc.</p>
<p><b>IT IS SO ORDERED.</b></p><em>Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Regala, Makalintal, 
Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez</em> and <em>Ruiz Castro, JJ</em>.,
