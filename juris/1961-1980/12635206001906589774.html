<span class="SpellE">Sala</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quirimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Pedrano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Fuldarico</span> Reyes were
charged with rape in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>
where, after a trial upon a plea of not guilty (except as to Reyes who had
remained at large up to that time), judgment was rendered as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court is of the opinion and so holds that the
prosecution has proven beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused Felipe <span class="SpellE">Amit</span> as principal by direct participation in the commission
of the crime of rape against <span class="SpellE">Divina</span> <span class="SpellE">Niez</span> on the night of May 27, 1965, at <span class="SpellE">sitio</span>

Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Dimasalang</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>, as charged in the information, penalized by
paragraph 3 of Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by Republic Act
No. 4111 with Reclusion <span class="SpellE">Perpetua</span>; likewise the
prosecution has proven beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> <span class="SpellE">Sala</span> and <span class="SpellE">Quirimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Pedrano</span> as accomplices
in the commission of the crime of rape necessarily included in the crime as
charged in the information, penalized by Article 52 pursuant to Articles 18 and
71 of the Revised Penal Code, with Reclusion Temporal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being no aggravating nor mitigating
circumstances proven in the commission of the crime, accused Felipe <span class="SpellE">Amit</span> is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION
PERPETUA, and to pay the amount of Six Thousand (P6,000.00) Pesos, to the victim
<span class="SpellE">Divina</span> <span class="SpellE">Niez</span> without

Thousand (P3,000.00) Pesos each, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency;
and accused Felipe <span class="SpellE">Amit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span>

their provisional liberty is cancelled and their commitment to jail is hereby
ordered."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the evidence presented by the prosecution and the
defense, the trial court found the following facts to have been established:</p>

<p class="BODY">In the evening of May 27, 1965, <span class="SpellE">Divina</span> <span class="SpellE">Niez</span>, 16 years old, single and a resident of barrio <span class="SpellE">Pagyaman</span>, <span class="SpellE">Uson</span>, <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>, and her niece <span class="SpellE">Elizalde</span> <span class="SpellE">Bocado</span> were selling soft drinks, beer, bread and cigarettes
in a place in <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mambog</span>,
barrio <span class="SpellE">Buracan</span>, Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Dimasalang</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>, where a "fiesta" was being
held.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>, <span class="SpellE">Divina</span> retired to <span class="GramE">a</span> uninhabited house, located about twenty meters away from
her stall, belonging to one <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> <span class="SpellE">Humapao</span>, where she fell asleep on a bench.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon thereafter she woke up and found herself
being lifted <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> by <span class="SpellE">Sala</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Pedrano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Amit</span> and Reyes -
whom she all knew - and was laid on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Once she was in that position, <span class="SpellE">Amit</span> tore her
panty and lay on top of her, while <span class="SpellE">Pedrano</span> held her
legs apart, <span class="SpellE">Sala</span> held her shoulders, and Reyes
covered her mouth with a piece of cloth thus preventing her from shouting for
help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result, <span class="SpellE">Amit</span>
succeeded in having sexual intercourse with her.</p>

<p class="BODY">At about that time, her niece <span class="SpellE">Elizalde</span> <span class="SpellE">Bocado</span> became sleepy and leaving their wares to <span class="SpellE">Lucina</span> <span class="SpellE">Niez</span>, sister of <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Divina</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span>
followed the latter to the uninhabited house of <span class="SpellE">Humapao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On becoming aware of the presence therein of
appellants and Reyes, she shouted:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"What are you doing here<span class="GramE">?,</span>" in view
of which they all fled through the window.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Divina</span> and <span class="SpellE">Elizalde</span> returned to their stall and after gathering the
things that they had for sale went home to barrio <span class="SpellE">Pagyaman</span>,
some two kilometers away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Early that
morning, <span class="SpellE">Divina</span> revealed to her father what had been
done to her, and later that same morning, both reported the matter to Juan <span class="SpellE">Diola</span>, barrio captain of <span class="SpellE">Buracan</span>,
and asked him to bring the case to the attention of the authorities of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dimasalang</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Father and daughter also complained to <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mijares</span>, Chief of Police
of <span class="SpellE">Dimasalang</span>, who suggested that <span class="SpellE">Divina</span>
submit herself to a physical examination by Dr. Jose de Vera, municipal health
officer of the town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This she did, and
the physician found that she had a slight swelling of the labia <span class="SpellE">majora</span>, multiple contusions with abrasions all over the
body and slight cervical laceration (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, she was questioned in the office
of the Chief of Police where her written statement was taken, and on June 3,
1965, appellants and Reyes were duly charged with rape in a complaint
subscribed by the offended party.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants now pray for their acquittal, claiming that the trial
court committed the following errors:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">"I</p>

<blockquote>THAT THE JUDGMENT OF THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER COURT</st1:address></st1:street>
BEING <span class="GramE">APPEALED,</span> IS NULL AND VOID, THE SAME BEING
CONTRARY TO LAW.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING CREDIT TO THE TESTIMONIES OF
PROSECUTION WITNESSES DIVINA NIEZ AND ELIZALDE BOCADO WHICH ARE FULL OF
INCONSISTENCIES, INHERENT IMPROBABILITIES, INCONSISTENT WITH HUMAN BEHAVIOR AND
EXPERIENCE AND AGAINST THE NATURAL COURSE OF THINGS.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">III</p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT CONSIDERING THE FLIGHT OF ACCUSED
FULDARICO REYES WHICH <span class="GramE">TEND</span> TO SHOW THAT HE SAID
ACCUSED WAS THE SOLE PERPETRATOR OF THE CRIME ALLEGED AND IMPUTED UPON THE
APPELLANTS.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">IV</p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION, EXHIBITS
"3" AND "3-A", THE STATEMENT OF THE OFFENDED PARTY, DIVINA
NIEZ MADE BEFORE THE BARRIO CAPTAIN OF BURACAN, DIMASALANG, MASBATE, STATING
AMONG OTHERS THAT IT WAS FEDERICO REYES WHO ABUSED HER.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">V</p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DECLARING THAT THE DEFENDANTS-APPELLANTS
FAILED TO PROVE MOTIVE ON THE PART OF PROSECUTION WITNESSES TO FALSELY TESTIFY
AGAINST THEM.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">VI</p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE APPELLANTS OF THE CRIME
CHARGED AGAINST THEM, THEIR GUILT NOT HAVING BEEN PROVEN BY THE PROSECUTION
BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' contention in the first assignment of error is that
the appealed decision is void because, in violation of the provisions of
Article VIII, section 12 of the Constitution of the Philippines and of section
2, Rule 120 of the Rules of Court, it does not contain "an analysis and/or
make a finding upon all the evidence adduced by both parties" and does not
state (a) the legal qualification of the offense charged, the aggravating or
mitigating circumstances attending the alleged commission thereof, and (b) the
participation of each of the appellants in the commission of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">Perusal of the appealed decision readily shows, however, that it
satisfies the above-mentioned legal provisions as it clearly gives the proper
qualification - Rape - for the offense charged; it makes a sufficiently clear
statement of the evidence presented by the prosecution and the defense and of
the facts which, in the opinion of the trial judge, were established beyond
doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">That the appealed decision does not contain a detailed narration
of all the facts testified to by each and everyone of the witnesses for the
defense but instead considered their testimonies as a whole as tending to
establish the defense of alibi - which was, in fact, appellants' main defense -
does not make said decision fatally defective.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, we believe that the alleged defect constitutes no irregularity
at all.</p>

<p class="BODY">The remaining assignments of error raise, in general, the
question of credibility of the prosecution witnesses and the sufficiency of
their testimonies to prove appellants' guilt beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, appellants claim that the testimony of the
complaining witness, <span class="SpellE">Divina</span> <span class="SpellE">Niez</span>,
and of her niece, <span class="SpellE">Elizalde</span> <span class="SpellE">Bocado</span>,
is unreliable because it is full of inconsistencies and of inherent improbabilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This we find to be groundless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever variance or contradictions may be
found in their respective testimony is merely on details that do not affect
their credibility and the substance of their statements in open court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Next, appellants claim that they could not have committed the
crime charged in a house almost surrounded by improvised stalls and situated
near the place where a dance was going on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These particular circumstances do not necessarily support appellants'
view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead it can be claimed that
they render more credible the prosecution evidence regarding the commission of
the crime at the <u>time</u> and <u>place</u> mentioned in the testimony of the
prosecution witnesses, because precisely the people attending to the sale of
their wares at their respective stalls, the persons buying from them, as well
as those who were engaged in dancing were too busy to pay attention or notice
what was happening inside the house of <span class="SpellE">Humapao</span> which,
according to the evidence, was located about twenty meters away from the stall
of the complaining witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">Next claim of appellants is that it was physically impossible for
the complaining witness to recognize them in the dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is untenable, premised as it is on the
unfounded assumption that the crime was committed in a dark place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this matter the evidence is to the effect
that the walls of the dilapidated house of <span class="SpellE">Humapao</span>
were studded with holes, and that the place where some people were dancing was
well lighted with a Coleman lamp.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence likewise is clear that appellants were personally
known to their victim; that she knew <span class="SpellE">Amit</span> because she
used to pass by his house in going to school; that before the night in
question, she had seen <span class="SpellE">Pedrano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sala</span> personally, and that she had also known Reyes when the
latter arrived in barrio <span class="SpellE">Mambog</span> to run a "<span class="SpellE">hantak</span>" game.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows, on the other hand, that <span class="SpellE">Divina</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Elizalde</span> were thoroughly examined and
cross-examined, but that this notwithstanding neither incurred in any
substantial contradiction sufficient to lessen her credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, the circumstance that
early that same morning when she was victimized <span class="SpellE">Divina</span>
reported her sad experience to her father and both reported the matter to the
barrio captain cannot but bolster her credibility.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants would like us to believe next that, because <span class="SpellE">Fuldarico</span> Reyes absconded, the presumption must be that, if
the rape was committed at all, he was the sole perpetrator thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To bolster this not so definite claim,
appellants presented some evidence to the effect that there were amorous
relations between Reyes and <span class="SpellE">Divina</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such evidence, however, is far from being
convincing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Metante</span>, whom appellants
called to the witness stand to corroborate their testimony on this matter
miserably failed to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to
the testimony of appellants <span class="SpellE">Sala</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pedrano</span>, Reyes and <span class="SpellE">Divina</span> stayed
together conversing in the uninhabited house of <span class="SpellE">Humapao</span>
from <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00 o'clock</st1:time> up to past <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">twelve midnight</st1:time>, but it may be gleaned from <span class="SpellE">Metante's</span> testimony that at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time> he had ordered coffee from <span class="SpellE">Divina</span>,
with instruction to have it served to those who were dancing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This renders doubtful, if not incredible, <span class="SpellE">Sala</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pedrano's</span> claim,
although <span class="SpellE">Divina</span> herself denied having sent the coffee
allegedly ordered by <span class="SpellE">Metante</span>, because she had no
coffee for sale that evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
as according to Di<span class="SpellE">vina</span> she knew Reyes to be a married
man, we cannot easily believe that she had amorous relations with him at her
tender age of sixteen, there being no showing that she was of loose morals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' defense of alibi, on the other hand, cannot overcome
the testimony of the offended party, who knew them personally, identifying them
as the persons who had subjected her to a tragic experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this we may add firstly, that, according
to the trial court, there is absolutely no evidence showing any ill motive on <span class="SpellE">Divina's</span> part falsely to impute to appellants the
commission of such a serious offense as rape; secondly, as appellants admitted
their presence in <span class="SpellE">Mambog</span> on the night of the
commission of the crime, drinking beer in different stalls, it was not
physically impossible for them to have left those places to go to the house of <span class="SpellE">Humapao</span> and commit the rape they were subsequently charged
with.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering all the foregoing, we are of the opinion and so hold
that appellants' guilt has been established beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We, however, disagree with the trial court's
finding that appellants <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> <span class="SpellE">Sala</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Quirimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Pedrano</span> are
guilty only as accomplices in the commission of the crime because, upon the
evidence before us, they are guilty of rape as co-principals (Article 17,
paragraph 3, Rev. Penal Code; People vs. Villa et al., 81 Phil. 193; People vs.
Alfaro et al., 91 Phil. 404), and must, therefore, be sentenced accordingly.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision, as far as appellant
Felipe <span class="SpellE">Amit</span> is concerned, is affirmed, said appellant
to pay his proportional share of the costs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The appealed judgment is, however, modified as far as appellants <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> <span class="SpellE">Sala</span> and <span class="SpellE">Quirimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Pedrano</span> are concerned by
finding them guilty, as they are hereby found guilty as co-principals in the
commission of the crime charged, penalized by Article 335, paragraph 1, as
amended, of the Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
consequence, each of them is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of
reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>, and to pay, jointly and severally
with the other appellants, the amount of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> to
the complaining witness, <span class="SpellE">Divina</span> <span class="SpellE">Niez</span>,
without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.</p>
