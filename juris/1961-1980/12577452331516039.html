<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Before Us is a motion for 
reconsideration filed by respondent Rafael P. Guerrero Sr. praying "that the 
decision of this Honorable Court dated June 20, 1966, be reconsidered in the 
sense that the lover court be ordered to receive the evidence and/or application 
for damages of the respondent Rafael P. Guerrero against the petitioner Luzon 
Surety Co. Inc., or in the alternative for the sake of Justice and equity to 
modify the decision of June 20, 1966 exempting the respondent Rafael P. Guerrero 
from costs".<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Our decision in this case 
granting the writ of certiorari prayed for in the petition filed by Luzon Surety 
Company Inc. is predicated upon the following considerations: that the bond 
filed by petitioner was an injunction bond liable - up to the amount of P600.00 
- for such damages as the party enjoined may suffer by reason of the writ of 
preliminary injunction issued against him, should that writ be subsequently 
declared to have been issued without sufficient cause; that to determine the 
liability of the surety upon such bond, the aggrieved party must make a claim 
for damages, and that the same should be set for hearing with previous notice to 
both parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the present case, the 
respondent court, on October 29, 1962, not only dismissed the petition for 
relief filed by the Navarro spouses, who were defendants in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case filed in the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City, but also held the indemnity bond filed by 
petitioner liable for such damages as respondent Guerrero might have suffered by 
reason of the injunction. Then on December 8 of the same year, resolving an 
ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> motion filed by Guerrero, said court issued 
an order for the issuance of a writ of execution against the bond filed by 
petitioner herein. Damages caused through the improvident issuance of a writ of 
preliminary injunction - as is well known - may not be recovered in a separate 
action but must be claimed in the same proceeding where the injunction bond was 
filed. In the case at bar, the allegations and prayer for relief contained in 
the motion to dismiss filed by Guerrero on August 23, 1962 and in his ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> motion for execution dated December 6, 1962 (Annexes 
"C" and "E" respectively, of the petition) comply substantially with the 
requirement concerning the filing of a claim, but no hearing in connection 
therewith was held before the writ of execution complained of was 
issued.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">IN CONSONANCE WITH THE 
FOREGOING</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
the motion for reconsideration is granted to the extent that the lower court is 
directed to hold the required hearing in relation to such claim for damages and 
afterwards proceed to determine the same. Without cost<o:p></o:p></span></p>
