				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In a decision dated March 18, 1969, the Judge of the Circuit Criminal Court of Manila sentenced to death the accused Alberto Domingo y Nato <i>alias</i> "Boy Arranque" and Francisco Agner y Redrindo alias "Francing" as principals for the crime of robbery with homicide, aggravated by recidivism, abuse of superior strength, and the use of motorized vehicle, mitigated by plea of guilty and voluntary surrender, to jointly and severally indemnify the heirs of the deceased Virginia Quintos de Sipin in the sum of P12,000.00 as actual damages, P20,000.00 by way of moral damages, to return to the said heirs the articles stolen from the deceased or to pay them jointly and severally their value in the total amount of P851.00.<br><br>This case was considered submitted for decision on August 5, 1970.&nbsp; However, in his ex parte motion filed on October 24, 1973, appellant Domingo prays for new trial on the ground that as a pauper, he was represented during the trial by a counsel de oficio who prevailed upon him to enter a plea of guilty without his having been properly advised by the trial judge of the nature and consequences of his plea of guilty; that he is unschooled and therefore was not afforded a chance to fully comprehend the meaning and effect of qualifying and/or aggravating circumstances; and that his testimony was not even taken before the trial court which should have been the proper course to follow to establish not only his guilt but also the degree of his culpability despite his plea of guilty, citing several cases including People vs. Villafuerte (L-32036, July 31, 1973) [pp. 197-198, rec.].<br><br>In his comment, the Solicitor General stated:<br><blockquote>“1.&nbsp; The record discloses that when arraigned on March 6, 1969, accused-appellant Alberto Domingo y Nato, together with two other co-accused, pleaded not guilty (p. 4,rec.);<br><br>“2.&nbsp; Rearraigned on March 14, 1969, said appellant Domingo, assisted by counsel <i>de oficio</i>, withdrew his previous plea of not guilty and substituted it with a plea of guilty, invoking the mitigating circumstances of plea of guilty and voluntary surrender.&nbsp; The prosecution objected to voluntary surrender, and manifested to prove aggravating circumstances (p. 10, rec.);<br><br>“3.&nbsp; By its order of March 12, 1972, the court <i>a quo</i> deferred its decision as to appellant Domingo, with the prosecution and defense to prove modifying circumstances, as claimed by them (p. 11, rec.);<br><br>“4.&nbsp; After joint trial, the court <i>a quo,</i> in finding appellant Domingo guilty, appreciated in his favor his plea of guilty and voluntary surrender, while it considered the aggravating circumstance of recidivism against him (pp.76-92, rec.);<br><br>“5.&nbsp; The above proceedings may well show that appellant Domingo is not entirely unaware of the plea of guilty that he entered;<br><br>“6.&nbsp; What impinges, however, on the validity of his plea is (to borrow the apt language in People vs. Villafuerte, et al., L-32036, July 31, 1973) ‘the absence in the record of whatever dialogue the judge or clerk of court might have had with the defendant(s)’ Domingo, in order to personally insure that he had ‘completely understood the full meaning, significance and implications' of his plea of guilty." (Pp. 1-2, Comment of the Solicitor General dtd. Dec. 4, 1973).</blockquote>When arraigned on March 5, 1969, accused Alberto Domingo y Nato pleaded not guilty (pp. 4-5, rec. of Crim. Case No. CC-VI-129) to the charge of robbery with homicide described as follows:<br><blockquote>"That on or about the 24th day of February, 1969, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, conspiring and confederating together with others whose true names and identities are still unknown and helping one another, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with intent of gain and by means of violence against and intimidation of person, to wit:&nbsp; by using a nickelplated .45 caliber automatic pistol threatening one Mrs. Virginia Quintos de Sipin with the infliction of bodily harm upon her person should she resist or cry out for help, take, steal and carry away one ladies’ Whitnauer wristwatch valued at P500.00, cash money amounting to P300.00, one pair of ladies' earrings valued at P25.00, one gold brooch valued at P15.00, one handbag valued at P5.00, one police whistle valued at P2.50, one music pipe valued at P3.00, one ball pen valued at P0.50 and keys and other personal papers, all belonging to the said Mrs. Virginia Quintos de Sipin, to the damage and prejudice of the said owner in the total sum of P851.00, Philippine currency; that on the occasion of the said robbery, the said accused, in furtherance of their conspiracy, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with intent to kill, shoot and fire at the said Mrs. Virginia Quintos de Sipin with the said firearm, hitting her on the right temporal body of the head, thus inflicting upon her physical injuries which were the direct and immediate cause of her death.<br><br>"That in the commission of said offense, the said accused acted with abuse of superior strength and treachery." (pp. 1-2, rec. of Crim. Case No. CC-VI-129).</blockquote>At the trial on March 12, 1969, the following proceedings were recounted:<br><br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" width="85%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">"Court:<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify"></div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">Are you all ready?<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Parties:</div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify">We are ready, your honor.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">Atty. dela Merced:<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify">If your honor please, I would like to manifest that accused Alberto Domingo has entered a plea of not guilty before and at this stage of the proceedings your honor, this accused Domingo is now willing to withdraw his former plea of not guilty and substitute it with a plea of guilty to the offense charged.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">Court:<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify">Who is Alberto Domingo, stand up.
