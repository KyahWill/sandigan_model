				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal taken by Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Baluran</span> and
Rosario <span class="SpellE">Morante</span> from the decision of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> finding them guilty, beyond
reasonable doubt, of the crime of robbery with homicide, committed with one
aggravating circumstance and without any mitigating circumstance to offset the
same, and sentencing both to suffer the penalty of death, to indemnify, jointly
and severally, the heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>
Mariano in the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, and each to pay
one-half of the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the morning of June 15, 1966 the Police Department of <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> was informed
that the body of a dead man had been found on the shoulder of a certain portion
of the <span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span> Highway located in barrio <span class="SpellE">Dakila</span> of said municipality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cailipan</span>,
who was dispatched immediately to investigate the case, found on a slope of the
shoulder of the highway, partly hidden by tall grasses, the dead body of a man
apparently a victim of foul play because his right eye was swollen, his neck
bore scratches and the back of his head had a big gaping wound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Searching the body, he found money in the
pockets of the dead man's pants, one ring with the initial "M", and a
piece of, paper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had the cadaver
taken to the morgue of the Provincial Hospital of <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>
where it remained until <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">noon</st1:time> of that
day.</p>

<p class="BODY">Earlier that morning, one <span class="SpellE">Macaria</span>
Garcia had reported to <span class="SpellE">Justo</span> Cruz, Chief of Police of
<span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Bulacan</span></span>,
that, contrary to what her son-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> Mariano,
used to do everyday after he was through with his work as a tricycle driver, he
failed to return home the previous night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Chief Cruz called up the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>
by telephone to relay the information to him and he was, in turn, informed that
the dead body of a man, who apparently answered the description of the missing
person, had been found in barrio <span class="SpellE">Dakila</span>, within the
jurisdiction of <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Chief Cruz and some relatives of the missing
man then went to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Malolos</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Provincial</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
where they found and identified the dead body of <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>
Mariano.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the Medico-Legal Officer of <span class="SpellE">Bu­lacan</span> could not be contacted, the cadaver was brought to
the NBI office in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> where an
autopsy was conducted by Dr. Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Ibarrola</span>, the
NBI Medico-Legal Officer, whose findings are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">That same day - <st1:date year="1966" day="15" month="6">June 15,
 1966</st1:date> - having received con­fidential information <span class="GramE">that
appellants</span> herein had been seen around <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>
of June 14 at the crossing of <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, Chief of Police Cruz of said municipality ordered
that <span class="SpellE">Baluran</span> be fetched from his residence at barrio <span class="SpellE">Banga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While he was
evasive at the beginning of the in­vestigation to which he was subjected, he
broke down later on and disclosed to Lt. Felipe Adriano the circumstances
surrounding the killing of <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> Mariano between 12
o'clock midnight of June 13 and 1:00 o'clock in the morning of June 14, both of
1966; how his co-appellant dumped the body of their victim along the McArthur
Highway; how the two tried to go to <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> to sell
the Honda tricycle driven by their victim until they were intercepted at the
constabulary checkpoint at <span class="SpellE">Bamban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> and later on brought to <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>; how he was allowed to go home to get the
license of the Honda in San Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, while
his co-appellant was left in the custody of the constabulary detachment at <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
state­ment was reduced to writing that same day, signed by him before the
Investigating Officer and later sworn to by him before Municipal Judge Santiago
of <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> (Exhibit B).</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter Sgt. Elias <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>, Patrolmen
Lucas and de Mesa, of the Police Force of <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span>,
were ordered to fetch appellant <span class="SpellE">Morante</span> from <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The constabulary authorities at that place
delivered to them the person of said-appellant for custody, as well as the
Honda tricycle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They then returned to <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> where they arrived at past <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date year="1966" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Hours</span> later appellant <span class="SpellE">Morante</span>
gave a written statement describing her participation in the robbery of the
tricycle and in the killing of <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> Mariano, which
was later subscribed and sworn to by her before Municipal Judge Santiago
(Exhibit A).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Honda tricycle mentioned above worth P1<span class="GramE">,850.00</span>
belonged to Fernando Garcia, father-in-law of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>
Mariano who was the one driving it to ferry pas­sengers within the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
and from said municipality to nearby towns such as <span class="SpellE">Guiguinto</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the time of his death, Mariano was 37 years of age, married to <span class="SpellE">Agripina</span> Garcia and with several children.</p>

<p class="BODY">Aside from the Honda tricycle the Police Department of <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> recovered from appellant <span class="SpellE">Baluran</span>
a watch worth P60.00 (Exhibit C), and from appellant <span class="SpellE">Morante</span>,
the driver's license of the deceased Mariano (Exhibit D), his residence
certificate (Exhibit E) and a prayer book (Exhibit F).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the evidence thus gathered by the authorities, a
criminal complaint for robbery with homi­cide was filed against appellants in
the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As they waived in writing the preliminary
investigation (Record p. 16) the case was forwarded to the Court of First
Instance where the Pro­vincial Fiscal filed the following information:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 15th day of June, 1966, in the
municipality of <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span>, pro­vince of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable Court, the said accused Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Baluran</span> y<i>
</i><span class="SpellE">Yaon</span> alias Rod and Rosario <span class="SpellE">Morante</span>
alias <span class="SpellE">Charing</span>, armed with blunt instruments,
conspiring and confederating together and helping one another, did then and
there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously, with
intent of gain and by means of violence, force and intimidation, take, rob and
carry away with them the following property, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>one (1) man's wrist watch marked '<span class="SpellE">Baybis</span>', valued at P60.00, cash money in the amount of
P4.00, driver's license, prayer book and residence certificate, all belonging
to <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> Mariano; and one (1) mo­torcycle marked
'Honda', 65 cc, with side car<i>, </i>valued at P1,800.00, belonging to
Fernando Garcia, to the damage and prejudice of the said owners in the total
sum of P1,864.00; that during the commission of robbery or on the occasion
thereof, the said accused, conspiring and confederating together and helping
one another, did then and there <span class="SpellE">wil­fully</span>, unlawfully
and feloniously attack, assault and hit with blunt instruments they were then provided
the said <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> Mariano, hitting the latter on the
vital parts of his body, thereby causing serious physical injuries which
directly caused the death of the said <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> Mariano
and in order to conceal or destroy the body of the crime, the said accused, in
furtherance of their conspiracy, dumped the body of the said <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> Mariano along the side of the <span class="SpellE">Mac­Arthur</span>
Highway and the railroad track at barrio <span class="SpellE">Dakila</span>, <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That in the commission of this crime, the following
aggravating circumstances were present to wit: (1) use of superior strength,
(2) <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span>, (3) evident premeditation, and (4)
treachery.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Contrary to law."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It appears that at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>
on <st1:date year="1966" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1966</st1:date> appellant <span class="SpellE">Morante</span> boarded the tricycle driven by the deceased <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> Mariano and had herself taken to barrio <span class="SpellE">Tabang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Guiguinto</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Along the
way, she had the vehicle stopped to allow her co-appellant <span class="SpellE">Baluran</span>
to ride with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching barrio <span class="SpellE">Tabang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Morante</span> got off but
returned soon saying that the person she was looking for was not in his
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They then motored back towards <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span>, but before reaching the "crossing" <span class="SpellE">Morante</span> told Mariano to proceed to <span class="SpellE">Bagong</span>
<span class="SpellE">Silang</span> where she wanted to borrow some money from
someone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once near the alleged house of
the latter, appellants ordered the tricycle to stop, and <span class="SpellE">Baluran</span>
got off and proceeded in the direction of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Returning shortly thereafter, he told Mariano
to wait for a short while because <span class="SpellE">Romy</span> was getting
ready.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, <span class="SpellE">Morante</span> also got off the tricycle and pretended to answer a
call of nature at a nearby place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then,
the driver of the tricycle - who remained astride the driver's seat - was
suddenly hit on the neck with a blunt instrument, and afterwards successive
blows rained on his head, face and other parts of the body, as a result of
which he fell down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Taking him for dead,
appellants put him on the side car of the tricycle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then appellant <span class="SpellE">Morante</span>
started the engine and drove towards <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span> Highway</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Along the way <span class="SpellE">Baluran</span>
threw the iron bar on the road side, and when they reached barrio <span class="SpellE">Dakila</span> they dumped the body of their victim on the shoulder
of the highway near a ditch with growing tall grass the same place where it was
discovered later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants then
searched the body of their victim and deprived him of P4.00, of his wrist
watch, residence certificate and a prayer book.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Afterwards, with appellant <span class="SpellE">Morante</span> still at
the driver's seat they proceeded northward with the intention of going to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city> where they intended to sell
the tricycle, but at the <span class="SpellE">Bamban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>
P.C. checkpoint, they were stopped at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00
 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning by the soldier on guard duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the latter questioned appellant <span class="SpellE">Morante</span>, she admitted that she had no driver's license and
that the ownership papers of the vehicle were not with her but with the owner,
her uncle, living in Sat Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the guard noticed <span class="GramE">blood
stains on the bar handles</span> of the tricycle and on the floor of the side
car, she told him that the same came from her nose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon further question­ing, she also said that
they had hit a person riding in the tricycle.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Due to their suspicious behavior, both were taken to the P.C.
headquarters located at <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Discussing the defense evidence, the trial court says the
following in the appealed decision:</p>

<blockquote>"The two accused admit the killing of the driver, although
each points to the other as the one responsible for said death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both admit having taken the body to a lonely
grassy place to hide it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They admit
having taken the tricycle from <span class="SpellE">Pla­ridel</span>, to <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, with <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city>
as the terminal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The burden of proving
their innocence is shifted to them, but each one of said accused failed to give
a clear and convincing explanation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is noteworthy that each of the accused tried very hard to throw the blame on
each other for only the killing of the victim and not on the robbery of the
tricycle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, the
written state­ments of both accused appearing on Exhibits A and B bore all the
marks of a true con­fession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same
were written in <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>, the native language of
accused <span class="SpellE">Morante</span> who reached first year in the high
school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said language is also fairly
spoken by accused <span class="SpellE">Baluran</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The details of said con­fessions tally with
the killing of the de­ceased driver, the taking of the Honda for sale to <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>, the hiding of the dead driver, the taking of money,
driver's license, wrist watch, residence certificate, and prayer book from the
victim; the inter­ception by the PC at the checkpoint at <span class="SpellE">Bam­ban</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, the attempt on their part to mislead the
police about the presence of blood clots on the motor and on the footrest of
the cab of the tricycle, their attempts to show to the PC authorities in <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> that the said tricycle was owned by an uncle of the
girl who lived in San Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, the
surrender by accused <span class="SpellE">Baluran</span> of the watch of the
deceased, the surrender by <span class="SpellE">Morante</span> of the license,
residence certificate, and the prayer book belonging to the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, were it not for the immediate
confession of this accused <span class="SpellE">Baluran</span>, the detention of
Ro­sario <span class="SpellE">Morante</span> in <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>
PC Headquarters could not have been known to the local police of <span class="SpellE">Pla­ridel</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lt.
Felipe Adriano and Municipal Judge Francisco Santiago of <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span>
both testified to the <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> and freedom with
which the said statements had been given.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The father of Rosario <span class="SpellE">Morante</span> was only outside
of the room where her statement was taken and he could not have been unaware of
any maltreat­ment her daughter suffered, if indeed she suffered anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, from a<i> </i>perusal of his
statements in court, he appeared to be a resigned father who expected the worst
from his child in view of her boyish and wayward nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge Francisco Santiago before whom the two
exhibits were subscribed and sworn to went beyond the ordinary norm of
conducting the preliminary investigation in this case by put­ting down in his
own penmanship additional questions and answers regarding the said statements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court is satisfied that said police
officer and Judge Santiago only did their duties, and were not biased in the
least.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As to the claim of each of the accused that only one of them
is really responsible for the killing of the driver, the Court believes and so
holds that the proven acts of the accused in running away with the motor
vehicle after the said driver was killed, the <span class="SpellE">asportation</span>
of money and other articles belonging to the victim constitute the complex
crime of robbery with homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
under Article 294, Paragraph 1, of the Revised Penal Code, this complex crime
is committed when robbery is proven and a homicide shall have been committed
'by reason or on occasion of the robbery.'</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"So it does not matter whether one or the
other killed the herein victim because, the latter was killed 'by reason of on
occasion of the robbery'.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
apart from the consideration of the acts of the accused in this case which
fully show that in the commission of the robbery there is concerted action and
meeting of the minds of the two accused, so that conspiracy has been well
established by the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
being a conspiracy, it is of no moment whether only one or both of them
delivered the fatal blows, for the act of one is the act of the other, and both
are equally responsible as principals."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In her brief appellant <span class="SpellE">Morante</span> contends
that the trial court erred in admitting her confession (Exhibit A) as well as
that of her co-appellant (Exhibit B) as evidence against her and that, as a
result, said court erred in not acquitting her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, <span class="SpellE">Baluran's</span> counsel de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span> contends that the trial court erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in admitting the latter's extrajudicial
confession as evidence against him; in proceeding with the trial of the case
without a previous valid preliminary investigation and, as a result, erred in
finding him guilty of the crime charged.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Baluran's</span> contention that there was no
previous valid preliminary investigation is without merit, firstly, because the
same was not raised at any stage of the pro­ceedings below; secondly, he and
his co-appellant had waived the preliminary investigation in the Municipal
Court of <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> (Record, p. 16).</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants also claim that the confessions in question should not
be given any probative value against them because they were obtained through
force and inti­midation.</p>

<p class="BODY">After going over appellants' testimony (transcript of October 6,
1966, pp. 1-45 and 45-75) and other evidence presented to support their
contention, we find that the same is too weak and unreliable to overcome the
testimony of Lt. Felipe Adriano of the <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span>
Municipal Police, and of Francisco Santiago, municipal judge of the same
municipality (pp. 4-19 of the transcript of the stenographic notes
corresponding to August 11, 1966, respectively) show­ing that the aforesaid
confessions were made freely and voluntarily.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While it is true that they were taken in the police department of <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span>, it is equally true that the affiants were
subsequently taken to the presence of Muni­cipal Judge Santiago who had said
confessions read to them as they were, asking them afterwards whether they were
the questions made to them and the answers given by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both replied in the affirmative and further
affirmed in the pre­sence of said judge that they had not been subjected to any
violence, threat or intimidation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, Judge Santiago, whose credibility has not been assailed by
appel­lants, asked them additional questions now forming part of their
respective confession.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the particular case of appellant <span class="SpellE">Morante</span>,
who claims that she was given face blows and karate blows, the following
excerpts from the testimony of her own father would be sufficient, We believe,
to show that her claim deserves but scant consideration –</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
stated that you were able to talk with your daughter here the following days
after she was taken from <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> and that she
complained to you that her hair was pulled by a police of­ficer, did you come
to know that police officer?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
did not inquire from her who that policeman was, because I was not in­terested
in knowing who.</blockquote>

<blockquote>FISCAL</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did
you ask your daughter if she was hurt?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
was the answer?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
said - not very much.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Your
daughter also told you that some­body gave her a karate blow, did you ask her
who gave that karate blow to her?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
complained to me, sir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did not ask who
that person was.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
stated you did not ask her who that man was but did she tell you who that man
was?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the questioned statements (Exhibits A and B) are in <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>, the native language of <span class="SpellE">Mo­rante</span>,
and a dialect fairly spoken and understood by <span class="SpellE">Baluran</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their contents tally substantially in many
important respects with their respective testimony during the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each of them, however, claims that it was the
other who did the killing we agree with the lower court that while upon the
evidence it was appellant <span class="SpellE">Baluran</span> alone who inflicted
the fatal blows that killed Mariano, appellant <span class="SpellE">Morante</span>
is likewise responsible <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, the conspiracy to
rob and kill said deceased having been established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that appellant <span class="SpellE">Morante</span>
engaged the services of Mariano and the use of his tricycle on the night in
question; the fact that she later fetched her co-appellant and both directed
Mariano to take them to barrio <span class="SpellE">Tabang</span> pretend­ing
that <span class="SpellE">Morante</span> was going there to borrow money from
someone; the fact that while they were motoring back towards <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span>, <span class="SpellE">Morante</span> told the
tricycle driver to proceed to barrio <span class="SpellE">Bagong</span> <span class="SpellE">Silang</span> where she intended to see a relative by the name of <span class="SpellE">Romy</span> to borrow money from him; the fact that upon hearing
the alleged house of the latter, appellants ordered the tricycle driver to stop
and then appellant <span class="SpellE">Baluran</span> got off pretending to look
for <span class="SpellE">Romy</span> in the house just to come back later saying
that the latter was already getting ready; the further fact that <span class="SpellE">Morante</span> then got off of the tricycle and while she was
pretending to answer a call of nature at a nearby place, <span class="SpellE">Baluran</span>
attacked the unsuspecting tricycle driver with a blunt instrument, hitting him
on the neck, head and face, which injuries caused his death; the fact that they
afterwards took the body of their victim aboard the tricycle and dumped it on
the shoulder of the road along the <span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span> highway;
the fact that both appellants run away with the tricycle of the deceased with
the intention of selling it in <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City but were
unable to do so because they were apprehended at <span class="SpellE">Bamban</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>; lastly, the fact that both were found in the
possession of money and other things belonging to the deceased; all these can
lead us to but one conclusion, namely, that both appellants had conspired to
rob and kill the deceased <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> Mariano.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This makes one completely liable for the acts
of the other.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing makes it unnecessary for us to consider appellant <span class="SpellE">Morante's</span> contention that the trial court erred in
considering the confession made by her co-appellant as evidence against
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear from what has been
stated heretofore that, even disregarding the confession of <span class="SpellE">Baluran</span>,
the rest of the evidence of record is sufficient to support the judgment of
conviction against her.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crime of robbery with homicide charged having been proven
beyond reasonable <span class="GramE">doubt,</span> We come now to the
consideration of the manner and circumstances under which the crime was
committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the trial court
that the evidence of record shows that the deceased was attacked and killed
treacherously with a blunt instrument.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crime committed, considering all the foregoing, is robbery
with homicide penalized under paragraph 1 of Article 294 of the Revised Penal
Code with reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span> to death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This penalty should be imposed in its maximum
degree, the commission of the offense having been attended by one aggravating
circumstance without any mitigating circumstance to offset the same.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, it is our painful duty to affirm the appealed
judgment, except that the indemnity of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> is
increased to P12,000.00 to be paid, jointly and severally, by the appellants to
the heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> Mariano.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With costs.</span></p>
