				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan finding the above appellants guilty of murder and sentencing each of them &nbsp;to &nbsp;life imprisonment and to indemnify the heirs of the deceased Tan Sek Yee in &nbsp;the sum of P6,000.00, with costs. <p>Said appellants were charged with murder allegedly committed &nbsp;in May, 1959, in barrio Carmen, municipality of Rosales, province of Pangasinan. &nbsp;The information alleged that said accused, &nbsp;conspiring together and mutually aiding one another with &nbsp;intent to kill, feloniously attacked Tan Sek Yee and inflicted upon him wounds and injuries that caused &nbsp;instant death.</p> <p>After a plea of not &nbsp;guilty, trial ensued &nbsp;and judgment was subsequently &nbsp;rendered, from which all of the above accused, seeking acquittal therefrom, &nbsp;presented appeals to this Court. &nbsp;The &nbsp;lower &nbsp;court, they contend, erred &nbsp;in &nbsp;finding: &nbsp;(1) that the &nbsp;offended party had &nbsp;been &nbsp;killed with treachery; (2) that in the commission of the &nbsp;crime, conspiracy among the three appellants had existed.</p> <p>The prosecution has &nbsp;proved that &nbsp;in &nbsp;the afternoon of May &nbsp;30, &nbsp;1959, in &nbsp;the United &nbsp;Restaurant of Carmen, &nbsp;Rosales, &nbsp;Pangasinan, Leodizon &nbsp;Honrado and Regino &nbsp;Leonin sat with one named "Kenkoy" engaged in a drinking spree. While sipping beer, one of them tossed a bottle under the table whereat the waitress Gliceria &nbsp;Quicho and her companions were enjoying &nbsp;their &nbsp;lunch. &nbsp;Presently, the &nbsp;said two &nbsp;accused, Leodizon and &nbsp;Regino caused a disturbance, bumping and toppling down &nbsp;the chairs. &nbsp;So, Tan Sek &nbsp;Yee, the old Chinese owner &nbsp;of the restaurant, emerged from his room to stop the trouble.. &nbsp;But the two resisted, fought the owner, &nbsp;even dragged him outside &nbsp;the restaurant, where the said two accused continued &nbsp;boxing their victim, &nbsp;who naturally - defended himself. &nbsp;At this &nbsp;juncture, a passenger jeepney bearing plate No. &nbsp;42489, (Pangasinan) arrived; and &nbsp;Anselmo &nbsp;Leonin, alighting &nbsp;from &nbsp;the vehicle, &nbsp; pulled an iron bar from its front &nbsp;seat and then rushed &nbsp;to &nbsp;join the scuffle. &nbsp; Without warning, &nbsp;said Anselmo struck the Chinese with the &nbsp;iron bar three &nbsp;times. &nbsp;The first blow on the left side of the head forced &nbsp;Tan Sek &nbsp;Yee to fall &nbsp;into a sitting position. &nbsp;The &nbsp;second &nbsp;and third blows, &nbsp;hit the left side of his neck. &nbsp;Whereupon, the Chinaman &nbsp;fell on the ground, and &nbsp;Anselmo rushed back &nbsp;to his jeepney to drive away on the road to &nbsp;Manila. &nbsp;The accused &nbsp;Regino and Leodizon, after the victim had fallen, returned to the Restaurant.</p> <p>The Chinaman &nbsp;died immediately of cerebral hemorrhage due to fracture of the skull and laceration of the brain. Dr. Rodolfo C. Flores, who &nbsp;performed the autopsy, attributed the &nbsp; wound and &nbsp;fracture &nbsp;to &nbsp;blows from a blunt instrument, like an iron bar.</p> <p>Both &nbsp;Regino Leonin and &nbsp;Leodizon Honrado denied all participation in the commission of &nbsp;the offense. &nbsp;Regino swore that all the time, he and Leodizon Honrado were at the United Restaurant drinking liquor; that they had proceeded to said place &nbsp;after &nbsp;having imbibed some wine in the market of Carmen; &nbsp;that while they were there, nothing beyond the ordinary happened inside the said restaurant ; that as he was drunk, he could not remember &nbsp;anything, &nbsp;except having gone back and forth from his seat and that later, a PC soldier took him to the municipal building.</p> <p>Leodizon Honrado corroborated the testimony of Regino. He stated that on May 30, 1959, after having had &nbsp;some drinks in the Rosales market, he went to the United Restaurant and met Regino on the way; that there he drank some more, this time with another man called" Kenkoy"; that while they were drinking, the owner of the restaurant, Tan Sek Yee, went to their table and inquired who of them would &nbsp;pay the bill; that when said "Kenkoy" answered that he &nbsp;would, the Chinese insulted them, calling: them "balasubas; that upon &nbsp;hearing this insult, he stood up, pushed "Lolo" (the Chinese) &nbsp;to &nbsp;the door of the &nbsp;restaurant and told the latter to &nbsp;leave them (the drinkers) &nbsp;alone; that when &nbsp;he returned to their table, his &nbsp;companions Regino and "Kenkoy" were gone; that he once more sat down to resume his lebation. &nbsp;He &nbsp;also swore that &nbsp;although he knows Anselmo Leonin, he did not meet him that day, May 30, 1959, nor the &nbsp;day before.</p> <p>On his part, the accused Anselmo Leonin &nbsp;claimed that on May 30, he drove his jeepney to &nbsp; pick up &nbsp;passengers beginning at about 6:00 o'clock in the morning; took his lunch &nbsp;in Carmen &nbsp;at noon, and &nbsp;continued his &nbsp;driving until about &nbsp;6:00 o'clock in the afternoon when he &nbsp;was arrested for the &nbsp;death of Tan &nbsp;Sek Yee. &nbsp;&nbsp;To confirm &nbsp;his story, he presented Wilfredo Cabegas, the conductor of his jeepney. After carefully &nbsp;examining the record, we are persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that the evidence sufficiently shows both &nbsp; accused &nbsp;Regino Leonin and Leodizon Honrado &nbsp;to have laid violent hands upon Tan Sek Yee; and that appellant Anselmo Leonin delivered the fatal blow with an iron bar.</p> <p>Under the &nbsp;circumstances, however, is it right to hold all three accused, &nbsp;guilty of murder? &nbsp;Did conspiracy exist in the commission of &nbsp;the crime?</p> <p>The trial court found conspiracy to exist because Leodizon Honrado and Regino Leonin entered the United Restaurant together and provoking the victim to anger, they dragged him around the place and beat him up; and during the scuffle, Anselmo Leonin, brother of Regino, entered the scene to deliver the fatal blow with an iron bar. &nbsp;Thus the lower court concluded that there &nbsp;was a common purpose to liquidate the Chinaman, the said two accused, Regino and Leodizon having performed acts &nbsp;without &nbsp;which Anselmo &nbsp;Leonin could not have treacherously made the attack.</p> <p>The &nbsp;evidence introduced during the trial, does not support the &nbsp;conclusion that when Leodizon Honrado and Regino Leonin entered the restaurant, they had made plans to kill the deceased. &nbsp;No motive has been shown that would kindle the desire to liquidate said Chinaman. &nbsp;The arrival of the accused Anselmo was purely coincidental. &nbsp;The fight happened in a street that said &nbsp;Anselmo regularly &nbsp;passed with his jeepney. &nbsp;He joined the scuffle upon the impulsie of the moment. Seeing his &nbsp;brother &nbsp;in &nbsp;a &nbsp;mix-up, &nbsp;he &nbsp;reacted spontaneously.</p> <p>In People<i> vs. </i>Iba√±ez, 77 Phil. 664, Cosme &nbsp;Magalong and Sixto Ibanez &nbsp;had a quarrel. &nbsp;&nbsp;Cosme ran and was pursued by Sixto Ibanez. &nbsp;Overtaking him, Sixto held Cosme around the neck from behind. &nbsp;And while they were struggling, Irineo, who &nbsp;had followed &nbsp;Sixto (his brother) &nbsp;suddenly stabbed Cosme to death. &nbsp;As held by this Court, only Irineo was guilty of murder. &nbsp;Sixto &nbsp;was acquitted, because he was not &nbsp;aware of the murderous intent of his brother. The same doctrine was applied in People<i> vs.</i> Delfin, L15230, L-45979-81, &nbsp;July 31, 1961. &nbsp;&nbsp;In that case, while Francisco and Renato were fighting, Eladio (cousin of &nbsp;the latter) approached and suddenly stabbed Francisco. &nbsp;&nbsp;We held Eladio to be solely responsible for frustrated murder, in the absence of conspiracy, the wounding having been unexpected.</p> <p>The alibi of the defendants &nbsp;must be &nbsp;discounted. &nbsp;Prosecution witnesses David Knopt <sup><font color="#ff0000">[1]</font></sup> and his wife, saw and described the &nbsp;events. &nbsp; Their testimonies &nbsp;are &nbsp;consistent, corroborative and clear. &nbsp;These witnesses being complete strangers to the appellants, could have no motive to falsely testify; and Jesus Gloria, 55, identified them too. &nbsp;Finally, the arrest of Anselmo and Regino on the &nbsp;same day clinched the case.</p> <p>Considering that when the accused Anselmo mortally hit the victim, Tan Sek Yee was trying to defend himself (by parrying the blows from the accused Regino and Leodizon) he could not have been aware of any other assailant. &nbsp;And as the attack of Anselmo was sudden, there was treachery. In view of the foregoing, we hold that as recommended by the Solicitor-General, Regino Leonin and Leodizon Honrado should be held guilty only of slight physical injuries; but &nbsp;Anselmo &nbsp;Leonin should be convicted of murder.</p> <p>Consequently, &nbsp;&nbsp;heeding &nbsp;the &nbsp;official &nbsp;&nbsp;recommendation, appellants Regino Leonin and &nbsp;Leodizon &nbsp;Honrado are each sentenced to 20 days of <i>arresto menor</i> under Art. 266 of the &nbsp;Revised Penal &nbsp;Code. &nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, appellant Anselmo Leonin is sentenced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to pay the heirs of the deceased Tan Sek Yee, the amount of P6,000.00 &nbsp;Costs against appellants.</p> <p><i>Padilla, Labrador, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala,</i> and <i>Makalintal, JJ.,</i> concur.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p></p><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"> <sup><font color="#ff0000">[1]</font> </sup> Wrote down the license number of the jeepney in a Free Press magazine which he then carried.</div>
