				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The two above-entitled cases were ordered consolidated by the
Resolution of this Court dated <st1:date month="4" day="29" year="1970">April
 29, 1970</st1:date>, (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, No. L-31878, p. 58),
because the petitioners in both cases seek similar relief, through these petitions
for <i>certiorari</i> by way of appeal, from the amended decision of respondent
Court of Appeals which affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>
the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
ordering "the defendants (herein petitioners Great Pacific Life Assurance
Company and <span class="SpellE">Mondragon</span>) jointly and severally to pay
plaintiff (herein private respondent Ngo <span class="SpellE">Hing</span>) the
amount of P50,000.00 with interest at 6% from the date of the filing of the
complaint, and the sum of P10,000.00 <span style="">as
</span>attorney's fees plus costs of suits."</p>

<p class="BODY">In its original decision, the respondent Court of Appeals set
aside the appealed decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, and absolved the petitioners from liability on the
insurance policy, but ordered the reimbursement to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
(herein private respondent) the amount of P1<span class="GramE">,077.75</span>,
without interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that on <st1:date year="1957" day="14" month="3">March
 14, 1957</st1:date>, private respondent Ngo <span class="SpellE">Hing</span>
filed an application with the Great Pacific Life Assurance Company (hereinafter
referred to as Pacific Life) for a twenty-year endowment policy in the amount
of P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> on the life of his one-year old daughter
Helen Go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said respondent supplied the
essential data which petitioner <span class="SpellE">Lapulapu</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Mondragon</span>, Branch Manager of the Pacific Life in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
wrote on the corresponding form in his own handwriting (Exhibit I-M).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mondragon</span> finally
type-wrote the data on the application form which was signed by private
respondent Ngo <span class="SpellE">Hing</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The latter paid the annual premium, the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,077.75</span>
going over to the Company, but he retained the amount of P1,317.00 as his
commission for being a duly authorized agent of Pacific Life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the payment of the insurance premium,
the binding deposit receipt (Exhibit E) was issued to private respondent Ngo <span class="SpellE">Hing</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise,
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Mondragon</span> handwrote at the bottom of the
back page of the application form his strong recommendation for the approval of
the insurance application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then on <st1:date month="4" day="30" year="1957">April 30, 1957</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Mondragon</span>
received a letter from Pacific Life disapproving the insurance application
(Exhibit 3-M).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The letter stated that
the said life insurance application for 20-year endowment plan is not available
for minors below seven years old, but Pacific Life can consider the same under
the Juvenile Triple Action Plan, and advised that if the offer is acceptable,
the Juvenile Non-Medical Declaration be sent to the Company.</p>

<p class="BODY">The non-acceptance of the insurance plan by Pacific Life was
allegedly not communicated by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Mondragon</span> to
private respondent Ngo <span class="SpellE">Hing</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, on May 6, 1957, <span class="SpellE">Mondragon</span>
wrote back Pacific Life again strongly recommending the approval of the 20-year
endowment life insurance on the ground that Pacific Life is the only insurance
company not selling the 20-year endowment insurance plan to children, pointing
out that since 1954 the customers, especially the Chinese, were asking for such
coverage (Exhibit 4-M).</p>

<p class="BODY">It was when things were in such state that on <st1:date month="5" day="28" year="1957">May 28, 1957</st1:date> Helen Go died of influenza with
complication of <span class="SpellE">broncho</span>-pneumonia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, private respondent sought the
payment of the proceeds of the insurance, but having failed in his effort, he
filed the action for the recovery of the same before the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, which rendered the adverse decision
as earlier referred to against both petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decisive issues in these cases are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) whether the binding deposit receipt
(Exhibit E) constituted a temporary contract of the life insurance in question;
and (2) whether private respondent Ngo <span class="SpellE">Hing</span> concealed
the state of health and physical condition of Helen Go, which rendered void the
aforesaid Exhibit E.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the back of Exhibit E <span class="GramE">are</span> condition precedents required before a<span style=""> </span>deposit is considered a BINDING
RECEIPT.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These conditions state that:</p>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the Company or its agent, shall received
the premium deposit xxx and the insurance application, ON or PRIOR to the date
of medical examination xxx <u>said insurance shall be in force and in effect</u>
from the date of such medical examination, for such period as is covered by the
deposit xxx, <u>PROVIDED the company shall be satisfied that on said date the
applicant was insurable on standard rates under its rule</u> for the amount of
insurance and the kind of policy requested in the application.</blockquote>

<blockquote>D.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>If the Company does not accept the
application</u> on standard rate for the amount of insurance and/or the kind of
policy requested in the application <u>but</u> issue, or <u>offers to issue a
policy for a different plan and/or amount</u> xxx, <u>the insurance shall not
be in force and in effect until the applicant shall have accepted the policy</u>
as issued or <u>offered by the Company</u> and shall have paid the full premium
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>If the applicant does not
accept the policy, the deposit shall be refunded</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>E.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>If the applicant shall not have been
insurable under Condition A above, and the Company declines to approve the
application, the insurance applied for shall not have been in force at any time
and the sum paid be returned to the applicant</u> upon the surrender of this
receipt." <span class="GramE">(Emphases Ours).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
provisions printed on Exhibit E show that the binding deposit receipt is
intended to be merely a provisional or temporary insurance contract and only
upon compliance of the following conditions:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) that the company shall be satisfied that the applicant was insurable
on standard rates; (2) that if the company does not accept the application and
offers to issue a policy for a different plan, the insurance contract shall not
be binding until the applicant accepts the policy offered; otherwise, the
deposit shall be refunded; and (3) that if the applicant is not insurable according
to the standard rates, and the company disapproves the application, the
insurance applied for shall not be in force at any time, and the premium paid
shall be returned to the applicant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Clearly implied from the
aforesaid conditions is that the binding deposit receipt in question is merely
an acknowledgment, on behalf of the company, that the latter's branch office
had received from the applicant the insurance premium and had accepted the
application subject for processing by the insurance company; and that the
latter will either approve or reject the same on the basis of whether or not
the applicant is "insurable on standard rates." </span><span style="">Since </span><span style="">petitioner Pacific Life disapproved the insurance application of
respondent Ngo <span class="SpellE">Hing</span>, the binding deposit receipt in
question had never become in force at any time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon this premise, the
binding deposit receipt (Exhibit </span><span style="">E)
is, </span><span style="">manifestly, merely conditional
and does not insure outright.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As held by
this Court, where an agreement is made between the applicant and the agent, no
liability shall attach until the principal approves the risk and a receipt </span><span style="">is given by the </span><span style="">agent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The acceptance is merely conditional, and is subordinated to the act of
the company in approving or rejecting the application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in life insurance, a "binding
slip" or "binding receipt" does not insure by itself (De Lim vs.
Sun Life Assurance Company of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Canada</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">, 41 Phil. 264).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It bears repeating that through the <span style="">intra-company </span>communication of <st1:date year="1957" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1957</st1:date> (Exhibit 3-M)<span class="GramE">,</span>
Pacific Life disapproved the insurance application in question on the ground
that it is not offering the twenty-year endowment insurance policy to children
less than seven years of age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What it
offered instead is another plan known as the Juvenile Triple Action, which
private respondent failed to accept.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the absence of a meeting of the minds between petitioner Pacific Life and
private respondent Ngo <span class="SpellE">Hing</span> over the 20-year endowment
life insurance in the amount of P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> in favor of
the latter's one-year old daughter, and with the non-compliance of the <span class="SpellE">abovequoted</span> conditions stated in the disputed binding
deposit receipt, there could have been no insurance contract duly perfected
between them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the deposit
paid by private respondent shall have to be refunded by Pacific Life.</p>

<p class="BODY">As held in De Lim vs. Sun Life Assurance Company of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
<u>supra</u>, "a contract of insurance, like other contracts, must be
assented to by both parties either in person or by their agents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
contract, to be binding from the date of the application, must have been a
completed contract, one that leaves nothing to be done, nothing to be
completed, nothing to be passed upon, or determined, before it shall take
effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can be no contract of
insurance unless the minds of the parties have met in agreement."</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not impressed with private respondent's contention that
failure of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Mondragon</span> to communicate to him
the rejection of the insurance application would not have any adverse effect on
the allegedly perfected temporary contract (Respondent's Brief, pp.
13-14).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, there was no
contract perfected between the parties who had no meeting of their minds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent, being an authorized
insurance agent of Pacific Life at <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>
branch office, is indubitably aware that said company does not offer the life
insurance applied for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he filed the
insurance application in dispute, private respondent was, therefore, only
taking the chance that Pacific Life will approve the recommendation of <span class="SpellE">Mondragon</span> for the acceptance and approval of the
application in question along with his proposal that the insurance company
starts to offer the 20-year endowment insurance plan for children less than
seven years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, the record
discloses that Pacific Life had rejected the proposal and recommendation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, having an insurable interest on the
life of his one-year old daughter, aside from being an insurance agent and an
office associate of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Mondragon</span>, private
respondent Ngo <span class="SpellE">Hing</span> must have known and followed the
progress on the processing of such application and could not pretend ignorance
of the Company's rejection of the 20-year endowment life insurance application.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, We find it fit to quote with approval, the very
apt observation of then Appellate Associate Justice <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span>
G. Martin who later came up to this Court, from his dissenting opinion to the
amended decision of the respondent court which completely reversed the original
decision, the following:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"Of course, there is
the insinuation that neither the memorandum of rejection (Exhibit 3-M) </span>nor
the reply thereto of appellant <span class="SpellE">Mondragon</span> reiterating
the desire of applicant's father to have the application considered as one for
a 20-year endowment plan was ever duly communicated to Ngo <span class="SpellE">Hing</span>,
father of the minor applicant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am not
quite convinced that this was so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ngo <span class="SpellE">Hing</span>, as father of the applicant herself, was precisely the
"underwriter who wrote this case" (Exhibit H-1).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The unchallenged statement of appellant <span class="SpellE">Mondragon</span> in his letter of May 6, 1957 (Exhibit 4-M),
specifically admits that said Ngo <span class="SpellE">Hing</span> was "our
associate" and that it was the latter who "insisted that the plan be
placed on the 20-year endowment plan." Under these circumstances, it is
inconceivable that the progress in the processing of the application was not
brought home to his knowledge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He must
have been duly apprised of the rejection of the application for a 20-year
endowment plan otherwise <span class="SpellE">Mondragon</span> would not have
asserted that it was Ngo <span class="SpellE">Hing</span> himself who insisted on
the application as originally filed, thereby implicitly declining the offer to
consider the application under the Juvenile Triple Action Plan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the associate of <span class="SpellE">Mondragon</span>
that he was, Ngo <span class="SpellE">Hing</span> should only be presumed to know
what kind of policies are available in the company for minors below 7 years
old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What he and <span class="SpellE">Mondragon</span>
were apparently trying to do in the <span style="">premises
was merely to prod the company into going into the business of issuing
endowment policies for minors just as other insurance companies allegedly
do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Until such a definite policy is,
however, adopted by the company, it can hardly be said that it could have been
bound at all under the binding slip for a plan of insurance that it could not
have, by then, issued at all." <span class="GramE">(Amended Decision, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 52-53).</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Relative to the second
issue of alleged concealment, this Court is of the firm belief that private
respondent had deliberately concealed the state of health and physical condition
of his daughter Helen Go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When private
respondent supplied the required essential data for the insurance application
form, he was fully aware that his one-year old daughter is typically a
mongoloid child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a congenital
physical defect could never be ensconced nor disguised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, private respondent, in apparent
bad faith, withheld the fact material to the risk to be assumed by the
insurance company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As an insurance agent
of Pacific Life, he ought to know, as he surely must have known, his duty and
responsibility to supply such a material fact.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Had he divulged said significant fact in the insurance application form,
Pacific Life would have verified the same and would have had no choice but to
disapprove the application outright.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The contract of insurance
is one of perfect good faith (<span class="SpellE">uberrima</span> fides meaning
good faith; absolute and perfect candor or openness and honesty; the absence of
any concealment or deception, however slight [Black's Law Dictionary, 2nd
Edition], not for the insured alone but equally so for the insurer (<span class="SpellE">Fieldman's</span> Insurance Co., Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Songco</span>, 25 SCRA 70).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Concealment is a neglect to communi</span>cate
that which a party knows and ought to communicate (Section 25, Act No. 2427).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether intentional or unintentional, the
concealment entitles the insurer to rescind the contract of insurance (Section
26, id.; Yu Pang Cheng vs. Court of Appeals, et al., 105 Phil. 930; <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> vs. Philippine American Life Insurance Company, 7
SCRA 316).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent appears
guilty thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are thus constrained to hold that no insurance contract was
perfected between the parties with the non-compliance of the conditions
provided in the binding receipt, and concealment, as legally defined, having
been committed by herein private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the decision appealed from is hereby set aside,
and in lieu thereof, one is hereby entered absolving petitioners <span class="SpellE">Lapulapu</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Mondragon</span> and Great
Pacific Life Assurance Company from their civil liabilities as found by
