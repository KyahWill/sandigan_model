				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from separate orders of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>, decreeing the judicial recount of ballots cast in
Precinct <span style="">No. 13 </span>of <span class="SpellE">Bongao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>, and directing the
municipal board of canvassers to canvass the election returns from all the
precincts in said municipality, including the judicial canvass return of
Precinct No. 13 and, based upon the returns, to proclaim the winner to the
position of municipal mayor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The factual background of the case is that in the November
elections of 1967 Binging Ho and <span class="SpellE">Bonsan</span> Go were
candidates duly voted for the position of municipal mayor of <span class="SpellE">Bongao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the course of the canvass of the election
returns, the municipal board of canvassers found out that the return for
Precinct No. 13 contained the following entries:</p>

<p class="BODY">The municipal board of canvassers thereupon decided to hold in
abeyance the canvass of the said return and proceeded with the canvass of
returns from the other precincts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
returns from all the precincts, excluding that from Precinct No. 13, gave to
candidate Binging Ho a total of 1,599 votes and to candidate Go 1,582
votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, the winners in,
the other municipal positions were all proclaimed.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the discrepancy in the election return from Precinct No. 13
involves 20 votes which, if counted in favor of candidate Go, would materially
affect the result of the election, Binging Ho filed on November 21, 1967 in the
Court <span style="">of
First Instance </span>of <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span> a petition for recount
of the ballots cast in Precinct No. 13.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Alleging further that six of the ten (10)-man board of canvassers,
without notice to the other members, convened on <st1:date year="1967" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1967</st1:date> and proclaimed <span class="SpellE">Bonsan</span>
Go as elected mayor, petitioner also prayed the court for the annulment of said
proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1967</st1:date>, while the court was receiving
evidence on the motion to <span style="">dismiss </span>filed by respondent <span class="SpellE">Bonsan</span> Go,
who claimed that his proclamation had rendered the petition moot, the Commission
on Elections issued a resolution declaring the earlier proclamation of said
respondent <span style="">null
and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, </span>the
motion to dismiss was denied, and the court of first instance proceeded with
the reception of evidence on the petition for judicial recount.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1968</st1:date>,
after both parties were duly heard, the court granted the petition and ordered
a recount of the ballots in Precinct No. 13.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The judicial canvass was carried out; on the same day, the Board of Ju­dicial
Recount for Precinct No. 13 submitted in open court the result of the recount
showing petitioner Binging Ho to have obtained 112 votes against 98 for
respondent <span class="SpellE">Bonsan</span> Go.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In view thereof, the court issued an order of even date, directing the
municipal board of canvassers to convene on April 15, 1968 to canvass the votes
in Precinct No. 13, using the judicial canvass return, and thereafter, to
proclaim the winning candidate on the basis of the total votes received by the
candidates in all precincts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From these
court orders, respondent interposed the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">It cannot be disputed that, as to the number of votes received by
candidate Go, there was discrepancy between the figures and words appearing in
the election return for Precinct No. 13, which conflict or discrepancy would
materially affect the result of the election.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And, since there was no showing of alteration or falsification committed
on the said statement or return, the case clearly calls for a judicial recount
pursuant to Section 163, in relation to Section 168, of the Revised Election
Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In contesting the validity of the recount-order of the court
below, respondent-appellant raises the issue of the constitutionality of the
aforementioned Sections 163 and 168 of the Revised Election Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He urges that, insofar as they confer upon
the court of first instance the administrative function of judicial recount,
the questioned provisions violate the constitutional mandates vesting judicial
power upon the courts,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>and on the Commission on Elections
the authority to "decide, save those involving the right to vote all
administrative questions, affecting elections, including the determination of
the number and location of polling places, and the appointment of election
inspectors and of other election officials - - - - ."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
In other words, it is appellant's contention that, since the special power to
recount votes conferred on the court of first instance by the Revised Election
Code "does not in itself involve a decision in a judicial
controversy"; that it is "separate and apart from the general exercise
(by the court) of jurisdiction set forth in the Judiciary Act of 1948, as
amended, and only a step in the election process leading to canvass and
proclamation";<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
then, recount is a proceeding essentially administrative or, at most,
quasi-judicial in nature, which the court has no authority to entertain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power to recount votes, according to
appellant, pertains to the Commission on Elections, the body empowered to
determine all administrative questions relative to elections, except the right
to vote (Section 2, Article X).</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's argument overlooks the fact that the actual recount
of the ballots by the court of first instance is but the necessary consequence
of <span style="">its </span>resolution of a
preliminary controversy, to wit, whether or not there are sufficient facts that
would warrant the opening of the ballot boxes and the recount of the ballots,
under section 163 of the Election Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The as­certaining that such basic facts do exist according to the
evidence submitted by the parties is essentially a judicial function, and it is
only after the court decides that the recount is legally justified that the
actual recount takes place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, while
the actual recount does not in itself involve a decision in a judicial controversy,
as we ruled in <span class="SpellE">Sanidad</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span>
(May, 1968), 23 S.C.R.A. 880, the preceding finding that a discrepancy exists
or does not exist between authentic copies of the returns, as required by the
election law, is an exercise of the judicial power to ascertain the facts, pass
upon their sufficiency, and apply the law to the controversy.</p>

<p class="BODY">That the resulting findings of the court are not subject to
appeal does not contradict the exercise of judicial power, for it is elementary
that appeal is not an inherent right but a purely statutory creation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be that the physical recount of the
ballots could have been more properly entrusted to an administrative agency
after the court decided that such recount is war­ranted; but as a mere adjunct
inextricably linked to the latter, we think that it was within the legislative
discretion to confer upon the trial court the authority to carry out the
recount, for the sake of expediency, instead of burdening the parties with the
task of resorting to another forum.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be borne in mind that recount is <span style="">a </span>special relief designed to meet a
special need - to bring prompt settlement to a controversy that can be attained
without going through, and awaiting the result of, a laborious and long-drawn
election contest, and restore public tranqui­lity by dispelling doubt as to the
true number (although not necessarily the validity) of votes cast for
particular candidates in a given precinct.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
And the advisability of this function as discharged by the court of first
instance was already underscored in the case of <u><span style="">Ramos vs. Commission on Elections</span></u><span style="">, </span>80 Phil. 722.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that
case, where this Court sustained the refusal by the Commission to take
cognizance of a complaint against an action of the municipal board of
canvassers on the ground of <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of a protest in
the court of first instance, we said:</p>

<blockquote>"- - - - Before the proclamation of election, any candidate
may petition the Court of First Instance to recount the votes cast in any
precinct in case of discrepancies between copies of statements of elec­tion (<span class="SpellE">secs</span>. 163 and 168, Revised Election Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the proclamation, any candidate may
file an election protest within two weeks (sec. 174 <st1:state><st1:place><u>Id</u>.</st1:place></st1:state>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These specific legal provisions logically
compel any can­didate, within short time limits, to seek in the Court of First
Instance the corresponding relief against the regularity of a canvass of
election, and to the same extent relieve the Commission on Elections from the
duty of conducting similar investigations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To contend that the Commission on Elections has the ministerial
function, and therefore may be compelled by mandamus, to look into and act on
all election frauds, is indirectly to incapacitate it; for with its limited
personnel and facilities, the Commission on Elections cannot be expected to
take cognizance and promptly dispose of every complaint, similar to that made
by the petitioner, possibly to originate from countless municipalities in the
Philippines." (on page 724).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant also seems to have overlooked one basic feature of our
tripartite system of government:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the
existence of what Justice Holmes so appropriately termed penumbra of
governmental powers, of authorities "shading gradually from one extreme to
the other", and the absence of a mathematically precise distinctive line
between the actions of the recognized branches of government.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Realistically, the practical demands of efficient government would prevent
strict observance of the principle of separation of powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it has been said that in determining
the constitutionality of the exercise of power by a department, the question to
be asked is not whether the power is essentially legis­lative, executive or
judicial, but whether it has been specifically vested in it by the
Constitution, or properly incidental to the performance of the functions of
that department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And where the power is
not peculiarly or distinctly legislative, executive or judicial, it is with­in
the authority of the legislature to determine where its exercise would belong.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It cannot be claimed with certainty that the resolution of the
question of whether or not an alleged discrepancy in election returns justifies
the recounting of votes cast in the given precinct falls within the competence
of the Commission on Elections, under its authority to "decide save those
involving the right to vote all administrative questions, affecting elections,
including the determination of the number and loca­tion of polling places and
the appointment of election inspectors and of other election
officials".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To us, the authority
granted to the Commission on Elections by Section 2, Article X, of the
Constitution appears to be limited to questions purely administrative in
nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is evident not only from
the explicit withdrawal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> of the authority to
rule on the issue of right to vote but also from the enumeration of similar
matters within the intended coverage of the provision, such as the
determination of the number and location of polling places and the appointment
of election inspectors, etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The jurisdiction
to order a recount not having been vested by the Constitution upon any entity
or body, its conferment upon the court of first instance by the Election Code
is within the power and prerogative of the legislature.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's fear that the above conclusion would encourage the
parties to shuttle between the Commission and the court to secure their rights,
thus resulting in multiplicity of suits, is not a valid argument against a
lawful grant of authority upon the tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The possibility of the parties' availing of different <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> should not warrant the withdrawal from them of a
remedy that may yet be more accessible, adequate and expeditious.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>FOR THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS</b>, the orders appealed from
are affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Municipal Board of
Canvassers of <span class="SpellE">Bongao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>,
is hereby ordered to convene, in 3 days from receipt of this decision, for the
purpose of canvassing the returns from all the precincts in the municipality
including the judicial return from Precinct No. 13, and immediately there­after,
to proclaim the winning candidate for the position of Municipal Mayor on the
basis of the total votes appearing in the returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against the respondent-appellant.</p>
