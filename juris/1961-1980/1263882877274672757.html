				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal, by way of a petition for review, from (1) the
resolution dated July 31, 1969 of the respondent Court of Tax Appeals
dismissing the petition for review filed therein by the peti­tioner Dy Pac
&amp; Company, Inc. for lack of juris­diction, the same having been filed
beyond the 30-day period prescribed in Section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125 (AN
ACT CREATING THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS) and (2) the resolution dated November
24, 1969 denying the petitioner's motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The various steps, with their respective dates, taken by the
petitioner, through its chief accountant, and by the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, before the petition for review was presented to the Court of Tax
Appeals on July 5, 1968, are summarized in the main resolution appealed from,
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On March 9, 1967, respondent assessed against petitioner the
amounts of P85,233.02 and P54,408.23 as forest charges and surcharges and sales
tax and surcharge, res­pectively, or a total sum of P139,641.25 for the period
from April, 1961 to May, 1963.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On April 19, 1967, petitioner protested the assessment and
requested that it be cancelled or withdrawn. </blockquote>

<blockquote>"In a letter dated April 16, 1967, respondent denied the
protest of petit prier which letter was received by the petitioner on May 16,
1967.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On July 3, 1967, petitioner reiterated its objections to the
assessment, making reference to its previous letter of April 19, 1967, and
again requested that the same be cancelled or withdrawn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent, in a letter dated October 18,
1967, received by petitioner on November 7, 1967, denied the request for
cancellation of the assess­ment and held that -?</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'In view of the foregoing, you are hereby requested for the <u>last
time</u> to <u>pay</u> the aforesaid sum of P139,641.25 <u>within thirty (30)
days from receipt hereof; otherwise, collection thereof will be enforced thru
the remedies prescribed by law without further notice</u>....</p>

<p class="2Q">'<u>Failure on your part</u> to settle the said tax account will
also constrain this Office to <u>recommend the criminal prosecution of your
President and/or other responsible officers for the enforcement of the penal
sanctions of the Revenue Code</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(p.
20, CTA rec; underlining supplied.).'</p>

<blockquote>"On December 2, 1967, petitioner wrote a letter to the
Secretary of Finance request­ing him to withdraw respondent's assessment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Secretary of Finance endorsed said
request to respondent who, on May 23, 1968, wrote a letter reiterating his
previous demand for the payment of P139,641.25.</blockquote>

<div class="Section2">

<blockquote>"On July 5, 1968, petitioner filed the instant petition for
review."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent provisions of Sections 7 and 11 of Rep. Act 1125
are hereunder quoted:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 7.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>JURISDICTION.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The Court of Tax
Appeals shall exercise exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal, as
herein provided --</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Decisions</u> of the Commissioner of <span style="">Internal </span>Revenue in cases involving
disputed assessments, refunds of internal revenue taxes, fees or other charges,
penalties imposed in relation thereto, or other matters arising under the
National Internal Revenue Code or other law or part of law administered by the
Bureau of Internal Revenue;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SEC. 11.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>WHO MAY
APPEAL; EFFECT OF APPEAL.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Any person,
association or corporation adversely affected by a <u>decision</u> or <u>ruling</u>
of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the Commissioner of Customs or any
provincial or city Board of Assessment Appeals may file an appeal in the Court
of Tax Appeals <u>within thirty days after the receipt of such decision or
ruling</u>." (Under­scoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is no debate that the petitioner's case is covered by
Section 7 of Republic Act 1125 and, therefore, comes within the jurisdiction of
the respondent court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But was said
jurisdiction invoked by the petitioner within the period prescribed by Section
11?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The central question is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>which was the appealable decision of the
Commissioner, the letter dated October 18, 1967 which was received by the
petitioner on November 7, 1967, as the res­pondents contend, or the letter of
May 23, 1968 which was received by the petitioner on June 5, 1968, as the
petitioner insists?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the latter, then
the petition for review filed with the respondent court on July 5, 1968 was
timely; if not, the assessment had become final and executory.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the point from which the period to appeal should be
counted is the receipt by the petitioner on <u>November 7, 1967</u> of the
letter dated <u>October 18, 1967</u> of the respondent Commissioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph 1, Section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125, in express
terms, allows appeal from the "decision or ruling of the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue." The word "decision" has been interpreted to
mean <u>decisions</u> of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on <u>protests</u>
of taxpayers against assessments.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
And, in computing the 30-day period for appea<span style="">l</span> to the Tax Court, counting should begin from the date of
receipt of the decision of the Commissioner on<span style=""> </span>the disputed assessment.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
However, where several re­quests for reconsideration have been filed with the
Commissioner, it would appear that the communica­tion from the latter
overruling taxpayer's request for reconsideration and affirming the disputed
assess­ment in terms clearly indicating finality of the action take<span style="">n</span>, constitutes the appealable decision
or ruling.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the substance of the letter of the respondent
Commissioner of October 18, 1967, it is evident that the said letter
constitutes his "decision;" it has the unmistakable tenor of finality
that would make it the appealable decision or ruling under Sections 7 and 11 of
Republic Act No. 1125.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The letter of
October 18, 1967, in clear and un­equivocal terms, states:"</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"...I </span>have the
honor to inform you that after a careful consideration of the facts of the
instant case, as well as the law and jurisprudence applicable thereto, this
Office has <u>decided</u> to deny your request for the withdrawal and
cancellation of the aforementioned assessment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In view of the foregoing, you are hereby requested for the <u>last
time</u> to pay the aforesaid sum of P139,641.25 within thirty (30) days from
receipt hereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise collection
thereof will be enforced thru the remedies prescribed by law, without further
notice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Failure on your part to settle the tax account within the
abovestated period will also constrain this Office to recommend the criminal
prosecution of your President and/or other responsi­ble officers for the
enforcement of the penal sanctions of the Revenue Code." (Underscoring
supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The respondent
Commissioner himself considered the said letter as his "decision"
that is final, hence his request for payment for the "last time."
Prior to his letter-decision of October 18, 1967, the Commissioner must have
considered his prior actions as tentative in character, pending his final
resolution of the merits of the arguments of fact and law submitted by
petitioners in support of their requests for cancellation and withdrawal of the
assessment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the reason why, in
the said letter-decision of October 18, 1967, the respondent Commissioner
included n express statement that his office had <u>decided</u></span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> to deny the petitioner's request and the
latter was requested <u>for the last time</u> to pay the assessment, otherwise,
the corresponding penal actions would be taken; and it must also have been for
this reason that, in a reply-letter, dated February 1968, (Annex "L")
to the indorsement of the Secretary of Finance requesting comment on the
petitioner's prayer for reconsideration, and throughout the preliminary
proceedings in the respondent court and in this Court, the respondent
Commissioner unrelentingly clung to his assertion that it was his letter of
October 18, 1967 that constituted his <u>final</u> decision on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A pertinent portion of the reply-letter to
the Secretary of Finance reads thus:"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>"...I </span>have the honor to inform you
that in a previous letter of this Office dated October 18, 1967, copy enclosed
for your ready reference, the taxpayer was requested to <span style="">pay </span>within thirty (30) days from receipt thereof of the amount
of P139,641.25, as forest charges, sales tax and surcharge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Our letter is a decision on the taxpayer's
administrative protest</u>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is also quite certain that the petitioner himself must have
believed that the letter of October 18, 1967 was the final decision of
respondent Commis­sioner for otherwise he would not have turned to the
Secretary of Finance immediately thereafter for possible relief.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should further be said that the letter of May 23, 1968 was not
a "decision" but rather a mere reiteration of the respondent
Commissioner's previous decision contained in his letter of October 18, 1967.</p>

<p class="BODY">The argument then that in computing the 30-day period prescribed
by Section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125, the letter of the respondent
Commissioner <span style="">of May 23, 1968 denying
the third request for reconsideration addressed to </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">Secretary of Finance should be considered as the final decision
contemplated in Section 7, becomes untenable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is worth mentioning in this connection that all the petitions
for reconsideration were premised on the same grounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By his successive motions, the petitioner was
able to delay the pay­ment of the taxes due from it for two years, which, of
course, is inimical to the interests of the State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The third request for reconsideration
directed to the Secretary of Finance did not adduce new grounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may, therefore, be considered a mere <u>pro-forma
</u>motion intended for the convenience of the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This being so, the letter in response thereto
of the respondent Commissioner dated May 23, 1968 could hardly change the
nature of the letter-decision of October 18, 1967.</p>

<blockquote>"We cannot countenance the theory that would make the
commencement of the statutory 30-day period solely dependent on the will of the
taxpayer and place the latter in a position to put off indefi­nitely and at his
convenience the finality of a tax assessment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such an absurd procedure would be detrimental to the interest of the
Government, for 'taxes are the lifeblood of the government, and their prompt
and certain availability an imperious need.' (Bull vs. U.S., 795, U.S.
247)."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>"While it is true that this Court had on several occasions
recognized the right of and encouraged taxpayers to exhaust all possible
administrative remedies before coming to it for the purpose of expediency and
to avoid unnecessary court expense on the part of the litigants, this right is
not without limit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue has made clear to the taxpayer that his decision subject of
a series of requests for reconsider­ation is final, as his letter of January
30, 1957 in the instant case, subsequent requests for reconsideration thereof
made pro-forma and for dilatory purposes should be ignored for the purpose of
computing the running of the thirty-day period prescribed under Section 11 of
Republic Act No. 1125.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot have
the running of the period of appeal entirely at the discretion of the taxpayer."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We thus hold that the
letter of October 18, 1967 was the <u>final decision</u> of the respondent
Commissioner appealable to the Tax Court; that the period to appeal such
decision expired on December 7, 1967, so that when the petition for review was presented
to the Court of Tax Appeals on July 5, 1968, the assessment in question had
become final and executory; and that the subsequent request for reconsideration
directed to the Secretary of Finance (who is not authorized by law to review
decisions of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue) did not suspend the running
of the reglementary period within which to appeal.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Even if we consider, for
the sake of argument, that it did suspend, still, the petition for review was
filed out of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Following the legal
procedure of computing time under the "exclude the first include the
last" method, it is clear that from November 7, 1967, the date when the
petitioner received the respondent Commissioner's letter-decision of October
18, 1967, to December 2, 1967, the date when the petitioner sent its third
request for reconsideration to the Secretary of Finance, 25 days had
elapsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From June 5, 1968, the date
when the petitioner received the respondent Commissioner's letter of May 23,
1968, to July 5, 1968, the date the petitioner filed its petition for review
with the Tax Court, an additional 30 days had elapsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal was therefore late by 25
days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The period to appeal being jurisdictional
and non-extendible, the failure to file seasonably the petition for review was
fatal.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
