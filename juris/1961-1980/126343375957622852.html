				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal interposed on <st1:date year="1968" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1968</st1:date>, by the accused Pedro Duarte from the
decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>,
13th Judicial District, <span class="SpellE">Laoang</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>, sentencing him to suffer the penalty of
<u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, to indemnify the
heirs of the victim in the amount of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and to
pay 1/4 of the cost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of the
imposition of the death penalty with respect to the accused Tito <span class="SpellE">Nale</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Duarte</st1:place></st1:city>'s
case is simultaneously on review by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prefatory to the determination of the merits of the appeal, it is
to be noted that on <st1:date year="1968" day="3" month="4">April 3, 1968</st1:date>,
at the outset of the trial, the accused Jose <span class="SpellE">Balictar</span>
withdrew his original plea of "Not Guilty" and made leave that he be
allowed to plead guilty to the lesser offense of homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without any objection on the part of the
prosecution and with the approval of the Court, the said accused when arraigned
anew pleaded guilty to the offense of homicide and thereby admitted having
stabbed to death <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>,
Sr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, he (<span class="SpellE">Balictar</span>)
was sentenced "to an indeterminate penalty of 8 years and one day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u> as minimum to 14 years, 8
months and one day of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> as maximum and to
indemnify the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>,
Sr. in the amount of P6,000.00 and to pay 1/4 of the cost of suit."</p>

<p class="BODY">Also to be <span class="GramE">noted,</span> is that the trial
court in its decision acquitted <span class="SpellE">Sofio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ada</span>, one of the accused, for the reason that it entertained
reasonable doubt as to his participation in the commission of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">This appeal, therefore, concerns only Tito <span class="SpellE">Nale</span>
and Pedro Duarte.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1964</st1:date>,
the Assistant Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> filed <span class="GramE">an information</span> for murder against Jose <span class="SpellE">Balictar</span>
alias <span class="SpellE">Bodo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sofio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ada</span>, Tito <span class="SpellE">Nale</span> alias <span class="SpellE">Bandot</span> and Pedro Duarte, which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 6th day of May, 1964, at about 3:00
o'clock in the afternoon, in barrio <span class="SpellE">Bañgon</span>,
municipality of <span class="SpellE">Gamay</span>, province of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating together
and mutually helping one another, with intent to kill, with evident premeditation
and treachery and taking advantage of superior strength, did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and
stab <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span> with
bolos, which the said accused had conveniently provided themselves for the
purpose, thereby inflicting upon the person of <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span> fatal wounds on the different parts of his body,
which wounds directly caused the instantaneous death of the latter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>That in the commission of the crime the aggravating circumstance of
quasi-recidivism was present with regard to accused Tito <span class="SpellE">Nale</span>,
he having been convicted in a final judgment rendered by this <st1:street><st1:address>Hon.
  Court</st1:address></st1:street> on <st1:date year="1958" day="2" month="7">July
 2, 1958</st1:date>, in <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case No. 2116 for
Homicide, sentencing him to an indeterminate penalty ranging from 6 years, and
1 day of <span class="SpellE">prision</span> mayor as minimum to 14 years, 6 <span class="SpellE">mons</span>. <span class="GramE">and</span> 1 day of reclusion
temporal as maximum and to indemnify the heirs of the victim in the amount of
P3,000.00 and to pay the cost."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It appears that in the morning of May 6, 1964, <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Sr., his wife, <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Melindo</span> and their sons, <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Jr. and <span class="SpellE">Romy</span> or "<span class="SpellE">Etik</span>,"
residents of <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tigbauan</span>,
went to Barrio <span class="SpellE">Bañgon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Gamay</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, in order to sell 31-1/2 kilos of abaca.</p>

<p class="BODY">After selling the abaca to <span class="SpellE">Bocoy</span> <span class="SpellE">Alvario</span>, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00
 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon of the same day, <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>,
Sr. and <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span>, Jr. went out for a stroll around the
barrio leaving <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Melindo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Romy</span> (<span class="SpellE">Etik</span>) at <span class="SpellE">Alvario's</span> place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
their way, father and son passed by the house of <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rebay</span>, where Tito <span class="SpellE">Nale</span> and
Pedro Duarte together with <span class="SpellE">Sofio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ada</span>
and Jose <span class="SpellE">Balictar</span> alias <span class="SpellE">Bodo</span>
were drinking <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> Po Tong, a Chinese wine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nale</span> invited the <span class="SpellE">Lebecos</span> to join the group but because <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>,
Sr. did not drink <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> Po Tong and preferred <u>tuba</u>
instead, the group including the <span class="SpellE">Lebecos</span> proceeded to
the house of Maria <span class="SpellE">Laodeño</span>, where <u>tuba</u> was
sold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the course of the drinking
spree, <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Sr. instructed his son to get <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> meat from the house of <span class="SpellE">Bocoy</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alvario</span> for their "<span class="SpellE">somsoman</span>."
After <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span>, Jr. returned with the meat, <span class="SpellE">Balictar</span> sliced it with his knife called "<span class="SpellE">mais-mais</span>.” Moments later, <span class="SpellE">Nale</span>
got the French cap of <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Sr. and exchanged it
with his own "<span class="SpellE">buri</span>" hat.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <st1:city><st1:place>Duarte</st1:place></st1:city>, who
came all the way from Barrio <span class="SpellE">Malindong</span>, for the
purpose of helping make a coffin for a dead friend at <span class="SpellE">Bañgon</span>,
asked to be excused from the group after drinking a glass of <u>tuba</u>, while
<span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Sr., his son and <span class="SpellE">Sofio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ada</span> went to the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
tailor to get a pair of trousers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nale</span> and <span class="SpellE">Balictar</span> were left
behind and continued to drink.</p>

<p class="BODY">Preparatory to their going home, <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>,
Sr. squatted on the street to wait for <span class="SpellE">Nale</span>, who had
his French cap.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not long after, <span class="SpellE">Nale</span> and <span class="SpellE">Balictar</span> arrived and
approached <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Sr., who then asked for his
cap.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nale</span>
pretended to hand over the cap but jestingly, each time <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>,
Sr. reached for it, <span class="SpellE">Nale</span> would withdraw the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was repeated for at least
three times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Balictar</span>
enjoying the game teased <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Sr. by saying,
"You are a weakling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You cannot
even get your cap from Tito." This prompted <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>
Sr. to throw <span class="SpellE">Nale's</span> <span class="SpellE">buri</span>
hat on the cement floor and in a challenging manner said, "This will be
the time that the 'tough guys' of <span class="SpellE">Lomoy</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bañgon</span> will meet." (<span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>,
Sr. and <span class="SpellE">Balictar</span> were known to be "tough
guys" of <span class="SpellE">Lomoy</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bañgon</span>,
respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, in a Petition for
Reconsideration of the death sentence imposed on Tito <span class="SpellE">Nale</span>,
the prosecuting fiscal said: "It had come to the knowledge of the
prosecution also that the victim <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Sr. has a string of criminal cases ranging from
Physical Injuries, Frustrated Murder to Homicide as well as Illegal Possession
of Firearm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Criminal Case No. 402
filed <st1:date year="1950" day="23" month="10">October 23, 1950</st1:date>,
the case was returned to the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Gamay</span>
on <st1:date year="1951" day="26" month="12">December 26, 1951</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Criminal Case No. 448 for Homicide filed <st1:date year="1951" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1951</st1:date>, he was convicted on <st1:date year="1951" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1951</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Criminal Case No. 2322 for Frustrated
Murder filed on <st1:date year="1958" day="17" month="3">March 17, 1958</st1:date>,
he was convicted on <st1:date year="1958" day="13" month="5">May 13, 1958</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Criminal Case No. 2554 for Frustrated Murder
and Criminal Case No. 2555 for Illegal Possession of firearm filed on June 22,
1959, were dismissed on July 13, 1964, on motion of the prosecution because
then the accused <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>,
Sr., was already dead having met his death on May 6, 1964 - the subject of the
present Murder charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These cases
proved the vicious character of the victim.")</p>

<p class="BODY">After the challenge and more hot exchange of words, <span class="SpellE">Balictar</span> suddenly snatched the bolo of <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>,
Sr. from the latter's waist, and thrust it into the abdomen of <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Sr., wounding him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Sr., already weaponless, asked for his
son's bolo but the latter did not give it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Sr. then picked up a piece of wood to
parry <span class="SpellE">Balictar's</span> attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Balictar</span>, however,
made another thrust at the abdomen of <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Sr.,
wounding him for the second time.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Melindo</span> and her other son <span class="SpellE">Romy</span>
rushed to the scene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Felisa</span>,
however, ran away and cried for help after seeing her husband wounded but
nobody gave succor for the residents of the nearby houses shut their doors and
windows.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Sr. fled to the
river bank and it is at this point where the prosecution's evidence and that of
the defense differ.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution claims that Pedro Duarte, Tito <span class="SpellE">Nale</span>, Jose <span class="SpellE">Balictar</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sofio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ada</span> pursued <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Sr. and when he was overtaken, he was stabbed
immediately by appellants Pedro Duarte and Tito <span class="SpellE">Nale</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants' version is that when <span class="SpellE">Nale</span>
saw <span class="SpellE">Balictar</span> stab <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>,
Sr. for the first time, he (<span class="SpellE">Nale</span>) tried to stop <span class="SpellE">Balictar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Jr. slashed <span class="SpellE">Balictar</span> with
his bolo but missed and instead slightly wounded <span class="SpellE">Nale</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meantime, <st1:city><st1:place>Duarte</st1:place></st1:city>
arrived trying to pacify <span class="SpellE">Nale</span> saying, "Do not
stay there because you might be involved."</p>

<p class="BODY">Misunderstanding the intentions of <st1:city><st1:place>Duarte</st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Jr. slashed <st1:city><st1:place>Duarte</st1:place></st1:city>
with his bolo slightly wounding him on the forehead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In self-defense, <st1:city><st1:place>Duarte</st1:place></st1:city>
drew his scythe and swung it at <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Jr., wounding
him on the arm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The boy then ran away
because of the wound inflicted upon him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense maintains that it was only <span class="SpellE">Balictar</span>
who pursued <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Sr. to the river bank and was the
lone assailant in inflicting the last 3 wounds.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As for <span class="SpellE">Nale</span>, it is claimed that he arrived too
late for he had to attend to <st1:city><st1:place>Duarte</st1:place></st1:city>
who was then nursing the wound inflicted by <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>,
Jr.</p>

<p class="BODY">Much later, <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Melindo</span>,
seeing her husband mortally wounded and his pursuers no longer around,
approached him and bandaged his abdomen with his shirt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She then brought her husband to a house near
the river bank and summoned Martin <span class="SpellE">Capoquian</span>, the
barrio captain of <span class="SpellE">Bañgon</span> to take <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>,
Sr.'s statement which he did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly
thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Sr. died.</p>

<p class="BODY">The ante-mortem statement (Exhibits "B", original and
"B-1", translation) was delivered to the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Gamay</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Chief of Police and the Sanitary Inspector of <span class="SpellE">Gamay</span> went to see the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Sanitary Inspector upon examination of
the victim's cadaver found 5 stab wounds on the body detailed as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"No.
1.</span> - Stab wound at the right side of the back behind the shoulder, 1
inch in length, 1/4 inch wide and about 5 inches deep.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">No.
2.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Stab wound near wound No. 1;
4 &amp; 1/2 inches in length, 1 inch wide and about 5 inches deep.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">No.
3.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Stab wound at the center of
the back, 1 &amp; 1/2 inches in length, 1 inch wide and about 5 inches deep.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">No.
4.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Stab wound on the left side
of the abdomen, 3 inches in length, 1 &amp; 1/2 inches wide and about 5 inches
deep.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">No.
5.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Stab wound near wound nos.
4, 5 inches in length, 1 &amp; 1/2 inches wide and about 7 inches deep.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Cause of death:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>5 fatal
wounds, internal and external hemorrhage." (Exhibit "A")</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' counsel assails the finding of the trial court,
"that from the description of the wounds, more than two weapons were
used," thereby implicating <span class="SpellE">Nale</span> and <st1:city><st1:place>Duarte</st1:place></st1:city>
because they were allegedly armed with a bolo and a scythe at the time of the
offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is asserted that such a
finding runs contrary to the testimony of the Sanitary Inspector who examined
the cadaver of the victim that: "there were two (2) kinds of weapons, one
is big and the other is small." Counsel argues further, that the size of the
wound is not determinative of the size of the weapons used for the size of a
wound depends upon several and varied factors, among which are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the strength of the blow; the position of the
blade upon entry and withdrawal; the movement of the blade or body of victim
upon withdrawal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General in refuting the above argument, states:</p>

<blockquote>"Appellants Pedro Duarte and Tito <span class="SpellE">Nale</span>
were armed with a bolo and a scythe, respectively, when they approached the
victim squatting in the street (pp. 42 and 43 <span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>. <span class="GramE">id</span>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
appellants had caught up with <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Sr., who ran
towards the river after having been stabbed by <span class="SpellE">Balictar</span>,
they then took turns in stabbing him (<span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Sr.)
(p. 53 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, id) until he fell mortally wounded (p. 30
<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, id).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
these stubborn facts bold and clear on the records, the conclusion is in­escapable
that more than two weapons were used by the victim's assailants."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">An examination of the records discloses that the prosecution
relied heavily on the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Jr. to prove the participation of <st1:city><st1:place>Duarte</st1:place></st1:city>
and <span class="SpellE">Nale</span> thus:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To what place was your father pursued?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To the river.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Was your father overtaken?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And what transpired when your father was
overtaken by these 4 persons?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tito and Pedro stabbed him immediately.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<blockquote>(p. 53, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
April 4, 1968)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is to be noted, however, that the <u>ante</u>-<u>mortem</u>
statement does not mention Pedro Duarte as one of the assailants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The English translation of the <u>ante</u>-<u>mortem</u>
statement reads:</p>

<p class="BODY">Relating the failure to mention <st1:city><st1:place>Duarte</st1:place></st1:city>
in this <u>ante-mortem</u> statements to the claims of the appellants, that <st1:city><st1:place>Duarte</st1:place></st1:city>
was unable to pursue the victim to the river bank because he was then nursing
the wound inflicted upon him by <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Jr. there is
every reason to doubt <st1:city><st1:place>Duarte</st1:place></st1:city>'s
participation in inflicting any of the stab wounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence, therefore, strongly suggests
that appellant <st1:city><st1:place>Duarte</st1:place></st1:city> was not at

contrary to the contention of the Solicitor General.</p>

from further inflicting injuries upon the person of <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>,
Sr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The presence of <span class="SpellE">Nale</span>
at the river bank was therefore, duly established.</p>

<p class="BODY">Collating the antecedent facts that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) <span class="SpellE">Nale's</span> acts precipitated
the unfortunate incident; (2) <span class="SpellE">Nale</span> was wounded by <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Jr. when the latter missed his aim at <span class="SpellE">Balictar</span>; and (3) <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Jr.
wounded <span class="SpellE">Nale's</span> father-in-law, Pedro Duarte, it is
exceedingly hard to believe that <span class="SpellE">Nale's</span> purpose in
going to the river bank was to stop <span class="SpellE">Balictar</span> from
further attacking <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Sr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The more natural reaction for <span class="SpellE">Nale</span> was for him to join <span class="SpellE">Balictar</span>
in killing <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Sr.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question as to the number of weapons used is explained in the
light of the above findings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' counsel in attempting to discredit the probative
value of the <u>ante-mortem</u> statement contends that the same could not be a
dying declaration because it has not been shown that the victim was conscious
of an impending death at the time of its execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is said that the victim was sitting at the
time he made the statement; that he was even able to scold the Barrio Chief of
Police so that the latter had to desist from taking his statement; that the
wife of the victim left him to fetch their children; that the victim was under
the influence of alcohol; and that the victim was a "tough guy." The
defense claims that the appreciation of the <u>ante-mortem</u> statement by the
trial court was tinged with vacillation because while it relied on the
statement to convict Tito <span class="SpellE">Nale</span>, the court disregarded
it to acquit <span class="SpellE">Sofio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ada</span>, and
again disregarded it to prove the innocence of <st1:city><st1:place>Duarte</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The People have countered by citing the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Capoquian</span> that the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span> was
moving uneasily and that after making the statement, the victim died.</p>

<p class="BODY">We disagree with appellants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fact that the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span> (victim) was
"moving uneasily" ("restless" is more appropriate) and
immediately expired after making the statement more than satisfies the
requisite element as to the victim's consciousness of an impending death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we find the trial court did not
err in holding the <u>ante-mortem</u> statement of the victim as a dying
declaration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants seek to impugn the credibility of the prosecution
witnesses <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Melindo</span>,
widow of the victim and <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>,
Jr., son of the deceased citing no less than six (6) instances wherein their
testimonies were inconsistent or at least contradictory.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apart from the general rule that the question of credibility is
for the trial court to determine, (People v. <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span>,
et al., L-27708, Dec. 19, 1970, 36 SCRA 401) the Court finds the alleged
inconsistencies and contradictions so minor and inconsequential that they
cannot negate their evidentiary value.</p>

<p class="BODY">The information alleges that the offense was attended with the
aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation, treachery and abuse of
superior strength.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, we see no
reason for their appreciation against the appellants considering the factual
backdrop of the fight that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>earlier in
the afternoon before the fray, the appellants, the two other accused, the
victim and his son had been in a drinking spree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence on record fails to show any
indication whatsoever that there was a preconceived plan among the accused to
kill the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather the killing was
an impulse of the moment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It came about
because of the jesting amongst <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Sr., <span class="SpellE">Nale</span> and <span class="SpellE">Balictar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For these reasons there could have been <span class="GramE">no evident premeditation nor</span> treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. Gonzales, 76 Phil. [1946]; People
v. <span class="SpellE">Sagayno</span>, L-15961-62, Oct. 31, 1963, 9 SCRA 360)</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court therefore, correctly ruled out the presence of
the aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation and treachery in its
decision, thus –</p>

<blockquote>"At the inception of the offense, Jose <span class="SpellE">Balictar</span>
made a sudden move by grabbing the bolo of the victim which was used to stab
the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the said act of <span class="SpellE">Balictar</span> was immediate and fast the same does not appear to
have been deliberately adapted in order to insure the killing of the deceased
because the said deceased himself had created an atmosphere in which his
adversary was incited and emboldened by what he did because of the throwing of
the <span class="SpellE">buri</span> hat on the cement after his own cap was not
delivered to him by <span class="SpellE">Nale</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The throwing of the <span class="SpellE">buri</span>
hat on the cement was a dare or challenge thrown against the accused and the
deceased must have anticipated what would come next by his challenge, so that,
the act of <span class="SpellE">Balictar</span> would not be treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the accused <span class="SpellE">Balictar</span>
had already stabbed the deceased and the latter had attempted to escape to the
river but the accused Tito <span class="SpellE">Nale</span>, Pedro Duarte and <span class="SpellE">Balictar</span> pursued him with their weapons and attacked him
when he was already weaponless and defenseless, the accused committed the
offense with abuse of superior strength which qualified the crime to that of
murder."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellants claim however that the trial court erred in
appreciating the presence of abuse of superior strength in the commission of
the crime as to qualify the killing to murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of their claim, appellants' counsel argues that the
odds at the inception of the fight as established by the evidence on record
shows that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>,
Sr. was originally armed with a bolo, (after his bolo was grabbed, he was still
able to pick up a piece of wood) <span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Jr. was
armed with a bolo and "<span class="SpellE">Etik</span>", a 10-year old
boy was also armed with a bolo; while on the part of the assailants, <span class="SpellE">Balictar</span> was armed with a bolo and a knife, Tito <span class="SpellE">Nale</span> (according to the defense was unarmed but the
prosecution attempted to establish that he had either a bolo or a scythe),
Pedro Duarte was armed with a scythe and <span class="SpellE">Sofio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ada</span> was weaponless.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Counsel concludes that from the above presentation, the disparity in the
number of the two contending groups was not so great so as to warrant the
finding of abuse of superior strength and to qualify the crime to murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For as stated in
People v. <span class="SpellE">Elizaga</span>, <span class="GramE">86 Phil. 364,
383, (1950),</span> "superiority in number does not necessarily mean
superiority in strength.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is necessary
to prove, besides, that the attackers 'cooperated in such a way as to secure
advantage from superiority of strength.' <span class="GramE">(U.S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Trumata</span>, 49 Phil. 192; Albert's Commentaries on the Revised
Penal Code, New Edition, p. 126.)"</span> So also was it held in People
vs. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>, et al., 63 Phil. 601, 607 (1936), quoting
U.S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Devela</span>, 3 Phil. 625, 630 (1904) that
"the mere fact that the number of the assailants is superior to that of
those attacked by them is not sufficient to constitute the aggravating
circumstance of abuse of superiority."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing, the crime committed is homicide
only which is punishable by <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we hereby acquit appellant Pedro Duarte, because
his guilt has not been established beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to appellant Tito <span class="SpellE">Nale</span>,
the record shows that he surrendered voluntarily to the authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, this mitigating circumstance cannot
off-set the qualifying aggravating circumstance of quasi-recidivism (he was
previously convicted of homicide for which he was on parole surveillance at the
time of the commission of the crime) so that the penalty has to be applied in
its maximum period (People v. <span class="SpellE">Perete</span>, No. <span class="GramE">L-15515, </span><st1:date year="1961" day="29" month="4"><span class="GramE">April 29, 1961</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 1 SCRA 1290).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Modifying the judgment of the lower court and
applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, Tito <span class="SpellE">Nale</span> is
hereby sentenced to an indeterminate imprisonment of 12 years of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u> mayor</u> as minimum to 18 years of <u>reclusion
temporal</u> as maximum, to indemnify the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lebeco</span>, Sr. in the amount of P12,000.00, and to pay
1/4 of the cost.</p>
