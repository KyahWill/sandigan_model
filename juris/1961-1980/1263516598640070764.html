				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">An action for Prohibition and Injunction, with prayer for a writ of
preliminary mandatory injunction, was filed before the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City, on June 3, 1963, by Leonardo Navarro
against Luis L. <span class="SpellE">Lardizabal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Nievera</span>, Domingo <span class="SpellE">Cabili</span> and
Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Rillera</span> who are the City Mayor, Chief of <span style="">Police, </span>City Treasurer and Market
Superintendent, of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City, <span style="">respectively.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is alleged in the complaint, that <span style="">plaintiff Leonardo Navarro </span>was an occupant of stall <span style="">No. </span>87 of the City Market of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>, for more than six (6) months <span style="">prior to </span>the filing of the case in
court<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"having previously acquired full ownership of the <u>business</u> <span style="">conducted </span>thereon (stall) by lawful
transfer of ownership<span style=""> from</span> <span style="">the </span>former lessee or stallholder
(Juanita <span class="SpellE">Cachero</span>)"; <span style="">that he </span>had paid the regular fees for the occupancy of <span style="">said stall; that in </span>accordance with
Ordinance No. 314-A of <span style="">the City of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>, plaintiff filed an</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">application for the award to him of s</span>aid stall, to the proper
authorities <span style="">of the City </span>of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>; <span style="">that </span>"said
application is pending <span style="">consi­deration </span>before
<span style="">the </span>City Market Committee <span style="">which has taken cognizance </span>of <span style="">said </span>application" at the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>time <span style="">the
complaint </span>was filed in court; that the defendants have <span class="SpellE">interferred</span> with the possession of the plaintiff of <span style="">the stall by threats and intimidation </span>that
on June 3, 1963, the City Mayor issued an order directing the Chief of Police
to eject the plaintiff from the said stall, and the latter official, in
compliance with the order, on June 4, 1963, forcibly removed plaintiff's stock
in trade inside the stall, brought them to the Police Department, and pre­vented
him from occupying, <span style="">the </span>stall;
that the order of the City Mayor and the acts of the Chief of <span style="">Police "are </span>without or in excess
of jurisdiction of said, defendants"; and that plaintiff suffered
damages<span style="">&nbsp; </span>as a result of the illegal and
arbitrary acts of the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For re­lief,
plaintiff prayed that a writ of preliminary man­datory injunction <span class="GramE">be</span> issued, and after a hearing, the same be made permanent;
that the defendants and their agents be permanently restrained from harassing
and dis­turbing the plaintiff in the occupation and use of said<span style=""> stall; </span>and <span style="">that the defendants be </span>sentenced to pay damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ordinance No. 314-A of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city>, re­ferred to in the
complaint, reads thus:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 1.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The Market Committee <span class="GramE">be</span>,
as it is hereby, authorized:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a) To award stalls which may be declared vacant under existing
regulations, directly to actual occupants of such stalls, who are operating,
capita­lizing and managing or conducting the business thereof;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b) To award stalls directly to persons qualified to lease mar­ket
stalls, who may have acquired the business conducted therein thru any of the
recognized modes of <span class="SpellE">transfering</span> ownership, from the
former lessee or stallholder:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Provided, <span class="GramE">That</span> the direct award shall only
be made to Filipino citizens, who are qualified to hold or lease a stall in the
City Market."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In their answer, the defendants traversed the alle­gations in the
complaint; and by way of special defense, alleged: (a) that plaintiff has no
approved application to lease or occupy the <span style="">stall </span>No. 87; (b) that Juanita <span class="SpellE">Cachero</span>
is the lawful and recognized lessee of said stall by virtue of a valid and
subsisting contract of lease; (c) that plaintiff is neither a helper nor
recognized partner of Juanita <span class="SpellE">Cachero</span> in the business
being conducted in said stall; (d) that the City Mayor, by virtue of the powers
vested in him by the Charter of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City and
Republic Act No. 37, <span style="">as implemented by
Order No. 32 of </span>the Department of Finance, has the general and exclusive
supervision and control over public markets in the City of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>;
and (e) that plaintiff not being a lawful <span style="">lessee
of stall No. 87, was an illegal occupant thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">From the documentary evidence presented during the trial, and
upon the pleadings of the parties, and the annexes thereto, upon which the case
was submitted <span style="">for decision, it appears
that Juanita </span><span class="SpellE">Cachero</span> is the law­<span style="">ful and recognized present holder of the
stall in ques­</span>tion under a valid <span style="">and
subsisting contract of lease with </span>the city authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff, however, was able to occupy
the stall, for more than six (6) months prior to the filing of the case in
court, presumably with the consent of Juanita <span class="SpellE">Cachero</span>
(not <span style="">a </span>party
<span style="">in </span>the case), <span style="">upon </span><span style="">an </span>alleged agreement between <span class="SpellE">Cachero</span>
and Navarro whereby the former transferred to the latter the owner­ship of, the
business being conducted in said stall.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Realizing, however, that his (Navarro’s) occupancy of <span style="">the stall was not legal until </span>and
unless a contract of <span style="">lease of the stall
is awarded in his favor by the city authorities, he filed an application for
the transfer </span><span style="">of </span>said stall in his name.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff's application, however, was protested by a D. B. Baton, on the
ground that the stall applied for is not vacant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of the protest of Baton, the City Market
Committee, the office authorized to make awards of stalls, indefinitely
postponed the consideration of the appli­cation, and at the time the complaint
was filed in court, the application has not yet been acted upon nor approved
City Market Committee.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, decision was rendered dismissing the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this appeal by the
plaintiff.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The right to lease and occupy a stall in a public <span class="GramE">market,</span> <span style="">is </span>not
a common right but a purely statutory privilege, governed by laws and
ordinances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Samson vs. <span class="SpellE">Fugoso</span>, 45 <span class="GramE">Off</span>. <span class="SpellE">Gaz</span>. 300) Therefore, for an appli­cant to be able to claim
a right to occupy a stall in a public market, he is bound to <span style="">comply </span>strictly
with the provisions of the laws and ordinances on the mat­ter.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, cognizant of his status as an illegal
occupant <span style="">of </span>the stall in
question, the plain­tiff filed an application to lease the stall occupied by
him with the market authorities; however, in view of the protest of <span style="">D. B. </span>Baton against the application,
and to enable the City Market Committee, the body authorized to make the awards
<span style="">of </span>stalls
in the city market, to determine whether the applicant Navarro possesses all
the qualifications and none of the dis<span style="">qualifications
to be a lessee of a stall in </span>the city market, the City <span style="">Market Committee </span>postponed
indefinitely the consideration of Navarro's application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it is not denied that at the time
the com­plaint was filed in court, Navarro's application has not yet been
approved.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of the plaintiff that because he has acquired
"full ownership of the business conduct­ed thereon (stall) by transfer of
ownership from the former lessee or stallholder" (Juanita <span class="SpellE">Cachero</span>), <span style="">and, </span>therefore,
he had acquired a valid right to occupy the stall, can have no relevant
consideration in support of his claim of preferential right to the stall, for
the following reasons: First, the contention is denied <span style="">by the </span>defendants, and plaintiff's own admission that he has no
contract of lease or award of the stall in his favor, nor permission, <span style="">even </span>temporarily,
to occupy the sane, are facts and matters which defeat his claim to occupy the
stall; <span style="">Second, no com</span>petent
evidence, oral or documentary, has been <span style="">presented
which </span>would justify a finding that Juanita <span class="SpellE">Cachero</span>
has entered into the sup­posed agreement, and for <span style="">the </span>further reason that the latter is not a party <span style="">in the case; <span style="">Third, admitting in <span class="SpellE"><u>gratia</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>argumenti</u></span> the existence of the alleged agreement, </span></span>the
same cannot have <span style="">the effect of </span><span style="">a </span>legal and
valid transfer or assignment <span style="">of </span>the
right <span style="">to
occupy the </span><span style="">stall, because said </span><span style="">agreement </span>is contrary to Section 5, Depart­ment
of Finance Order No. 32 wh<span style="">ich </span>prohibits
the trans­fer of possession or <span style="">occupan</span>c<span style="">y of a </span>stall from a partner to a
co-partner; Fourth the<span style=""> agreement
between </span><span class="SpellE">Cachero</span> and Navarro <span style="">contemplated a transfer only of the </span>business
or stock in trade <span style="">but not of the right
to occupy the </span>stall; Fifth, paragraph (h) of <span style="">Ordinance No. 314</span>-<span style="">A </span>above-quoted,
as the trial court held:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> is </span>repugnant and contrary <span style="">to Republic Act No. </span>37 and <span style="">Department Order No. 32, because under said
Department Order, </span>parti­cularly <span style="">Section
5 </span><span style="">and 6, any </span>market
stallholder <span style="">who </span>enters into
business partnership <span style="">with </span><span style="">any </span>party after he has acquired the
right to lease such a stall <u>shall have no authority to transfer</u> to his
partner or partners the right <span style="">to occupy
the </span>stall, so that since <span style="">plaintiff
disclosed having </span>acquired full ownership, occu­pancy and use <span style="">of </span>said stall No. 87 by transfer and
there is no evidence <span style="">that he is </span>either <span style="">a </span>helper
or rela­tive within the third degree, as a requisite thereof, <span style="">his </span>alleged claim to occupy said stall
should perforce be cancelled, as it was cancelled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is evident he acquired no privi­lege, much
less a right, to occupy said stall."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and; Sixth, admitting <i>ad <span class="SpellE">arguendo</span></i>, <span style="">that said </span><span style="">paragraph (h) of Ordinance </span>314-A is
not in conflict <span style="">with Department </span><span style="">Order </span>No. 32, and the agreement is valid, the City Market <span style="">Committee has the
discretion to approve or </span><span style="">disapprove the same, and under </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">facts ob</span><span style="">t</span><span style="">ainin</span><span style="">g</span><span style=""> in </span><span style="">the case, it clearly appears that the City
Market Committee has not yet approved <span style="">plaintiff's
</span>application </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">occupy the stall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Even under Ordinance <span style="">314-A
of </span>the <span style="">City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Baguio</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, it </span>us required that before market
stall may be awarded to an applicant, it is necessary that said stall <span style="">first be de­</span>clared vacant (par. <span style="">[<span class="GramE">a</span>], </span>and that
the proper authority has determined that the applicant has all the qualifica­tions
to <span style="">lease a </span>stall in the city
market, which conditions are not present In the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing, taken into account together with the indubitable
fact that Juanita <span class="SpellE">Cachero</span> is still the lawful and
recognized lessee of the stall in question, which is not vacant, on one hand,
and Navarro's application to lease said stall has not yet been approved by, the
City Market Committee, on the other hand, and the fact that the occupancy of a
stall in a public market cannot be the subject of a valid contract unless
approved by the city authority (Mercado vs. Aguilar, 45 Off. <span class="SpellE">Gaz</span>. <span style="">No. </span>5,
supp. 118) afford solid support to the conclusion that the plaintiff has not
established a valid and legal right to occupy said stall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint, therefore, states no<span style=""> </span>cause of
action, and the trial court was correct in dismissing the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">It clearly appears on the record that the remedy <span style="">of </span>prohibition sought by the plaintiff
basically seeks <span style="">to </span>de­termine
his right to occupy the stall <span style="">No. </span>87
of the City Market.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The remedy is
improper, since its only function is to prevent a usurpation of jurisdiction,
and to restrain the doing of some act about to be done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner must <span style="">clearly show that he has a </span>legal right to the subject of the
action without which he shall fail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
the mainte­nance, operation, supervision and control of public mar­kets within
a city or municipality is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the municipal
authorities, and <span style="">considering that the
plaintiff has no valid and legal right to occupy the stall in </span>question,
therefore, the order of the defend­ant City Mayor to have the plaintiff ejected
from the stall is within his power and authority, and the facts obtaining <span style="">in the case </span>do not indicate, that in
the exercise of <span style="">his </span>authority,
the City Mayor had committed gross abuse of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">mere
fact that in </span>the <span style="">exercise </span>of
such power, the person to whom <span style="">the
execution </span>of the order of <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> <span style="">was entrusted had committed alleged arbitrary
acts, the chief of police having forcibly ejected the plaintiff from the stall
– which has not</span> been proven, does not entitle the aggrieved party to the
remedy of prohibi­tion <span style="">or </span>injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff has some other <span style="">appro</span><span style="">priate remedy recognized in law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For
</span><span style="">the </span><span style="">foregoing considerations, </span><span style="">the appeal is denied, with costs </span><span style="">against </span>the
appellant.</p>
