				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Court affirms on appeal the decision of the <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City court of first instance granting the Republic's
timely petition for review of the decree of registration and <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> the certificate of title issued in favor of the
applicant-appellant, since it clearly appears that actual fraud had been
employed by the applicant in pro­curing the title over the lands in question
which are part of the pu­blic domain (and not private property as falsely
claimed by applicant) and the Republic is entitled to their reversion to the
public domain.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 26, 1966 applicant-appellant <span class="SpellE">Teodocia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lozada</span> had filed an application in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> for the registration of, and
confirmation to, two parcels of land in Las <span class="SpellE">Piñas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (designated as Lots 2 and 3, <span class="SpellE">Psu</span>.
218933, SWO-40867 in the technical descriptions, with an area of about 390
square meters), asserting title thereto by right of inheritance from her
deceased parents, coupled with alleged continuous and exclusive
possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As related in the Court of
Appeals' resolution of May 10, 1976 certifying applicant <span class="SpellE">Lozada's</span>
appeal to us as involving only questions of law, said appellant originally <span class="SpellE">suceeded</span> on <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u>
evidence in securing registration of the property, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Under date of <st1:date year="1966" day="16" month="11">November
 16, 1966</st1:date>, the court <u>a quo</u> issued a notice of initial hearing
of the petition (Ibid., p. 19).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petition was opposed by the Provincial Government of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
and the Municipal Government of Las <span class="SpellE">Piñas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 27).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Director of Lands did not deem it
necessary at the time to file an opposition to <span class="SpellE">Teodocia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lozada's</span> petition (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 30) and returned
the records of the case to the court <u>a quo</u> through the Solicitor General
(<u>Ibid</u>., p. 29).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the
Director of Lands reserved the right to file his opposition thereto should it
be found upon investigation that applicant <span class="SpellE">Lozada</span> is
not entitled to the lots in question (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 30).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1967" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1967</st1:date>,
an order of general default was issued by the court <u>a quo</u>, excepting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the Provincial Government of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
and the Municipal Government of Las <span class="SpellE">Piñas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (Amended Record on Appeal, pp. 9-10).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same date, the court <u>a quo</u>
referred the case to the Municipal Court of Las <span class="SpellE">Piñas</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> because the value of the contested lots does
not exceed P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, as shown in the tax declaration
(<u>Ibid</u>., p. 10).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="26" month="6">June 26, 1967</st1:date>, upon the <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u> evidence presented by applicant <span class="SpellE">Teodocia</span> <span class="SpellE">Lozada</span>, the Municipal
Court of Las <span class="SpellE">Piñas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
found applicant <span class="SpellE">Lozada</span> to have a <span class="SpellE">registerable</span>
title to the two parcels of land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
said court confirmed her title thereto (Amended Record on Appeal, pp.
11-14).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A month later, the municipal
court ordered the issuance of the corresponding decree of registration (<u>Ibid</u>.,
pp. 14-15).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1967</st1:date>, Original Certificate of Title
No. 6314 (Exhibit 7, Folder of Exhibits, p. 100) in the name of <span class="SpellE">Teodocia</span> <span class="SpellE">Lozada</span> was issued by the
Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, however, well within one year from entry
of the decree filed a petition for review of the decision and decree of
registration on the ground that applicant <span class="SpellE">Lozada</span> had
procured the same by actual fraud (1) because she deliberately concealed the
fact that the lots in question were covered by Revo­cable Permit Application
No. 15849 and Miscellaneous Sales Appli­cation No. V-76845, both in the name of
her husband, Felix <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>, and that these
applications were rejected by the Bureau of Lands since these lots were
reserved for school site purposes pursuant to Resolution No. 114, Series of
1963, of the Municipal Council of Las <span class="SpellE">Piñas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>; and (2) these lots are portions of the public domain
and as such belong to the State and are not subject to private appropriation
and, therefore, not <span class="SpellE">registerable</span> under the Torrens
System.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court of first instance gave due course to the Republic's
petition notwithstanding appellant <span class="SpellE">Lozada's</span>
opposition contending <u>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></u> that the
petition raises the issue of ownership which should be brought up in a separate
civil action and that the lands were private property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After reopening the case and holding several
hearings at which both the applicant and the Republic presented their
documentary and testimonial evidence, it found that "actual fraud was
employed by the applicant in procuring title over the property subject of this
application which <span class="GramE">are</span> portions of the public
domain."</p>

<p class="BODY">It found <u>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></u> in its
decision upon the petition for review that before appellant <span class="SpellE">Lozada's</span>
petition for registration, her husband, Felix <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>,
had filed with the Bureau of Lands a revocable permit application and a sales
application which had been rejected on April 12, 1965 precisely because the
lands had been reserved for school purposes and that the husband "by not
so filing the application for registration of the property in question and by
allowing his wife, applicant <span class="SpellE">Teodocia</span> <span class="SpellE">Lozada</span>, to file the application, the Bureau of Lands, repre­senting
the Republic of the Philippines, was misled." The Court found that
applicant <span class="SpellE">Lozada</span> and her husband had deliberately
deceived the State, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court draws this conclusion from the very patent
improbability that a fair and unprejudiced mind will accept.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is most improbable that the Bureau of
Lands will not oppose the registration of a piece of land, but will oppose any
application to purchase the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
are two conflicting actions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
in the first instance, the land registration will result in the acquisition of
the property without the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
being paid for it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the second
instance, the approval of the sales application will result in the acquisition
of the property with the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
being paid for it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why should the Bureau
of Lands not file its opposition in the first instance and, on the other hand,
reject the application for purchase in the second instance?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The truth of the matter, in the opinion of
the Court, is that had the application for registration been only filed by
FELIX <span class="SpellE">CRISTOBAL</span>, the husband, the Bureau of Lands,
representing the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
would have acted uniformly, that is, (1) oppose the registration and (2) reject
the sales application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here again is
clearly seen how the Republic of the Philippines, represented by the Bureau of
Lands, through the act of applicant <span class="SpellE">Teodocia</span> <span class="SpellE">Lozada</span> of filing separately the application for
registration and through the act of FELIX <span class="SpellE">CRISTOBAL</span>
of applying for approval of a sales application for the same property, was
effectively deprived of its day in court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It bears repeating that had the instant application for registration
only been made by FELIX <span class="SpellE">CRISTOBAL</span>, the husband, who
had already a record in the Bureau of Lands, as a person who had taken the initial
step for the purchase of a certain public land, then the Bureau of Lands would
have filed its op­position or would have taken steps appropriate to stop the
registration thereof."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The lower court accordingly rendered judgment on <st1:date year="1973" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1973</st1:date> in favor of the
Republic, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Setting</span> aside the
decision of the Municipal Court of Las <span class="SpellE">Piñas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> of <st1:date year="1967" day="26" month="6">June 26,
 1967</st1:date>, subject of the instant review proceedings, and the
corresponding decree issued pursuant thereto;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Declaring the property in question to be part
of the public domain belonging to the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dismissing the registration application of <span class="SpellE">Teodocia</span> <span class="SpellE">Lozada</span> of <st1:date year="1962" day="16" month="10">October 16, 1962</st1:date>;</blockquote>

and <span class="SpellE">Teodocia</span> <span class="SpellE">Lozada</span> to
vacate immediately the property in question so that the same may be used for
the purpose it was reserved, that is, as a school site."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Applicant <span class="SpellE">Lozada</span> appealed to the Court
of Appeals which, however, certified the appeal to us as involving only
questions of law which it set forth in its resolution, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Applicant appealed to this Court and contends that the court <u>a
quo</u> erred in:</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Holding that there was actual and extrinsic

applied for; and</blockquote>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Holding that the lots applied for by applicant
form part of the public domain.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is <u>not denied</u> that the lots in question were the
subject of a revocable permit application and a miscellaneous sales application
filed with the Bu­reau of Lands by Felix <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., September 7, 1971, pp. 11, 12; June 22, 1972, pp.
4, 9), husband of applicant-appellant <span class="SpellE">Teodocia</span> <span class="SpellE">Lozada</span>, before she filed a petition for registration and
that <span class="SpellE">Cristobal's</span> applications were denied by the
Bureau of Lands (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., September 7, 1971, p. 12;
June 22, 1972, p. 4).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet
applicant-appellant <u>made it appear under her oath</u> that she had <u>inherited</u>
the lots in question from her parents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is also no question that the application for registration was
filed in the name of <span class="SpellE">Teodocia</span> <span class="SpellE">Lozada</span>
and not in the name of Felix <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> (Amended
Record on Appeal, p. 1).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We note that these <u>material facts</u> were <u>not disclosed</u>
in the application for registration filed by <span class="SpellE">Teodocia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lozada</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is
this conduct within the kind of fraud contemplated in Section 38 of Act 496, as
amended, to warrant the review of the decision of the Munici­pal Court of Las <span class="SpellE">Piñas</span> and the nullification of the de­cree of registration?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the material facts above stated in the Court of
Appeals' resolution which have not been disputed by appellant, the Court
affirms the appealed judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Lozada</span> (and her husband Felix
<span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>) were clearly guilty of fraud (1) in not
disclosing in her application for registration the vital facts that her
husband's previous application for a revocable permit and to purchase the lands
in question from the Bureau of Lands had been rejected, because the lands were
already reserved as a site for school purposes; (2) in thus concealing the fact
that the lands were part of the public domain and so known to them; (3) in
stating the deliberate falsehood that the lands were allegedly inherited by her
from her parents; and (4) in filing the application for registration in the
name of appellant <span class="SpellE">Lozada</span> and not in that of her
husband Felix <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> or the two of them jointly,
thus suppressing the fact that Felix <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>
already had a record in the Bureau of Lands of having filed a rejected
application for the same lands, all of which misled the Bureau of Lands into
not filing an opposition to her application, and as aptly observed by the lower
court "effectively deprived (the Republic) of its day in court."</p>

<p class="BODY">Such fraud may well be deemed as "extrinsic or collateral
fraud, as distinguished from intrinsic fraud [which] connotes any fraudulent
scheme executed by a prevailing litigant <u>'outside</u> the trial of a case
against the defeated party, or his agents, attorneys or witnesses, whereby said
defeated party is prevented from presenting fully and fairly his side of the
case.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But even assuming that such fraud could be technically considered
as "intrinsic fraud [which] takes the form of 'acts of a party in a
litigation <u>during </u>the trial, such as the use of forged instruments or
perjured testimony, which did not affect the presentation of the case, but did
prevent a fair and just determination of the case,'"<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
it would not alter the result, because the mistake and error into which the
officials of the Bureau of Lands were misled by such a deliberately false application,
suppressing the facts known to the applicant that the lands sought to be registered
were lands of the public domain (and not private property) and having been
reserved for a school site were not susceptible of private registration (as in
fact her husband's application to purchase the same had been rejected) cannot
operate to bar the Republic's timely petition to review and set aside the
decree, since the State cannot be <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> by the
mistake or error of its officials and agents.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the registration decree was properly voided by the lower
court since it had no jurisdiction over the lands of the public domain subject
matter of the proceedings which were portions of the bed or foreshore of the
Las <span class="SpellE">Piñas</span> <span class="GramE">river</span> and were not
open to registration proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, as this Court unanimously stressed in <span class="SpellE"><u>Piñero</u></span><u> vs. Director of Lands</u><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
"It is to the public interest that one who succeeds in fraudulently
acquiring title to a public land should not be allowed to benefit <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, and the State should, therefore, have an ever
existing authority, thru its duly authorized officers, to inquire into the circumstances
surrounding the issuance of any such title, to the end that the Republic, thru
the Solicitor General or any other officer who may be authorized by law, may
file the corresponding action for the reversion of the land involved to the
public domain, subject thereafter to disposal to other qualified persons in
accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the
indefeasibility of a title over land previously public is not a bar to an
investigation by the Director of Lands as to how such title has been acquired,
if the purpose of such investigation is to determine whether or not fraud had
been committed in securing such title in order that the appropriate action for
reversion may be filed by the Government."</p>
