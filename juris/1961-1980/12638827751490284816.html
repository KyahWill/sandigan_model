				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY" style="">This is a claim for separation
pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Claimant Pedro <span class="SpellE">Horario</span>
worked for the <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span> Milling Co., Inc. from
1919 to 1922 as a train machinist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
1922 he worked for the company as a locomotive fireman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He served continuously in that capacity up to
1960 (he was fifty-nine years old in 1960) when he was discharged due to total
blindness of the left eye and progressive blindness of the right eye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was then receiving a salary of P130 a
month.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a permanent employee, he worked during milling and
off-seasons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When there was no milling,
he repaired the locomotive or he used it to remove, by means of steam, the tall
grasses growing along the railroad tracks (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B).<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="BODY">Prior to April 30, 1960 <span class="SpellE">Horario</span>
suffered pains in his eyes accompanied by severe headaches.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vision of his left eye became
blurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The company physician found
that <span class="SpellE">Horario</span> was afflicted with "glaucoma,
bilateral, chronic, total blindness of the left eye and progressive blindness
of the right eye".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That finding was
confirmed by a private eye specialist.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Horario</span> was allowed to continue
working.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He performed only light
work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1960" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1960</st1:date> he was dismissed due to his ailment or,
as he testified, because he was blind or he had lost his sight (7, 20 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1968" day="15" month="3">March 15,
 1968</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The company's version is that <span class="SpellE">Horario</span>
was formerly a locomotive fireman; that, due to his age, he was transferred in
1956 to the job of locomotive watchman; that, upon the doctor's recommendation
in 1960, <span class="SpellE">Horario</span> was temporarily laid off due to his
weak eyesight, with the understanding that he would be allowed to work again if
his ailment was cured, and that thereafter he did not report for work.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Horario</span> sued the company on <st1:date year="1961" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1961</st1:date> for workmen's
compensation (WCC Case No. 6974).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He won
the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The company paid him on <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="10">October 4, 1965</st1:date> the sum of P3<span class="GramE">,916.64</span> as workmen' s compensation under section 15 of Act
No. 3428.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The company was ordered to
provide <span class="SpellE">Horario</span> with the requisite medical and
surgical attendance (<u>Ibid</u>, sec. 13).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1967</st1:date>
<span class="SpellE">Horario</span>, as a pauper litigant, sued the company in
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental for
separation pay and damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claimed
that he worked for the company from 1919 to 1960, a period of about forty-two
years, and that he was not given any notice before he was dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He computed his separation pay in the amount
of P2<span class="GramE">,730</span> or P65 for every year of his forty-two years
of service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He demanded moral and
exemplary damages of P25<span class="GramE">,000</span> and attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The company in its answer alleged that before the start of the
1960-61 milling season.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Horario</span> was examined by the company physician; that it was
discovered that he was suffering from "glaucoma, bilateral, chronic";
that, for that reason, he was not allowed to work and he was advised to secure
medical treatment; that in spite of continuous medication, he lost the vision
of his left eye, and that <span class="SpellE">Horario</span> was not reinstated
because he did not recover his vision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lower court noted that during the trial <span class="SpellE">Horario</span>
had to be guided by his wife in order to find his way.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court denied <span class="SpellE">Horario's</span> claim
for separation pay because of its finding that he was not dismissed within the
meaning of the Termination Pay Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
found <span class="SpellE">Horario's</span> case similar to that of an employee,
who was killed accidentally while performing his work in the course of
employment and whose heirs were paid death benefits but whose estate is not
entitled to separation pay.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Horario</span> appealed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The legal issue is whether a locomotive
fireman of a sugar central who, by reason of defective eyesight, was paid
workmen's compensation but who, for that same cause, was laid off, after having
served his employer for forty-two years, is entitled to claim separation pay
due to lack of advance written notice that his employment would be terminated.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are of the opinion that <span class="SpellE">Horario's</span>
claim for separation pay cannot be sustained because of the rule that "the
rights and remedies granted by" the Workmen's Compensation Law to an
employee "by reason of a personal injury entitling him to
compensation" exclude all other rights and remedies accruing to the
employee under the Civil Code and other laws, because of the said injury (Sec.
5, Act No. 3428).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that he was not given any formal notice of dismissal,
as required under section 1 of Republic Act No. 1052, as amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it is undeniable that he knew all along
that he was to be laid off because of his defective eyesight.</p>

<p class="BODY">The company doctor testified that <span class="SpellE">Horario</span>
could not be allowed to continue working since he might meet an accident and
that occurrence would be prejudicial to the company (4 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>
<st1:date year="1968" day="12" month="8">August 12, 1968</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The advance notice of dismissal is required in order to obviate
abrupt and arbitrary dismissals and to enable the poor laborer or employee to
survive while he is looking for another job.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That reason does not exist in this case because <span class="SpellE">Horario's</span>
layoff was not sudden and arbitrary.</p>

<p class="BODY">It cannot be denied that <span class="SpellE">Horario</span> had
become totally disabled for work.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, he should have been paid the maximum workmen's compensation
for total disability, or six thousand pesos, under section 14 of Act No. 3428,
as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">Disregarding technicalities and to do justice in this case to a
poor laborer, we hold that <span class="SpellE">Horario</span> should be paid an
amount equal to the difference between P6,000 and P3,916.64, the sum already
paid to him in 1965 (Flores vs. Workmen's Compensation Commission, L-41612,
June 30, 1976, 71 SCRA 633).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is
further entitled to an award of six hundred pesos for attorney's fees and
litigation expenses because the company compelled him to litigate (Art. 2208,
Civil Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">The courts should be vigilant for the protection of the laborers
and the other members of society who live a hand-to-mouth existence (Arts. 24
and 1700, Civil Code; <span class="SpellE">secs</span>. 6, 7 and 9, Art. II, Constitution).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As has been well said, those who have less in
life should have more in law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering <span class="SpellE">Horario's</span> forty-two years
of service, an enlightened employer, with a keen sense of social justice or
with a social conscience, should have given him some gratuity, if, as in this
case, it has apparently no pension, provident or retirement fund.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the trial court's judgment is reversed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span>
Milling Co., Inc. is ordered to pay Pedro <span class="SpellE">Horario</span> the
sum of P2<span class="GramE">,083.36</span>, as the equivalent of the deficiency
workmen's compensation not paid to him, with six percent interest <u>per annum</u>
from the filing of the complaint, plus the sum of six hundred pesos (P600) for
attorney's fees and litigation expenses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Costs against respondent <span class="SpellE">Tasimico</span>.</span></p>
