				<H3>EMILIANO CASTRO, JR., PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF
APPEALS AND PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES,
RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> Castro y
Villanueva - hereinafter referred to as appellant - seeks the review on
certiorari of a decision of the Court of Appeals, affirming that of the Court
of First Instance of Manila, convicting him of the crime of <span class="SpellE">concu­binage</span>,
with which he is charged, upon complaint filed by his wife, <span class="SpellE">Flordeliza</span>
T. Castro, and sentencing him to an indeter­minate penalty ranging from three
(3) months and eleven (11) days of <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span> <u>mayor</u>
to one (1) year, eight (8) months and twenty-one (21) days of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span>,
and to pay the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not having been
apprehended, his co-defendant, Lolita <span class="SpellE">Flojo</span> y <span class="SpellE">Balicanta</span> has not, as yet, been tried.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals found that, although legally married to the
complainant on February 9, 1952 - who was separated from him since 1954 - and
their marriage had not been dissolved, appellant had, from about 1956 to 1959,
cohabited and had sexual intercourse with his co-defendant, who lived with him,
in his house - which used to be his and complainant's matrimonial do­micile at
1321-A P. Guevara St., Manila, openly as his wife, as well as presented herself
and was presented by appellant as such.</p>

<p class="BODY">These facts were established by complainant's testimony and that
of her sister Sylvia <span class="SpellE">Tanjuan</span>, who were fully corrobo­rated
by the birth certificate (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B) <span class="GramE">and</span>
the SSS form (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. E) <span class="GramE">of</span>
appellant's co-defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
Exhibit B, which is signed by the latter as Lolita <span class="SpellE">Flojo</span>
<u>Castro</u>, shows that on <st1:date year="1957" day="7" month="10">October
 7, 1957</st1:date>, she gave birth, at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Far</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Eastern</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>, to a child named
Alejandro <span class="SpellE"><u>Flojo</u></span> <u>Castro</u>, who, she
declared, was her “legitimate” son and that of <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span>
Villanueva Castro, appellant herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
the foot of her signature, she wrote "1321 P. Guevara, <st1:city><st1:place>Santa
  Cruz</st1:place></st1:city>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,”
which is appellant's address, as her own.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the other hand, in her SSS form, she used the same name and address
- although it was more specific, by add­ing the suffix A to the house number -
and, apart from naming appellant as her beneficiary, she described him as her
"<span class="GramE">husband</span>", and her mother, Angeles <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Flojo</span>,
as her dependent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant denied, on the witness stand, having had illicit
relations with his co-defendant; but, it is clear that his testimony can not
prevail over the aforementioned evidence for the prose­cution, aside from the
circumstance that the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are conclusive
upon us under a petition for review on certiorari, such as the one at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the issues raised by appellant herein
are basically factual, in view of which said petition should not have been
given due course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since, however we have
already examined the record, we are satisfied that said issues are devoid of
merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, appellant maintains, as he did in the trial court and in
the Court of Appeals, that there had been <span class="SpellE">condonation</span>
or pardon on the part of his wife; but, neither court sustained this
pretense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, the conclusions
of the Court of Appeals thereon constitute another finding of fact, which is
not <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> by us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Independently of the foregoing, although one letter of the complain­ant
in 1956 - when she seemingly had mere hearsay notion of the illicit relations
between the defendants herein - may not be clear on her position in relation
thereto, her letters in 1957 - in which she referred to Lolita <span class="SpellE">Flojo</span> as appellant's "<span class="SpellE">querida</span>"
or mistress - and, particularly, her <span class="SpellE">behaviour</span> since
1958, when she became positive about said relations, leave no room for doubt
that she had never consented, pardoned or condoned the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, on May 5, 1959, she even filed a
civil action - civil case No. 1957 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> - against her husband, for legal separation, based
upon the illicit relations between the here­in defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against
appellant, <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> Castro y </span></span>Villanueva.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>
