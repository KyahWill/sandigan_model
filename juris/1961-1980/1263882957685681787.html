<p class="BODY">The facts in this arbitration proceeding as repro­duced in the
Resolution of the Court of Appeals are:</p>

<blockquote>"On March 15, 1963, petitioner Severo J. Santiago and
respondent Eugenio Juan Gonzalez entered into an agreement whereby Gonzalez
under­took to construct for a certain amount a residential house for Santiago
at White Plains Subdivision, Quezon City.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Before the termination of the construction, a controvery arose between
the parties, it being al­leged by Gonzalez that he had not been paid on
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gonzalez stopped the construction
on Octo­ber 11, 1963, and he notified Santiago.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To resolve the contro­versy between them, Santiago and Gonzalez entered
into an agree­ment on December 28, 1963, to submit their dispute to arbitra­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The agreement is marked <span style="">Annex </span>A of the Petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the terms of Annex 'A', paragraph 5,
'the deliberations of the arbi­tration award shall be recorded in writing and
the decision or award shall likewise be made in writing and served upon the par­ties
or their respective counsel.' Under paragraph 6, the Arbitration Board 'shall
complete the proceed­ing and render award within a pe­riod of thirty (30) days
from its constitution', and 'the Arbitration Board shall be constituted not
later than ten (10) days from the date of the signing of this agreement,' which
was on December 28, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Paragraph 8 of
Annex A provides, 'the manner by which the arbitra­tion proceedings shall be
conducted shall be left entirely to the dis­cretion of the members of the
Arbitration Board who shall have the right, as stated in the preceding
paragraph to summon the parties, make ocular inspection of the place of
construction or take such tests acceptable in engineering practice as to them
may be necessary in or­der to arrive at a proper determination of the
controversial tech­nical issues with speed and dis­patch'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Arbitration Board rendered its decision
on July 6, 1964, but copy of the award or decision was received by the
petitioner herein only on August 10, 1964, and by Gonzalez on July 25,
1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August 24, 1964, petitioner
Santiago filed a motion for reconsi­deration with the Arbitration Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is authorized by the arbitration
agreement, Annex 'A', paragraph 5, which provides that the decision or award
shall be final unless either party asks for reconsideration within 15 days from
receipt of a copy thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under
paragraph 6, such motion for reconsideration shall be decided within 10 days
from the submission of said motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Arbitration Board having failed to decide peti­tioner's motion for reconside­ration,
the petitioner filed this petition on September 9, 1964, to vacate the award of
the Arbitration Board on several grounds.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the hearing which was set by this Court, the Court suggested that to
resolve all questions by the parties, Gonza­lez on his part filed a motion for
the confirmation of the award, which he did."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, after considering the numerous docu­ments
presented by both parties, confirmed the award made by the Arbitration Board in
a decision dated January 11, 1965, the dispositive portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the award made by the Board of Arbitrators
declaring that the balance due to Eugenio Juan Gonzalez from the petitioner
Severo J. Santiago to be P49,594.63 is hereby confirmed and judgment is hereby
rendered in favor of Eugenio Juan Gonzalez and against the peti­tioner Severo
J. Santiago for the amount of P49,594.63.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Without pro­nouncement as to costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Manila, January 11, 1965.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Judge"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner-appellant, in his brief filed with the Court of
Appeals, assigned fifteen (15) errors alleged­ly committed by the lower
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the principal legal
issue to be resolved in this appeal is whether or not the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
acted correctly in confirming the arbitration award and deciding the case
without receiving additional evidence in a hearing before it.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that the arbitration board con­sisting of three
(3) members was duly constituted pursuant to an agreement to arbitrate executed
by the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Board discharged its
duties in consonance with the scope of their authority as embodied in the submission
or contract to arbitrate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence
of the parties consists of the original construction contract of the parties,
the result of the ocular inspection conducted in the premises, conferences and
numerous letters with documentary annexes offered mostly by the appellant, and
a detailed estimate and breakdown of the payments and the extent of the cons­truction
undertaken by the respondent Eugenio Juan Gonzalez up to the time he stopped
the construction work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pro­ceedings
held before the Board from the time of its creation on December 28, 1963 lasted
up to July 6, 1964, when the award was rendered and promulgated.</p>

<p class="BODY">An examination of the proceedings of the Board of Arbitration
will show that ample opportunity was afforded the petitioner to adduce proof in
support of his contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioner cannot complain that he was deprived of due process by the said
Board.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court confirmed the award of the Board of Arbitrators
because:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x An examination of the decision
or award of the Board shows that in arriving at its decision, the Board had
taken in to consideration the claims and explanation of the peti­tioner,

<blockquote>In addition to this, the Board of
arbitration had authorized the Chairman to make an independent estimate of the
whole project as per plans and specifications embodies in the con­tract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision or award states in detail the
matters which had been taken in to consideration in arriving at its decision as
well as the break down of the respective claims and defenses of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither in the motion for reconsideration nor
in the petition to vacate has the pe­titioner pointed specifically and
concretely in what way the Board of Arbitration had erred or had acted with
fraud or partiality in granting the award.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the motion for reconsideration filed by the petitioner there was no
offer of any evidence, documentary or oral.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The fact that Mr. Concio did not sign the decision does not mean
that he was not consulted, or that it is not the act of the Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 20 of the Arbitration Law provides that
the award must be signed and acknow­ledged by a majority of the arbitra­tors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the agreement of the
parties does not require that all three arbitrators should concur.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it must be observed that Mr. Concio,
while he has not signed, the award, has not dissented there­from.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Court does not find any suf­ficient reason, fact, or
circumstance, which will justify the setting aside of the award made <span style="">by </span>the Board."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The lower court denied the motion for reconsideration filed by
petitioner on the ground that:</p>

<blockquote>"As stated <span style="">by </span>the
Court in its decision, neither in the motion for reconsideration nor the
petition to vacate had the petitioner pointed specifically and concretely in
what way the Board of Arbitration had erred or had acted with fraud or
partiality in granting the award; and neither was there any showing of what
evidence, oral or documentary, plaintiff intended to submit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the Arbitration Law does not
specifically so provide, the Court believes that a reconsideration based upon the
evidence which had been received or evidence which the movant seeks to
introduce must be made in like manner as in a petition for review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion must specifically state what
evidence had not been taken into consideration or the error that had been committed
by the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, it is nothing
but a mere formal motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If any further
evidence is sought to be introduced, the substance of that evidence must be
stated under oath together with copies of the document sought to be
introduced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, there must be
affidavits of merit, for neither the time of the Arbi­tration Board nor of this
Court must be wasted in useless wrang­lings on vague and general alle­gation of
fraud or error or failure to take into considera­tion evidence that should have
been received.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence to be
offered must be such that if admitted, it will probably change the result of
the award.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No such showing made by the
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He contended himself with
general allegations of fraud and state­ment of failure or refusal of the Board
to receive further evidence without specifically stating what those documents
are and in what the testimony will consist of."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing ruling of the lower court is in con­sonance with
the holding of this Court that "it is not enough that a motion should
state what part of the decision is contrary to law or the evidence; it should
also point out why they are so . . .<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner-appellant herein also assails the decision
rendered by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> on the ground that it did not find the
appellee <span style="">to be </span>without any right
to stop the construction in violation of the law, particular­ly Articles 1721,
1725 and 1726 of the Civil Code of the Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that the appellee had stopped the construction
by notifying the appellant owner on grounds of delay of the agreed payments of
the work done as em­bodied in their contract, the records clearly show that the
appellant, in a reply letter, dated October 12, 1963, advised the appellee that
the building contract executed by and between them is rescinded upon receipt
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records likewise reveal
that it was the appellant who con­tinued the construction of his house since
then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sub­mission or contract to
arbitrate agreed upon by the parties was the outcome of such rescission of the
contract by the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
appellant's intention to withdraw from the building contract is clear from the
following portions of his letter to the appellee:</p>

<blockquote>"Effective upon your receipt of this letter, please be advised
fur­ther that our contract with you for the construction of my residential
building at White Plains is hereby rescinded for the following reasons:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>In order to provide the necessary instrumentalities for the fair
and reasonable determination of both our equities during the period when the
contract was in operation, I have designated my chief legal counsel, Atty.
Dominador E. Chipeco, who shall be assisted by my certified public
account(ant), Col. Isidoro Astillero and my engineer, Mr. Benjamin Ponce de Leon
to confer with you immediate­ly in the equity liquidation of our contract in
fairness to both of us.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I sincerely believe, that as men of goodwill, this problem can be
re­solved amicably and in fairness to all concerned, thereby avoiding for both
of us any subsequent court action that will be most damaging to both our in­terest
as client and contractor.</blockquote>
