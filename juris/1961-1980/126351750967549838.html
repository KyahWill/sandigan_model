				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The present proceedings are the sequel of our judgment of
February 18, 1970 in Case L-31566 wherein <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>
we set aside the resolution of January 26, 1970 of respondent <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> and directed that the proclamation of the winning
candidate for the position of Congressman for the second district of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> be held in abeyance until after the questions
affecting the same, as discussed in the decision, pending in the <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> court of first instance, are determined with
finality.</p>

<p class="BODY">Foremost among these incidents pending in the <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
court, as recounted in our decision of February 18, 1970, were seven <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u> petitions for judicial correction of election returns
under section 154 of the Revised Election Code filed on January 27, 1970 by the
corresponding boards of election inspectors.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
In its "decision" of February 7, 1970, the <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
court had therein authorized the correction of the election returns from six
precincts of San Luis, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
crediting petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> with 292 additional votes
therein that would overcome respondent <span class="SpellE">Sanga's</span>
over-all margin of 247 votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After our
decision of February 18, 1970, the <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> court
eventually maintained its said "decision" of February 7, 1970, per
its resolution of March 10, 1970, denying therein <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sanga's</span> motion for reconsideration of February 25,
1970 and its resolution of March 25, 1970 denying therein <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sanga's</span> motion of March 13, 1970 for retrial and
recall of petitioners-inspectors and witnesses for cross-examination.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this Court, after several incidents resolved in our resolutions
of March 19, March 20, March 23, March 25, and March 30, 1970, we directed
respondent <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, through the last resolution of
March 30, 1970 "to immediately convene the board of canvassers with instructions
to conclude its canvass and to proclaim forthwith the winning candidate for the
second congressional district of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>. "</p>

<p class="BODY">The corresponding members of the boards of inspectors of the six
San Luis precincts concerned thereafter convened at the session hall of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> before the three-man supervisory committee
appointed by <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> at proceedings attended by the
counsels of the contending parties and the provincial board of can­vassers of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> and made the authorized corrections, duly initialed
by them, on the corresponding returns, crediting peti­tioner <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> with 292 additional votes therein in the following
manner:</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon termination of the act of correction, respondent <span class="SpellE">Sanga's</span> counsel objected to the correctness of the
corrections made in four precincts,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
principally on questions of identity, raised as to whether the persons, who
appeared and were questioned by the committee and by counsels for both parties
and made the corrections on the corresponding <span class="SpellE">returns,were</span>
the same persons who accomplished the said returns in the elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The commit­tee so found affirmatively in its
report of <st1:date year="1970" day="3" month="4">April 3, 1970</st1:date> to
res­pondent <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, which, in its resolution of the
same date, approved the report of the committee, overruled respondent <span class="SpellE">Sanga's</span> objections and "consider(ed) said corrections
to have been regularly made."</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the provincial canvassing board reconvening on April 6, 1970
to discharge its function, respondent <span class="SpellE">Sanga's</span> counsel
verbally moved that the six corrected returns" be disregarded on the
ground that said returns on their face are mathematically impro­bable and were
obviously manufactured as it clearly appears that the votes cast for the
congressional candidate(s) are very much in excess of the registered voters in
the respective precincts. " The board thereupon, by unanimous vote,
resolved to refer the issue to the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> for
resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, after hearing the
parties, promul­gated its split 2 to 1 resolution of April 7, 1970, wherein,
resolv­ing the referral, it ordered the board "not to include in the can­vass
the election returns for Precincts Nos. 9, 15, 16, 19, 20 and 21 of San Luis, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, for being mathematically impro­bable as shown by
the great excess of votes appearing thereon for congressional candidates"
and to thus complete the canvass and make the corresponding proclamation of the
winner on April 13, 1970 at 5:00 p.m., unless restrained by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> filing on April
9, 1970 of his "Motion to Enforce Judgment (alternatively) Petition for <i style="">Certiorari</i>", challenging this last
resolution of respondent <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> on the ground that <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> had no authority to review and vacate the <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> court's correction "decision" the Court
issued a restraining order as prayed for and required respondents to file their
answer thereto. Respondents, in their answers, joined issue, asserting that the
<span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> court's ruling in the judicial correction
proceedings is not <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>
and binding on <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> insofar as the genuineness of
the corrected returns is concerned if in <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span>
judgment the use thereof would tend to foist a fraud on the electorate.
Respondent <span class="SpellE">Sanga</span> further contended that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> had instigated the boards of inspectors of the
precincts concerned to petition for judicial correction of the returns to
offset the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> (<span class="SpellE">Sanga's</span>)
majority as shown in <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> first resolution of
Jan­uary 26, 1970 (set aside in our judgment of February 18, 1970), against
said board's previous representations to <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> that
they had been forced to prepare said returns at gunpoint.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court heard the parties in oral argument on April 23, 1970
and held a re-hearing on July 16, 1970, wherein, pursuant to its resolution of
June 29, 1970, it heard Hon. <span class="SpellE">Honorio</span> Romero,
presiding judge of Branch III of the <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> court
who heard and decided the correction proceedings and received from his clerk of
court the records, exhibits and transcripts of the proceed­ings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The questioned <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> majority
resolution itemized the following excess votes found upon examination of the
corrected returns:</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> majority, holding that
"where, as in this case, the excess votes were the result of judicial
correction made one day after the Commission has promulgated its decision (Case
No. RR-695), and the winner already known, based <u>solely</u> on sworn
petitions of the corresponding boards of inspectors, and the returns as
corrected contained excess votes materially affecting the result of the
election, then the only explanation that could be derived <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
is that said boards had submitted <u>false</u> or <u>inaccurate</u> <u>data</u>
to the Court," that it "cannot countenance the use of election
returns that are 'obviously' invalid" and that "the court merely
sustained the sworn petitions of said boards without considering other factors
on the probable consequences thereof", ordered the exclusion for being
"mathematically impro­bable" of the six corrected returns from the
canvassing, "adhering to the sound policy that abhors 'mere pyrrhic
victory of candidates and that the holding of elections must, at all times and
at any cost, be free, orderly and honest."</p>

ruling sustaining <span class="SpellE">Sanga's</span> contention that the returns
which were concededly genuine and au­thentic are now to be excluded as
"obviously manufactured" and invalid after and because of the
corrections thereon judicially authorized by the <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
court, which very corrections <span class="SpellE">Corn­elec</span> had itself
ruled to have been "regularly made;" and petitioner's, for
maintaining that the six returns were properly corrected only to reflect the
true and correct total votes of <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> (313,
increased by 292 from 21), ignoring the 273 excess votes appearing on the very
face of the returns as a result of the corrections made, as against the lesser
"number of voters who actually voted" with the corresponding
"ballots found in the compartment for valid ballots recorded thereon (897

and for seeking to explain them away now by affidavits of the inspectors
submitted at the first hearing held on April 23, 1970 to the effect that the
votes credited now to <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> per the correction were
wrongly cre­dited originally to another candidate, Federico <span class="SpellE">Taruc</span>,
and should therefore be deducted from the votes credited to <span class="SpellE">Taruc</span>
in the re­turns, when they had testified at the correction proceedings that

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court has noted,
however, that the vexing question at bar of excess votes emerging despite, and
in fact as a result of, the judicial correction proceedings would not have
arisen, had due notice of the petition for correction been properly given to
the af­fected candidates, with the questioned returns sought to be correct­ed
duly submitted to the lower court, and hence, the testimony of the inspectors
in support of their petition would not have been heard ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span>
by the court without benefit of cross-examination, as in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court, on the strength of prevailing jurisprudence cited in
the preceding paragraph No. 1, had issued in Case L-31566 its resolution of
March 23, 1970, denying respondent <span class="SpellE">Sanga's</span> urgent
motion of March 19, 1970 for reconsideration of the Court's reso­lution of the
same date declaring its decision of February 18, 1970 to be <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
and authorizing the canvassing board to reconvene and complete its
canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court, thereafter, acting
upon respondent <span class="SpellE">Sanga's</span> urgent motion for
reconsideration of March 24, 1970 (wherein <span class="SpellE">Sanga</span> for
the first time adverted to the excess votes that would result from the judicial
correction), issued its resolu­tion of March 30, 1970 denying <span class="SpellE">Sanga's</span> motion and declaring that "the electoral
administrative processes which are mandated by law to be summary in nature in
order to determine expeditiously the outcome of the elections ... must come to
an end" and that "no further motion to hold in abeyance the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the Court's resolutions of March 19 and 23
(for the canvass to proceed) will be entertained. "</p>

<p class="BODY">In our decision of <st1:date year="1970" day="18" month="2">February
 18, 1970</st1:date>, we had directed that the proclamation of the winning
candidate between the contending rivals be held in abeyance until after the
questions affecting the same, pending in the <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
court, are determined with finality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
challenged COMELEC resolution now before us has per­force laid open the question
of finality of the <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> court's correction ruling
- not because of <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> resolution beyond its
jurisdiction to exclude the corrected returns and thus review and set aside the
<span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> court's ruling - but because of the grave
question of due process by virtue of lack of notice of the proceedings on the
parties affected, as <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">proprio</span></u> noted by the Court, and which bears heavily on
the validity or nullity of the correction proceedings, as hereinafter
discussed. Besides, <span class="SpellE">prescinding</span> from the fact that
the <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> court's ruling was not directly elevated
to the Court, it is a settled principle in the administration of justice that
"it is always in the power of the Court to suspend its own rules or to
except a particular case from its operation whenever the purposes of justice
require it."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Since the Court's pronouncement in <span class="SpellE"><u>Gumpal</u></span><u>
vs. Court of First Instance of Isabela</u><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">10-a</span></span></a> that section 154 of the Revised
Election Code does not require notice of the judicial <u>correction</u>
proceedings upon the candidates affected, in contrast with section 163 thereof
which specifically directs that notice of the judicial <u>recount</u>
proceedings be "given to all candidates affected", the Court has had
occasion to amplify on its ruling and the rationale <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.
As restated in <u>Estrada vs. Navarro</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">11</span></span></a> the Court has invariably required
unanimity of the inspectors in petitioning for correction for the reason
"that the proceeding for correction is a summary one, is not supposed to
raise controversial issues, and does not call for a recount or revision of the
ballots themselves, either of which contemplates a different remedy."</p>

<p class="BODY">Experience has shown us the contrary, however.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Invariably, the correction petition itself,
although by unanimous consent of the inspectors, has <u>ipso facto </u>given
rise to grave controversial issues and doubts since the correction sought to be
made would materially affect the result of the election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Witness <u>Dizon</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">12</span></span></a>
where by judicial correction of the election return of one precinct in <span class="SpellE">Biñan</span>, Laguna, reducing candidate Benitez' votes therein
from 148 to 129, Benitez lost out to his opponent <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
in the gubernatorial race in the 1928 elections by 10 votes, when without the
correction, he would have won by 9 votes; <span class="SpellE"><u>Gumpal</u></span><u>,
supra</u>, where by judicial correction of the returns from two precincts in
Santiago, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leocadio</span>
Ignacio, <span class="SpellE">Gumpal's</span> opponent for the position of
provincial board member in the 1959 elections was credited in one precinct with
174 votes “not included in (the) election return due to inadvertence" and
140 instead of 114 votes in the other precinct, or a total of 200 additional
votes, sufficient for Ignacio to nose out <span class="SpellE">Gumpal</span> by
10 votes; and the latest case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Cuenco</u></span><u> vs.
Laya</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">13</span></span></a>
where by judicial correction of the return from one precinct in <span class="SpellE">Carcar</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, upheld by the Court
by a six-to-three vote, Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span> was credited
with 67 votes to supply the complete omission from the return of his name and
votes received, which votes were decisive in his being proclaimed winner over
Antonio V. <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span> by 16 votes in the last elections
for the third congressional district of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And controversies have also arisen even as to
unanimity of the petition itself, e.g. as to whether the adverse party's
inspector understood the peti­tion or was the person actually appointed as such
or was com­pelled to sign the petition under duress, or whether the unanimous
petition may still be acted upon by the court or be properly con­sidered when
the adverse party's inspector recants or disowns the petition or whether such
unanimity need only exist upon the filing of the petition or before the court
issues the order of cor­rection.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the above-cited cases, the Court, reflecting on the desirability
of requiring that due notice of the correction proceedings be given to all
candidates affected, did concede in <span class="SpellE"><u>Gumpal</u></span>
that “it would be a good practice to require such notice in appropriate cases,
particularly when there is sufficient time <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
and there are circumstances indicating that the allegations of the petition for
correction may not be entirely truthful," and in <span class="SpellE"><u>Cuenco</u></span>,
that "due process, the community's sense of fairness, would seem to
indicate the need of hearing the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span>,
consistently with the<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>summary</u>
character of the proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In­deed
the respondent judge might have accommodated the peti­tioner's request,
considering that the latter's residence is only a stone's throw from the
courthouse. " But the Court therein, after satisfying itself that all
indications pointed to the veracity of the petitions unanimously filed by the
inspectors, upheld the judicial corrections thus authorized, despite the lack
of notice to the affected parties, on broad perspectives of public policy in
the light of the law's mandate requiring the prompt ascertainment in summary
proceedings of the winning candidate entitled to pro­clamation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the difference in votes between the rival
candidates in the cited cases, as in the case at bar, is marginal, such that
the judicial correction by unanimous petition of the ins­pectors of one or a
few precincts would materially affect the results of the election and spell
victory or defeat, the Court has felt constrained to re-examine thoroughly the
question and after due deliberation has arrived at the conclusion that due
process, as guaranteed by the Constitution, requires in order that juris­diction
may be properly acquired over the parties affected and exercised by courts of
first instance in <u>correction</u> proceedings under section 154 of the
Revised Election Code that (1) notice of the <u>correction </u>proceedings be
given to all candidates affected just as it is required under section 163
thereof governing <u>recount</u> proceedings and (2) copy of the return sought
to be corrected must be ordered by the court to be duly submitted to it by the
provincial or municipal treasurer, as the case may be, or by the chairman of
the board of canvassers concerned who had received the same for the canvassing,
without prejudice to availing of other official copies of the return such as
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> copy and that deposit­ed in the ballot
box.</p>

<p class="BODY">The demands of procedural due process that a party affect­ed must
be given notice and an opportunity to be heard must be fulfilled together with
the law's policy for the prompt proclama­tion of the true winner in the
elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The summary character of the
proceedings, if implemented with a firm hand so as to rule out impertinent and
irrelevant questions and dilatory tac­tics, would normally not cause any undue
delay in the ensuing proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
if some measure of delay were entailed, nevertheless the due process
requirement may not be dispensed with.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">14</span></span></a> Lack of notice to a party
adversely affected has invariably been held to mean the nullity of the
decisions rendered in ordinary civil cases, since they "suffer from a
fatal infirmity for want of due process."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">15</span></span></a> As stated by the now Chief Jus­tice
in <span class="SpellE"><u>Cuaycong</u></span><u> vs. Sengbengco</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">16</span></span></a>
'Acts of Congress, as well as those of the Executive, can deny due process only
under pain of nullity, and judicial proceedings suffering from the same flaw
are subject to the same sanction, any statutory provision to the contrary
notwithstanding. "</p>

<p class="BODY">This doctrine of due process should equally be applied to <u>correction</u>
proceedings under section 154 of the Revised Elec­tion Code, for they are in
law and in fact judicial proceedings. As pointed out by Mr. Justice J. B. L.
Reyes speaking for the Court in <u>Binging Ho vs. Municipal Board of Canvassers</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">17</span></span></a>
wherein we upheld the constitutionality of the legislative grant of authority
on courts of first instance to recount the ballots in case of conflicting
election returns,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">18</span></span></a> "(T)he ascertaining that such
basic facts do exist according to the evidence submitted by the parties is
essentially a judicial function, and it is only after the court decides that
the recount is legally justified that the actual recount takes place." <u>Correction</u>
proceedings constitute the only other instance of such legislative grant of
authority on the courts to intervene in the pre-proclamation electoral process,
and the Court's ruling in <u>Binging Ho</u> is equally applicable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In paraphrase thereof, the pre-requisite
finding or determination by the courts as to the veracity or non-veracity of
the inspectors' petition and of the error alleged, to warrant the granting or
denial of judicial authority to make the correction, an exercise of the
judicial power to ascertain the facts, pass upon their sufficiency, and apply
the law to the controversy."</p>

<p class="BODY">With due notice of the proceeding, the fate of a candidate
adversely affected would not be adjudged ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> and
without due process, and he would have the opportunity of confronting the
inspectors seeking the correction and cross-examining them to assist the court
in appraising the veracity of the petition, and the paramount public interest
which calls for the proclama­tion of the actual winner in the election would be
<span class="SpellE">subserved</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
spectacle of excess votes resulting from the correction authorized by the court
would not arise, since the same would be readily perceived by the court and the
parties affected from the face of the return, which states the number of
registered voters in the precinct, the number who actually voted, with the
corresponding number of valid and spoiled ballots.</p>

<p class="BODY">There really exists no valid reason compatible with due process
why such notice of the proceedings and submittal of the return should be
required only in <u>recount</u> proceedings and not in <u>correction</u>,
proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the foregoing reasons, the Court accordingly expressly
overrules the previous doctrine enunciated by it in the cited cases of <span class="SpellE"><u>Gumpal</u></span><u> vs. Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span></u> and <span class="SpellE"><u>Cuenco</u></span><u>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Laya</span></u>, <u>supra</u>, and all other cases
inconsistent with the doctrine now enunciated that notice of the correction
proceedings must be given to all candidates affected and that copy of the
election return sought to be corrected should be ordered by the court to be
duly submitted to it by the custodian thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court therefore declares the correction proceedings in the <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> court null and void.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the Court's
declaration of nullity of the <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> court's
decision in the <u>correction</u> proceedings for lack of notice to the
candidates affected, specifically petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span>,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Sanga</span> and candidate Federico <span class="SpellE">Taruc</span> (to whom the addi­tional 292 votes now sought to be
credited to <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> per the correc­tion were
erroneously credited, according to the April, 1970 af­fidavits of the
inspectors, <u>supra</u>), said court will have to hear anew the inspectors'
petitions for correction, with due notice to the candidates affected, and
render anew its resolution on the basis of the evidence that may be submitted
to it.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court herein expressly discards the previous doctrine of <u>Benitez
vs. Paredes</u><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">19</span></span></a>
and <span class="SpellE"><u>Dizon</u></span><u> vs. Provincial Board of
Canvassers</u><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">20</span></span></a>
and all subsequent cases uniformly ruling that in correction proceedings, where
the court after hearing the inspectors is satisfied as to the veracity of their
petition or affidavits and of the error alleged to have been committed, it
shall, without any need of opening the ballot boxes, order the corresponding
correction of such error in the election return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In lieu thereof, the Court now sets the
procedure that in all such correction proceedings, the court of first instance
upon being satisfied at the hearing that a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> case has
been made out, must furthermore, -- unless the correction sought is indu­bitable
or unopposed and may therefore be summarily ordered -­in all cases where it
finds that the integrity of the ballot box and its contents has been duly
preserved, go to the real evidence, open the ballot box and conduct a summary
recount of the ballots themselves as in judicial recount proceedings under
section 163 of the code.</p>

<p class="BODY">In resolving now to establish the procedure for a summary recount
of the ballots in disputed correction proceedings where the ballot box and its
contents have not been tampered with, the Court is impelled by its
constitutional prerogative and duty to lay down the guidelines and fix uniform
procedures for the observance of trial courts and the parties affected.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under its constitutional rule-making power "to promulgate
rules concerning pleading, practice and procedure in all courts,"<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">21</span></span></a>
it is conceded that 'procedure" is "generally accepted as embrac­ing
both 'pleading' and 'practice' and it also includes <u>'evidence.</u>'<u> What
evidence should be admitted</u> and <u>what rejected in each case</u>, and <u>how
to weigh it under particular circumstances</u> is <u>fundamen­tally a judicial
function</u> and <u>essentially a procedural matter</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">22</span></span></a>
Related thereto is the injunction in Rule 135, section 6 of the Rules of Court
that:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 6. <u>Means to carry jurisdiction into effect.</u> -
When by law jurisdiction is conferred on a court or judicial officer, all
auxiliary writs, processes and other means necessary to carry it into effect
may be employed by such court or officer; <u>and if the procedure to be
followed in the exercise of such jurisdiction is not specifically pointed out
by law or by these rules, any suitable process or mode of Proceeding may be
adopted which appears conform­able to the spirit of said law or rules</u>."
(emphasis furnished)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This rule was incorporated in the pre-war Rules of Court on the
basis of the Court's assertion, in connection with its rule-making power in the
early case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Shioji</u></span><u> vs. Harvey</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">23</span></span></a>
that "(I)<span class="SpellE">ndependent</span> of any statutory provision .
. . every court has in­herent power to do all things reasonably necessary for
the ad­ministration of justice within the scope of its jurisdiction. " In <span class="SpellE"><u>Villalon</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Arrieta</span></u>,
<u>supra</u>, passing on the more specific provisions of section 163 on <u>recount</u>
proceedings (as compared to the broad and general provisions of section 154 on <u>correction</u>
pro­ceedings), the Court observed that "the law evidently leaves it to the
court to devise the means for the exercise of its powers and the performance of
its assigned role in the manner which may appear to it to be most consistent
with the fundamental purpose of the proceeding."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court, therefore, declares that the suitable process or mode
of proceeding in disputed correction proceedings that would enable trial courts
to effectively exercise their fundamen­tally judicial function of receiving and
weighing the evidence is to avail of the <u>real evidence</u><a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">24</span></span></a>
of the ballot box and of its contents and to conduct an arithmetical count of
the ballots themselves, as in recount proceedings under section 163 of the
code. Neither appreciation of the ballots nor determination of their validity
is called for, since the only purpose of the recount, as is well settled by
jurisprudence,<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">25</span></span></a>
is merely to count the number of votes received by each candidate as they
appear on the face of the valid ballots previously counted by the board of
inspectors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The recount conducted as
part of the correction proceedings would serve best the overriding spirit of
the election code - in entrusting to courts of first instance exclusive jurisdiction
over summary recount proceedings under sections 163 and 168 and correction
proceedings under section 154 - of res<u>toring public tranquility by
dispelling all doubts as to the true number of votes cast for the rival
candidates in a given pre­cinct</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">26</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is further sustained in its conclusion by the following
compelling reasons and considerations:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Far from being non-contentious in character,
the margin of votes involved in correction proceedings has in­variably proven
to be not only controversial but <u>decisive</u> of the results of the
election, as discussed above;<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">27</span></span></a><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There really is no substantial difference bet­ween
<u>correction</u> proceedings and <u>recount</u> proceedings in the one and
principal objective thereof of expeditiously determining be­fore proclamation
the actual votes to be summarily credited to a particular candidate or
candidates in a given precinct where the inspectors claim to have committed an
honest error or there are discrepant returns, and thus offering prompt relief
in a simple but decisive controversy;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rationale behind the grant of authority to
courts of first instance to authorize correction of election returns, as well
as to recount the ballots in case of discrepancy between authentic copies of
the same returns, is that "mistakes of all sorts are too common in human
experience to justify anyone in denying the possibility of honest error ...
(generally such errors or omis­sions to the prejudice of one candidate are
attributed to honest mistake, oversight, inadvertence or confusion due to
fatigue and lack of sleep or terrorism as in the case at bar) .. and it was in
contemplation of the possibility of such errors that the law­makers provided
for their correction with judicial approval."<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">28</span></span></a>
The only difference as far as the commission of the error by the inspectors is
concerned is that in <u>recount</u> proceedings, the errors appear on the face
of the discrepant copies of the return, while in <u>correction</u> proceedings,
the error is not readily seen on the face of the return (except where the name
and votes of a particular candidate is totally omitted, as in <span class="SpellE"><u>Cuenco</u></span>) but has to be manifest­ed by sworn statement
or petition of the inspectors alleging that they gave a certain candidate(s)
more votes or less votes than were actually counted for him. Just as there is
need to recount the ballots in case of discrepant returns in order to determine
the true result of the count of votes cast for the contending candidates, there
exists the same, if not greater need, to also recount the ballots for the same
purpose, in case the inspectors claim they committed some honest error and seek
judicial authorization to alter or amend the return originally prepared and
announced by them. The procedural and evidentiary rule of opening the ballot
box and summarily recounting the votes would readily bear out the fact of such
honest error and no prejudice will have been caused; in the contrary case,
however, the falsity of the alleged honest error would just as readily be
exposed and irreparable prejudice to the intended victim will have been
avoided;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(d)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing in the provision of section 154 of the
Revised Election Code on correction proceedings bars a recount of the
votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cited <span class="SpellE">codal</span>
provision merely directs that "the board of inspectors shall not make any
alteration or amendment in any of its statements, unless it be so ordered by a
competent court." The petition for correction is addressed to the sound
judicial discretion of the court, and there is nothing in the law to indicate
that the judge of first instance must of necessity order the correction<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">29</span></span></a>
and accept unqualifiedly the inspectors' version of what was the true result of
their count of the votes. For there is nothing either in the law that would bar
the judge from following the realistic procedure provided in section 163 of the
Code for a summary recount of the votes,<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">30</span></span></a> and thus cut the Gordian Knot and
thereby satisfy himself as well as all the parties - more than a hundred affidavits
of the inspectors - of the true and actual result of the count of the votes
cast in the precinct concerned;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(e)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The past precedents against opening the ballot
box and recounting the votes were based on the Court's giving paramount
consideration to the imperative perspectives of public policy imposing upon
courts the <span class="SpellE">premptory</span> duty of ascertaining the
candidate entitled to proclamation as the winner. But side by side therewith,
the Court has time and again stressed the overriding necessity of thwarting the
unrelenting efforts of the unscrupulous (who continually tailor their evil
schemes to fit within the ambit of the Court's latest pronouncements) to frus­trate
the popular choice of the electorate and leave the aggrieved party the
"mere pyrrhic victory" of a long tedious election pro­test, and of
exerting every effort to ascertain the true returns, mindful that outright
exclusion from canvass of returns decisive of an election is an act which lends
itself to misuse by the canvass­ing board. These imperatives likewise based on
the clear man­dates of public policy ordain as indicated above, that the true
actual results of the balloting be determined by opening the ballot box and
recounting the votes cast, even though the expeditious proclamation of the winning
candidate be delayed in some measure. In practice, however, this should prove
as expedi­tious as the summary recount in <u>recount</u> proceedings under sec­tion
163 of the Code, for as soon as the trial court is satisfied as to the
existence of a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> case of correction, he may conduct
forthwith the recount and thereby determine the true result of the balloting,
cutting short all further conjecture and discussion as to the fidelity of the
inspectors' recollection of the votes cast and of the errors allegedly
committed by them in re- cording the in the election return;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(f)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The broad legislative grant of authority to
the courts of first instance to authorize the amendment or alteration of the
return necessarily carries the grant of whatever is reasonably necessary for
the proper and effective exercise of the court's judicial task, since the
procedure is not specified by the code and the court is enjoined under Rule
135, section 6 to adopt a suitable process <span class="SpellE">conformalby</span>
to the spirit of the law, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>, to demand the
submittal of the real and best evidence of the ballots as deposited in the
ballot box and conduct a summary recount to determine the true and actual
result of the balloting, which the courts may then judiciously and within the
limits of human certainty authorize to be incorporated in the return submitted
for correction;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(g)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question of the contending candidates' con­sent
to the trial court's opening the ballot box and recounting the ballots - which
formula was proposed in the past without success, as one or all candidates
invariably would manifest their non-con­formity on some vague or speculative
grounds - thus becomes irrelevant in-the light of our pronouncement now
establishing the conduct of such summary recount as the suitable procedure in correction
proceedings under section 154 of the code;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(h)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our pronouncement now is but a logical
development and consequence of our decisions in <span class="SpellE"><u>Pacis</u></span><u>
vs. Comelec</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">31</span></span></a>
upholding <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> order therein to open the ballot
boxes in four precincts to secure serviceable copies of the election returns;
in <span class="SpellE"><u>Mutuc</u></span><u> vs. Comelec</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">32</span></span></a>
authorizing the reopening by the inspectors of the ballot box to retrieve an
accomplished copy of the return, failing which the inspectors were directed to
count the ballots and accomplish a new return based thereon: as well as <u>our
decision of February 18, 1970 in the case at bar</u>, where we overruled
respondent <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> ruling that the remedy of
judicial correction of the returns for Precincts 35-A and 36, <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span>, where the name of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span>
was completely omitted, could not longer be availed of because the inspectors,
according to <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, "could not remember
whether petitioner received any votes" therein, and instead ordered the
inspectors to open, in the presence of all parties concerned, the ballot boxes
for said precincts, count the votes for petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span>,
if any, and make new returns accordingly; and</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(<span class="SpellE">i</span>)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The condition
herein required that the trial court make a preliminary finding that the
integrity of the ballot box and its contents has been duly preserved is, of
course, a neces­sary one, since a new count of the ballots found in a ballot
box that has been tampered with would serve no legitimate purpose and would
defeat the very objective of the recount to determine from the real evidence of
the ballots the true results thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">33</span></span></a> In such a case, the trial court
must content itself with all other secondary evidence available to satisfy
itself of the merit of the petition, such as the inspectors' testimonies, the
tally board and tally sheet, minutes of voting, etc., without regard to the
contents of the tampered ballot box.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the Court has resolved: (a) to annul and set
aside respondent <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> resolution of April 7,

"decision" of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">DIZON, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">The majority opinion penned by Mr. Justice Claudio <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span> in effect overhauls - in part - what heretofore
has been the procedure followed in proceedings for the correction of election
returns in accordance with the provisions of the Revised Election Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While I concur in the result arrived at, I
find myself unable to accept some statements and conclusions set forth
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I, therefore, submit this
separate opinion stating the reasons for my concurrence and dissent.</p>

<p class="NUM">(1) It is well settled that, under Section 154 of the Revised
Election Code, a competent court may authorize the correction of an election
return upon una­nimous petition of the members of the Board of Inspectors of
the precinct concerned (Benitez vs. <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> et al.,
52 Phil. p. 1; Board of Inspectors etc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>, 55
Phil. 914). In justification of this We said in Benitez­-<span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>
that "Mistakes of all sorts are too common in human experience to justify
anyone in denying the possi­bility of honest error in a case like the one under
con­sideration; and it was in contemplation of the possibility of such error
that the lawmakers provided for their correc­tion with judicial approval"
(52 Phil. 47-54). The requirement of <u>unanimity</u> on the part of the
election inspectors was, of course, intended to prevent the misuse of the legal
provision, the prevailing opinion on the matter being that, from the moment
there is lack of unanimity amongst them the case becomes contentious and makes
the correction im­proper.</p>

<p class="BODY">For reasons of expediency - to avoid undue delay in the
proclamation of the winning candidate - the proceeding for <u>correction</u>
was deemed to be summary, so summary that it has been held that a petition for
the purpose may be heard and resolved <u>without notice to the other affected
candidates</u> (<span class="SpellE">Gumpal</span> vs. Court of First Instance et
al., G. R. Nose L-16409 and L-16416, November 29, 1960).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the purpose of the law, as construed by
the courts, was undoubtedly laudable, experience has shown that a determined
losing candidate, with the aid of unscrupulous election inspectors or of
election inspectors acting under threats, could resort to this proceeding for
correction of election returns to enable the former to "grab the
proclamation" leaving to his opponent no other recourse but to avail
himself of the tedious and expensive remedy of an election contest to protect
his rights.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because of the summary character of the correction proceeding, it
was thought not proper, generally, for the Court to inquire extensively into
the circumstances, under which the election inspectors committed the alleged
mistake, nor to order the opening of the ballot box as an effective means of
verifying the truth of the alle­gations regarding the alleged commission of a
mistake the election inspectors. Thus, to prevent undue delay in the proclamation
of the winner, judicial practice had in truth created the possibility of an
injustice being committed against other candidates who would be affected
adversely by the correction. For these reasons, I agree with the majority that
the procedure followed heretofore in correction proceedings should be so
changed as to give the parties woo might be adversely affected b the proposed
correction, an opportunity to be heard, and enable the Court, in doubtful
cases, to verify the trust of the allegations made in the petition for
correction not only by receiving pertinent oral evidence but also by ordering
the opening of the ballot box for the purpose of making <u>physical count</u>
of the ballots contained therein and the number of votes cast in favor of each
of the candidates for the contested position. It is to be understood however
that this is no authority for said. Court to go into the matter of appreciation
of ballots and the reso­lution of particular objections against anyone of them</p>

<p class="NUM">(2) The Revised Election Code (section 144) provides that after
the counting of the votes, the Board Inspectors shall make a. written statement
of the result, this statement being what is generally known as an election
return. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>These election returns are then
submitted in. accordance with law to the provincial or Municipal Board of
Canvassers who are to make the canvass of the result and the proclamation of the
winning candidates in accordance with the provisions of Section 158 to 170 of
the same Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, what really are the powers of these Boards of Canvassers?
While it has been generally stated that their duty in the premises is <u>ministerial</u>,
the truth is that, under the law, as construed by Us <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span>
and other cases, these Boards of Canvassers are not supposed to be mere adding
machines but may exercise a certain amount of discretion - however limited - to
determine whether or not any given election return is genuine, or is an
obviously manufactured return, for the purpose of deter­mining whether or not
the same should be used in canvas­sing the result of the election. From their
resolution, of course, any aggrieved party may seek relief either by invoking
the supervisory jurisdiction of the Commission on Elections or the power of
review of this Court. I deem it to be the settled rule, however, that the
Boards of Canvassers, pursuant to the provisions of the Revised Election Code,
have not only the right but the <u>duty</u> to determine, in the first
instance, whether any given election return before them is genuine or is
Obviously manufactured. In the present case, the Provincial Board of Canvassers
appears to have failed to comply with its <u>duty</u> in the pre­mises because
when the election returns for the contested precincts came up for consideration
and questions were raised against their use for the canvassing of the results,
said Board referred the whole matter to the Commission on elections who, after
hearing the parties, rendered the re solution assailed in these proceedings. My
view on the matter is that said resolution was irregularly rendered, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> not having authority to decide, in the first
instance, the matter thus submitted to it. In the exercise of its supervisory powers
over the Board of Canvassers, it should have required the latter to decide the
matter first, and thereafter any party aggrieved thereby could take up the
matter with the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> or with this Court, For this
reason I agree with the majority that the resolution aforesaid of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> should be set aside.</p>

<p class="NUM">(3) The majority opinion holds that after the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> had <u>authorized</u> the
correction of the election returns under consideration and after the same had
been corrected <u>in accordance with the petition of the members of the Boards
of Inspectors</u>, the Provincial Board of Canvassers of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
had only one duty in the premises:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to
accept and use the corrected returns in the canvassing of the votes and the
proclamation of the winner in the elections for the position of one of the
Representative districts of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, and that
neither the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> nor the Pro­vincial Board of
Canvassers had authority to <u>review</u> the aforesaid decision of the Court
of First Instance of said province. While the Undersigned agrees with the legal
proposition that neither the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> nor any
Provincial or Municipal Board of Canvassers has juris­diction to review and, as
a. result thereof, to modify or reverse the decision rendered by a Court of
First Instance in a proceeding for correction of an election return, I do not
admit that the Provincial Board of Canvassers of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
can not refuse to use the cor­rected election returns in question for the
purpose of the canvass it has to make, if in its opinion they do not speak the
truth or are obviously manufactured because, as corrected, they give rise to a
manifest and unexplained considerable <u>excess</u> of the votes <u>cast</u>
over the number not only of the <u>registered voters</u> in each precinct but
also over the number of <u>registered voters who actually cast their votes</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If in the exercise of their discretion on the
matter they would refuse to the corrected returns, I submit that such action
does not amount to reversing or modifying the decision of the Court of First
Instance, of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be remembered in this connection
that said.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Court simply <u>authorized</u>
the Board of Inspectors, on the strength of the evidence presented, to correct
the election returns the manner prayed for in their unanimous petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, it seems clear to the
undersigned the possible negative action of the Provincial Board of Canvassers
referred to above would not amount to saying that the Court of First instance <u>erred</u>
in authorizing correction because the evidence presented before it was not
sufficient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is what would amount to
a <u>review</u> of the decision of said Court.</p>

<p class="NUM">(4) Finally, my understanding of the majority opinion is that it
annuls all the proceedings had to fore it the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> relative to the petition for correction of the
election returns in question and directs said Court and the parties concerned
to start all over again, with the court's powers on the matter either amplified
or merely clarified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I agreed with this
ultimate result because of the peculiar circumstances of the case - which could
easily be repeated <span class="GramE">is</span> future similar cases.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To be remembered is the fact that it was
first attempted to have the election returns in question declared void because
they were "gun point returns"; that after the failure of this
attempt, a tentative canvass made showed a favorable result for <span class="SpellE">Sanga</span>; that it was then that the Boards of Inspectors of
the affected precincts - who at the beginning were or might have been ready to
sustain the "gun point returns" theory - came out with the petition
for cor­rection mentioned heretofore; that, according to the evidence presented
before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, these
Boards of Inspectors, while holding session in separate premises, happened - by
accident perhaps - to commit the same mistake in registering the number of
votes received by the same candidate - <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> -
because of shots fired outside the election precinct premises; that the
presiding judge authorized the cor­rection of the questioned election returns
without even having them before him and without having any notice served on the
other candidates for the same position for which <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span>
ran, who would inevitably be adversely affected by the correction sought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These circumstances more than justify, in my
opinion, the resolution to annul the afore­mentioned proceedings.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">FERNANDO, <i>J.</i>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the result but reach it by an approach in sympathy
with, but not unqualifiedly subscribing to, the premises the majority find
compelling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not to deny the merit
inherent in the opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>
characterized by vigor and forthrightness and powerful in its logic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precisely though, its high persuasive quality
may obscure what for me would appear to be certain implications and nuances
that for the present at least I cannot fully accept.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this concurring opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is, it would seem, some justification
for a separate statement of one's views considering the marked departure from
previous rulings, overruling past decisions and locating the existence of a
power hitherto not discerned.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. It is expressly declared in the <span class="SpellE">diapositive</span>
portion of our decision that the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
is directed in the correction proceedings, in the election cases therein named,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
"to hear the same anew with due notice to the candidates affected; to have
before it the copies of the election returns sought to be corrected; upon being
satisfied <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> of the errors alleged to have been
committed by the boards of inspectors concerned and upon its preliminary
finding that the identity and integrity of the ballot boxes have been duly
preserved, order the opening thereof and after like­wise satisfying itself that
the integrity of the ballots therein has been also duly preserved, conduct a
summary and arithmetical recount of the ballots themselves; and thereafter to
render anew the appropriate resolution on the basis of the evidence before
it." The result thus reached would impart to Section 154 of the Revised
Election Code the interpretation that the candidates affected be notified of
the hearing thereon in accordance with the cardinal requirement of due process
and that if it be ascertained that the integrity of the ballot boxes and their
contents has been duly preserved, to open the same for the purpose of
determining the votes actually received by such candidates as the basis of
whatever appropriate resolutions could thereafter be handed down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As noted at the outset, I am in full
agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">There can be no exception to the correctness of this categorical
pronouncement in the opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>:
"The demands of procedural due process that a party affected must be given
notice and an opportunity to be heard must be fulfilled together with the law's
policy for the prompt procla­mation of the true winner in the elections."
It may not be amiss to refer to what was clearly set forth in a dissent by
Justice <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> in <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Laya</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
It was his view that respondent Judge "committed a grave abuse of
discretion in considering [the urgent petition] <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>
and in issuing the order complained of."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
As he pointed out: "[I] agree with the majority opinion that 'broad
perspectives of public policy impose upon courts the imperative duty to
ascertain who is the real candidate elected, in as expeditious a manner as
possible, without being fettered by technicalities and procedural barriers',
but I also submit that equally broad and imperative perspectives of public
policy demand that the courts should do so with fair­ness and understanding,
and without taking any precipitous action – <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of due process – that might give rise to suspicions of bias."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The construction that is now fastened on this section of the Election Code has
decidedly in its favor its conformity with a constitutional mandate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is as it ought to be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hereafter, no doubt should remain as to the
necessity of giving the candidates affected an opportunity to be heard in every
proceeding for correction.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. Equally so, the disposition of this litigation, considering the
facts brought to our attention, would not be in accordance with justice
according to law unless a recount is had, assuming, of course, the integrity of
the ballot boxes and their contents has been preserved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, again, the writer of this opinion joins
the rest of his colleagues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is not
fully persuaded, however, that there is a need to provide that hereafter
"in all such correction proceedings, the court of first instance upon
being satisfied at the hearing that a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> case has been
made out, must further­more, – unless the correction sought is indubitable or
unopposed and may therefore be summarily ordered – in all cases where it finds
that the integrity of the ballot box and its contents has been duly preserved,
go to the real evidence, open the ballot box and conduct a summary recount of
the ballots themselves as in judicial recount proceedings under section 163 of
the code." While, for me, the necessity for such a procedure is apparent
in this case, I am not prepared as yet to go along with the view that such a
rigid formulation should be invariably adhered to in every such litigation of
this character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would leave the matter
open to the discretion of the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With this view I take of the case, there would seem to be no need as yet
for the appropri­ate invocation of the exercise of our rule-making power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is in that sense that my acceptance of the
opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span> is less than complete.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. The opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span> sets
forth in the most emphatic language what is referred to as "compelling
reasons and considerations" for the conclusion reached in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The way they are <span class="SpellE">marshalled</span>
and assembled would appear to render immune from any objection our decision in
this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If I find myself unable to
give my unconditional assent, it is partly due to what I feel to be the
assumption that both the correction and recount proceedings need not be
distinguished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As set forth, the opinion
states that there "really is no substantial difference" between
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Insofar as the objective be to
determine the votes actually received, then there is no basis for
disagreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the extent, however,
that the differing theories constituting the justification for the various
steps set forth in detail in the Election Code are inadvertently overlooked in
the stress laid on the ultimate purpose of a recount, namely, to ascertain the
true will of the voters, then it would appear to me that less than sweeping
language is called for.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be likewise that I read into Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee’s</span>
opinion implications that it does not really contain, but in the weighing of
the two objectives of public interest, insufficient weight, it seems to me, is
placed on the need for prompt expedition of-the proceedings prior to
proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not to say that
"the thwarting of the unrelenting efforts of the scrupulous to frustrate
the popular choice of the electorate" is not a basic objective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That affords warrant for the opening of the
ballot boxes in proceedings of this character to determine what the true results
are.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is to pay tribute anew to the
constitutional objective of insuring free, orderly, and honest elections.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">What makes me hesitant, however, to go along with the sweeping
scope of the opinion is that while I am persuaded that this particular case
calls for a decision as rendered by us, I am far from convinced that thereafter
the procedure indicated by us in this decision is to be inflexibly
followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The situations that may arise
in the future are many and varied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
principle valid for today may not always retain that attribute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, for me at least, there is merit in
the view, especially in election law cases, that no overriding doctrine
impressed with an inflexible character is to be categorically announced, the
process of inclusion or exclusion being the more appropriate considering the
multifarious and diverse instances of abuses in the electoral process that may
subsequently present themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am
not prepared to state then, except where, as in the case of the notice, the
constitutional command of due process is paid deference, that the action to be
taken by the lower court in the exercise of its power under Section 154 is to
be predetermined in advance to cover each and every instance where such power
is invoked.</p>

<p class="NUM">4. Nor would there be in any opinion any valid objection that
could be raised if our decision, considering the literal language of Section
154 of the Election Code, tends to be rather expansive in character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is implicit in the process of
construction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To paraphrase those noted
jurists, Holmes and <span class="SpellE">Cardozo</span>, judge-made law is one of
the existing realities of life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A court
though is not free to roam at will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
limits of its competence are narrower.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It may legislate only between gaps.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It fills the open spaces of the law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But courts must and do legislate, only they do so interstitially; they
are confined from molar to molecular motions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nonetheless within such limits and within the confines of these open
spaces, choice moves with a freedom that stamps its action as creative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law which is the resulting product is not
found but made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clear is it thus that
the power to declare the law carries with it the authority, and within limits
the duty, to make law where none exists.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>
