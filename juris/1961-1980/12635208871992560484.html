<p class="BODY">The testimony for the prosecution was to the effect that the
deceased Miguel <span class="SpellE">Lomontod</span> with his wife, Sofia <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>, was on the afternoon of <st1:date year="1959" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1959</st1:date> in the house of Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Dignos</span> in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. <span class="SpellE">Niño</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also present were his mother, <span class="SpellE">Florentina</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabantoc</span>, together
with his sister and brother-in-law, Ester <span class="SpellE">Lomontod</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span> <span class="SpellE">Moscoriola</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
He left the place to return to his house, about a kilometer away in the same
barrio, together with his wife, mother, sister, and brother-in-law at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the after­noon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With them was a certain <span class="SpellE">Pio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pomentera</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon reach­ing a certain intersection on the way, <span class="SpellE">Pomentera</span>
placed his arm around the shoulder of the deceased and informed him that to
pass by the main road would be dangerous, an abandoned narrow trail being
preferable instead.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The deceased, unfortunately for him as it turned out later, paid
heed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They took the trail, the wife and
the mother follow­ing at a distance, with the spouses Ester <span class="SpellE">Lomontod</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span> <span class="SpellE">Moscoriola</span>
taking the usual way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon after, <span class="SpellE">Pomentera</span> took off his arm from the shoulder of the
deceased, then stepped backward and requested the deceased to wait for him.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
As the deceased turned around to face <span class="SpellE">Pomentera</span>, a
shot, apparently coming from a banana grove some ten meters away from the
deceased, exploded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It found its <span class="GramE">mark,</span> the deceased being hit on the back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He fell down and cried for help, addressing
his mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The wife instinctively took
cover behind the trunk of a coconut tree nearby upon <span class="GramE">hearing</span>
the shot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pomentera</span>
ran away.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The wife, from the cover afforded by the coconut tree, saw four men armed with
guns emerge from the banana clump.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
were the accused, now appellants Modesto <span class="SpellE">Beraces</span>, <span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> <span class="SpellE">Biacolo</span>, Felipe Villa,
and Jimmy Nicolas, all of whom were known to the mother, the wife, and the
brother-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Moscoriola</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants <span class="SpellE">Beraces</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Biacolo</span> each carried a carbine; appellants Villa
and Nicolas had a rifle and <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">thompson</span></span>,
respectively.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant <span class="SpellE">Beraces</span> took a shot at the deceased, the
bullet hitting the ground just in front of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that point, the deceased raised his left
hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was then that appellant <span class="SpellE">Biacolo</span> took aim and fired at the deceased, hitting his
ring finger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the deceased lay
prostrate on the ground, appellants left.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The mother and the wife attended to the deceased, as best they
could, with his sister and the brother-in-law assisting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Dignos</span>, who
was informed of the tragedy, came, and the deceased was brought to his house.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The deceased, very much weakened, asked his wife and his mother to look for a
motorboat so that he could be taken to <span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place> for treatment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They proceeded to do so, but soon after, they
were called by <span class="SpellE">Moscoriola</span> to return to the house of <span class="SpellE">Dignos</span> as the condition of the deceased has taken a turn
for the worse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was at that stage,
with life ebbing away and death impending, that the victim told his wife in the
presence of his mother and brother-in-law that the persons who shot him were
the herein appellants.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Then he died.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon an examination of the body of the deceased by a sanitary
inspector, <span class="SpellE">Serafin</span> Villa, bullet wounds on the back
and front were found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was his view
that the wound on the back was the entrance of the bullet, and the wound on the
abdomen, the exit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also found a wound
on the left-hand ring finger of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">The Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.</span>
<span class="SpellE">Niño</span>, Jacinto Reyes, made an ocular inspection of the
scene of the incident, accompanied by the sanitary inspector.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They located three empty shells fired from a
carbine; two were near the cluster of banana plants, and the third, near the
place where the deceased fell.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There was likewise evidence as to motive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Beraces</span>
nursed a grudge against the deceased as the latter, in 1958, had refused to
give appellant his share of the harvest of rice from the land owned by one
Miguel <span class="SpellE">Apostol</span> who appointed the deceased as
overseer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Beraces</span>
had previously worked on the land by planting rice thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Between Jesus <span class="SpellE">Llever</span>,
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Llever</span> and appellant <span class="SpellE">Silvino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Biacolo</span> on one hand, and the family of the deceased,
on the other, was a dispute over the ownership of a land pending before the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> and docketed as
Civil Case No. 4728.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant Felipe
Villa was a constant companion of <span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> <span class="SpellE">Biacolo</span>, while appellant Jimmy Nicolas was the brother-in-law
of appellant Modesto <span class="SpellE">Beraces</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was on the basis of the testimony for the prosecution coming
from the mother, <span class="SpellE">Florentina</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabantoc</span>,
the wife, Sofia <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>, and the brother-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Seferino</span> <span class="SpellE">Moscoriola</span>, that
appellants were convicted of the crime charged, the lower court rejecting the
defense of alibi relied upon by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
noted in the decision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"On the
other hand, the defense put up by the accused is alibi, a defense which is said
to be the weakest, seldom believed for given weight, except (1) when the
identity of the accused has not been positively made, and (2) when the evidence
is airtight, which means that there was physical impossibility for the accused
to be in the place where the incident took place because they were in another place
which makes it physically improbable for them to be at the place of the
incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Modesto <span class="SpellE">Beraces</span>
claims that he was in [Barrio] <span class="SpellE">Baras</span> with his
co-accused Jimmy Nicolas, together with Marcos <span class="SpellE">Orongan</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Orongan</span>, a
place only three kilometers away from the scene of the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> <span class="SpellE">Biacolo</span> claims to be in [Barrio] <span class="SpellE">Cabonga</span>-<span class="GramE">an</span> making sled together with <span class="SpellE">Dioscoro</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bransuela</span>, also three kilometers away, more or less,
from the place of the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Felipe
Villa claims that he was in [Barrio] <span class="SpellE">Cabonga</span>-an on
March <span style="">6 </span>and 7 together with <span class="SpellE">Perito</span> <span class="SpellE">Branzuela</span> cementing the
house of <span class="SpellE">Venancia</span> <span class="SpellE">Biacolo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Marcos <span class="SpellE">Orongan</span>
corroborated the alibi of <span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> <span class="SpellE">Biacolo</span>,
while <span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> <span class="SpellE">Biacolo</span>
corroborated the alibi of Felipe Villa."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
The lack of persuasive character of such a defense was explained in the
decision thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The Court is not
impressed by the alibi put up by the accused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is far from airtight so to speak.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>True Modesto <span class="SpellE">Beraces</span> claims that he was in
[Barrio] <span class="SpellE">Baras</span> with his co-accused Jimmy Nicolas, now
his brother-in-law, but Barrio <span class="SpellE">Baras</span> appears only to
be three kilometers away from the place of the incident and it takes barely two
hours to negotiate the distance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Felipe
Villa was in [Barrio] <span class="SpellE">Cabonga</span>-an only two kilometers
away from the scene of the incident while <span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> <span class="SpellE">Biacolo</span> likewise was in [Barrio] <span class="SpellE">Cabonga</span>-an.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the distance of the place where <span class="GramE">all the</span> accused claim they were during the day of the
incident it is not improbable that they could have been in the place of the
incident, commit the act imputed against them, then return in the place where
they claim they were, negotiating the distance in a short time."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">1. It is significant that in this appeal the attack on the
correctness of the lower court decision is centered on the proposition that the
prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants would have this
Court disregard the findings of the trial judge as to the weight to be given
the evidence of record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That such a
power exists is not to be denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
equally undeniable that unless a fact or circumstance of weight or influence
has been shown to be disregarded by the lower court there is no justification
for its judgment as to the<span style=""> credibility
to be attached to the testimony offered by the witnesses being disturbed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So this Court had occasion to reiterate in
the relatively recent case of People v. <span class="SpellE">Gumahin</span>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The findings of the lower court embodied in a well-written
decision cannot only stand the test of the most rigid scrutiny but also has in
its favor the well-settled principle that as far as credibility is concerned,
the findings of the lower court which had the opportunity to see, hear and
observe the witnesses testify and to weigh their testimonies will be accorded
the highest degree of respect by this Tribunal."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Appellants were unable to demonstrate that
such a principle should not be paid deference.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2. It is likewise stressed in this appeal that the lower court
should not have considered the identification of appellants as coming within
the concept of a dying declaration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is not denied, as it could not be denied, that immediately after the victim had
pointed to appellants as the perpetrators of the crime, he died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When his mother and his wife were called back
from a mission to get a motorboat so that the deceased could be taken to <span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span>, he was lying at death's door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was uttered then did come from a man who
was mortally wounded and who was least likely to pervert the truth, conscious
as he was that he was about to join his Maker.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would be to flout the well-accepted doctrines announced by this Court
time and time again <span style="">as to what is a
dying declaration, if under such circumstances the lower court would be held as
having committed an error in giving credence to the statement made by the
deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">That we are
not disposed to do.</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
