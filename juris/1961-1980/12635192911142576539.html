				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Original action for <i style="">certiorari</i>
and prohibition to annul an order of respondent Public Service Commission
setting aside its previous decision approving the uncontested sale and transfer
of municipal franchise and certificate of public convenience for the operation
of electric service in <span class="SpellE">Pulilan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
in favor of petitioner and to prohibit respondent commission from further
proceedings in the case below.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent <st1:place>Milo</st1:place> was the grantee of
a municipal franchise, and upon application, was granted a certificate of
public convenience for the operation of electric service in <span class="SpellE">Pulilan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, in a decision of respondent commission
rendered on <st1:date month="11" day="10" year="1958">November 10, 1958</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="2" day="15" year="1967">February 15, 1967</st1:date>,
said respondent sold his franchise and corresponding certificate of public
convenience to petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties
to the sale filed on April 24, 1967 with respondent commission a joint petition
for approval of the sale,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
setting forth the inability of respondent-vendor to devote the necessary time
and attention to the operation of his franchise to the prejudice of the public
and the willingness and financial capacity of petitioner-vendee to operate the
franchise with the resultant promotion of public necessity and convenience.</p>

<p class="BODY">After various hearings which were postponed by the parties'
agreement, respondent executed and submitted his affidavit of <st1:date month="10" day="25" year="1967">October 25, 1967</st1:date> that "I have
no objection and will not interpose any in the early approval of the sale and
transfer subject of the above case."</p>

<p class="BODY">Associate Commissioner Gregorio C. <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>,
to whom the case had been assigned and who had earlier on June 15, 1967 issued
a provisional order of approval of the sale, thereupon scheduled the hearing on
November 16, 1967, at which hearing respondent's counsel manifested that there
was no further reason for postponements of the hearing as were obtained
"several times in the past to enable the parties to reach an agreement on
certain collateral agreements between them" and "I will have no more
objection to the hearing of Case No. 67-2819 for approval of the sale and
transfer and also to the <span class="SpellE">deputization</span> of a hearing
commissioner to receive the evidence in support of the application."</p>

<p class="BODY">Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> then delegated
first the reception of evidence to an Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gueco</span>,
but as the latter was not in his office, the parties asked for the <span class="SpellE">deputization</span> of another hearing commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>
then delegated the reception of evidence to the then chief of the industrial
division, <span class="SpellE">Engr</span>. Pedro <span class="SpellE">Talavera</span>,
who was the same commissioner who received the evidence in the original case
granting respondent <st1:place>Milo</st1:place> the subject certificate of
public convenience.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Engr</span>. <span class="SpellE">Talavera</span>
conducted inspections of petitioner-vendee's electric service in the
municipality to verify his compliance with certain requirements for the
improvement of his electric service and installations, as required in the
commission's provisional order of approval, and received the evidence in
support of the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 19, 1967, on the basis of the evidence submitted,
Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> rendered decision finding the
petition in order and approving the transfer and sale of the franchise and
certificate of public convenience, including all machinery and equipment in
favor of petitioner, as promoting the public interest in a proper and suitable
manner.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 19, 1968, or 30 days after the decision, respondent
Milo filed a petition for reconsideration alleging that the decision was
"incomplete and premature" since "collateral agreements"
only "partially" complied with, and "subsequent"
commitments not complied with, by petitioner-vendee, had not been submitted to
the commission for approval; that petitioner was not financially qualified to
operate and maintain the electric service; and that "the transaction with
applicant-vendee belongs to the category of inexistent or void contracts"
and that "no amount of approval by the commission can cure the inherent
nullity of the transaction." Petitioner duly filed his opposition thereto
of <st1:date month="3" day="13" year="1968">March 13, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, however, at the hearing of the motion for
reconsideration, respondent added a new ground and filed a supplemental motion,
assailing the validity of the proceedings before <span class="SpellE">Engr</span>.
<span class="SpellE">Talavera</span>, on the ground that not being a lawyer, he
could not be authorized to receive the evidence in the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 24, 1968, respondent commission, by a vote of four to
one, Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> dissenting, issued its
order granting the reconsideration, setting aside the decision of December 19,
1967 and directing the commission secretary to set the case for hearing anew on
the ground that "Mr. <span class="SpellE">Talavera</span> is not a lawyer
and does not have the necessary preparation to process the evidence, oral and
documentary, presented in this case; and the provisions of Section 32 of Act
146, as amended, being clear that the hearing of cases may only be delegated to
duly qualified attorneys of the Public Service Commission or Division Chiefs
‘if they be lawyers' x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 12, 1968, within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
30-day period, petitioner filed the present petition, submitting that appeal
was not a plain, speedy or adequate remedy, because of "the great
prejudice (to) petitioner who not only has paid respondent the purchase price
of the sale, but also has introduced many improvements and invested money and
effort in the operation of the franchise." In the alternative, petitioner
submitted that should the Court rule appeal to be an adequate remedy, that the
petition, timely filed, be treated as one for review under Rule 44 and that the
questioned order be stayed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court accepted the petition and issued summons on <st1:date month="7" day="17" year="1968">July 17, 1968</st1:date> requiring respondents
to answer the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1968" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1968</st1:date>, the Court, upon a
P1,000.00-bond, issued a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining the
enforcement of the questioned order.</p>

<p class="BODY">The basic issue raised by the petition concerns the validity of
the decision rendered by Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> on
the basis of the evidence received by <span class="SpellE">Engr</span>. <span class="SpellE">Talavera</span>, chief of the industrial division, who admittedly
is not a lawyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resolution thereof
depends on this question:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>may a joint
applicant in an <u>uncontested</u> joint petition in an industrial case before
the Public Service Commission for approval of the transfer and sale of a
certificate of public convenience made by him in favor of his co-applicant,
after submitting an affidavit that he has no objection to the early approval of
the sale and agreeing through counsel to the delegation by the commission of
the reception of evidence to the chief of the industrial division, be
permitted, after the commission had rendered its decision of approval as prayed
for and on the basis of the evidence thus received, to assail the decision so
rendered on the ground that the said delegate, not being a lawyer, could not be
legally authorized to receive the evidence in the case?</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent <st1:place>Milo</st1:place>
must be held to be now clearly <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from
assailing the delegation of the reception of evidence to <span class="SpellE">Engr</span>.
<span class="SpellE">Talavera</span>, then chief of the industrial division of
the commission, and questioning the validity of the decision thus rendered,
after not having presented any timely objection to such delegation but having
consented thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the grounds
of his last-minute motion for reconsideration were ignored and brushed aside by
respondent commission, since the sale executed by him in favor of petitioner
was clearly legally valid and binding and he could not be heard in the
commission to question its validity, after he himself had submitted it for
approval, for alleged non-compliance with "collateral" and "
subsequent" agreements, and the proper form for its annulment was not the
commission but the regular courts of competitive jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged ground of nullity of the
delegation of <span class="SpellE">Engr</span>. <span class="SpellE">Talavera</span>
was just an after-thought submitted by respondent in a supplemental motion at
the hearing of his motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, if respondent were to be consistent with his present posture
that the decision was a nullity because the evidence was received by <span class="SpellE">Engr</span>. <span class="SpellE">Talavera</span>, who is not a
lawyer, and therefore excluded from those expressly authorized in section 32 of
the Public Service Act (Comm. Act No. 146) since its amendment by Republic Act
No. 723 which took effect on June 6, 1952,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
to be delegated to receive evidence - he must perforce concede the nullity of
the commission's original decision granting him on November 10, 1958 the
subject certificate of public convenience, for the reception of evidence in
said case was likewise delegated to and received by <span class="SpellE">Engr</span>.
<span class="SpellE">Talavera</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(The
whole question would then be moot, for respondent in such case would have no
valid certificate to retain or sell.)</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever defect there may
have been in delegating the reception of evidence to a non-lawyer but to <span class="SpellE">Engr</span>. <span class="SpellE">Talavera</span> with his long
experience and <span class="SpellE">knowledgability</span> as chief of the
industrial division must be deemed waived by the parties' consent to his
designation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The objectives of the law
were well complied with in the designation of <span class="SpellE">Engr</span>. <span class="SpellE">Talavera</span>, as observed by Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>
in his dissenting opinion:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"(D)<span class="SpellE">uring</span> the hearing of the Motion for Reconsideration,
counsel for the petitioner, added a new ground which is not included in the
petition for reconsideration to the effect that since Mr. Pedro <span class="SpellE">Talavera</span> who was then the Chief of the Industrial Division
of this Commission is not a lawyer, he can not be authorized to receive the
evidence in this case and the proceedings conducted by him is null and
void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The practice in this Commission,
even in the past, is when a case is uncontested, like the present case, the
Commission delegates the reception of the evidence to Mr. <span class="SpellE">Talavera</span>,
who is an engineer and the Chief of the Industrial Division and who is believed
more competent than a lawyer to know about industrial cases like electric
plants, ice plants, cold storage plants and the like, as regards their
technical aspect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>No objection was
made to the delegation of the hearing to Mr. <span class="SpellE">Talavera</span>
by any party, so that whatever defect it has is deemed waived, particularly as
in this case when the party now questioning the delegation was present and even
agreed to it</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such defect in the
delegation of reception of evidence to the person designated by the commission
was invariably held to be a procedural defect which was deemed waived if no
timely objection were raised by a party in our jurisprudence prior to the
enactment on June 6, 1952 of Republic Act No. 723 - when the Public Service Act
contained no provision authorizing the commission to delegate the conduct of
hearings and reception of evidence to hearing commissioners. "By timely
objection," the Court pointed out in <u>Enriquez &amp; Co. vs. Ortega</u><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>,
"we mean when the point is raised at the beginning of the hearing or
investigation before the person assigned to receive the evidence, and not after
he has completed the investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
reason is obvious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the objection is
raised at the beginning of the hearing, and the objection is sustained, the
trouble and expense that a trial or an investigation generally entails could be
avoided and the case may then be tried by the Commission, or by a member
thereof, as the law requires.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if the
objection is interposed opportunely and is overruled and the investigation is
continued over and above the objection of the opposing counsel, the party so
objecting can later reiterate his objection and pray for the nullification of
the proceedings for then it is not fair that he be made to suffer the
consequence resulting from the mistaken resolution of the officer assigned to
receive the evidence." The Court thus emphasized that "the objection
must be timely interposed in order to prevent the presentation of the evidence
before a person who has no legal authority to receive the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the objection is interposed after the
evidence had been presented, it comes late and should be disregarded."</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Rizal</u></span><u>
Light &amp; Ice Co. vs. Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Morong</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
involving the very question of a similar belated objection to the delegation of
the very same <span class="SpellE">Engr</span>. <span class="SpellE">Talavera</span>
as division chief to hear the case and receive the evidence, although he is not
a lawyer, and therefore excluded from those expressly authorized in section 32
of the Public Service Act, as amended by Republic Act 723, to be designated to
receive evidence, the Court, per Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>,
nevertheless adhered to the ruling of <u>Enriquez</u>, and other precedents, <u>supra</u>,
that such defect in delegation was a procedural, not a jurisdictional, point
that was waived by failure to interpose timely objection thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it was held therein that "(T)his
Court in several cases has ruled that objection to the delegation of authority
to hear a case filed before the Commission and to receive the evidence in
connection therewith is a procedural, not a jurisdictional point, and is waived
by failure to interpose timely the objection and the case had been decided by
the Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since petitioner has
never raised any objection to the authority of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Talavera</span>
before the Commission, it should be deemed to have waived such procedural defect,
and consonant with the precedents on the matter, petitioner's claim that the
Commission acted without or in excess of jurisdiction in so authorizing Mr. <span class="SpellE">Talavera</span> should be dismissed."</p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the later case of <u>Eastern
<span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> Bus Co. Inc. vs. Public Service Commission</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
however, the petitioner therein timely interposed an objection and motion for
inhibition and disqualification of the public utility adviser designated to
receive the evidence, since he was not a division chief, although a lawyer, and
the rationale of Enriquez,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
was expressly invoked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court found
that "It was alleged that at the hearing on September 26, 1968, counsel
for petitioner upon learning for, the first time that respondent Calderon,
while a member of the bar, was not included in the legal division of respondent
Commission and was not a division chief, moved for his inhibition or
disqualification, invoking the appropriate statutory provision<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
as well as two decisions of this Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent Calderon was deaf to such a plea and insisted on continuing with the
hearing on the merits of such application, justifying such adamant stand on the
view that while neither a member of the legal division nor a division chief,
his being a public utility adviser placed him in the latter category." The
Court thus held that "respondent Calderon could not thus have been validly
designated to conduct the hearing," and in consonance with <u>Enriquez</u>
ordered the nullification of the proceedings before therein respondent
Calderon.</p>

<p class="NUM">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if such defect in
the delegation of reception of evidence were to be considered a jurisdictional
matter, it must be raised by timely objection as in the Eastern <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> case cited above, for otherwise the complaining
party would fall under the principle enunciated by Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> for the Court in <span class="SpellE"><u>Tijam</u></span><u>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Sibonghanoy</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
that "after voluntarily submitting a cause and encountering an adverse
decision on the merits, it is too late for the loser to question the
jurisdiction or power of the court." As restated in <span class="SpellE"><u>Crisostomo</u></span><u>
vs. Reyes</u><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
and a number of subsequent cases,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
the principle decrees that “While the jurisdiction of a tribunal may be
challenged at any time, sound public policy bars the petitioners from so doing
after their having procured that jurisdiction themselves, speculating on the
fortunes of litigation."</p>

<p class="NUM">7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, it may be noted
that petitioner's right to operate the electric service in <span class="SpellE">Pulilan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, is no longer open to question, petitioner
having been granted a twenty-five year congressional franchise <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> under Republic Act No. 6013 enacted on August 4,
1969.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>
