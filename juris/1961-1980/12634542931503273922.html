				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In the election for barrio captain of Bad-as, Placer, <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del Norte, held on January 12, 1964, <span class="SpellE">Plamasur</span> <span class="SpellE">Buyser</span> was on the same
day proclaimed elected following a canvass by the local board of election
tellers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The official tally gave him a
total of 232 votes as against 213 for his opponent, <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Florendo</span>, Sr.</p>

<p class="BODY">His election was thereupon contested by <span class="SpellE">Florendo</span>
who, in a petition lodged with the municipal court of Placer, charged that
there was error in the appreciation of the ballots; that the number of ballots
used and unused after the election exceeded that issued before the election;
and that there was a discrepancy between the number of voters who registered on
January 5, 1964 and the number of those who voted on January 12 as a result of
the "fraudulent" registration of additional voters on January 11 and
12.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Buyser</span> moved to dismiss the petition;
when his motion was denied, he filed an answer, after which the case was heard.</p>

<p class="BODY">The municipal court thereafter rendered judgment in favor of <span class="SpellE">Buyser</span>; it held that there was neither error in the
appreciation of ballots nor proof of fraud arising from the discrepancy in the
number of ballots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It declared the
registration of voters held on January 11 and 12, 1964 valid, because consented
to by both <span class="SpellE">Florendo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Buyser</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It ruled that, while the registration of new
voters on a date other than that fixed by law was irregular, of the 57 late
registrants only 7 were new voters whose ballots, even if they are considered
as having been cast for <span class="SpellE">Florendo</span>, could not have
reversed the results of the election.</p>

<p class="BODY">From this judgment <span class="SpellE">Florendo</span> appealed to
the Court of First instance of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> Norte, pursuant to section 8 of the Revised Barrio
Charter,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
with which he filed an amended protest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He alleged, among other things, that after the re­gistration of voters
on <st1:date year="1964" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1964</st1:date>, 33 more
were regis­tered on January 11 and 12 and that these 33 unlawfully voted for <span class="SpellE">Buyser</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was
tried <u>de</u> <u>novo</u>, after which the court directed the parties to
submit memoranda on three issues: (1) whether the registration of voters on
January 11 and 12, 1964 was valid; (2) if it was illegal, whether the court
could an­nul the election; and (3) in the event that the election is annulled,
whether it could order a new election.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>After the submission of
memoranda by the parties, the court issued on <st1:date year="1964" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1964</st1:date> an order stating:</p>

<blockquote>"The Commission on Elections fixed the date of registration of
voters in its resolution to be not later than <st1:date year="1964" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The resolution does not provide for any other day of registration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resolution also provides that if no
election is held on the day fixed by the Commission on Elections which is
January 12, 1964, it may be held on any other day within the month of January,
to be determined in a resolution by the council and if it is not held within
the month of January, it shall be held on a day to be fixed by the Provincial
Governor upon petition by the barrio council which will not be beyond forty days
from the date of the said petition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Clearly the registration of voters on January 11 and 12,
1964, was not authorized and the same was null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The election on January 12 having included
voters registered on said days is also null and void.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, the Court hereby declares that the election of Barrio
Council Members of Bad-as, Placer, on January 12, 1964, is null and void, and
pursuant to the provisions of the resolution of the Commission on Elections of
December 5, 1963, the Court hereby directs that the Provincial Governor be fur­nished
with a certified copy of this order so that pursuant to this order he shall
call new elections to be held on a fixed day not later than 40 days from this
date for the election of the Members of the Barrio Council of barrio Bad-as,
Placer, <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del Norte."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From this order, <span class="SpellE">Buyser</span> appealed to
this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He con­tends that the trial
court erred (1) in not allowing him to present evidence of his agreement with <span class="SpellE">Florendo</span> to permit the registration of additional voters
after <st1:date year="1964" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1964</st1:date>, and
(2) in annulling the registration of voters held on Ja­nuary 11 and 12, 1964
and the election held on the latter date.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first contention is palpably without merit as <span class="GramE">no</span> manner or form of agreement by the parties can validate
registration of voters hold subsequent to the deadline date fixed by law, in
this case <st1:date year="1964" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1964</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second contention is likewise devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 8 of the Revised Barrio Charter provides in part that ?</p>

<blockquote>"Not later than the first Sunday of January of the election
year in accordance with this sec­tion, there shall be a registration of new
voters to be conducted by the board of tellers. . . .”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The registration of voters on January 11
and 12, 1964 was void, but this is not sufficient reason for the annulment of
the election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this Court has said in
another case,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
"the power to throw out an entire division is one which ought to be
exercised with the greatest care and only under circumstances which de­monstrate
beyond all reasonable doubt either that the disregard of the law has been so
fundamental or so persistent and conti­nuous that it is impossible to
distinguish what votes are law­ful and what are unlawful, or to arrive at any
certain result whatever, or that the great body of the voters have been
prevented by violence, intimidation, and threats from exercising their
franchise."</p>

<p class="BODY">True it is that in <u>Reyes</u> <u>v.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Biteng</u></span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court annulled the election in two precincts on account of the
registration of voters made outside the days fixed by law, but this action was
justified by its findings that as a result of the irregularity "many
voters, without any qualification whatsoever <span style="">&nbsp;</span>. . . succeeded in having their names
inscribed in the official list" and that it was "impossible to
segregate the legal from the illegal votes and because the frauds and
irregularities com­mitted had affected the entire election to such an extent
that it is impossible to ascertain the true will of the voters authorized to
exercise the right of suffrage."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In contrast, here there is no allegation either that the voters
registered on January 11 and 12, 1964 are disqualified or that it is impossible
to separate their votes from <span class="GramE">those cast</span> by the rest of
the voters in Bad-as so as to warrant the annulment of the entire election.</p>

<p class="BODY">In many respects this case is similar to <u>Deles</u> <u>v</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Alkonga</u></span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
in which the following findings and ruling were made by this Court:</p>

<blockquote>"'With reference to the third assignment of er­ror, the fact
that the first registration of voters was held in the town of San <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> instead of the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Bagacay</span>,
which was the place fixed by the resolution of the municipal council, and the
second registration in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Bagacay</span>, and the
voting in the town of San <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span>, while it
constitutes an irregularity, said fact is not sufficient to annul the whole
election in precinct No. 3 of San <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> where 185
electors had voted, inasmuch as it does not appear that the forty-eight
electors registered in said precinct were not able to vote by reason of said
change, and not for any other reason, nor does it appear that had they voted,
they would have voted for the protestant, Ramon Deles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only qualified elec­tor whom the
protestant could present and who was not able to vote on account of said
change, was <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Montejo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Anatolio</span> <span class="SpellE">Begaforo</span>, even if he had wanted to vote, would not have
been able to do so, because he was not registered as a voter in said
precinct."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case at hand, instead of annulling the election, the court
<u>a</u> q<u>uo</u> should have proceeded to ascertain not only who registered
after <st1:date year="1964" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1964</st1:date> but
also for whom each of them voted, in order to determine the correctness of <span class="SpellE">Florendo's</span> allegation that all the illegal registrants
voted for <span class="SpellE">Buyser</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The necessary adjustment in the number of votes cast for each of the
candidates could then accordingly be made.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court has to make these vital findings of fact, be­cause the
factual findings of the municipal court were necessarily vacated by the appeal,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
and the case stood for trial <u>de</u> <u>novo</u>, "as though the same
had never been tried before and had been originally there commenced."</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the order <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> of <st1:date year="1964" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1964</st1:date> is set aside, and this
case is remanded to the Court of First Instanced of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>
del Norte for further proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
pronouncement as to costs.</p>
