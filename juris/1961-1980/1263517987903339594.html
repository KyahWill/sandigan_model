				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a review of the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals in
its Case No. 1226.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to Act No. 667, as amended, the <span class="SpellE">Escudero</span>
Electric Service was granted municipal franchises to operate and maintain
electric light, heat and power sys­tems by the municipal council of <span class="SpellE">Candelaria</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, under
Resolution No. 61, dated <st1:date year="1928" day="7" month="6">June 7, 1928</st1:date>
and by the municipal council of <span class="SpellE">Calauan</span>, Laguna under
Resolution No. 11, dated <st1:date year="1929" day="19" month="3">March 19,
 1929</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The franchise for <span class="SpellE">Candelaria</span> fixed the rate of franchise tax at "<span class="SpellE">uno</span> <span class="SpellE">porciento</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <span class="SpellE">ingresos</span> <span class="SpellE">brutos</span>
<span class="SpellE">que</span> <span class="SpellE">obtenga</span> <span class="SpellE">por</span> <span class="SpellE">dicho</span> <span class="SpellE">privilegio</span>

As to the
fran­chise of <span class="SpellE">Calauan</span>, since no copy thereof was
presented in evidence, the tax court presumed that the rate of franchise tax
prescribed therein was 2%, as it was the rate being paid by the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1960</st1:date>
the respondent assessed against the petitioner deficiency franchise tax and
surcharge in the sum of P20,228.33 for the period from <st1:date year="1948" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1948</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1959" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1959</st1:date>, computed as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">All billings made by the petitioner, regardless of whether paid
or not, were made subject to the franchise tax.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to the respondent, the tax of 5% on the gross receipts, as
well <span style="">as </span>the 25% surcharge on
the deficiency, was imposed in accordance with Section 259 of the National
Internal Revenue Code, as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner, through its counsel, protested the assessment and
requested for its withdrawal and cancellation on the following grounds,
namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the right to assess the
alleged deficiency tax for the period from January 1, 1948 to September 30,
1955 bad already prescribed; (2) that the 2% tax prescribed in its franchise
prevailed over the 5% tax provided for in Section 259 of the National Internal
Revenue Code, <span style="">as </span>amended; and
(3) that the uncol­lected revenues do not constitute part of the taxable gross
receipts or earnings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his letter
dated <st1:date year="1961" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1961</st1:date>,
the respondent denied the request for lack of legal basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, the petitioner filed with the
Court of Tax Appeals a petition for review of the respondent's decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">After proper proceedings, the tax court rendered its decision
dated <st1:date year="1963" day="26" month="12">December 26, 1963</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> por­tion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"In resume, we are of the opinion that the right of the
Government to assess the deficiency franchise tax against petitioner covering
the period from <st1:date year="1948" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1948</st1:date>
to <st1:date year="1955" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1955</st1:date> has
already prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to the
deficiency franchise tax and surcharge covering the period from October 1, 1955
to June 30, 1959 in the sum pf P15,772.91 (P12,618.33 deficiency tax plus
P3,154.58 as 25% surcharge), the decision of respondent is hereby affirmed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, petitioner is hereby ordered to pay
the sum of P15,772.91 within thirty days from the date this deci­sion becomes
final, without pronouncement <span style="">as </span>to costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Unable to secure a reconsideration of the adverse portion of the
decision, the petitioner instituted the instant petition for review.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first issue to be resolved in this case is whether or not the
provisions of petitioner's municipal franchises regarding the rate of tax have
been amended by Section 259 of the Tax Code, as amended by Republic <span style="">Acts Nos. </span>39
and 418, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 259.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Tax </u><u><span style="">on </span></u><u><span style="">corporate franchises</span></u><span style="">.- </span>There shall be collected in respect
to all existing and future franchises, upon the gross earnings or receipts from
the business covered by the law granting the <span style="">franchise a tax </span>of five <u>per</u> <u>centum</u>
or such taxes, charges, and percentages <span style="">as are spe­</span>cified in the special charters of
the grantees upon whom such franchises are conferred, whichever is higher,
unless the provisions thereof preclude the imposi­tion of <span style="">a </span>higher
tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the purpose of facilitating the
assessment of this tax, reports shall be made by the respective holders of the
franchises in such form and at such <span style="">times, as </span>shall be required by the
regulations of the Department of Finance.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The taxes, charges, and percentages on corporate franchises,
shall be due and payable as specified in the particular franchise or in case no
time <span style="">limit </span>is
specified therein, the provisions of section one hundred and eight-three shall
apply; and if such taxes, charges, and percentages remain unpaid for fifteen
days from and after the date on which they must be paid, twenty-five <u>per</u>
<u>centum</u> shall be added to the amount of such taxes, charges, and
percentages, which increase shall form part of the tax."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In at least four cases<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
similar to the present case, where the franchises were issued by the municipal
councils also pursuant to Act No. 667, this Court has held that the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> section of the tax code amended the pertinent
provisions of the municipal franchises.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In <span class="SpellE">Balanga</span> Power Plant Co. vs. Commissioner <span style="">of </span>Internal Revenue, this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"At the outset, it should be noted the status of petitioner's
municipal franchises as property and property right <span style="">is </span>dependent upon or qualified by the nature and limitations of
the authority under which said franchises were granted by the municipal
corporations concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Admittedly, such
authority, as regards the franchises for <span class="SpellE">Balanga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Samal</span>, emanated from Act No. 667, pursuant to which
franchises granted <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> shall be 'subject to
the power of Congress to alter, modify or repeal the same.' To the extent that
Section 259 of our Nation­al Internal Revenue Code is inconsistent with the
rate of taxes fixed in said municipal franchises - and the theory that Section
259 as applied to petitioner herein is unconstitutional, necessarily implies
such inconsistency - it is ob­vious that, for all intents and purposes, said
legal provision alters the pertinent provisions of said franchises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effect­ing such alteration, our
legislative de­partment has merely exercised, however, a power expressly
reserved thereto by said franchises, and has acted, therefore, <u>in</u> <u><span style="">conformity</span></u><span style="">, </span>therewith, <u>not</u> in violation of the provisions thereof
or to the detriment of the rights thereby vested in petitioner herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We now come to the question <span style="">as </span>to whether the un­collected amounts due
from petitioner's customers should be excluded in computing the franchise
tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In upholding the assessment made by
the respondent wherein the fran­chise tax payable by the petitioner was based
on gross receipts, whether collected or not, the tax curt relied on the case of
Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company vs. Collector of Internal Revenue.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
In that case this Court construed "gross receipts" to mean
"gross earnings," thereby subjecting the uncollected revenues to the
tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Receipts" means amount actually
received, for otherwise they would not be re­ceipts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the words of the franchise were to be
construed in their literal sense, in­dependently of the organic act or the
Constitution, the theory of the plaintiff-appellant may be plausible; but it
should be noted that the Philippine Legislature granted the fran­chises through
Acts Nos. 1368 and 3436 under the authority vested in it by Section 74 of the
Philippine Bill of 1902, the first organic act, and by Section 28 of the Jones
Law, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The acts of the Legislature granting the franchises should be
construed so <span style="">as
</span>not to contravene or violate the organic acts above mentioned, for
otherwise <span style="">said
legisla­tive acts </span>would be null and void or uncons­titutional.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The organic acts use the word 'earnings.' A
person may <span style="">have earned his </span>salary
but may not have collected it, or may be unable to collect it from an in­solvent
employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">A </span>person cannot demand payment of his unpaid salary unless he
has earned it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would show that to
col­lect is a different act from to earn.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Con­sequently, the uncollected "gross receipts" which should
be construed as meaning the same thing <span style="">as "gross </span>earnings" should be
subject to the franchise tax."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, Section 259 of the National Internal Revenue Code, as
amended by Republic Acts Nos. 39 and-418, uses the term "gross earnings or
receipts," so thus that "gross receipts" as so used has the same
meaning as "gross earnings." Accordingly, the uncollected charges or
amounts due from the petitioner's customers should be considered part of the
taxable "gross earnings or receipts."</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to <span style="">the imp</span>osition
of 25% surcharge on the deficiency, this Court in <span class="SpellE">Imus</span>
Electric Co., Inc. vs. Court of Tax Appeals, <u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">, </span>and <span class="SpellE">Guagua</span> Electric Light Co. Inc., vs. Collector of Internal
Revenue <u>supra</u>, ruled that when the taxpayer acted in good faith in
paying the franchise tax at the lower rate fixed by its franchise, the
surcharge may be dispensed with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
instant <span style="">case, </span>the delay in the
payment of the deficiency tax was due to the erroneous view of the petitioner
that <span style="">its </span>franchises had not
been amended by Section 259 of the National Internal Revenue Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since it appears that at one time or another
the office of the respondent also shared the view of the petitioner to the
extent of making refunds to franchise holders who had paid at the rate of 5% as
in the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> cases, it would not be fair to
impose on the herein peti­tioner the 25% surcharge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently it was only after our decision in
the <span style="">two </span>cases of <span class="SpellE">Hoa</span> <span class="SpellE">Hin</span> Co., vs. David, G. R.
Nos. L-9616 and L-11783, <st1:date year="1959" day="25" month="5"><span style="">May </span>25, 1959</st1:date>, wherein we
held Section 259 of the Tax Code to be applicable, that the Bureau of Internal
Revenue defined its stand accordingly and started assessing municipal franchise
taxes at 5% instead of at the lower rates stated in the corresponding
franchises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present case the
assessment of the deficiency taxes, made on <st1:date year="1960" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1960</st1:date> covered a period up to <st1:date year="1959" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1959</st1:date> only; and it cannot therefore
be said that the petitioner had been paying before then at the lower rate of 2%
with knowledge that its payments were deficient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our ruling with respect to the surcharge in
the <span class="SpellE">Imus</span> and <span class="SpellE">Guagua</span> cases
should apply herein.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Wherefore</span></b>,
modified by eliminating the 25% sur­charge on the amount of P3,154.58, the
decision appealed from is hereby affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No pronouncement <span style="">as </span>to
costs.</p>
