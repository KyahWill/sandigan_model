Domestic Relations Court).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due
publication was had.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition was
set for hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, be­fore the
petition could be heard on the merits, the court, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">motu</span></u></span><u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">proprio</span></span></u><span style="">, </span>in its order of <st1:date year="1962" day="6" month="11">November 6, 1962</st1:date> expressed the opinion "that
an alien cannot avail himself of the provisions of our Rules of Court relating
to change of name" and thereupon denied the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A move to recon­sider was rejected in the
court's order of <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Off­shoot is the present appeal.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At issue is whether an
alien may petition for a change of name.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Primarily, this question hinges on the proper interpretation of the word
<u style=""><span style="">person</span></u><span style=""> </span>as it is employed in Rule 103 of the
Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This problem, by all
means, is not new.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a recent judicial test (In the Petition for the Change of Name
of JOSELITO YU, G.R. L-20874, May 25, 1966) we held that Philippine citizenship
of the applicant is not a prerequisite for a petition to change name; and that,
accordingly, an alien may petition for a change of name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, this Court, speaking through Mr.
Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, declared:</p>

<blockquote>"Rule 103 does not say that only citizens of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
may petition for a change of name.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>[Neither does Public Act No. 1386 of the Philippine Commission (enacted <st1:date year="1905" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1905</st1:date>) from which the Rule
has been adopted.] Section 1 provides that 'a person desiring to change his
name shall present the petition to the Court of First Instance of the province
in which he resides, or, in the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Ma­nila</st1:place></st1:city>,
to the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court.' Here the word 'person' is a
generic term which is not limited to Filipino citizens, but embraces all
natural persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule does not even
require that the citizenship of the petitioner be stated in his petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is enough that the petition be verified,
signed by the petitioner or some other person in his behalf, and set forth (a)
that the petitioner has been a bona fide resident of the province where the pe­tition
is filed for at least three (3) years prior to the date of filing; (b) the
cause for which the change of name is sought; and (c) the name asked for
(Section 2).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule is clear and
affords no room for interpretation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
sets forth all the requirements, and Filipino citizenship is not one of them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u><span style="">
</span>ruled that since the use of surnames is based on family rights, and
since under Article 15 of the Civil Code laws relating to family rights and
duties, or to the status, condition and legal capacity of persons are binding
upon citizens of the Philippines even though living abroad, the converse of the
principle must be recognized, that is to say, the same matters in respect of an
alien must be governed by the laws of his own country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The major premise of the proposition may be
true in a general sense:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One's surname
is usually that by which not only one as an individual but one's family as well
is known.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus Title XIII of the Civil
Code (Articles 364 to 373) contains provisions for the use of surnames by
legitimate, legitimated, illegitimate, and adopted children, as well as by
women who are married, widowed or legally separated from their husbands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But a change of name as authorized under Rule
103 does not by itself define, or effect a change in, one's existing family
relations, or in the rights and duties flowing <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>;
nor does it create new family rights and duties where none before were
existing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not alter one's legal
capacity, civil status or citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is altered is only the name, which is that word or combination of
words by which a person is distinguished from others and which he bears as the
label or appellation for the conveniences of the world at large in addressing
him, or in speaking of or dealing with him (38 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>.
595).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The situation is no different
whether the person whose name is changed be a citizen or an alien.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">To be sure, there could be
instances where the change applied for may be open to objection by parties who
already bear the surname desired by the applicant, not because he would thereby
acquire certain family ties with them but because the existence of such ties
might be erroneously impressed on the public mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this is precisely the purpose of the
judicial application - to determine whether there is proper and reasonable
cause for the change of name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As held by
this Court in seve­ral cases, in which pertinently enough the petitioners were
aliens, the change is not a matter of right but of judicial discretion, to be
exercised in the light of the reasons adduced and the consequences that will
likely follow (<span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Peng</span> <span class="SpellE">Oan</span> v. Republic, L-8035, Nov. 29, 1957; Tan vs. Republic,
L-16384, April 26, 1962; <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Te v. Republic, L-15549,
June 30, 1962; Moore v. Re­public, L-16607, June 26, 1963).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In not one of those cases, however, has it
been ruled that an alien is not entitled to file a petition at all."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, we pause to
consider whether every alien in this country may petition for a change of name.</p>

<p class="BODY">Change of name - under our own law - is a special proceeding to
establish the status of a person involving his relations with others, that is,
his legal position in, or with regard to, the rest of the community.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
is directed against all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is <u>in <span class="SpellE">rem</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it <span class="GramE">is,</span> that under Section 3 of Rule 103, publication of the
petition is required.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The broad general
doctrine is that the status of an alien indivi­dual is governed and controlled
by the <span class="SpellE"><u>lex</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">domicilii</span></u>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Implicit in this precept is that an alien
may be allowed to change his name here only if he be domiciled in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
"domicile" means </span>"permanent home, the place to which,
whenever absent for business or pleasure, one intends to return, and depends on
facts and circums­tances, in the sense that they disclose intent."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">An alien who temporarily stays in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
may not there avail of the right to change his name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, what good will that be if, after all,
his stay will be for a short period of time?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would not be of much benefit to him; court proceedings for the
purpose could yet be a useless ceremony; the salutary effects flowing from a
change of his social relation and condition may not thus be achieved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And then, stock should be taken of the fact
that in a change of name, third persons and the State are concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Correct, then, it is to say that change of
name is not temporary in nature; the new name may not be shunted aside at will.</p>

<p class="BODY">We, accordingly, lay down the rule that <u>only</u> aliens
domiciled in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
may apply for change of name in the courts thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Considering that the
petition herein complies with the requisites set forth in the Rules of Court,
we vote to set aside the orders of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of
November 6, 1962 and November 24, 1962; and to direct said Court to proceed
with the hearing and determination of Special Proceeding 03521, entitled
"In the Matter of the Petition to Change Name of <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
