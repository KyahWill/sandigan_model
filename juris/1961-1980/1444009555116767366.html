				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Application for naturalization. The judgment below was adverse to petitioner. He appealed.<blockquote><p>1. Amongst the grounds relied upon in the judgment under review is that petitioner failed to state in his petition a former place of residence—Cebu City.</p></blockquote><p>Petitioner's application for naturalization named his present place of residence as Garcia-Hernandez, Bohol. No mention was made of any other place of residence. Concededly, however, he also stayed in Cebu City, For, he completed a one-year course for radio mechanic jn March 1958 and a two-year course for radio operator ending March 1960—in Cebu City.</p><p>Section 7 of the Naturalization Law requires that a petition for naturalization state petitioner's "present and former places of residence." Residence contemplated in Section 7 encompasses all places where petitioner actually and physically resided.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Cebu City where petitioner studied for three years perforce comes within the compass of the term <em>residence</em>. And this, because "information regarding petitioner and objection to his application are apt to be provided by people in his actual, physical surrounding." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Failure to allege a former place of residence is fatal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <br></p><blockquote><p>2. Naturalization proceedings involve public interest. In consequence, the entire record thereof is open to scrutiny.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> We take a look at petitioner's income.</p></blockquote><p>At the time of his application for naturalization, petitioner's known income <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> was an annual salary of P2.400.00 plus P600.00 commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> But commission does not figure in reckoning income. Because it is contingent, speculative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></p><p>By judicial standards an income of P2.400.00 a year— for a petitioner who is single—is below the level of the lucrative. Reason: The high cost of living and the low purchasing power of money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p><p>We find it unnecessary to dwell on the other points discussed in the briefs.</p><p>Judgment affirmed. Costs against petitioner. So ordered.</p><p><em>Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P. </em>and<em> Zaldivar, JJ., </em>concur.</p><p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p><p><em><br></em></p><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Qua <em><em>vs.</em></em> Republic, L-19834, October 27, 1964.<p></p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Chang <em><em>vs.</em></em> Republic, L-20713, April 29, 1966; Chan Kiat Hunt <em><em>vs.</em></em> Republic, 1,-19579, February 28, 1966; Republic <em><em>vs.</em></em> Reyes, et al., L-20602, December 24, 1965, citing cases.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Kwan Kwock How <em><em>vs.</em></em> Republic, L-18521, January 80, 1964; Tio Tek Chgi <em><em><em>vs.</em></em></em> Republic, L-1911.2, October 30, 1964; Chenpr <em><em>vs.</em></em> Republic, L-20013, March 30, 1965; Lee Np Len <em><em>vs.</em></em> Republic, L-20151, March 31, 1965; Lee <em><em>vs.</em></em> Republic, L-20148, April 30, 1965.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> For purposes of the National Law, the income to be considered is that which petitioner had at the time of the filling of the petition.
