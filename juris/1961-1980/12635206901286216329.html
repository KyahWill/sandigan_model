				G.R. No. L-32692, July 30, 1971</h4>
				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES,
PLAINTIFF?APPELLEE, VS. EPIFANIO FLORES Y MARIKIT ALIAS EDWIN
BANATLAO, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.
<br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MAKALINTAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">This case is before this
Court on mandatory review of the judgment of the Circuit Criminal Court of <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, imposing upon
the defendant, <span class="SpellE">Epifanio</span> Flores y <span class="SpellE">Marikit</span>,
</span><u>alias</u> <span style="">Edwin <span class="SpellE">Banatlao</span>, the penalty of death upon his plea of guilty to
the charge of robbery with homicide.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the brief filed by the law firm of Burgos and <span class="SpellE">Sarte</span>, counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>,
it is recommended that the case be remanded to the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> so
that the defendant may be arraigned anew and the meaning and possible
consequences of a plea of guilty explained clearly to him in order to preclude
any doubt that if he enters such a plea he does so voluntarily and
intelligently.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same recommendation
is made by the Solicitor General.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The record does not show
that minutes were taken of the proceedings below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision under review, however, recites
what transpired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant appeared
for arraignment without counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
his consent the court appointed <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
counsel, who thereupon man</span><span style="">i</span><span style="">fested that the defendant</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">was
intending to plead guilty but would like to have the information read to him in
Pilipino.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This request was complied
with, after wh</span><span style="">i</span><span style="">ch he "intimated that he fully
comprehended the same and signified his willingness to plead guilty to the
offense charged, the consequences of which he likewise understood."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court then passed sentence, taking into consideration
the aforesaid plea as a mitigating circumstance and the three aggravating
circumstances alleged in the information, namely, superior strength, <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span> and recidivism.</p>

<p class="BODY">As pointed out by counsel the terms "<span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span>"
and "superior strength" have each a legal significance not ordinarily
understandable to a layman unless explained to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In itself nighttime is not an aggravating
circumstance, and becomes one only where it is especially sought by the
offender or taken advantage of by him to facilitate the commission of the crime
or to avoid discovery and thus minimize the risk of capture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same manner, abuse of superior
strength is a relative factor, and may depend upon other circumstances than
mere numerical superiority of the aggressors<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
- circumstances which may be correctly appreciated by a trial judge only upon
searching inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such inquiry should
of course include the existence of mitigating circumstances, if any, since they
affect the determination of the proper penalty.</p>

<p class="BODY">The norm that should be followed where a plea of guilty is
entered by the defendant, especially in cases where the capital penalty may be
imposed, is that the court should be sure that defendant fully understood the
nature of the charges preferred against him and the character of the punishment
provided by law before it is imposed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While there is no law requiring it, yet where the penalty may be death,
it is advisable for the court to call witnesses for the purpose of establishing
the guilt and the degree of culpability of the defendant.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The latest decision on this point is in the case of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Remegio</span> <span class="SpellE">Estebia</span>, G. R. No.
L-26868, July 29, 1971, where this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Enrique
Fernando, stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>". . . inasmuch
as judgments of conviction imposing the extreme penalty of death are subject to
review by the Supreme Court as law and justice shall dictate, whether the
defendant appeals or not, which automatic review neither the Court nor the
accused could waive or evade, it would seem that the proper and prudent course
to follow where the accused enters a plea of guilty to capital offenses
especially where he is an ignorant person with little or no education, is to
take testimony not only to satisfy the trial judge but to aid the Supreme Court
in determining whether accused really and truly understood and comprehended the
meaning, full significance and consequences of his plea."</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Wherefore</b>, the decision under review is set aside and the
case remanded to the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> for a new arraignment of the
defendant, with assistance of counsel and with the precautions herein
indicated.</p>
