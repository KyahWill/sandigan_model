				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Restituto</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span>
seeks a writ <span style="">of "certiorari </span>and/or
prohibition," with preliminary <span style="">injunction, to </span>restrain respon­dent Gregorio
T. <span class="SpellE">Lantin</span>, as Judge of the Court of First <span style="">Ins­</span>tance of
Manila, Branch VII, from <span style="">enforcing, </span>during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of this
case, an order issued by him on January 31, 1963, in Civil Case No. 52866 of
said court - hereinafter re­ferred to as CFI Case No. 52866 - and, after <span style="">due hearing, to
reverse or annul </span>said order, to make the writ of preliminary injunction
permanent, as well as to recover costs, and to secure "such further relief
as may be in consonance with jus­tice and equity."</p>

<p class="BODY">The events leading to the institution of the present case are
these:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On September 5, 1955, a deed,
entitled "Contract of Transfer of Management", was executed by <span class="SpellE">Valleson</span>, Inc. - hereinafter referred to as <span class="SpellE">Valleson</span> - represented by its President and General
Manager, Lorenzo Valdez, as Transferor, and <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sibal</span>, as <span style="">Transferee, as well as Mariano </span><span class="SpellE">Guison</span>, as owner of the <span style="">"Angela Building", located </span>at
No. 323 <span class="SpellE">Carriedo</span> Street, Manila - part of which is
occupied by <span class="SpellE">Valleson</span> - whereby the latter ceded,
conveyed and transferred to <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> "the wholesale
and retail acts and activities of disposing <span style="">and <span style="">selling </span>to the
consuming public the commercial items" of <span class="SpellE">Valleson</span>,
"from September 5, 1955 to September 4, 1962," in consideration of
the sum of P2,000 a month to be paid by <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was further stipulated in the contract
that <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> would "have full and complete freedom
to run the wholesale and retail <span style="">busi­</span>ness"
during said period, "without any interference from anybody"; that he
would "honor and respect all present subsisting contracts or their last
expired contracts, of all the concession­aires with <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE">Valleson</span>"
and would "not collect from them, in any form, any charge of goodwill and
rate of commission except the one existing in their present contracts" or
"remove them from the premises except for just and reasonable causes as
pro­vided for in their respective contracts"; and that <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span>
would pay <span class="SpellE">Guison</span> the sum of P3,400 a month, "as
rental of the Angela Building".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the same date,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Guison</span> executed
another contract - hereinafter referred to as the first contract - whereby <span class="SpellE">Guison</span> leased to <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> "the
total space presently occupied by <span class="SpellE">Valleson</span>,"
from "September 1955 to September 1962 <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>to be renewed only upon agreement of
both parties."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 1, 1962, <span class="SpellE">Guison</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> executed another
contract of lease - here­inafter referred to as the second contract - whereby <span class="SpellE">Guison</span> leased the Angela <span style="">Building to </span><span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> "for a term of
ten (10) years beginning September 2, 1962," at a "monthly rental of
P4,000." It would seem that, soon thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span>
notified the former concessionaires and <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span> of
<span class="SpellE">Valleson</span>, who, <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> con­tends,
had become his <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span>, to vacate the spaces sub­leased
to them and that, otherwise, proceedings for their <span class="SpellE">eject­ment</span>
would be instituted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Presently, or on or about September 4, 1962, <span class="SpellE">Valleson</span>
commenced Civil Case No. 51476, of the Court of First Instance of Manila -
hereinafter referred to as CFI Case No. 51476 - against <span class="SpellE">Guison</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was alleged in the complaint there­in that, although the first contract of
lease purports to have been signed by <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> in his
personal capacity, he, in fact, acted therein as <span class="SpellE">Valleson's</span>
representative, and that, pursuant to said contract, the same was, upon its
expiration, to be renewed under the same terms and conditions specified
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Valleson</span>
prayed, therefore, that a writ of preliminary injunction or <span style="">a </span>restraining
order be issued directing <span class="SpellE">Guison</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> to refrain from interfering with <span class="SpellE">Valleson's</span>
possession of the Angela Build­ing, and that, after hearing, judgment be
rendered declaring that <span class="SpellE">Valleson</span> has the right to
renew the contract of lease with <span class="SpellE">Guison</span>, for another
period of seven (7) years, under the same terms and conditions specified in the
first contract of lease and ordering <span class="SpellE">Guison</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> to pay damages, as well as granting such other relief
as may be just and equitable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Forthwith
- <span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1962</st1:date> - said Court, presided over by Honorable
Gregorio T. <span class="SpellE">Lantin</span>, Judge, issued the writ of
preliminary in­junction prayed for by <span class="SpellE">Valleson</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Subsequently, or on </span><st1:date month="11" day="5" year="1962"><span style="">November
 5, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> instituted, in the municipal court of Manila, the
following unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> cases, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Case </span><span style="">No. </span><span style="">103384, against Benjamin and Patricia <span class="SpellE">Manio</span>;
Case No. 103385, against <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> Hernandez; Case No.
103386, against Belen <span class="SpellE">Neis</span>; and Case No. 103387,
against <span class="SpellE">Aug­usto</span> and <span class="SpellE">Natalia</span>
Valdes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants in these four (4)
cases were former <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span> of <span class="SpellE">Valleson</span>,
and alleged <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span> of <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date month="12" day="12" year="1962"><span style="">December 12, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, the latter filed, </span><span style="">in the same </span>court, similar cases, to
wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Case No. 104595, against Alfonso
and <span class="SpellE">Narcisa</span> Domingo; and Case No. 104596, against
Lorenzo and <span class="SpellE">lnocencia</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These two (2) sets of defendants are
identically situated as the defendants in Cases Nos. 103384 to 103387, in
relation to <span class="SpellE">Valleson</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Before the institution of
the last two (2) cases, or on November 10, 1962, <span class="SpellE">Valleson</span>
moved, in CFI Case </span><span style="">No. </span><span style="">51476, that <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> be dealt with for contempt of Court, for having filed
the first four (4) unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> cases -
hereinafter referred </span><span style="">to as </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">ejectment</span></span><span style=""> cases - notwithstanding the writ of
preliminary injunction, issued on September 4, 1962, but the motion was, on
December 13, 1962, denied by Judge <span class="SpellE">Lantin</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Meanwhile, or on </span><st1:date month="11" day="12" year="1962"><span style="">November
 12, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
defendants </span><span style="">in </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">ejectment</span></span><span style=""> cases Nos. 103384 to 103387 had filed
motions to dismiss the same, based upon the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of said CFI Case No. 51476.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
motions were, on </span><st1:date month="12" day="3" year="1962"><span style="">December 3, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, denied by Honorable W. L. <span class="SpellE">Cornejo</span>, Judge of the Municipal Court of Manila, for lack
of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Cornejo</span>,
likewise, ordered said cases set for hearing on </span><st1:date month="12" day="17" year="1962"><span style="">December 17, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
petition, </span><span style="">filed </span><span style="">by the defendants in
said cases Nos. 103384 to 103387, which was joined by the defendants in cases
Nos. 104595 to 104596 - all of them hereinafter referred to collectively as <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span> – for </span><span style="">the reconsideration of </span>said order of
December 3, 1962, was denied in an order of Judge <span class="SpellE">Cornejo</span>,
dated December 22, 1962, which, moreover, reset the <span style="">six </span>(6) cases for hearing on Jan­uary
8, 1963.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Soon later, or on January
15, 1963, the <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span> filed their respective
answers in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases, alleging <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that their <span class="SpellE">sublessor</span>
is <span class="SpellE">Valleson</span>, not <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span>,
that said cases raise the very same </span><span style="">issues involved </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">CFI Case No. 51476, and that, for this
reason, <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> "does not have any right"
against them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span> set up a counterclaim for expenses of
litigation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Then, or on or about January 22, 1963, the <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span>
commenced CFI Case No. 52866 against Judge <span class="SpellE">Cornejo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span>, to restrain the former from "further
proceedings" in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases, and to
annul the "proceedings already had therein", upon the ground that
said Judge had acted without jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion in
taking cogni­zance of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases and setting
them for hearing, despite the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of CFI Case
No. 51476.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date month="1" day="26" year="1963">January 26, 1963</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span>
filed, in said CFI Case No. 52866, an "urgent motion for a writ of
preliminary injunction" or a "simple res­training order, directing <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Cornejo</span> to desist, during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>"
of said case, "from hearing and/or taking any further proceedings" in
the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By an order, dated <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="1">January 31,
 1963</st1:date>, Judge <span class="SpellE">Lantin</span> authorized the
issuance of said writ of preliminary injunction, upon the filing of a bond in
the sum of P5,000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said writ was,
accordingly, issued on <st1:date month="2" day="1" year="1968">February 1, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereupon, <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> instituted the present
action, against Judge <span class="SpellE">Lantin</span> and the <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span>, to annul <span style="">said order of </span><st1:date month="1" day="31" year="1963"><span style="">January </span>31, 1963</st1:date>, and
suspend the enforcement thereof, during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the filing of the
petition here­in, we issued a writ of preliminary injunction restraining Judge <span class="SpellE">Lantin</span> from enforcing his aforementioned order of <st1:date month="1" day="31" year="1963">Jan­uary 31, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On motion of respondents herein and upon the
filing of the corresponding counter-bond, said writ of prelimi­nary injunction
was, however, dissolved on <st1:date month="7" day="8" year="1963">July 8, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The issue in this case is
whether or not Judge <span class="SpellE">Lantin</span> had acted with grave
abuse of discretion amounting to excess of jurisdiction in issuing, in CFI Case
No. 52866, his order of </span>January 31, 1963, authorizing the issuance of a
writ of preli­minary injunction restraining <span style="">Judge <span class="SpellE">Cornejo</span> from hearing and </span>taking
further proceedings in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer is in the affirmative.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 3 of Rule 58 of the Rules of Court provides:</p>

<blockquote>" <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><u>Grounds
for issuance of preliminary injunction</u>. - A preliminary injunction may be
granted at any time after the commencement of the action and before judgment
when it is esta­blished:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(a) That the plaintiff is entitled to the re­lief demanded,
and the whole or part of such re­lief consists in restraining the commission or
continuance of the acts complained of, or in the performance of an act or acts,
either for a limited period or perpetually;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b) That the commission or continuance of some act complained
of during the litigation or the non-performance thereof would probably work injustice
to the plaintiff; or</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(c) That the defendant is doing, threatens, or is about to
do, or is procuring or suffering to be done, some act probably in violation of
the plaintiff's rights respecting the subject of the action, and tending to
render the judgment in­effectual."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, one of the prerequisites for the possession of authority to
grant a writ of preliminary injunction, is that "the plaintiff is entitled
to the relief demanded." The relief sought in CFI Case No. 52866 was a
"writ <span style="">of </span>certiorari and/or
prohibition" ordering Judge <span class="SpellE">Cornejo</span> "to
desist from further proceedings" in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
cases "and declaring null and void proceedings already taken
therein." The petition for such relief was premised upon the allegation
that Judge <span class="SpellE">Cornejo</span> had "acted without
jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion in taking cognizance <span style="">of </span>the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
cases and in setting them for hearing on the merits," because:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) "in his answer in Civil Case No.
51476 <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> had already set forth his counterclaim for
rentals"; and (b) the "<span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases
should be held in abeyance until the resolution of the question x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" raised in CFI Case No.
51476, which is said to be "prejudicial".</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, it should be noted that CFI Case No. 52866 is
one for certiorari and/or prohibition; that either writ must be denied unless
respondent judge has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>;
and that Cases Nos. 103384 to 103387 and 104595 to 104596 are admittedly
unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> cases, which are <u>within</u> the <u>exclusive</u>
original jurisdiction of the muni­cipal court<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the <span style="">latte</span>r had the <u>authority</u> and the <u>duty</u> to hear and
decide said cases, and <u>no other</u> court could do <span style="">so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span> argue that the issues
therein are, also, raised in CFI Case No. 51476, which was filed before the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases, and that a determination of the issue in
CFI Case No. 51476 is a "prejudicial'' question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This pretense is untenable, both as to its
premise and as to the conclusion drawn <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed:</p>

<p class="NUM">(1) The parties in CFI Case No. 51476 are <span class="SpellE">Valleson</span>,
on the one hand, and <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> and <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Guison</span></span><span style="">, on </span>the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span> are <u>not</u> parties therein, in much the same
way as <span class="SpellE">Valleson</span> is <u>not</u> a party in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases.</p>

<p class="NUM">(2) The issue in CFI Case No. 51476 is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To whom did <span class="SpellE">Guison</span>
lease the <st1:place><st1:placename>Angela</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Building</st1:placename></st1:place>
under the first contract of <u>lease</u>, to <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> or
to <span class="SpellE">Valleson</span>?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The issue in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>who <u>subleased</u> portions of said
building to the <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span> - was it <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> or <span class="SpellE">Valleson</span>?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Guison</span> is
absolutely <u>alien</u> to this issue.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>CFI Case No. 51476 deals with the <u><span style="">lease</span></u><span style="">, </span>whereas
the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases are concerned with the <u>subleases</u>.</p>

<p class="NUM">(3) Not being parties in CFI Case No. 51476, whatever may be the
decision therein rendered would <u>not</u> bind the <span class="SpellE">sublesees</span>.</p>

<p class="NUM">(4) The right of Sibal to eject the sublessees does not de­pend
necessarily upon his being <span class="SpellE">Guison's</span> lessee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even a usurper - as regards the owner of land
- may seek the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of those who, having
obtained possession thereof by agreement with the former, refuse to surrender
it to him, after the expiration of the term of said agreement.</p>

<p class="NUM">(5) The defense set up by the <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span>
in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases impugns <span class="SpellE">Sibal's</span>
<u>cause of action</u>, and does not affect the <u>jurisdiction</u> of the
municipal court to hear and decide said cases.</p>

<p class="NUM">(6) The term of the first contract of <span style="">lease </span>has admittedly expired, so that, even if <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span>
had made it on behalf of <span class="SpellE">Valleson</span> - which is denied
by <u>and</u> <span class="SpellE">Guidon</span> - <span class="SpellE">Valleson's</span>
alleged right of lease had already been extinguished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not true that said con­tract gave the
lessee the right to renew it under the same terms and conditions stipulated
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contract provided that it
was "to be renewed <u>only</u> upon agreement of <u>both</u>
parties," which means that the lessee could not renew the contract without
the <span class="SpellE">lessor's</span> consent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The record further shows that <span class="SpellE">Valleson</span> and <span class="SpellE">Guison</span> could not agree on said renewal, and that,
accordingly, <span class="SpellE">Guison</span> executed the second contract of
lease in favor of <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span>.</p>

<p class="NUM">(7) The first and the second contracts of lease appear, on the
face thereof, to have been made by <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span>, in <u>his
own</u> behalf, <u>not</u> in representation of another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This circumstance is bolstered up by two (2)
facts, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Guison</span></span><span style="">, </span>the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, confirms it; and (b) the
first contract was made on <st1:date month="9" day="4" year="1955">September 4,
 1955</st1:date>, or <span class="SpellE"><u>coetaneously</u></span> with the
"Contract of Transfer of <span style="">Management",
</span>between <span class="SpellE">Valleson</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Guison</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, <u>the acts performed by the parties at the time of the execution
of said contract of transfer of management bolster up the position </u><u><span style="">taken by <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> </span>and
<span class="SpellE">Guison</span> in CFI Cases Nos. 51476 and 52866</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, the records of both show that <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Guison</span> are <u>prima
facie</u> right, so that, if <span style="">any </span>abuse
of discretion was committed, it was <u>not</u> by Judge <span class="SpellE">Cornejo</span>,
in setting the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases for hearing, but by <u>Judge
<span class="SpellE">Lantin</span></u>, in issuing his order of January 31, 1963,
<span style="">authorizing </span>the
issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction to restrain Judge <span class="SpellE">Cornejo</span> from proceeding With the hearing and determination
of <span style="">said </span><span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as Judge <span class="SpellE">Cornejo</span> had, not only
authority to hear and decide the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases,
but, also, <u>exclusive</u> jurisdiction <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
and there had been no abuse of discretion on his part, in setting those cases
