				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>This is a petition for certiorari to review and set aside two orders of the 
Court of First Instance of Manila in Special Proceedings No. 43516 entitled 
"Testate Estate of Cecilia Bautista Limlingan", Hon. Antonio Cañizares, 
presiding. The first order is dated February 1, 1962 and declares the testate 
proceedings closed "it appearing that the estate and inheritance taxes have 
already been paid". The second order, dated April 26, 1962, denies a motion to 
reconsider the order for the closing of the proceeding, on the ground that an 
heir is still liable for taxes even after distribution. </p>
<p>On March 7, 1962, about a month after the final; order declaring the 
proceedings closed, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, petitioner herein, 
filed a "Manifestation and Motion" in the proceeding to the effect that the 
amounts of estate and inheritance taxes appearing in the receipts to have been 
paid represent only a portion of the taxes due, that the taxes due are still 
being verified and suggested that the proper amounts of the estate and 
inheritance taxes be first determined, assessed and collected before the 
proceeding can be closed. This manifestation and motion was denied in the second 
order of the court already alluded to, which order denied there consideration of 
the closing of the case. </p>
<p>On May 29, 1962 the Solicitor General, in representation of the Collector of 
Internal Revenue, moved to reconsider the order of closing, citing the 
provisions of Section 103 of the National Internal Revenue Code and Rule 91, 
Sec. 1 of the Rules of Court. These provisions are as follows:- </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 103. <em>Payment before delivery by executor or administrator</em>. - 
No judge shall authorize the executor or judicial administrator to deliver a 
distributive share to any party interested in the estate unless it shall appear 
that the estate tax has been paid." (Nationa1 Internal Revenue Code).</p>
<p>"SEC. 1. <em>When order for distribution of residue made. Testimony taken on 
controversy preserved.</em> -"When the debts, funeral charges and expenses of 
administration, the allowances to the widow, and inheritance tax, if any, 
chargeable to the estate in accordance with law, have been paid, the court, on 
the application of the executor or administrator, or of a person interested in 
the estate, and after hearing upon notice, shall assign the residue of the 
estate to the persons entitled to the same, naming them and the proportions, or 
parts, to which each is entitled, a net such persons may demand and recover 
their respective shares from the executor or administrator., or any other person 
having the same in his possession. If there is a controversy before the court as 
to who are the lawful heirs of the deceased person or as to the distributive 
share to which each person is entitled under the law, the testimony as to such 
controversy shall be taken in writing by the judge, under oath.</p>
<p>"No distribution shall be allowed until the payment of the obligations 
above-mentioned has been made or provided for, unless the distributees, or any 
of them, give a bond, in a sum to be fixed by the court, conditioned for the 
payment of said obligations within such time as the court directs." (Rule 91, 
Rules of Court). </p></blockquote>
<p>In respondents answer it is alleged that the order of December 29, 1961 had 
the effect of closing the proceedings; that when the motions for reconsideration 
were presented on March 6 and 7, the estate had already been distributed and so 
the court no longer had Jurisdiction of the case. </p>
<p>We find no merit in these objections to the petition. The order closing the 
proceedings is dated February 1, 1962 and the motion to reconsider it was filed 
on March 7, 1962. Considering that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue had no 
knowledge of the proceedings except the payment of the taxes and had had no time 
to check the correctness of the amounts paid, We should consider the motion of 
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue as a motion for reconsideration under Rule 
38 of the Rules of Court and, therefore, presentable within 60 days of the order 
sought to be suspended. </p>
<p>In view of the provisions of Rule 91 Sec. 1, of the Rules of Court and Sec. 
103 of the National Internal Revenue Code,, We hold, that the court erred and 
committed an abuse of discretion in denying the motion for reconsideration of 
its order closing the proceedings. </p>
<p>Wherefore, the orders sought to "be reviewed are hereby set aside, and the 
court below is directed to proceed as herein indicated. </p>
<p>So ordered. </p>
<p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Paredes, 
Dizon</em> and <em>Makalintal. JJ.,</em> concur. </p>
