<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1963</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Juliano</span> - herein­after

- herein­after referred to as <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> - in the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due time the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>
filed an answer to the protest and a counter-protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The protestant in his protest, and the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> in his counter-protest, as the case may be,
alleged commis­sion of frauds, coercions and irregularities that were committed
in specified precincts in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> and each had impugned the
validity of specified ballots that were cast in favor of each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After appro­priate proceedings pursuant to
law, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, on <st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="2">February 5, 1966</st1:date>, rendered a decision
declaring the protestant winner over <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> by a
margin of 283 votes.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> appealed from the
decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>
to the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a decision
rendered on <st1:date year="1966" day="19" month="12">December 19, 1966</st1:date>,
the Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the lower court and declared the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> winner over the protestant by a margin of 17
votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon a motion for reconsideration
filed by the protestant, the Court of Appeals, on <st1:date year="1967" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1967</st1:date>, promulgated a resolution maintaining its
decision which declared the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> the winner, but
reducing the winning margin from 17 to 13 votes.</p>

<p class="BODY">In due time, the protestant filed before this Court a petition
for certiorari by way of an appeal from the decision of the Court of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court gave due course to
protestant's petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his petition for certiorari the protestant has assigned six
errors which, he alleges, had been com­mitted by the Court of Appeals in
deciding the case against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We shall
proceed to dwell on those al­leged errors in the order that the protestant has
in­dicated them.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. In the first error assigned by the protestant, he points to 48
groups of ballots, all cast for the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>, and he
contends that each group of these 48 groups of ballots had been prepared by
only one per­son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The protestant
maintains that the Court of Ap­peals erred in not holding that each of these 48
groups of ballots had been prepared, or written on, by only one person.</p>

<p class="BODY">These 48 groups of ballots, <span class="SpellE">totalling</span>
274, are accordingly marked as exhibits for the protestant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The number of ballots in each group varies -
depending on how many ballots are considered as prepared by one per­son
only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the purposes of this decision,
however, We do not consider it necessary to mention the exhibit marks of the
ballots as grouped.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>
declared these 274 ballots invalid, precisely upon the ground that each group,
of the 48 groups into which those 274 ballots had been separated, had been
prepared by only one person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In ruling
on these 274 ballots the Judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> relied on his personal examination of the ballots
and on the testimony of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Lastimosa</span> who is the hand­writing expert that was presented
as a witness by the protestant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside
from the testimony of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Lastimosa</span>
that each of these 48 groups of ballots had been prepared by only one person,
the record does not show that the protestant had presented evidence which would
show how it could have happened that each of these 48 groups of ballots in
question had been prepared by only one person.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> had pre­sented
numerous witnesses to prove that the elections in the precincts where those
questioned ballots were cast had been orderly and regular.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have carefully examined these groups of bal­lots in question,
and also the record of this case, and We find that the Court of Appeals did not
err when it held that each of these 48 groups of ballots had not been written
on, or prepared, by one person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree
with the following observations and conclusions of the Court of Appeals:</p>

<blockquote>"CONSIDERING:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the
sole, absolutely, the only proof, submitted by protestant to the effect that
the different sets of bal­lots mentioned a few pages back, had been prepared by
the same hands in said Pre­cincts 39, 41, 43, 49, 50, 53, and 54, is the
testimony of his questioned docu­ments examiner, in private practice, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Lastimosa</span>, the gist of
whose testimony is that he had examined the bal­lots aforementioned and
concluded from the fact that the writings in said sets alleged­ly evinced the
same individual characteris­tics line quality, speed, and design, that they had
been respectively written by the same hand; stated otherwise, on the sole basis
of this opinion evidence the trial judge took the responsibility of outlawing
two hundred seventy four (274) ballots;</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"CONSIDERING:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That to
all the foregoing is one detail that this Court has in this appeal further
found out in the exam­ination of the record, which is that not only that
protestant had failed to present one single witness, either one of his watch­ers
or any other spectator, who could have declared if not to actual, at least to
sus­picious manipulations in the precincts here­in involved, any one of them,
Precincts 39, 43, 50, 53, and 54, that might indicate that indeed there had
been such allegedly flagrant violation of the exercise of suf­frage by the
preparation, wholesale, of ballots by one person alone,- which must have been
visible if truly committed, not only this, but on the contrary, it was <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> who was able to present the electoral offi­cials
themselves, representatives of the Com­mission on Elections mainly, presumed to
be impartial for they were public school teach­ers on the whole, and inspectors
of the other opposing party, the rest,- and trial Court throughout, all
throughout its decision, failed to state why it should not have be­lieved them
and should have chosen to dis­card their versions as to the regularity of the
elections in said precincts;</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"CONSIDERING:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That with
the conflict of evidence thus presented on the question­ed ballots in these
Precincts 39, 43, 49, 50, 53, and 54, involved in Errors 10, 18, 21, 24, 26 and
29, it must be seen that against the foregoing testimonies of elect­ion
officials, public school teachers as well as of inspectors not of the party of <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>, that there had not been committed any anomaly in
the elections in said precincts, officials who had nothing to gain with the
victory of <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>, who have not been shown to have
owed him a debt to repay by permitting themselves to become instruments of
fraud and deceit; if it be said that they would have had the natural instinct
of self-preservation to declare that their actuations had been clean, let it be
remembered that they are not under any indictment at all, nor the slightest com­plaint
been lodged against them for the re­cord is absolutely silent as to that,
indeed, and peculiarly enough, even trial judge has not given any reason at all
in his decision why they should not be believed;- and against these public
school teachers and election officials, there is pitted the sole and only
opinion evidence consisting in the conclusions of protestant's documents
examiner, seeking to establish that flagrant violations of the law had been
there perpe­trated, which conclusions could have been incorrect as explained so
many pages back; in such a conflict of proofs, where the ballots themselves can
not speak but on their face, regular and correct, attest to the will of the
particular registered and qualified voters of the City of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>,
in the barrios of <span class="SpellE">Kalanganan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tamontaka</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Pagalamotan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tiogon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tubiran</span>, if there be any doubt as to who had declared to
the truth, it better be re­membered that if frauds, in the dimensions declared
by the documents examiner, had been perpetrated, the public school teachers,
Chairmen of the various Board of Inspectors, could not but have noticed, and
noticing, could not have permitted them to have passed <span class="SpellE">unprotested</span>,
if not the public school teachers, the PC who were also there, watching to see
to it that the elections be clean, if not the PC, the watchers, of which
protestant himself had his own; but not one of these no­ticed, or protested;
the record is elo­quently silent that protestant had ever denounced the
commission of any anomaly during the election day in said pre­cincts; x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> it was <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>
who took the initiative of presenting abundant proof to attest to the
regularity of the elections but protestant did not care to counteract in
rebuttal, if there be any doubt in the approximation of the truth, such doubt
should be resolved to validate the votes; because the rules of burden and
preponderance of proof so dictate, and where Courts of Justice must have to
choose between giving effect to a ballot re­gular on its face, or throwing it
aside on less than plainly satisfactory evi­dence, the law, public policy, and
simple justice should dictate its acceptance, otherwise, electoral protests,
instead of attaining, the purity of elections might produce exactly the
contrary result and sub­vert the will of the electorate; Errors 10, 18, 21, 24,
26, and 29 must have to be as they are hereby sustained, so that to the
previous total of <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> of 3,667 votes should be
added another two hundred seventy four (274) making a grand total of 3,941
votes in his favor, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the findings and the ruling of the Court of Appeals,
regarding these 48 groups of ballots, relate to questions of fact which this
Court will not disturb.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a settled
rule in election cases ap­pealed to this Court that the findings of facts of
the Court of Appeals with regard to the evidence <span class="SpellE"><u>aliunde</u></span>
submitted by the parties are no longer open for review, the function of this
Court being limited to determining if the appreciation of the ballots by the
Court of Appeals apart from the evidence was made in accordance with law and
the rulings of this Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2. In the second error assigned by the protest­ant, in his appeal
before this Court, he alleges that the Court of Appeals erred in refusing to
consider and rule that 40 ballots, cast in favor of the protestant, are not
marked ballots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The protestant maintains
that the Court of Appeals should have declared these 40 bal­lots valid and
should have counted them in his (pro­testant's) favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These 40 ballots are marked as Exhibits 9-M,
9-DD, 9-LLL, 10-KKKKKK, 10-MMMMM, 12-AAA, 13-BBBB, 14-R, 14-QQQ, 15-FFF, 16-JJ,
19-EE, 19-A, 19-HHHH, 21-DDD, 23-QQQ, 23-Y, 23-RRRR, 24-N, 24-YY, 24-MMMM,
25-V, 26-P, 26-SSS, 26-III, 27-XXXX, 29-Z, 29-VVV, 30-N, 31-BBB, 33-D, 33-TT,
37-G, 37-HH, 37-QQQQ, 37-TTTTT, 39-­Q, 10-KK, 22-GGGGG, and 13-FFFF.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon a careful examination of the record We have noted that 8 of
the 40 ballots mentioned in the pre­ceding paragraph, namely, those that are
marked as Ex­hibits 10-MMMMM, 13-BBBB, 14-QQQ, 16-JJ, 19-P, 23-Y, 26-P, and
37-QQQQ, are included among the ballots which the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>
mentioned in some of the errors he as­signed in his appeal to the Court of
Appeals (Errors 44, 51, 52, 54, 62, 69, 72, and 97, listed on pages 9, 10, 11,
12, 13, and 17 of <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>-appellant's brief; and
are discussed on pages 52, 54, 55, 58, 61, 62, and 71 in the same brief; See
also pages 13, 14, 15, 23 and 27 of the decision of the Court of Appeals which
are respectively marked as pages 44, 45, 46, 54 and 58 of the record, or <span class="SpellE">rollo</span>, of this case).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We have noted that all these 8 ballots had been rejected by the Court
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> (Pages 543, 629, 653, 693,
781, 940, 1041 and 1334 of the printed decision of the lower court).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are surprised that while the lower court
had rejected these 8 ballots the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> had included
these same 8 ballots in the errors he assigned in his appeal to the Court of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These 8 bal­lots are included
in the groups of ballots which, the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>
alleges, were erroneously ruled by the lower court as "valid votes for <span class="SpellE">Juliano</span>" (Errors Nos. 44, 51, 52, 54, 62, 69, 72, and
97, respectively).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, sur­prisingly,
the Court of Appeals had not taken note of this error or inconsistency on the
part of the <span class="SpellE">pro­testee</span>, except as regards the ballot
marked as Exhibit 23-Y.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of
Appeals declared this ballot (Exhi­bit 23-Y) invalid, thus affirming the ruling
of the lower court (p. 23, CA decision; p. 54 <span class="SpellE">rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How­ever, as regards the other 7 ballots, it
can be ga­thered from the decision that the Court of Appeals had considered
them valid ballots for the protestant (pages 13, 14, 15, and 27, CA decision;
pp. 44, 45, 46 and 58, <span class="SpellE">rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But we have noted also that while the lower
court had rejected these 7 ballots and deducted them from the votes of the
protestant, the Court of Appeals did not credit the protestant with 7 votes
correspond­ing to these 7 ballots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court of Appeals should have counted these 7 ballots as 7 more votes for the
protestant.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have stated that there are 40 ballots which are the subject of
the second error assigned by the protestant in his appeal before this
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These 40 ballots were claimed by
the protestant before the Court of Appeals as valid ballots for him -- 37 in
the mo­tion for reconsideration of the decision, and 3 were added as
"additional claims" while the motion for re­consideration was pending
action by the Court of Ap­peals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court of Appeals, in resolving the motion for reconsideration, refused to rule
on the claim of the protestant that these 40 ballots are valid bal­lots for
him, for the reason "that not one of any of these ballots was claimed by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> (protestant) when he filed his brief x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> nor in all of his posterior
pleadings x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> instead he
therein made evi­dent his determination to have the case submitted on the basis
of the specific ballots he had previously claimed in his brief."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The stand of the Court of Ap­peals in refusing to consider the claim of the pro­testant
on these 40 ballots is that if this method of introducing entirely new claims
were to be permitted in motions for reconsideration after the decision had been
rendered in an appeal the court will have to examine more ballots and the
losing party in the case can always claim on and on afterwards more ballots and
the inevitable result would be that the case would never end, and there would
be confusion and disorder in the disposition of the appeal, and this would be
contrary to public policy which looks to the prompt and orderly disposition of
election protest.</p>

<p class="BODY">We believe that the Court of Appeals erred when it refused to
consider and rule on these 40 ballots in a motion for reconsideration that was
timely filed by the protestant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we
have adverted to, 8 of these 40 ballots were included in some of the errors
assigned by the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>, and the protestant claimed
them in his appeal brief in the Court of Appeals (pp. 15, 17, 18, 21, 23, 24,
and 33, protestant-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> brief).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As regards the remaining 32 ballots, it is
true that the protestant had not claimed them in his brief, but when the
protestant claimed those 32 ballots in his motion for reconsideration the
protestant had thereby brought those 32 ballots squarely before the Court of
Appeals, and said court should have examined those bal­lots and rule on the
claim of the protestant that those are valid ballots for him which were
erroneously re­jected by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The circumstance that the claim on those 32 ballots was made in a motion
for re­consideration should not deter the court from examining, and ruling on,
those ballots.</p>

<p class="BODY">Well settled is the doctrine that election con­tests involve
public interest, and technicalities and procedural barriers should not be
allowed to stand if they constitute an obstacle to the determination of the
true will of the electorate in the choice of their elective officials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And also settled is the rule that laws
governing election contests must be liberally construed to the end that the
will of the people in the choice of public officials may not be defeated by
mere technical objections.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
In an election case the court has an imperative duty to ascertain by all means
within its command who is the real candidate elected by the electorate.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
An appeal in an election contest shall proceed as in a criminal case and the
appellate court may take notice of every error in fact or in law committed by
the lower court.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In consonance with the doctrines and rulings recited in the
preceding paragraph, this Court in the case of <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>
v. De Leon, G. R. No. L-20245, <st1:date year="1963" day="3" month="9">Septem­ber
 3, 1963</st1:date>, ruled as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"It is true that this Court has stated in some cases that in
appeals in election protests it is necessary that the party ap­pealing should
make an assignment of error in which he should point out the error or errors
imputed to the trial court in the re­vision of ballots in different precincts
in view of the numerous number of ballots in­volved in a protest and that if
such assignment is not made or the error is not pointed out, the appellate
court may refuse to exam­ine or consider the same in the appeal, but <u>that
ruling was laid down merely as a guide for a party or his counsel in an
election case in view of the numerous ballots involved<span style="">&nbsp; </span>because otherwise the court may not know what
particular ballot an appeal refers to</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>But that ruling cannot be so interpreted as to deprive an appellate
court of the right given<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to it by law to
examine any ballot even <span class="SpellE">motu</span> <span class="SpellE">proprio</span></u>
if that is necessary to arrive at a correct decision (Section 175, Revised
Elect­ion Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is for this reason
that an appeal in an election case is likened to an appeal in a criminal case
where the case is deemed tried <u>de</u> <u>novo</u> (Section 178, Revised
Election Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The philosophy behind
this ruling is that the real purpose of an elect­ion case is to ascertain what
is the true will of the people or who is the one duly elected and this can only
be achieved by throwing wide open the appeal before the court."

that Monsanto did not appeal from the decision of the court of first instance,

</span>We hold that the action of the Court of Appeals in reversing the action
of the lower court on the 22 ballots and in counting them in favor of <span class="SpellE">protestee-appellee</span> is in accord with the provisions of
Section 178 of the Revised Election Code which considers an election protest

<p class="BODY">It can be gathered from a reading of the fore­going rulings of
this Court that the decisive circum­stance that makes it mandatory for the
court to consider, and rule on, a ballot is that the ballot is <u>be</u>­<u>fore
the court</u> and it is claimed or impugned by a party in the election contest
-- be it in the trial court or in the appellate court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court can not, and it must not, close its
eyes to the realities as presented by the ballots <u>before</u> <u>it</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention that to allow a party to claim
or impugn ballots for the first time in a motion for reconsideration of a
decision in the appellate court is to sanction confusion and delay in the
disposal of election cases is of no moment as long as the claim on the ballots
is presented before the decision has become final and the ballots thus claimed
would be decisive in determining the real winner in the elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that the purpose of elect­ion
contests is to determine the true will of the elect­orate, the court should
examine every ballot presented before it and rule whether the ballot or ballots
is/are valid or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the court to
refuse to consider bal­lots brought before it simply because a party has not
complied with certain procedural or technical require­ments, would be to
disregard the public interest that is involved in the election case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, it is for the court to determine
if the belated claim or ob­jection on certain ballots before it is frivolous,
done in bad faith, and only for the purpose of delay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case now before Us, the motion for
reconsidera­tion, where the 40 ballots in question were claimed by the
protestant, was filed on January 7, 1967 and it was not until March 30, 1967
when the Court of Appeals re­solved to deny the motion for reconsideration --
only to declare that the 40 ballots can not be considered because they were
claimed for the first time by the protestant in the motion for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The re­solution of the
Court of Appeals denying the motion for reconsideration does not make even a
hint that the claim on these 40 ballots by the protestant was done for the
purpose of delay, or that the claim is frivolous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The policy which looks to the prompt disposal
of election contests should not be made to prevail over the public interest which
demands that the true will of the electorate must be ascertained by the courts
by all means within their command.</p>

<p class="BODY">The 40 ballots in question are properly identified, they have
been passed upon by the lower court, and they were squarely <u>presented and
claimed before</u> the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp;

considered and ruled upon by the Court of Appeals, and these ballots are now <u>before</u>

written and followed by a mark "X" written in lead pencil.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find that the word "<span class="SpellE">Mañara</span>" is the surname of one of the candidates for

close examination of this ballot we are persuaded that the mark "X"
on this ballot could not have been written by the voter who prepared this
ballot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently the mark "X"
was placed by some other person to indicate that the writing of the name <span class="SpellE">Mañara</span> in the space for senator was not correct because <span class="SpellE">Mañara</span> was a candidate for councilor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the names in this ballot are written in <span class="SpellE">crayola</span> and it is improbable that the voter who prepared

<p class="BODY">The lower court declared this ballot marked for the reason that

word "<span class="SpellE">Ganzo</span>" that was crossed out and the word
"Lim" there is an "X".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon a close examination of this ballot, We find that the "X"
is written heavily, in contrast to the light way that the names on this ballot
are written.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our conclusion is that this
"X" was not placed by the voter who prepared this ballot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently, this "X" was placed by
some other person, not the voter who prepared this ballot, to indicate that
"Lim" was voted for the second time for senator, because the word
"Lim" also appears on the fourth line for senator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is ano­ther case where a mark placed on
the ballot by a per­son other than the voter who prepared the ballot does not

from the way the names on this ballot are written that the voter is a poor

what happened is that the voter first attempted to write the word "<span class="SpellE">Jalanol</span>" at the upper part of the space for mayor, and
feeling that he had not written the name of his candidate correct­ly he tried
to write again and succeeded in writing the word which may be read "<span class="SpellE">Jalana</span>" in a very poor way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So he attempted to write again, and finally
he wrote the word that may be read "<span class="SpellE">Julaano</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The intention of the voter to vote for

big capital letters, while the names of the candidates voted for senators are
written in ordinary script.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The use of
these two forms of writ­ing in the ballot, in the absence of evidence that this

</span>The lower court declared this ballot marked because the names of the
candidates voted for therein are written in block capital letters, and that
some of the names are written in blue <span class="SpellE">crayola</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From what appears on the face of this ballot
it is easy to conclude that the voter used an ordinary pencil in writing the
names of the candidates from the first line for senator down to the line for
vice mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in writing the name
"CARAG", which is the name voted for vice mayor, the voter could use
his pencil only up to the letter "A" when he wrote the surname
"CARAG" and then the lead of his pencil must have broken, or must
have been used up, and so he had to use a blue pencil in writing the letter
"g" to complete the name "CARAG".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had to use that same blue pencil in
writing the names of "<span class="SpellE">Bueno</span>" and "<span class="SpellE">Rabago</span>" who were the only two candidates for councilor
whom he voted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The use of blue pencil in
writing on the ballot does not invalid­ate the ballot, in the absence of
evidence to show that this was done in order to identify the ballot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither does the use of block letter form of
writing invalidate the ballot in the absence of evidence that that form of
writing was deliberately resorted to in order to identify the ballot (Rules 10
and 18, Sec. 149, Revised Election Code).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Inasmuch as the word "<span class="SpellE">Julino</span>" is
clearly written in the space for mayor, which is <u>idem</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>sonans</u></span> to the name <span class="SpellE">Juliano</span>,
this ballot is a valid one for the protestant.</p>

that in the space for mayor a word which apparently was a name of a candidate
was crossed out by the voter in such a way that that word first written cannot
be deciphered at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the voter
wrote the word "<span class="SpellE">Juliano</span>" in the same
space.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently what happened here is
that the voter had changed his mind so he crossed out heavily the first name
that he had written and wrote the name of the protestant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a good ballot for the pro­testant

candidate for senator and he wanted to emphasize his vote for this particular
can­didate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no evidence that
the writing of the name <span class="SpellE">Climaco</span> on this ballot in ink

however, that while the lower court had deducted this ballot from the votes of
the protestant, the Court of Appeals did not credit this ballot as one more
vote for the protestant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court declared this ballot marked for the reason that
on the eighth space for senator the voter wrote a so-called glaring mark before
writing the name "Peralta".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lower court consider this "unnecessary blotting in the face of
the ballot" as a distinguishing mark.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon Our examination of this ballot We find that what really happened
was that the voter had written a name on the eighth line for sena­tor and then
he crossed it out in such a way that what he had written could not be
discerned, and then wrote the name "Peralta".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We consider this simply as a change of mind
on the part of the voter, such that he crossed out the name that he had already
written and then wrote another name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
situation in this ballot is similar to that of Exhibit 24-MMMM (see above)

not write well the name of the candidate that he wanted to vote for, and so he
simply crossed the letters that he had already written.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judging from the way the names are written on
this ballot it is very apparent that the voter is a very poor writer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact he was able to write only four names

<p class="BODY"><u>Exhibit 26-IIII</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;

Padilla, <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span>, on

the words "Straight Liberal Party"; and that in the space for

Government".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not consider
that the writing of the words "Straight Liberal Party" and "Straight
Citizens League for Good Govern­ment" constitutes distinguishing marks as
would in­validate this ballot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Apparently, when the voter wrote the word "Straight Liberal
Party" he meant to emphasize that he was voting for all the candidates of
the Liberal Party, as in fact he did, because the record shows that in the
elections of November 12, 1963 the candidates of the Liberal Party for senator
were <span class="SpellE">Balao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Climaco</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span>, De la Rosa, <span class="SpellE">Liwag</span>,
Padilla, <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, when the voter wrote the words
"Straight Citizens League for Good Government" across the lines for
councilor he meant to emphasize that he was voting for the candidates of the
"Citizens League for Good Government." The record shows that the
protestant <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Juliano</span>
was the candidate for Mayor of the "Citizens League for Good
Government" of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> City, and he had a

vice-mayor, and on lines five, six, seven and eight for councilors the voter
placed heavy pencil shadings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower
court con­sidered these pencil shadings as identification marks on this
ballot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon our examination of this
ballot We find that the pencil shadings are found on the lines where no names

shadings are light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We consider these
pencil shadings as an indication on the part of the voter that he was not
voting for any other candidate aside from those whose names he had already
written on the ballot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These pencil
shadings are similar to the circles, crosses or lines put on the spaces on which

the first and second lines for senators and then drew a crooked (snake-like)
line from line 3 down to line 6 for senators, and on the seventh and eighth
lines for councilors the voter also drew the same crooked line.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We consider the writing of this crooked line
from lines 3 to 8 for senators as an in­dication on the part of the voter to
desist from vot­ing for other candidates for senator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, when the voter wrote a similar line
from lines 7 to 8 on the lines for councilors he indicated his desistance from
voting for other candidates for councilor.<span style="">&nbsp;

ballot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have closely examined this
ballot and We have noted that the first word "<span class="SpellE">Juliano</span>"

the way he wrote the first "<span class="SpellE">Juliano</span>" and so
he wrote again the same word in a clearer way.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Judging from the way the names are written on this ballot, it is very
apparent that the voter is a poor writer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The writing of the name of a candidate twice on the same line on the

third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh lines for councilors the voter wrote
many crosses which identify the ballot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon Our examination of this ballot we find that what the voter did on
lines 3 and 4 for councilors was to cross out the names that he wrote and again
wrote names of can­didates that he voted for on the same lines; while on line
six the voter crossed out the name "E. <span class="SpellE">Tanghal</span>",
presumably because the same name is also written on the seventh line for
councilor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no crossing out of
any word on line five.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crossing out
by the voter of the names he had written is a permissible act when he wants to correct
himself (Rule 4, Sec. 149, Revised Election Code; <span class="SpellE">Villavert</span>

straight ones (wavy lines).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower

very apparent to Us that these horizontal lines were placed by the voter simply
to indicate his desistance from voting for other candidates for senator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same way that We have declared valid

very heavy crosses on the names of the councilors . . . . on the same lines the
voter tried to write the names of the senators" (p. 1240, printed de­cision
of the lower court).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears to Us
that the lower court itself has given the reason why this ballot should not be
considered invalid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, what the
voter did on this ballot was simply to cross out the names of the persons who
were candidates for councilor, which he had written on the lines for
senator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In­asmuch as the protestant is
properly voted for mayor in this ballot, this ballot should be counted valid
for the protestant (Rule 4, Sec. 149, Revised Election Code; <span class="SpellE">Villavert</span> v. Lim, <u>supra</u>).<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Exhibit 37-G</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court of Appeals did not rule on this ballot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lower court declared this ballot marked because from the second to
the eighth line for senators the voter placed two "x" marks apart

eighth line for councilors the voter placed three "x" marks apart
from each other (x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We consider the placing of these
"x" marks simply as an indication on the part of the voter that he
was desisting from voting for other candidates.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the same way that We declared valid the ballots, Exhibits 27-XXXX,

the latter words were stricken out leaving only 'Dondoy Juliano', in the

what appears in the space for mayor is that the voter had written a name and

21-MM and 10-HHHHH - were claimed for the first time by the pro­testant in his
motion for reconsideration in the Court of Appeals, while the other ballot,
Exhibit 35-P, had previously been passed upon by the Court of Appeals because
that was included in the 92nd error assigned by the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>
in his appeal before the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because these three ballots are before Us now, for the same reason that
We have ruled on the forty ballots mentioned in the second error assigned by

<p class="BODY"><u>Exhibit 21-MM</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court of Appeals did not rule on this ballot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lower court declared that what is written in the space for mayor on
this ballot is illegible and does not sufficiently identify the candidate voted
for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have examined this ballot very

mayor in this bal­lot was not sufficient to identify the person voted for (p.
26 CA decision; p. 57 <span class="SpellE">rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find that what appears written in the

four ballots, marked as Exhibits 26-II, 33-ZZZ, 34-CC, and 36-CC, where the
protestant is voted for mayor, are not valid ballots for the protestant.</p>

<p class="BODY">These four ballots were all rejected by the lower court, but,
surprisingly, the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> included them all in his
appeal before the Court of Appeals (Errors Nos. 73, 87, 89, and 95,

brief in the CA).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals, in its decision, declared that all these
four ballots have already been rejected by the lower court, and it affirmed the
ruling of the lower court that they are all marked ballots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals likewise overruled the
claim of the protestant on these ballots (Decision of the CA, pp. 23, 25, and
26; pp. 54, 56, 57, <span class="SpellE">rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The protestant included these four ballots in his motion for
reconsideration, and the Court of Appeals, in its resolution denying the motion
for reconsidera­tion, maintained its ruling that these four ballots are not
valid ballots.</p>

<p class="BODY">We believe that both the lower court and the Court of Appeals
erred in declaring these four ballots invalid for being marked, upon the ground
that in Exhi­bit 26-II the word "Straight <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>"

"Straight NP" is written across the lines for senators; that in
Exhibit 34-CC the word "<span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party"
is written over the lines for senators; and in Exhibit 36-CC the word
"Straight <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>" is writ­ten on the

</span>The words "Straight <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>",
"Straight NP", or "<span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
Party", as the case may be, written on these ballots, are not
distinguishing marks that would invalidate these ballots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No evidence had been presented to show that

of the re­pealed block-voting system, may be expected for some time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of evidence <span class="SpellE">aliunde</span> that these words were intended for identification
of the ballot or voter, this ballot should be counted in favor of <span class="SpellE">pro­testee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;

in ballot P74-Al, above, with regard to the words '<span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
<span class="SpellE">Paterio</span> Bloc'.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The name 'Norma Vales' should only be considered as a stray vote under

<p class="BODY">It appearing that the protestant is properly voted in these four
ballots in question, these ballots should be considered valid ballots for the
protestant.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find, however, that in the decision of the Court of Appeals
(pp. 9, 10 and 11) said court de­clared invalid the ballot, Exhibit VVV-1,
where the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> is voted for mayor, upon the
ground that it contained the words "All LP senators".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This ballot is among those ballots that have
been forwarded to this Court, and We have examined it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find that the phrase "All LP
senators" is written on the first line for senators, and no candidate for
senator is voted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> is properly voted in the space for mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In consonance with Our ruling that the four
ballots, claimed by the protestant, in this fourth error he as­signed, are
valid, We declare that this ballot, Exhi­bit VVV-1, is also a valid ballot for
the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It results that in this fourth error assigned by the protestant,
the protestant should be credited with four (4) additional votes, while the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> should be credited with one (1) additional vote.</p>

<p class="NUM">5. In the fifth error assigned by the protestant, in his appeal
before this Court, he alleges that the Court of Appeals erred in validating
twenty-three bal­lots, cast in favor of the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>,
that are written partly in Arabic script and partly in Romanized script, all of
which were previously rejected by the trial court and not counted in favor of
the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In assailing the validity of these ballots the protestant invokes the
provisions of Rule 8, Section 149 of the Revised Election Code, which provides
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"8. Ballots wholly written in Arabic in localities where it is
of general use are valid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To read them
the board may employ any person who upon oath can do so impartially."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is the contention of the protestant that under that rule if
the ballot is not wholly written in Arabic the ballot is not valid.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have examined these 23 ballots and We find that each one of
them is really partly written in Arabic script and partly written in the
Romanized script.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These ballots are
properly identified, but for the purposes of this decision We do not consider
it necessary to mention them by their exhibit marks.</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot sustain the contention of the pro­testant in assailing
the validity of these ballots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court
takes judicial notice that in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
a large segment of the population are Muslims who speak and write the Arabic

inhabited by Muslims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the spread of
instruction in the English language through the schools, it is to be expected
that Muslim inhabitants have learned to speak and write the En­glish
language.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not surprising,
therefore, that those Muslims who knew how to write in the Romanized script way
would write their ideas either in the Arabic way or in the Romanized way, or
mixed Arabic and Roman way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence
of evidence, and the record does not show any, that the mixed writing of names
in each of the 23 ballots in question - some in Arabic and some in Roman script
- was a device deliberately resorted to in order to identify these ballots or
the voters who prepared them, We have to resolve whatever doubt there may be
regarding these 23 ballots in favor of their validity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the following ob­servations of
the Court of Appeals, in its decision, regarding these ballots:</p>

<blockquote>"xxx it is argued that in order for a ballot with Arabic
writing to be valid, all the names voted for in that ballot should be in
Arabic, but this logic appears to be out of place for the reason that it
overlooks the fact that perhaps the more correct conclusion should be the reverse,
that if only portions are in Arabic and the rest in the ordinary Romanized
system of writing, with more reason should the bal­lot be validated; where the
law accepts the validity of the whole, it must be inter­preted to accept the
validity of the part, because the whole includes any of the parts, stated
otherwise, since the Election Code has gone so far as to permit ballots to be
prepared wholly in Arabic, that cannot be meant to mean that ballots prepared
partly in Arabic and partly in the ordinary Ro­manized form would be excluded;
in the first place, there is nothing in the Election Code that justifies that
conclusion; in case of doubt, the interpretation of the Courts would never be
to disenfranchise the voter; x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">6. In the sixth error assigned by the protest­ant, in his appeal
before this Court, he alleges that the Court of Appeals erred in refusing to
rule that two ballots cast in favor of the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>,
marked as Exhibits XXX-9 and PP-29, are invalid ballots.</p>

<p class="BODY">These two ballots were declared valid by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The protestant assailed the validity of these
ballots for the first time in his motion for reconsideration in the Court of
Appeals, but said court re­fused to rule on them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These two ballots; however, are not among the
ballots forwarded to this Court from the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as these two ballots can not be
found, the ruling of the lower court on these ballots shall be sustained (<span class="SpellE">Coscolluela</span> v. Gaston, 63 Phil., 41, 48).</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>In</u> <u>resume</u>, We declare that at this instance the protestant
must be credited with forty-two (42) more votes, and the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>
with one (1) vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the decision of
the Court of Appeals We find that the <span class="SpellE">pro­testee</span> was
credited with a total of 3,937 votes and the protestant with a total of 3,924
votes. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Inasmuch as at this instance the
protestant is credited with forty-two additional votes, and the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> with one additional vote, it results that the
protestant must be credited with a grand total of 3,966 votes and the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> with a grand total of 3,938 votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The protestant must, therefore, be declared
winner over the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> by a margin of twenty-eight
(28) votes.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the appealed decision of the Court of Appeals
should be, as it is hereby, reversed, and ano­ther one entered declaring protestant
<span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Juliano</span> the duly
