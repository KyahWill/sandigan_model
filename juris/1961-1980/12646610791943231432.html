<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Charged before the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> for the crime of 
Murder, for the death of Noel <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span>, the accused 
Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Reyno</span>, was found guilty thereof and sentenced 
to "reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>," to indemnify the heirs of the 
deceased in the amount of P6,000.00, and to pay the costs. Being a detention 
prisoner, 1/2 of his preventive imprisonment was credited to his 
favor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">There is no dispute regarding the 
fact that Noel <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span> was stabbed in the early 
morning of </span><st1:date year="1961" day="7" month="4"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 7, 
1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, in 
the vicinity of </span><st1:address><st1:street><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Quimson</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> St.</span></st1:street><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, </span><st1:city><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Cabanatuan</span></span></st1:city></st1:address><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> City, which caused his death. 
The issue is predominantly on the identity of the 
assailant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The version of the prosecution, 
thru the testimony of Nicolas Ruiz, Jr., upon which the decision of conviction 
was primarily anchored, runs as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">At about 12:30 o'clock in the 
early dawn of April 7, 1961, the witness (Ruiz, Jr.), the deceased (<span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span>), Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Afaglaya</span>, 
Oscar Nieves, <span class="SpellE">Boyet</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> 
Reyes, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Bundoc</span>, a certain Johnny from <span class="SpellE">Talavera</span>, and Salty and Ruben, and <span class="SpellE">compadre</span>, respectively, of said witness, were front of the 
store of Sally, at the corner of <span class="SpellE">Quimson</span> <span class="SpellE">Consejo</span> Streets, <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span> City. 
While they were conversing, four (4) persons, one of whom was later recognized 
by Ruiz to be the accused Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Reyno</span>, arrived in 
the vicinity and tinkered with the water pipe in front of the 
</span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Wesleyan</span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">College</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. The deceased <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span>, from the store, told the group, not to tinker with 
the pipe, which caused one of the four persons tinkering with the pipe to glance 
back at <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span> and his companions. Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Maglaya</span> followed by the deceased <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span> approached the group, but they left going eastward 
on </span><st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Quimson</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. Because the pipe was spurting 
water, <span class="SpellE">Maglaya</span> and <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span> 
fixed the same, after which they joined their own group. After 15 minutes more 
of conversation, <span class="SpellE">Magilaya</span> and his group started for 
home, taking </span><st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Quimson</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> where the house of <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span> was more accessible. <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bundoc</span> walked side, by 
side, well ahead of the group, followed by Ruiz, Jr. and <span class="SpellE">Maglaya</span>, about five (5) meters behind. Close behind were 
Oscar Nieves and <span class="SpellE">Boyet</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes. As the group was passing in front of the house of 
Dr. <span class="SpellE">Luningning</span> <span class="SpellE">Roa</span>, on <span class="SpellE">Quimson</span> Street, Ruiz, Jr. saw Noel <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span> suddenly turn around, pressing the joint of his left 
thigh. <span class="SpellE">Maglaya</span>, closely followed by Ruiz, Jr., ran to 
find out what had happened to <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span>. When they were 
in the place where <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span> was, Ruiz, Jr. <span class="GramE">saw</span> a person, about 2 to 3 meters away, holding a bladed 
instrument. At this juncture, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Bundoc</span> shouted 
"Boy (referring to Ruiz, Jr.) may <span class="SpellE">dala</span> <span class="SpellE">yan</span>," causing Ruiz, Jr. to stop running. At this instance, 
the person stabbed at Ruiz, Jr., who evaded the assault by jumping. As the 
assailant readied to give, another thrust, and as Ruiz, Jr. prepared to parry 
the same, the two stared at each other for about 40 winks or seconds. It was at 
this juncture that Ruiz, Jr. <span class="GramE">came</span> to recognize the 
assailant, as one of those who tampered with the pipe in front of the 
</span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Wesleyan</span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">College</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and whom the deceased accosted 
earlier. At the time of the stabbing, the accused Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Reyno</span> was wearing khaki trousers, T-shirt, a <span class="SpellE">buri</span> hat, the same attire worn by one of the persons who 
tinkered with the pipe. There- after, <span class="SpellE">Reyno</span> ran 
eastward along </span><st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Quimson</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. Ruiz Jr., also saw three (3) 
other persons, whom he failed to recognize running away with accused <span class="SpellE">Reyno</span> from the scene of the offense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The deceased was brought to the 
</span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Provincial</span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Hospital</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> in 
</span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Cabanatuan</span></span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. The attending physicians called 
for the immediate need of blood. In the meanwhile, the relatives of <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span> were notified of the incident, who also tried to 
look for blood. At </span><st1:time minute="25" hour="2"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">2:25 a.m.</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> the same date (</span><st1:date year="1961" day="7" month="4"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 7, 
1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">), 
Noel <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span>" expired, due to severe hemorrhage, 
before the necessary blood type could be found and administered to him. The 
cadaver was later brought to the <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span> Funeral Parlor 
for burial preparations. The police authorities were also notified, and police 
patrols were instructed to cover possible outlets, most specially bus 
terminals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">At the Rural Transit Terminal, 
Policeman Agustin Alonzo found the accused <span class="SpellE">Reyno</span>, on 
board a bus bound for </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. He was acting suspiciously, 
looking back and forth. Pat. Alonzo questioned <span class="SpellE">Reyno</span> 
inside the bus, but later brought him down in front of the terminal. Accused 
<span class="SpellE">Reyno</span> told the policeman that he was going to <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> town, notwithstanding the fact that he was on board a 
truck bound for </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. After a while, Attorneys <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span>, brother of the deceased, and <span class="SpellE">Wycoco</span> and <span class="SpellE">Maglaya</span> arrived. Pat. 
Alonzo asked <span class="SpellE">Maglaya</span> if <span class="SpellE">Reyno</span> was the assailant, to which <span class="SpellE">Maglaya</span> replied that the one who stabbed Noel <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span> looked like <span class="SpellE">Reyno</span> and that 
the one who could positively identify the killer, was Nicolas Ruiz, Jr. Ruiz, 
Jr. was brought from the funeral parlor and immediately upon seeing <span class="SpellE">Reyno</span>, told the policeman that he (<span class="SpellE">Reyno</span>) was the one who stabbed <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span>, although said <span class="SpellE">Reyno</span> was 
wearing a different attire then. The bag of <span class="SpellE">Reyno</span>, 
which was still in the <span class="GramE">bus</span> was taken. Asked if he had a 
knife, <span class="SpellE">Reyno</span> gave a negative reply. However, upon 
examination of his bag, aside from clothes, men's toilet articles, in a <span class="SpellE">topsy</span>, <span class="SpellE">turvy</span> condition, and a fan 
knife which <span class="SpellE">Reyno</span> admitted to be his, were found. 
<span class="SpellE">Reyno</span> was brought to the City Hall for further 
questioning. A search in the house of Juliana R. Domingo, sister of accused 
<span class="SpellE">Reyno</span>, yielded a Jacket, which was taken to the 
municipal building. The T- shirt was stained with blood at the hem. The knife 
and t-shirt were submitted to the NBI for examination and chemical analysis. The 
shoes of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span> at the scene of the 
crime, which were covered with <span class="GramE">blood</span> were also 
forwarded to the NBI for the same purpose. On April 26, l961, Andres A. 
Santiago, Chemist of the NBI, rendered a report (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 
B-l) stating that the knife (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C), the T-shirt 
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D) and the shoes (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 
E &amp; E-l<span class="GramE">),</span> were positive for human blood. At a later 
date (</span><st1:date year="1961" day="20" month="6"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 20, 
1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">), 
the same NBI Chemist rendered a Final Report (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B), 
wherein he stated, in addition to the observations contained in <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B-1, dated </span><st1:date year="1961" day="26" month="4"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 26, 
1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
that the type of blood found on the T-shirt of the accused and found on the 
shoes of the deceased (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. E &amp; E-1) belonged to 
the same type of blood as the deceased; that the blood group of the accused 
<span class="SpellE">Reyno</span> was type O, which is different from that found 
on the T-shirt and the shoes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In his appeal before this Court, 
accused-appellant denied having stabbed the deceased, claiming that he was in 
the house of his sister at the time. In explaining the blood stain in the hem of 
the T-shirt (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>; D), the appellant claimed that it 
could have been put there when he was being investigated by the police in the 
municipal building.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We have gone over the records 
with great care, considering the nature of the offense and the penalty imposed 
by the trial Court; and We are perfectly convinced, as did the trial Court of 
the identity of the appellant. True, he offered the alibi that he was in the 
house of his sister, at the time the crime was being committed. His 
<i>alibi</i>, however, cannot overcome the positive identification by 
prosecution witness Ruiz, Jr., which was spontaneously made, after the 
accused-appellant had been confronted by Ruiz, at the bus terminal. Moreover, 
the identification of the appellant finds convincing corroboration in the 
findings of the NBI Chemist, to the effect that the tell-tale knife found among 
the belongings of the accused, at the time he was going away, was positive with 
human blood; that the blood found on the hem of the T-shirt belonging to him 
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D) <span class="GramE">tallied</span> with the 
blood grouping of the deceased. Appellant attributed the blood on his T-shirt, 
as having been placed there by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span>, the 
brother of the deceased, when he was being investigated in the municipal 
building. This was, nevertheless, discarded by the lower court, which considered 
the imputation as preposterous, with the noteworthy observation that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span> would not fabricate evidence against the accused in 
the presence of many towns-people. We share this view of the court a quo, 
specially when, by the very admission of the appellant, the deceased did not 
have any ill-feeling with him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellant's counsel projects an 
argument that there was no reason fur the accused to kill the deceased. It must 
be stated, however, that lack of motive does not preclude the commission of an 
offense. Moreover, in this particular case, the accused <span class="SpellE">Reyno</span> must have resented the interference of the deceased, 
when he (accused) and three (3) other persons tinkered with the water pipe, in 
front of the Wesleyan Colleges. While ordinarily the incident would not have 
provoked the accused, or anyone for that matter, to commit an offense, it is of 
judicial knowledge that others have been killed or assaulted for lesser or no 
reason at all. In the present era, the impulsiveness of youth has given way to 
mature thinking. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">PREMISES 
CONSIDERED</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
decision appealed from should be, as it hereby affirmed, in all respects, with 
costs against the accused-appellant, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Reyno</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
