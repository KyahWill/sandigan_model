				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. VIVENCIO CATLI, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case began with an information against Vivencio Catli charging that 
sometime in May 1948, in Tiaong, Quezon Province, he inflicted mortal injuries 
upon Vidal Saludo, assisted by two others still at large. Aggravating 
circumstances of treachery, superior strength and means to weaken the defense 
were cited.
<p>After trial, the court of first instance of Quezon adjudged him guilty of 
murder, and sentenced him to suffer life imprisonment with the accessories, to 
indemnify Saludo's heirs in the sum of P6,000.00 sans subsidiary imprisonment, 
and to defray the costs.</p>
<p>Insisting on his innocence, the accused seasonably appealed, raising here 
these material points: (a) substantial variance between the allegations and the 
proof, because while the information indicated three persons as authors of the 
crime, the prosecution's evidence showed there were more; (b) delay of seven 
years in the prosecution of the crime; (c) the testimonies of the State 
witnesses are evidently fabricated.</p>
<p>The people's evidence discloses that on May 6, 1943, Vidal Saludo, then 
barrio lieutenant of Bucal, Tiaong, was living with his wife, Fausta Mercado, 
their children and a 14-year old godson Francisco Lopez, in a house located in 
said barrio. At about 7:00 a.m. of said day, several armed men headed by 
appellant Vivencio Catli inquired from Fausta Mercado the whereabouts of her 
husband, and upon being informed that the latter was upstairs, Catli went up and 
requested Vidal Saludo to accompany him to look for Benito Tenorio who had 
strayed from the appellant's group; yielding to this request, Saludo joined the 
appellant's band iwhich proceeded westward; Saludo was then wearing rubber 
shoes, white polo shirt and fatigue pants. And that was the last time his family 
saw him.</p>
<p>At around 11:00 o'clock of that same morning, Marcelo Verano, who was 
pasturing his carabao in the northern part of barrio Bucal, heard someone 
groaning; out of curiosity, he proceeded to the place whence the sounds had 
come, cautiously peered through some bushes and espied appellant beating Vidal 
Saludo with a rice pestle, in the presence of armed companions, one of whom 
remarked: "That is enough Babing, he is already dead;" seized With fear, Verano 
left the place but refrained from disclosing to others what he had observed, 
because he surmised that appellant and his men were Huks.</p>
<p>At about 2:00 p.m. of the same day, Diego Martija, then a member of the rural 
council of Bucal, met Maria Saludo who sobbingly told him that her brother Vidal 
had been taken by the Huks led by appellant; she begged his help to locate 
Vidal, and after some hesitation, Martija responded by asking a neighbor, 
Leoncio Manimtim to accompany him to search for Vidal. The pair followed the 
trail Vidal was last seen to have taken, making inquiries from people who may 
have seen Saludo's group; the search ended near the Capanglao river; en route, 
the two, Martija and Manimtim discovered some drops of blood. As they approached 
the river, the two found a newly dug grave covered with coconut leaves; they 
brushed off the leaves only to find <i>a castorillo hat which they recognized as 
one</i> Vidal Saludo was wont to wear. Replacing the coconut leaves, the two 
left for their respective homes, but refrained from revealing their findings to 
the authorities, for fear of the Huks.</p>
<p>Years after or in 1951, Diego Martija was appointed barrio lieutenant of 
Bucal but he was not provided with firearms; then on March 22, 1955, he was 
named chief of the civilian commando unit of the same barrio and was given a 
gun. Emboldened by the possession of such weapon and encouraged by the 
government campaign against the dissidents, Martija sometime in December, 1955, 
reported to the police chief of Tiaong what he knew about Vidal Saludo's 
killing. On December 5, 1955, the police chief with some PC soldiers exhumed the 
remains of Vidal Saludo; inside the grave, which he pointed out, they found 
bones of a human skeleton and a pair of soles of rubber shoes. The bones were 
gathered in an army sack, shipped to the NBI in Manila for medico-legal 
examination, and following such examination, Dr. Jesus D. Crisostomo, 
medico-legal officer submitted an osteological report with the conclusion 
that:</p>

<p>Appellants defense revolyes around an alibi. He testified that in 1946, he 
lived in the house of Arcadio Exconde in barrio Quipot, Tiaong; that in March 
1948, he moved to barrio "Sta. Clara, Sto, Tomas, Batangas, residing in the 
house of Elena Jaurigue, sister of Gorgonia, the girl he was courting; that 
following an old native custom, he stayed in Sta. Clara performing such chores 
as drawing water and clearing the coffee farm in the service of the woman, 
object of his affections; that he never left Sta. Clara until July 1948 when, 
having ostensively won the girl's favor, he and his bride-to-be departed for 
barrio Quipot, Tiaong, where they resided in peace arid contentment. He recounts 
that on April 6, 1951, five men lured him from his house at wight and after 
leading him some five meters away, they stabbed him repeatedly and then left" 
him for dead; that fifteen days after, he recovered from his wounds at the 
government hospital of San Pablo City and then he moved to Unisan, Quezon for 
fear of his assailants; that on April 11, 1955, he executed an affidavit before 
Agent No. 43 of the National Bureau of Investigation regarding the attempt on 
his life, naming as his assailants Tomas Magwari, Hilarion Gutierrez, Pedro 
Mangubat, Eusebio Orense and another person whom he failed to recognize and 
especially pointing to Mayor Punzalan of Tiaong as the instigator of the crime; 
that on July 1, 1955, he executed another affidavit concerning the same incident 
before Jose B. Tuason, deputy clerk of the CFI of Quezon and on the basis of the 
two affidavits, a complaint for frustrated murder filed by appellant before the 
assistant fiscal of Quezon was investigated. Appellant also averred that while 
his complaint was pending investigation, Mayor Punzalan sent an emissary, 
Avelino by name, requesting him (appellant) to withdraw his complaint in 
exchange for P3,000.00 and an appointment as a <i>caminero</i>; that appellant 
spurned the offer and instead, on September 1, 1955, he executed another 
affidavit before the same NBI Agent No. 43 elaborating on his first affidavit; 
that on December 5, 1955, the police chief of Tiaong directed the exhumation of 
Saludo's remains; that on Decemeber 13, 1955, the same officer fetched Fausta 
Mercado from barrio Bangcalat, Tanauan, Batangas and took her to Tiaong where 
she subscribed to a statement naming the appellant as the murderer of her 
husband Vidal Saludo; and that the complaint against him was trumped up at the 
instigation of Mayor Punzalan because of his refusal to withdraw his complaint 
against the mayor and the latter's henchmen.</p>
<p>Appellant's alibi, besides being inherently weak, sounds unconvincing and 
ineffectual. His claim that he resided in his sister-in-law's (Elena Jaurigue) 
house at barrio Sta. Elena, Sto. Tomas, Batangas between March and July 1948, by 
no means erases the possibility that he was in barrio Bucal, Tiaong on May 6, 
1948, when the victim, Vidal Saludo was murdered. Elena Jaurigue herself 
declared that the distance between the two barrios was short and could be 
negotiated <i>by bus in half an hour</i>. Although she tried hard to corroborate 
appellant's alibi by insisting that the latter did not leave barrio Sta. Elena 
even once during the five months of his stay thereat, her testimony does not 
ring true. She said it was impossible for appellant to leave her house without 
her knowledge; because her home was a one-room affair where appellant kept his 
clothes and that this room was under Jock, the key to which she always kept. But 
this situation does not rule out appellant's chance to slip out of the premises 
unnoticed by Elena, because precisely he was locked out; and since he was 
purportedly rendering manual chores, he perforce had to be dressed and leave the 
house once in a while, such as appellant would stay confined in only one place 
Withal, it is hard to believe that an able-bodied laborer for a prolonged and 
continuous period.</p>
<p>As against appellant's alibi, there is the positive identification made of 
him by Marcelo Verano who peered through the bushes and saw him clubbing Vidal 
Saludo with a rice pestle; and the testimony of the victim's wife pointing to 
appellant as the leader of the band that took her husband away. All these render 
appellant's alibi, unavailing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p>In connection with the variance between the number of persons alleged in the 
information and the number of persons cited by the witnesses as having 
participated in the crime, it is enough to state that such variance is not 
material. Appellant was properly identified in both the information and in the 
testimonial evidence of the witnesses; he was fully aware of the nature and 
cause of the accusation; and he failed to object seasonably in the trial to the 
testimonial allegation that there were some other persons involved in the crime. 
And it is the rule in this jurisdiction that a "variance between the allegations 
of the information and the evidence offered by the prosecution in support 
thereof, does not of itself entitle the accused to an acquittal."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> More, it is within the prosecution 
officer's discretion to determine what persons appear to be responsible for the 
commission of an offense; and if for lack of knowledge or mistake or any other 
reason, he fails to include the names of one or more criminals in an 
information, such persons will not be relieved of penal liability; nor will the 
acctised who have been charged with the offense, be permitted to escape 
punishment merely because it develops in the course of the trial that there were 
other guilty participants in the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p>
<p>Appellant ascribes unreasonableness in the delay between the supposed 
commission of the offense in 1948 to its prosecution in 1956. It appears, 
however, that the silence of the witnesses, particularly of Martija, Verano and 
Fausta Mercado was satisfactorily explained: they feared Huk reprisals. Indeed 
before these witnesses disclosed the facts to the authorities, dissident bands 
asking for "binalut" or wrappers with food had been foraging in the barrios and 
intimidating the residents. The insecurity of the life in the barrio is 
illustrated by appellant's claim that he was stabbed and left for dead on April 
6, 1951 when he refused to give his firearm to six persons.</p>
<p>Appellant lastly asserts that the charge against him was trumped up and the 
witness's testimonies fabricated. He claims that he was stabbed on April 6, 1951 
upon orders of Mayor Punzalan; that as a consequence, he filed a complaint for 
frustrated murder against the Mayor and his five henchmen; and for his refusal 
to withdraw the charge, the mayor caused the instant case to be filed against 
him.</p>
<p>Appellant's claim lacks merit. His written statement (Exh. H, p. 190 record) 
of April 7, 1951, when he still had no opportunity to contrive, reveals that he 
failed to recognize his assailants. This statement entitled "Ante-Mortem" bears 
the appellant's thumbmark and is witnessed by his own brother-in-law, Simon 
Jaurigue. Subsequently, on April 11, 1951, five days after he was stabbed, 
appellant executed an affidavit before Agent No. 43 of the NBI and this time, he 
named Hilarion Gutierrez, Tomas Magwari, Pedro Mangubat and Eustaquio Orense as 
his attackers; he also claimed having overheard Gutierrez mutter: "Ang sabi ni 
Mayor (PUNZALAN) ay huag ng barilin at saksakin na lamang" (Exh. 6, pp. 178-179, 
Record). In the same statement, however, appellant stated that one Brigido 
Balmes aided him shortly after he was wounded; but in the trial, Balmes 
testifying as a rebuttal witness for the State declared that appellant had told 
him that five persons had attacked and stabbed him near a mango tree but that he 
(appellant) was unable to recognize his attackers.</p>
<p>In fine, we feel that the evidence on hand sufficiently establishes 
appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the judgment of conviction must be upheld; and there being no 
question as to the penalty imposed upon this appellant, the appealed decision is 
affirmed in toto with costs. So ordered.</p> <i>Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera,
