				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The question shaped out by this case is the propriety of the
trial court's denial of defendant's petition for relief from judgment.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="12" month="9">September 12, 1961</st1:date>,
plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Saulog</span>
sued in the City Court of Manila for damages and attorneys' fees against
defendants <span class="SpellE">Custombuilt</span> Manufacturing Corporation (<span class="SpellE">Custombuilt</span>), Northwest Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc.
(Northwest), and the City Sheriff of Manila.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Plaintiff complained that <span class="SpellE">Custombuilt</span> caused to be
sold on execution certain properties belonging to him which he leased to one
Adriano Go, <span class="SpellE">Custombuilt's</span> judgment debtor in another
case.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Those properties consisted of a piano with a stool, and a rattan dinner and <span class="SpellE">sala</span> set.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff
filed a third-party claim thereon to stave off levy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But <span class="SpellE">Custombuilt</span>
posted a P1<span class="GramE">,200</span>-bond issued by Northwest in favor of
the City Sheriff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This paved the way for
the execution sale of said properties on <st1:date year="1961" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
prayer in plaintiff's complaint:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the
three defendants to pay, jointly and severally, P1<span class="GramE">,200</span>;
against <span class="SpellE">Custombuilt</span>, for P1,000 as actual and moral
damages and P500 as attorneys' fees; and against all of them, the costs of
suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 3, 1962, the City Court of Manila rendered judgment on
plaintiff's evidence introduced <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>
against <span class="SpellE">Custombuilt</span>, the City Sheriff, and the
defaulting Northwest - all of whom failed to appear on the date set for the
trial despite due notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The city
court's judgment directed defendants, jointly and severally, to pay plaintiff
the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,200</span> plus P100 for attorneys' fees, and
the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Custombuilt</span> appealed to the Court of
First Instance of Manila,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
substantially reiterated its answer in the inferior court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant Sheriff reproduced his answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1964</st1:date>,
pre-trial was had.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Custombuilt's</span>
counsel was in the courtroom that day, but left before the case was
called.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On plaintiff's motion, the
judge, on the same day, dismissed the appeal and revived the city court's
judgment, without costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Copy of this order was received by <span class="SpellE">Custombuilt's</span>
counsel on November 10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On November 14,
he filed a petition for relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
November 19, plaintiff opposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
November 27, the court below denied the petition for lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Custombuilt</span>
appealed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The city court's judgment as revived by the Court of First
Instance must be sustained.</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concededly, at the
start of the pre-trial on November 5, <span class="SpellE">Custombuilt's</span>
attorney was present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he
unceremoniously left the courtroom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Counsel averred in his petition for relief that he had to leave
posthaste because "he was summoned home all too suddenly" as
"(h)is pregnant wife had been having labor pains" which "were
cause for alarm" because "his wife was due for confinement x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> and she finally delivered on
November 10, 1964."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Counsel did not have the foresight required of him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to Section 1, Rule 20 of the Rules
of Court, both client and counsel must appear at the pre-trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is mandatory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failure of the client to appear is ground for
dismissal.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
If one representing his client - a corporation - was present, counsel could
have easily left word for the former to tell the judge that he was suddenly
summoned to his home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the client were
not present, then the case just the same would have been dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, the point is that allegedly <u>someone</u>
summoned said attorney to go back home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If this were true, then it would have been quite easy for the lawyer to
have asked that man to stay around and tell the judge or the clerk or the
branch deputy clerk of court of his, predicament.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or, he himself could have as easily told the
judge, or either clerk, or the adverse counsel, the court stenoÂ­grapher, the
interpreter, the bailiff, or anyone for that matter, of his inability to wait
for the pre-trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He failed to do any
one of these.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his petition for relief, <span class="SpellE">Custombuilt's</span>
lawyer also made the statement that his wife did not give birth until five days
later, that is, on November 10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
unreasonable to assume that during the whole period of time - from November 5
to November 10 - his mind was in blank, such that it was impossible for him to
have taken steps to tell the court personally or otherwise that his absence
during the pre-trial was excusable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, he did not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He received
copy of the decision on November 10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
did not file the petition for relief until November 14.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing are not isolated instances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact is that even when the trial was held
in the City Court of Manila, neither was there appearance for appellant
Custom-built - "despite due notice".</p>

<p class="BODY">All of these facts point to one conclusion:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>lack of interest on the part of appellant to
defend itself against the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rather, the pattern of conduct discloses a desire to delay disposal of
the present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failure to prosecute
is a ground for dismissal of the appeal and revival of the judgment of the city
court under Section 9, Rule 40 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have not overlooked Section 2, Rule 20 of the Rules of Court,
which says that "a party who failed to appear at the pre-trial conference
may be non-suited or considered as in default." So that, as held in the
two cases heretofore cited, namely, <u>American</u> <u>Insurance</u> <u>Company</u>
<u>vs</u>. <u>Republic</u>, <u>supra</u>, and <u>Home</u> <u>Insurance</u> <u>Company</u>
<u>vs</u>. <u>United</u> <u>States</u> <u>Lines</u> <u>Co</u>., <u>supra</u>, a
complaint may be dismissed failure of the party plaintiff to appear at the
pre-trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, this remedy is by no
means exclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It goes hand in hand
with the right of the court of first instance - upon a showing of failure to
prosecute - to <u>dismiss</u> a defendant's appeal from the judgment of an
inferior court pursuant to Section 9, Rule 40.</p>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Custombuilt's</span> notice of appeal,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
we note that defendant gave notice that he would "appeal the judgment on
the merits, upon the ground that it is not supported by the evidence and is
contrary to law." Indeed, his second assignment of error challenges the
correctness of the judgment of the city court on the merits.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">One important roadblock stands astride any discussion of the
judgment of the City Court of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pursuant to Section 9, Rule 40, <u>supra</u>, that judgment "shall
be deemed revived and shall forthwith be remanded to the justice of the peace
court or municipal court for execution." Implicit in this rule is that
that judgment of the City Court of Manila may no longer be reopened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, the appeal to the Court of First
Instance of Manila has already been dismissed by the latter court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that is left is to execute the city
court's judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>FOR THE REASONS GIVEN</b>, the trial court's order of <st1:date year="1964" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1964</st1:date> is hereby affirmed.</p>
