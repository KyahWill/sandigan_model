				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case is before Us on automatic review of a decision of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, convicting
defendants <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> <span class="SpellE">Nabual</span>,
Luis <span class="SpellE">Nabual</span> and <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bachicha</span>, of the crime of robbery with homicide, under an
information alleging:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 7th day of January, 1967, in the
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Calbiga</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating together
and helping one another with one <span class="SpellE">Cresencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabute</span> who is still at large, armed with guns and a knife,
with intent to kill and to gain, by means of force, violence against and
intimidation of persons, and at nighttime, did then and there willfully,
unlawfully and feloniously enter the house of one Carlota P. <span class="SpellE">Ocenada</span>, and once inside thereat, pointed their guns at
said Carlota P. <span class="SpellE">Ocenada</span> and demanded money from her
and because of fear that she might be killed, said Carlota P. <span class="SpellE">Ocenada</span> handed said accused money in cash which was placed
inside their trunk, amounting to One Hundred Thirty Five (P135.00) Pesos, and
accused forcibly opened the suitcase and got another money in cash amounting to
Four Hundred (P400.00) Pesos, which the <span style="">said
</span>accused took, stole and carried away with them, to the damage and
prejudice of the said <span style="">owner in </span>the
total sum of Five Hundred Thirty Five (P535.00) Pesos, Philippine currency; and
accused, pursuant to their conspiracy and on such occasion thereof and for the
purpose of enabling them to take, steal and carry away with them said amount of
money, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault
and stab several times one Pablo <span class="SpellE">Ocenada</span>, husband of
said Carlota P. <span class="SpellE">Ocenada</span> with said knife with which
the said accused had con­veniently provided themselves for the purpose, there­by
inflicting upon said Pablo <span class="SpellE">Ocenada</span> several wounds on
the different parts of his body which wounds caused his death.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That in the commission of the crime the following aggravating
circumstances were present:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
Nighttime; (2) the crime was committed in the dwelling of the offended party,
the latter not having been giving provocation for it; (3) <span class="SpellE">habituality</span>
or reiteration, they having been convicted on September 5, 1962, in the Court
of First Instance of Branch I, <span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, for murder, in Criminal Case No. 6074, and was
sentenced to imprisonment from 4 years and 2 months of <span class="SpellE">prision</span>
<span class="SpellE">correccional</span> to 8 years of <span class="SpellE">prision</span>
mayor, with accessory penalties provided by law and indemnify jointly and
severally the heirs of Loreto <span class="SpellE">Cabrillas</span> and pay the
costs; as to accused Luis <span class="SpellE">Nabual</span> and <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> <span class="SpellE">Nabual</span>; (4) evident
premeditation; (5) taking advantage of sup­erior strength in number and
arms."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">When the case was called for arraignment, counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> for the defendants informed said Court of
their intention to enter a plea of guilty, whereupon His Honor, the trial
Judge, propounded to them the questions and the defendants gave the answers
quoted here­under:</p>

<blockquote>COURT - (To the three accused)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q -<span style=""> </span>Your lawyer
has manifested to this court that you desire to enter the plea of guilty to the
offenses charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do you agree to that
manifestation of your lawyer?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A -<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir (all the three accused)</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Q -<span style=""> </span></span>Do
you know that by so agreeing to that manifestation of your lawyer you will be
admitting the commission of the crime charging you with robbery with homicide?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A -<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir (all the three accused)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span style="">Q</span> -<span style=""> </span>And
for which this court will sentence you to death or of imprisonment for which
length of time that it will determine?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A -<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir (both the three accused).</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Q -<span style=""> </span></span>And,
notwithstanding what was explained to you <span class="SpellE">you</span> still
insist your desire to enter the plea of guilty to the offense charged?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A -<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir (both the three accused).</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Q -<span style=""> </span></span>The
court would like to inform you again that this robbery with homicide is punish­able
with reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span> with death.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A -<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Yes, </span>sir (both the three accused).</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Q -<span style=""> </span></span>And
there is a likelihood that you might be sentenced to death.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A -<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir (both the three accused).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q -<span style=""> </span>And, notwithstanding what is explained to you
by the court you still insist in your desire to enter the plea of guilty?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A -<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir (both the three accused).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"COURT</blockquote>

<blockquote>Arraign the accused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"INTERPRETER</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Reading the information to the three accused).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"INTERPRETER</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Q -<span style=""> </span></span>Did
you understand what was read to you?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Interpreter asking the same question to the three accused)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A -<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir (both the three accused).</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Q -<span style=""> </span></span>What
is your plea <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> <span class="SpellE">Nabual</span>?
</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Q -<span style=""> </span></span>What
is your Luis <span class="SpellE">Nabual</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A -<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Guilty.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Q -<span style=""> </span></span>What
is your plea <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bachicha</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A -<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Guilty.</blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q -<span style=""> </span>Why did you enter the plea of guilty to the
crime charged?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A -<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I pleaded guilty because I have done it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Both the three accused answering one by
one)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thereupon, the trial court rendered judgment finding the de­fendants
guilty of robbery with homicide, with the aggravating circumstances of
nighttime, dwelling, evident premeditation and abuse of superior strength, in
addition, insofar as Luis <span class="SpellE">Nabual</span> and <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> <span class="SpellE">Nabual</span> are concerned, to
the aggravating circumstance of reiteration, with no mitigating circumstance in
favor of any of said defendants ex­cept that of plea of guilty, which is,
however, insufficient to offset all of the aforementioned aggravating
circumstances, and, accordingly, sentenced them to death, to jointly and
severally indemnify the heirs of Pablo <span class="SpellE">Ocenada</span> in the
sums of P6,000 and P535, which latter sum represents the amount stolen, and to
pay the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the pre­sent
automatic review.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> thereof, or on <st1:date year="1968" day="24" month="12">December 24, 1968</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Deme­trio</span> <span class="SpellE">Nabual</span> died in
consequence of injuries sustained when prison guards fired at him, as he,
together with other prisoners, tried to escape from the New <span class="SpellE">Bilibid</span>
Prisons, where he was undergoing preventive imprisonment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By resolution of this Court, dated <st1:date year="1969" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1969</st1:date>, the case against
him was, therefore, dismissed, so that the present decision refers exclusively
to defendants Luis <span class="SpellE">Nabual</span> and <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bachicha</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Conceding the propriety of the judgment of conviction against
these defendants, their counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
maintains<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
that the lower court erred in considering that the crime charged was committed
with the aggravating circumstances of reiteration, nighttime and evident
premeditation; that the commission of said crime was attended by no other
aggravating circumstances than those of dwelling and abuse of superior
strength; that these two (2) aggravating circumstances should be deemed offset
by the plea of guilty entered by the defen­dants, so that they should be
sentenced merely to life imprisonment; and that said judgment should be
modified accordingly.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the aggravating circumstances of reiteration and
nighttime, it is urged that, according to the information, the defendants had
been previously "convicted" of the crime of murder and
"sentenced" <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>; that there is no
allegation that they had served the sentence; that actual punishment or service
of the sen­tence is essential to the aggravating circumstance of reiteration,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
unlike recidivism, for which previous conviction of a crime falling under the
same title of the penal code is sufficient; and that the information fails to
aver that nighttime had been purposely or espe­cially sought or that the
defendants had taken advantage thereof in order either to facilitate the
commission of the offense or to afford them impunity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We deem it unnecessary, however, to discuss
these aggravating circumstances, because even if <span style="">we </span>discarded them, the result would be the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, appellants affirm that evident premeditation is inherent
in the crime of robbery and that robbery with homicide is essentially a crime
against property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that in the
case of People v. <span class="SpellE">Valeriano</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
which was one of robbery with homicide, it was held that:</p>

<blockquote>"Evident premeditation is not considered <span style="">as </span>an
aggravating circumstance in crimes of robbery because the same is inherent in
the crime specially where it is committed by various persons; they must have an
agreement, they have to meditate and reflect on the manner of carrying out the
crime and they have to act coordinately in order to succeed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">However, in the same case, this Court added:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <u>But in the crime of robbery with homicide, if there is
evident premeditation to kill besides stealing it is considered as an
aggravating circumstance.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> In the instant case, it has
been proven that the accused, on various occasions be­fore committing the
crime, planned and decided not only to steal but also to kill Judge
Bautista.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, <u>there is present
evident premeditation</u>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, in the case at bar, the information explicitly alleges
that the "accused conspiring, confederating together and helping one
another x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> armed with
guns and a knife x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <u>with
intent to kill</u> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
did x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> willfully,
unlawfully and feloniously <u>enter</u> the house" of the offended parties
and steal the aggregate sum of P535, and "pursuant to their conspiracy, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> did x <span class="SpellE">x</span> stab several times x <span class="SpellE">x</span> Pablo <span class="SpellE">Ocenada</span> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> with said knife <u>with which said accused had
conveniently provided themselves for the purpose, thereby inflicting upon said
Pablo <span class="SpellE">Ocenada</span></u> several wounds x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> which x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> caused his death." This allegation was
admitted by the defendants, who acted, therefore, with evident premeditation <u>to
kill</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Independently, therefore, of the aggravating circumstances of
nighttime and reiteration, evident premeditation, dwelling, and abuse of
superior strength should be considered present at the commission of the
offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the light of the conditions
obtaining in the present case, we believe that defendants’ plea of guilty is
insufficient to offset these three aggravating circumstances, and that the
extreme penalty was properly meted out to.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Luis <span class="SpellE">Nabual</span> and <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bachicha</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have not overlooked the fact that, in People v. <span class="SpellE">Apduhan</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
we refrained from imposing the extreme penalty, for lack of the number of votes
necessary <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, despite the existence of three
aggravating circumstances as against the mitigating circumstance of plea of
guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such case should not be
construed, however, as implying that this mitigating circumstance has as much
weight as three aggravating circumstances, whatever the latter may be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, some aggravating circumstances are
graver than others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the same
aggravating circumstance may connote a greater degree of malice or perversity
in one case than in another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conversely,
the same mitigating circumstance may merit more weight in one case than in
another, depending upon the conditions surrounding each.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the very nature of things, judges must
exercise their sound judgment in the appraisal thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, the defendants had planned not only the
robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had entered the house of
their victims with the intent to kill.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For this purpose, they had armed themselves with deadly weapons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, notwithstanding the fact that they had
been previously convicted of and sentenced for murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if the legal feasibility of considering
such conviction and sentence as sufficient to establish the aggravating
circumstance of reiteration may be debatable, said fact is undoubtedly
indicative of the marked moral perversion of the defendants and of the grave
danger they pose to society.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, again, there is every reason to believe that the plea of
guilty entered into by them was prompted, not by a feeling of regret or remorse
and a willingness to pay their debt to society, but by a desire to avail of the
only means to create a possibility, no matter how remote, of preventing the
imposition of the death penalty, by establishing one mitigating circumstance in
their favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This assertion is based
upon the fact that otherwise the prosecution would have, in all probability,
proven that nighttime had been purposely sought or taken advantage of, and that
the defendants had not only been convicted of and sentenced for murder, but,
also, served the sentence <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the lower court found - upon
informal examination of the documents that the prosecution intended to introduce
in evidence, had the defendants chosen to proceed to trial - that Luis Nabual
and Demetrio Nabual were parolees, so that they must have served part of their
aforementioned sentence. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>In short, had a
plea of not guilty been entered, there was a great likelihood that the
following aggravating circumstances would have been established, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) nighttime; (2) dwelling; (3) abuse of
superior strength; (4) evident premeditation; and (5) as regards Luis <span class="SpellE">Nabual</span> and <span class="SpellE">De­metrio</span> <span class="SpellE">Nabual</span>, reiteration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With no mitigating circumstance to offset any of these aggravating
circumstances - in the absence of a plea of guilty - defendants' chances of
avoiding the extreme penalty were nil.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, they had no choice but to enter said plea.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, modified as to the indemnity of P<span style="">6,</span>000 which is hereby increased to
P12,000,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
in addition to the stolen sum of P535, the decision appealed from is hereby
