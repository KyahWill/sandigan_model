				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">An </span>appeal from a
decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila, in civil case No. 46039, dismissing
the complaint filed by the San Miguel Brewery, Inc., and ordering it to pay to
the defendant P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> in damages, P1,000.00 as
attorneys fees, and costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal was originally lodged with the Court of Appeals which
certified the case to this <span class="GramE">Court,</span> the issue involved
being purely one of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the stipulation of facts submitted by the parties in the
lower court and the various annexes referred to therein, the facts of the case
that gave rise to the controversy are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 14, 1950, the Municipal Board of <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span>
City passed Ordinance No. 11 <span style="">amending
Ordinance </span>No. 7 of said City, imposing <span style="">a </span>tax of two per cent (2%) on the gross sales or receipts of
those engaged in the sale, trading in, or disposal <span style="">of all alcoholic </span>or malt beverages, wines and mixed or fermented
liquors, including <u>tuba</u>, <span class="SpellE"><u>basi</u></span> and <span class="SpellE"><u>tapuy</u></span>. (Sec. 1 [e]<span style="">, </span>Annex A.) On June 6, 1960, the same Municipal Board passed
Ordi­nance No. 110 amending Ordinance No. 11, fixing instead <span style="">a tax </span><span style="">on the sale of beer at the rate of P.25 per </span><span style="">case </span><span style="">of twenty-four </span>bottles, and <span style="">on the </span>sales of soft drinks at the rate of P.10 per case of
twenty-four bottles of Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, <span class="SpellE">Tru</span>-Orange,
Seven-Up, <span class="SpellE">Bireley</span>, Soda Water, and any other kind of
soft drinks or car­bonated drinks. <span class="GramE">(Sec. 2 [e] and Sec. 3,
respectively, Annex B.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The San Miguel Brewery, Inc., a corporation or­ganized and <span style="">existing under </span>the laws of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
with principal offices at <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
maintains a warehouse or branch office in the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Butuan</span></st1:place></st1:city> and is engaged in the sale
of beer and soft drinks in said City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Al­<span style="">though it appears to have paid </span>the
required <span style="">taxes under </span>Ordinance
No. 11 promptly and religiously upon <span style="">the
</span><span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the ordinance, the company
stopped pay<span style="">ing the taxes </span>thereafter
(Annex D), and thereby incur­red in back taxes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Verbal demands were made by the <span style="">City
Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span> on the representative of the San
Miguel Brewery, Inc. at </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Butuan</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> with warnings </span>that a warrant of <span class="SpellE">distraint</span> and levy will be issued against <span style="">its properties unless it settles its tax lia­bility
</span>under the ordinance aforesaid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">On September 23, </span>1960, counsel for the
company wrote a letter to the City Treasurer of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Butuan</span></span><span style=""> questioning the power of the city government of <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span>
to levy upon its </span>properties <span style="">pointing
out, “that the power </span>of <span class="SpellE">distraint</span> and levy as
embodied in your Charter (Republic Act No. 523, as amended), can only be
exercised by your <span class="SpellE">goodselves</span> in <span style="">respect to delinquencies in the payment of
real estate </span>taxes".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To <span style="">this, the City </span>Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span>, in a letter dated <st1:date year="1960" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1960</st1:date>, promptly answered and explained <span style="">that he may issue warrants of <span class="SpellE">distraint</span> and levy upon properties of delinquent </span>taxpayers
<span style="">under Or­</span>dinance No. 26 of the
City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Butuan</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the <span style="">San Miguel Brewery, Inc received </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">formal letter of
demand for payment of its tax liability from the City </span>Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span>, to which the Branch Manager of the company at <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> City who has
supervision of the company's warehouse at <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span>
City, answered on October 10, 1960, requesting more time "within which to
act on said demand and in order to refer the matter to its Manila
Office".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several other written
demands were thereafter made by the City Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span>
to officials of plaintiff's branch office in said city, but failed to yield any
concrete result.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, on January
6, 1961, the city treasurer, with the appro­val of the Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span> City issued a warrant of <span class="SpellE">distraint</span>
and levy against the properties of the San Brewery, Inc. at <span style="">its </span>branch office in that city to
enforce the collection of the taxes assessed against it, <span class="SpellE">i</span>.
e., under ordinance Nos. 11 and 110, amounting to P9,129.42, including
penalties corresponding to the period from May, 1957 to August 15, 1960, and
under Ordinance No. 110, the amount of P15,618.96, including penalty, for the
period corresponding to June 6 up to October 30, 1960, or a total of
P24,747.32.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On January 9, 1961, at about
9 o'clock in the morning a notice of seizure by virtue of the warrant of <span class="SpellE">distraint</span> and levy was served on the company's Branch Manager
at <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span> City who, upon previous arrangement with
the represent­ative of the City Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span>,
voluntarily sur­rendered the two (2) delivery trucks of the company seized
under the warrant to the said City Treasurer at about 5 o'clock in the afternoon
of the same day.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 12, 1961, the San Miguel Brewery, Inc. instituted the
present action in the Court of First Instance of Manila, praying for an order
directing defendant Francisco <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> to release the
delivery trucks seized and impounded by the City Government of <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span> allegedly "without authority and for reasons
unknown to the company", and to order the defendant to pay to the
plaintiff damages in the amount of P6,000.00 the corresponding to the period
from January 9, 1961 to January 10, 1961, and 3,000.00 for each day thereafter
that the trucks remain impounded and unused by the plaintiff, plus the costs of
the suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Parenthetically, the action
was brought against the defendant Francisco <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> in
his individual capacity, as disclosed in the alle<span style="">g</span>ations in the complaint, and as expressly admitted in the
appellant's brief, thus - "As a matter of fact, plaintiff filed this
action against Francisco <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>, <u>not in his
official capacity, but in his individual ca­pacity</u>, x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>." (p. 13).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span>his answer,
defendant Francisco <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> inter­posed, among others,
the defense that in seizing the delivery trucks of the San Miguel Brewery,
Inc., he was acting, and was in the performance of his official duty, as
Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span> City, and can not be held liable
to pay to the company any damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
set up a counterclaim of P40<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and P10,000.00 as
moral and exemplary damages, respectively, allegedly sustained by him and the
members of his family on account of the shock, fright, wounded feelings, mental
anguish be­smirched reputation and social humiliation they suf­fered by reason
of the filing of the case against him by the plaintiff, plus attorney's fees in
the amount of P2,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the action, the
San Miguel Brewery, Inc. paid under protest the taxes assessed against it by
the City Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span>, and forth­with the
impounded trucks were released.</p>

<p class="BODY">The parties submitted no testimonial evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, they submitted a stipulation of
facts along with documentary evidence, on the basis of which the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u>, on <st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1962</st1:date>,
rendered the decision appealed from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
motion for reconsideration of the decision having been denied, the plaintiff
interposed the instant appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the first assignment of error, appellant as­<span style="">sails </span>the conclusion of the court that
"the allegation in the complaint (par. 5) that the seizure of plaintiff's
trucks was made for reasons unknown to the plaintiff, is false", because
it is not sustained by the evidence; said appellant claiming that it was only
at the time that the stipulation of facts was being prepared that the de­fendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> made mention for the first time of his alleged
authority to issue a warrant of <span class="SpellE">distraint</span> and levy
against properties of tax delinquents under Ordi­nance No. 26 of the City of <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
contention is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In paragraph <span style="">8 </span>of the stipulation of facts, it is
admitted that on September 29, 1960, in a letter of the City Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span> to Attys. Ponce <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span>, <span class="SpellE">Siguion</span> Reyna, <span class="SpellE">Montecillo</span> &amp;
Belo, counsel for the plain­tiff, said counsel was informed that the city
government was exercising its power of levy and <span class="SpellE">distraint</span>
against properties of taxpayers under Ordinance No. 26 of the city.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant, therefore, may not now feign
ignorance of such notice which appears in the records.</p>

<p class="BODY">To the charge that Ordinance No. 26 of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Butuan</span></st1:place></st1:city> is <u>ultra</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>vires</u></span>, suffice it to say that the same may not be
considered in this appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An
examination of the complaint filed in this case, reveals that except for the
general averment therein that its delivery <span style="">trucks </span>were seized and impounded by order of the de­<span style="">fendant Francisco </span><span class="SpellE">Magno</span>
"without <span style="">authority of law and </span>for
reasons unknown to the plaintiff", which is with­out factual basis as
pointed out above, no mention was <span style="">made
in the </span>stipulation of facts nor any evidence ever introduced during the
trial of the case in the lower court, to show that it was the intention of the
appell­ant to place in issue the validity of the ordinance a­foresaid.</p>

<p class="BODY">In cases where <span style="">the </span>constitutionality
of statutes are directly <span style="">put </span>in
issue, the <span style="">general rule is, that </span>the
question of constitutionality must be raised at the earliest opportunity, so
that if not raised by the plead­<span style="">ings,
ordinarily it </span>may not be raised at the trial, and if <span style="">not raised </span>in the trial court, it will
not be consi­<span style="">dered </span>on appeal
(People and <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> &amp; Shanghai <span style="">Banking </span>Corporation vs. Vera and Cu <span class="SpellE">Unjieng</span>, 37 O.G., 164 citing <span style="">12 C. J., p. 786).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See also <span class="SpellE">Cadwalader</span>-Gibson Lumber Co. vs. Del Rosario, 26 Phil. 192;

Philippines, 68 Phil., 320; <span class="SpellE">Macondray</span> &amp; Co. vs.

No. <span style="">L-18240, </span><st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="1"><span style="">January 31, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">.) </span>The exceptions <span style="">are, as stated </span>in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>
etc. vs. Cu <span class="SpellE">Unjieng</span>, <u>supra</u>, in criminal cases,
where the <span style="">question </span>may be raised
at any stage of the proceedings, either <span style="">in
</span>the trial <span style="">court </span>or on
appeal; in civil cases, it has been held that it is the duty of the court to
pass on the constitutional question, though raised for the first time on <span style="">appeal, if it appears that a determination of
</span>the question is necessary to a decision of the case; and it has also
been held that a constitutional question will be considered by an appellate
court at any time, where <span style="">it involves
the jurisdiction of the court below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
same rule should apply where the validity of a mu­<span style="">nicipal </span>ordinance is questioned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We do not <span style="">find any of </span>the
<span style="">exceptions </span>aforementioned
applicable to this case to justify a conclusion that <span style="">the validity of Ordinance No. 26 of the City </span>of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Butuan</span></st1:place></st1:city> may be properly passed upon
in this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> is sued in
this case not <span style="">in his capacity as City
Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span> but in his individual
capacity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is not the proper party
against </span>whom the alleged invalidity of the ordinance in question <span style="">should be pleaded, nor is this the proper
proceeding wherein the alleged infirmity of the said ordinance may be
raised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A municipal ordinance is not </span>subject
<span style="">to col­lateral attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Public policy forbids collateral im­peachment
of legislative acts (43 C. J., 555-556).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under the second assignment of error, it is con­tended that the
trial court fell into error in not or­dering the defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
to pay to the appellant in damages the amount of P2,160.00, notwithstanding the
admission of the defendant in the stipulation of facts that the San Miguel
Brewery, Inc. incurred dam­ages in that amount, representing the hire of two
(2) trucks at the rate of P80.00 per day which the plain­tiff was compelled to
secure and use for the period from January 9, 1961 to February 8, 1961, during
which time the two delivery trucks of the plaintiff were im­pounded by the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
argument is based on a wrong premise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
erroneously assumes that the de­fendant is <u>personally liable</u> for damages
to the appel­lant, disregarding the established fact that the de­fendant had
issued the warrant of <span class="SpellE">distraint</span> and levy against
plaintiff's properties in his capacity as City Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span>
who, under the law, is empowered to issue the warrant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ordinance No. 26 of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Butuan</span></st1:place></st1:city> provides, among others, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 1.- Upon the failure of any person owing any
delinquent tax or de­linquent revenue to pay the same, at the time required
under existing ordi­nance, the City Treasurer, his deputy, or any of his clerks
duly authorized in writing by the City Treasurer may seize or <span class="SpellE">distraint</span> any goods, chattels or effects, and other
personal property, including stocks and other securities, debts, credits, bank
accounts and any interest in and rights to personal pro­perty, of such person
in sufficient quantity to satisfy the tax, or charge, together with any
increment thereto in­cident to delinquency, and the expenses of the <span class="SpellE">distraint</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Since there is no dispute that the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> issued the warrant of <span class="SpellE">distraint</span>
and levy against the delivery trucks of the appellant on January 9, 1961, in
his capacity as City Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span>, and as
there is no disagreement that defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
issued said warrant by virtue of Ordinance No. 26 of the City of <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span> above-quoted (Par. 15, Stipulation of Facts), and
not having been shown that the defendant, either as <span style="">a private citizen or as City Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span>,
had acted in bad faith, there can be no question that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>, who was merely performing a </span>duty
enjoined by law to be performed when he issued the warrant of <span class="SpellE">distraint</span> and levy, cannot be made to answer <u>personally</u>
for damages to the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, under the third assignment of error, <span style="">appellant maintains that </span>the trial
court should have awarded damages in favor of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
under the counterclaim of the latter, for the reason that no evi­dence was
introduced by the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> in support of the moral
and exemplary damages he and his family allegedly suffered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It argues further that attorney's fees <span style="">should not have been </span>assessed against
it.</p>

<p class="BODY">In respect <span style="">of the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> counterclaim for moral and exemplary damages,
the trial court said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"With respect to the counterclaim of defendant, <span style="">it appears that </span>defend­ant introduced
no evidence to support his claim for P40<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> moral
dam­ages, <span style="">P10,000.00 </span>exemplary
damages and P2,000.00 attorney's <span style="">fees."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Nevertheless, the trial court sentenced
the plaintiff to pay to the defendant, damages in the sum of P2<span class="GramE">,000</span>. <span class="GramE">00,</span> and costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">In order that moral damages may be awarded, there must be
pleading and proof of moral suffering, mental anguish, fright and the like (<span class="SpellE">Darang</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Belizar</span>, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-­19487, </span><st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="1"><span class="GramE">January 31, 1967</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>While no proof of pecuniary loss is necessary
in order that moral damages may be awarded, the <span style="">amount of indemnity </span>being left to the dis­cretion of the court
(Article 2216), it <span style="">is, </span><span style="">neverthe­less, essential that the claimant
should satisfactorily </span>prove the <span style="">existence
</span>of the factual basis of <span style="">the </span>damages
(Article 2217) and its causal connection to defendant's acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">is
</span>so, because moral damages, though inca­<span style="">pable of pecuniary </span>estimation, are in the category of an award,
designed to compensate the claimant for <span style="">actual
injury suffered </span>and <span style="">not to
impose a </span>penalty on the wrong-doer (<span class="SpellE">Algarra</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Sandejas</span>, 27 Phil. 284; <span class="SpellE">Malonzo</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>, G.R. No. L-13851, <st1:date year="1960" day="27" month="7">July 27, 1960</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither may we consider the award as exemplary damages, be­cause the
mere findings that certain allegations in the complaint are not true, and the
plaintiff com­mitted a mistake in instituting the action against the wrong
party, do not justify the award of this kind of damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It infringes upon the right of a citizen to
have access to the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The portals
of the courts of justice should not be closed to litigants who ask for the
protection of their rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Penalty in
the concept of damages should not be imposed simply because a complaint is
found unmeritorious by the courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">The amount of attorney's fees, on the other hand, is addressed to
the sound discretion of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
may be awarded along with expenses of litigation, other than judicial costs, in
cases where the court deems it just and equitable under the cir­cumstances of
the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when as in this case, the
defendant public officer was sued in his private capacity for acts done in the
performance of official duty required by law, and was forced to employ the
services of private counsel to defend his rights, it is but proper that
attorney's fees be charged against the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nominal damages may also be adjudica­ted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe the award of P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
attorney's fees and P100.00 nominal damages, is just and equitable in the
premises.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is modi­fied,
setting aside the award of P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> to the de­fendant
in concept of damages, but increasing the attorney's fees to P2,000.00, and
ordering the plain­tiff to pay to the defendant P100<span style="">.0</span><span style="">0 </span>as nominal
damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judgment is affirmed in all
other respects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs
