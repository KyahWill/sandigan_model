				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from the decision dated 6 October 1962 of the Court of
First Instance of Manila - dismissing the action in its Civil Case No. 48925 -
brought by the herein plaintiff-appellant Philippine First Insurance Co., Inc.
to the Court of Appeals which Court, upon finding that the said appeal raises
purely questions of law, declared itself without jurisdiction to entertain the
same and, in <span style="">its </span>resolution
dated 15 July 1966, certified the records thereof to this Court for proper
determination.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The antecedent facts are
set forth in the pertinent portions of the resolution of the Court of Appeals
referred to as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"According to the complaint, plaintiff was originally
organized <span style="">as an </span>insurance
corporation under the name of 'The <span class="SpellE">Yek</span> Tong Lin Fire
and Marine Insurance Co., Ltd.'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
articles of incorporation originally presented before the Security and Exchange
Commissioner and acknowledged before Notary Public Mr. E. D. Ignacio on <st1:date year="1953" day="1" month="6"><span style="">June </span>1,
 1953</st1:date> state that the name of the corporation <span style="">was </span>'The <span class="SpellE">Yek</span> Tong Lin Fire and Marine
Insurance Co., Ltd.'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1961</st1:date> the articles of
incorporation were amended pursuant to a certificate <span style="">of </span>the Board of Directors dated <st1:date year="1961" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1961</st1:date> changing the name of the corporation to
'Philippine First Insurance Co., Inc.'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The complaint alleges that the plain­tiff Philippine First
Insurance Co., Inc., doing business under the name of 'The <span class="SpellE">Yek</span>
Tong Lin Fire and Marine Insurance Co., Ltd.' signed as co-maker together with
defendant Maria Carmen <span class="SpellE">Hartigan</span>, CGH, a promissory
note for P5,000.00 in favor of the China Banking Corporation payable within 30
days after the date of the promissory note with the usual banking interest;
that the <span style="">plaintiff <span style="">agreed </span>to act as</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">such co-maker of the promissory note upon the application of the
defendant Maria Carmen <span class="SpellE">Hartigan</span>, CGH, who together
with Antonio F. Chua and Chang Ka Fu, signed an indemnity agreement in favor of
the plaintiff, undertaking jointly and severally, to pay the plaintiff damages,
losses or expenses of whatever kind or nature, including attorney's fees and
legal costs, which the plaintiff may sustain </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">a result of the
execution by the plaintiff </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">co-maker of Maria Carmen <span class="SpellE">Hartigan</span>,
CGH, of the promissory note above-referred to; that as a result of the
execution of the promissory note by the plaintiff and Maria Carmen <span class="SpellE">Hartigan</span>, CGH, the China Banking Corporation delivered to
the defendant Maria Carmen <span class="SpellE">Hartigan</span>, CGH, the sum of
P5,000.00 which said defendant failed to pay in full, such that on August 31,
1961 the same was renewed for P4,500.00 payable within 30 days thereof and as
of November 27, 1961 there was due on account of the promissory note the sum of
P4,559.50 including interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
complaint ends with a prayer for judgment against the defendants, jointly and
severally, for the sum of P4, 559.50 with interest at the rate of 12% per annum
from November 23, 1961 plus P911.90 by </span>way <span style="">of attorney's fees and costs.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Although O. <span class="SpellE">Engkee</span> was made as
party defendant in the caption of the complaint, his name is not mentioned in
the body of <span style="">said </span>complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, his name appears in the <span style="">Annex A attached to the complaint which is
the counter indemnity agreement supposed to have been signed according to the
com­plaint by Maria Carmen <span class="SpellE">Hartigan</span>, CGH, Anto­nio F.
Chua and Chang Ka Fu.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In their answer the defendants deny the allegation that the
plaintiff formerly conducted business under the name and style of 'The <span class="SpellE">Yek</span> Tong Lin Fire and Marine Insurance Co., Ltd.'. They
admit the execution of the indemnity agreement but they claim 'that they signed
said agreement in favor of the '<span class="SpellE">Yek</span> Tong Lin Fire and
Marine Insurance Co., Ltd.' and not in favor of the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They likewise admit that they failed to pay
the promissory note when it fell due but they allege that since their
obligation with the China Banking Corporation based on the promissory note
still subsists, the surety who co-signed the promissory note is not <span style="">en</span><span style="">titled to collect the value thereof from the defendants otherwise they
will be liable for double the amount of their obligation, there being no
allegation that the surety has paid the obligation to the creditor.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"By <span style="">way </span>of
special defense, defendants claim that there is no <span class="SpellE">privity</span>
of contract between the plaintiff and the defendants and consequently, the
plaintiff has no cause of action against them, considering that the complaint
does not allege that the plaintiff and the 'Yak Tong Lin Fire and Marine
Insurance Co., Ltd.' are one and the same or that the plaintiff has acquired
the rights of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties
after the admission of Exhibit A which is the amended articles of incorporation
and Exhibit 1 which is a demand letter dated August 16, 1962 signed by the
manager of the loans and discount department of the China Banking Corporation
showing that the promissory note up to said date in the sum of P4,500.00 was
still unpaid, submitted the case for decision based on the pleadings."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>Under date of 6 October 1962, the Court
of First Instance of <span style="">Manila rendered
the decision appealed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It dismissed the
action with costs </span><span style="">against </span><span style="">the plaintiff Philippine First Insurance Co.,
Inc., reasoning as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“* * * With these
undisputed facts in mind, the parties correctly concluded that the issues for
resolution by this Court are <span style="">as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"(a) </span>Whether or
not the plaintiff is the real party in interest that may validly sue on the
indemnity agreement signed by the defendants and the <span class="SpellE">Yek</span>
Tong Lin Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co., Ltd.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Annex A to plaintiff's complaint); and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b) Whether or not <span style="">a
</span>suit for indemnity or reimbursement may under said indemnity agreement
prosper without plaintiff having yet paid the amount due under said promissory
note.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the first place, the change of name of the <span class="SpellE">Yek</span> Tong Lin Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co., Ltd. to the
Philippine First Insurance Co., Inc. is of dubious validity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such change of name in effect dissolved the
original corpora­tion by a process of dissolution not authorized by our
corporation law (see <span class="SpellE">Secs</span>. 62 and 67, inclusive, of
our Corporation Law).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, said
change of name, amounting to a dis­solution of the <span class="SpellE">Yek</span>
Tong Lin Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co., Ltd., does not appear to have been
effected with the written note or assent of stockholders representing at least
two-thirds of the subscribed capital stock of the corporation, a voting proportion
required not only for the dissolution of a corporation but also for <u>any</u>
amendment of its articles of incorporation (<span class="SpellE">Secs</span>. 18
and 62, Corporation Law). Furthermore, such change of corporate name appears to
be against public policy and may be effected only by express authority of law
(Red Line Transportation Co. v. Rural Transit Co., Ltd., 60 Phil. 549, 555;
Cincinnati Cooperage Co., Ltd., vs. <span class="SpellE">Vate</span>, 26 SW 538,
539; <span class="SpellE">Pilsen</span> Brewing Co. vs. Wallace, 125 NE 714), but
there is nothing in our corpora­tion law authorizing the change of corporate
name in this jurisdiction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the second place, assuming that the change of name of the <span class="SpellE">Yek</span> Tong Lin Fire &amp; Ma­rine Insurance Co., Ltd. to
Philippine <span style="">First </span>Insurance Co.,
Inc., <span style="">as </span>accomplished
on March 8, 1961 is valid, that would mean that the original corporation, the <span class="SpellE">Yek</span> Tong Lin Fire <span style="">&amp;
Marine Insurance Co., Ltd., became dissolved and of no further existence since
March 8, 1961, so that on May 15, 1961, the date the indemnity agreement, Annex
A, </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">executed, said original corporation had no
more power to enter into any agreement with the defendants, and the agreement
entered into by </span>it <span style="">was
ineffective for lack of capacity of said dissolved corporation to enter into
said agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, even if we
hold that said change of name </span><span style="">is
</span><span style="">valid, the fact re</span>mains
that there is no evidence showing that the <span style="">new </span>entity, the Philippine First Insurance
Co., Inc. has, with the consent of the original parties, assumed the obligations
or was assigned the rights of action in the original corporation, the <span class="SpellE">Yek</span> Tong Lin Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co., Ltd.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, there is no <span style="">evidence </span>of conventional subroga­tion
of the plaintiffs in the rights of the <span class="SpellE">Yek</span> Tong <span style="">Line Fire &amp; Marine </span>Insurance Co.,
Ltd. under said indemnity agreement (Arts. 1300, 1301, New Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without such subrogation or assignment of
rights, the herein plaintiff has no cause of action against the defendants, and
is, therefore, not the right party in interest as plaintiff.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Last, but not <span style="">least,
</span>assuming that <span style="">the </span>said
change of name was legal and operated to dissolve the original corporation, the
dissolved corporation, must pursuant to Sec. 77 of our corporation law, be
deemed <span style="">as </span>continuing
as a body corporate for three (3) years from March 8, 1961 for the purpose of
prosecuting and defending suits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is,
therefore, the <span class="SpellE">Yek</span> Tong Lin Fire &amp; Marine
Insurance Co., Ltd. that is the proper party to sue the def­endants under said
indemnity agreement up to March 8, 1964.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Having arrived at the foregoing conclusions, this Court need
not squarely pass upon issue (b) formulated above.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"WHEREFORE,
plaintiff's action </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">hereby dismissed, with costs against the
plaintiff."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In due time, the Philippine First Insurance Company, <span style="">Inc. </span>moved for reconsideration of the
decision aforesaid, but said motion was denied on December 3, 1962 <span style="">in an </span>order
worded thus:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<blockquote>"The motion for reconsideration, dated <st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="11">November 8, 1962</st1:date>, raises no new issue that we
failed to consider in rendering our decision of <st1:date year="1962" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, it gives us an opportunity to amplify our decision as regards
the question of change of name of a corporation in this jurisdiction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We find nothing in our Corporation Law authorizing a change
of name of a corporation organized pursuant to its provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sec. 18 of the Corporation Law authorizes, in
our opinion, amendment to the Articles of Incorporation of a corporation only
as to matters other than its corporate name.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Once a corporation is organized in this jurisdiction by the execution
and registration of its Articles of Incorporation, it shall continue to exist
under <span style="">its </span>corporate
name for the lifetime of <span style="">its </span>corporate
existence fixed in its Articles of Incorpora<span style="">tion, unless sooner legally dissolved (Sec. 11, Corp. Law).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Significantly, change of name is not one of
the methods of dissolution of corporations expressly authorized by our
Corporation Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also significant is the
fact that the po<span style="">wer </span>to change
its corporate name is not one of the general powers conferred on corporations
in this jurisdiction (Sec. 13, Corp. Law).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The enumeration of corporate powers made in our Corporation Law implies
the exclusion of all others (Thomas v. West Jersey R. Co., 101 U.S. 71, 25 L.
ed. 950).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is obvious, in this connection,
that change of name is not one of the powers necessary to the exercise of the
powers conferred on corporations by said Sec. 13 (see <span style="">Sec. </span>14, Corp. Law).</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"To rule that Sec. 18 of our Corporation Law authorizes the
change of name of a corporation by amendment of its Articles of Incorporation
is to indulge in judicial legislation. <span style="">We </span>have examined the cases cited in Volume
13 of American Jurisprudence in support of the proposition that the general
power to alter or amend the charter of <span style="">a</span>
corporation necessarily includes the power to alter the name of a corporation,
and find no justification for said conclusion arrived at by the editors of
American Jurisprudence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary,
the annota<span style="">tions in </span>favor of
plaintiff's view appear to have been based on decisions in cases where the
statute itself expressly authorizes change of corporate <span style="">name </span>by amendment of its Articles of Incorporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The correct rule in harmony with the
provisions of our Corporation Law <span style="">is </span><span style="">well
expressed in </span>an English case <span style="">as </span>follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'After a company has been completely registered without defect or
omission, so as to be incorporated by the name set forth in the deed of
settlement, such incorporated company has not the power to change its name * *
* Although the King by his prerogative might incorporate by a new name, and the
newly named corporation might retain former rights, and sometimes its former
name also, * * * it never appears to be such an act as the corporation could do
<span style="">by itself, </span><span style="">but required the same power as created the
corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Reg. v. Registrar of Joint
Stock Cos. 10 Q.B.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>839, 59 E.C.L. 839).'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The contrary view appears to represent
the minority doctrine, judging from the annotations on decided cases on the
matter.</p>

<blockquote>"The <span class="SpellE">movant</span> invokes <span style="">as </span>persuasive
precedent the action of the Securities Commissioner in tacitly approving the
Amended Articles of In­corporation on <st1:date month="5" day="26" year="1961">May
 26, 1961</st1:date>. We regret that we cannot in good conscience lend approval
to this action of the Securities and Exchange Commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">We </span>find no justification, legal, moral, or
practical, for adhering to the view taken by the Securities and Exchange
Commission­er that the name of a corporation in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
may be changed by mere amendment of its Articles of Incorporation <span style="">as </span>to its
corporate name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">A </span>change of corporate name would serve
no useful purpose, but on the contrary would most probably cause
confusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only a dubious purpose could
inspire a change of <span style="">a </span>corporate name which, unlike a natural person's name, was
chosen by the incorporators themselves; and our Courts should not lend their
assistance to the accomplishment of dubious purposes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, we hereby deny plaintiff's motion for
reconsideration, dated <st1:date month="11" day="8" year="1962">November 8,

<p class="BODY">Appellant's position <span style="">is </span>correct;
all the above assignments of error are well taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The whole <span style="">case, </span>however, revolves around only one question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>May <span style="">a
</span>Philippine corporation change its name and still retain its original
personality and individuality as such?</p>

<p class="BODY">The answer is not difficult to find.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True, under Section 6 of the Corporation Law,
the first thing required to be stated in the Articles of Incorporation of any
corporation <span style="">is
</span><span style="">its name, </span><span style="">but it is only one among many matters equally
if not more important, that must be stated therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it is also required, for <span style="">exam­</span>ple, to state the number and
names of and residences of the incorporators and the residence or location of
the principal office of the corporation, its term of existence, the amount of
its capital stock and the number of shares into which it is divided, etc., etc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Section 18 explicitly permits the articles of
incorporation to be amended thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 18.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Any
corporation may for <span style="">le­</span>gitimate
corporate purpose or purposes, amend its articles of incorporation by a
majority vote of its board of directors or trustees and the vote or written
assent of two-thirds of its members, if it be a non-stock corporation or, if it
be a stock corporation, by the vote or written assent of the stockholders
representing at least two-thirds of the subscribed capital stock of the
corporation: <u>Provided</u>, <u>however</u>, That if such amendment to the
articles of incorporation should consist in extending the corporate existence
or in any change in the rights of holders of shares of any class, or would
authorize shares with <span style="">preferences in any </span>respect superior to those of outstanding
shares of any <span style="">class,
</span>or would restrict the rights of any stockholder, then any stockholder
who did not vote for such corporate action may, within forty days after the
date upon which such action was authorized, object thereto in writing and
demand payment for his shares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, after
such a demand by a stockholder, the corporation and the stockholder <span style="">cannot agree upon the value of his share or
shares at the time such corporate </span>action was authorized, such value
shall be ascertained by three disinterested persons, one of whom shall be named
by the stockholder, another by the corporation, and the third by the two thus chosen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The findings of the appraisers shall be
final, and if their award is not paid by the corporation within thirty days after
<span style="">it is </span>made,
it may be recovered in an action by the stockholder against the
corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon payment by the
corporation to the stockholder of the agreed or awarded price of his share or
shares, the stockholder shall forthwith transfer and assign the share or shares
held by him as directed by the corporation: <u>Provided</u>, <u>however</u>,
That their own shares of stock purchased or otherwise acquired by banks, trust
companies, and insurance companies, should be disposed of within <span style="">six </span>months after acquiring title
thereto.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Unless and until such amendment to the articles of
incorporation shall have been abandoned or the action rescinded, the
stockholder making such demand in writing shall cease to be a stockholder and
shall have no rights with respect to such shares, except the right to receive
payment <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> as aforesaid.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A stockholder shall not be entitled to payment for <span style="">his </span>shares
under the provisions of this section unless the value of the corporate assets
which would remain after such payment would be at least equal to the aggregate
amount of its debts and <span style="">liabilities </span>and
the aggregate par value and/or issued value of the remaining subscribed capital
stock.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A copy of the articles of incorporation <span style="">as </span>amended, duly certified to be
correct by the president and the secretary of the corporation and a majority of
the board of directors or trustees, shall be filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commissioner, who shall attach the same to the original articles of
incorporation, on file in his office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From the time of filing such copy of the amended articles of
incorporation, the corporation shall have the same powers and <span style="">it </span>and the members or stockholders
thereof shall thereafter be subject to the same liabilities as if such
amendment had been embraced in the original articles of incorporation: <u>Provided</u>,

life, the extension shall not <span style="">ex</span>ceed
50 years in any one instance, <u>Provided</u>, <u>further</u>, That the
original articles and amended articles together shall contain all provisions required
<span style="">by law </span>to be set out in the
articles of incorporation: <u>And</u>, <u>provided</u>, <u>further</u>, That
nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize any corporation to
increase or diminish its capital stock or so <span style="">as </span>to effect any rights or actions
which accrued to others between the <span style="">time
</span>of filing the original articles of incorporation and the filing of the
amended articles.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Securities and Exchange Commissioner shall be entitled to
collect and receive the sum of ten pesos for filing said copy of the amended
articles of incorporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>,

articles of incorporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Securities &amp; Exchange Commissioner shall not hereafter file any amendment
to the articles of incorporation of any bank, banking institution, or building

law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(As further amended by Act No.

<p class="BODY">It can be gleaned at once that this section does not only au­thorize
corporations to amend their charter; it also lays down the procedure for such
amendment; and, what is more relevant to the present discussion, it contains
provisos restricting the power to amend when it comes to the term of their
existence and the increase or decrease of the capital stock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no prohibition therein against the
change of name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inference is clear
that such a change is allowed, for if the legislature had intended to enjoin
corporations from chang­ing names, it would have expressly stated so in this
section or in any other provision of the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">No doubt, "(the) name (of a corporation) is peculiarly
import­ant as necessary to the very existence of a corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The general rule as to corporations <span style="">is </span>that each
corporation shall have a name by which it is to <span style="">sue </span>and be sued and do all legal acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The name of a corporation in this respect
designates the corporation in the same manner as the name of an individual
designates the person."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Since <span style="">an </span>individual
has the right to change his <span style="">name </span>under certain conditions, there is no compelling reason why
a corporation may not enjoy the same right.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is nothing sacrosanct in a name when it comes to artificial
beings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sentimental considerations
which individuals attach to their names are not present in corporations and
partnerships.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, as in the case

<p class="BODY">The learned trial judge held that the above-quoted propositions are
not supported by the weight of authority because they are based on decisions in
cases where the statutes expressly authorize change of corporate name by
amendment of the articles of incorporation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">We </span>have
carefully examined these authorities and <span style="">We </span>are satisfied of their relevance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even Lord Denman who has been quoted by His
Honor from In Reg. v. Registrar of Joint Stock Cos. 10, Q.B., 59 E.C.L.
maintains merely that the change of its name "never appears to be such an
act <span style="">as </span>the
corporation could do for itself, but required the same power <span style="">as </span>created a
corporation." What <span style="">seems </span>to have been overlooked, therefore, is that the procedure
prescribed by Section 18 of our Corporation Law for the amendment of corporate
charters is practically identical with that for the incorporation <span style="">itself </span>of a
corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the appealed order of
dismissal, the trial court made the observation that, according to this Court
in Red Line Transportation Co. v. Rural Transit Co. Ltd., 60 Phil. 549, 555,
change of name of a corporation </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">against
public policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We must clarify that such
is not the import of Our said decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What this Court held in that case is simply that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"We know of no law that empowers the Public Service Commission
or any court in this jurisdiction to authorize one corporation to assume the
name of another corporation as a trade name.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Both the Rural Transit Company, Ltd., and the <span class="SpellE">Bachrach</span>
Motor Co., Inc., are Philippine corporations and the very law of their creation
and continued existence requires each to adopt and certify a distinctive
name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The incorporators 'constitute a
body politic and corporate <u><span style="">under the
name stated </span>in the </u><u><span style="">certificate.</span></u><span style="">' </span>(Section 11, Act No. 1459, as
amended.) A corporation <span style="">has </span>the power '<u>of suc</u><u><span style="">cession by its corporate </span>name</u>.' (Section 13, <u><span style="">ibid</span></u><span style="">.) The name of a corporation is therefore essential to its
existence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot change its name
except in the manner provided by the statute.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By that name alone is it authorized to transact business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law gives a corporation no express or
implied authority to assume another name that is <span class="SpellE">unappropriated</span>;
still less that of another corporation, which is expressly set apart for it and
protected </span>by <span style="">the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If any corporation could assume at pleasure
as an unregistered trade name the name of another corporation, this practice
would result in confusion and open the door to frauds and evasions and
difficulties of administration and supervision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The policy of the </span><span style="">law </span><span style="">as
expressed in our corporation statute and the Code of Commerce </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">clearly against such a practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Cf.

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In other words, what We have held to be
contrary to public policy the use by one corporation of the name of another
corporation <span style="">as </span>its trade
name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are certain no one will
disagree that such an act can only "result in confusion and open the door
to frauds and evasions and difficulties of administration and supervision."

one of change of name.</p>

change in its name, <span style="">is in no sense a
