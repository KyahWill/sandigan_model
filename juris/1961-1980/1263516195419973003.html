				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">The specific question </span>that
confronts this Court in <span style="">this </span>petition
for certiorari with preliminary injunction, one that is novel and unique, <span style="">is the competence of </span>a court of first<span style=""> </span>instance to pass upon and entertain a
<span style="">special civil action </span>to prohibit
municipal mayors, presumed to be partial to the candidacy of a congressional
candidate, from appointing spe<span style="">cial
policemen, and agents </span>with the sole purpose, so it is alleged, to <span style="">terrorize </span>voters and <span class="GramE">thus</span> frustrate the basic objective of the Election Code,
which is to assure the free and honest expression of popular will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge, by no means free from
suspicion of sympathy for the other candidate, had <span class="GramE">no</span>
doubt about his power to act in the premises.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">With unusual </span>celerity and
dispatch, he granted <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> the
preliminary injunction sought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
Court is of a different mind.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such an assumption of jurisdiction, considering that the
Commission on Elections is by the Constitution<span style=""> </span>vested with "exclusive charge <span style="">of the </span>enforcement and administration of all laws relative to the
conduct of elections * * *,"<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
is as war with the plain constitutional command the implementing statutory <span style="">provisions, </span>and the hospitable scope
afford such grant of authority so <span style="">clear </span>and
unmistakable in recent decisions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, if respondent Judge were of a similar persuasion, the <span style="">tradition </span><span style="">of impartiality </span><span style="">so </span><span style="">necessary and vital to maintain unimpaired
respect for the judiciary would have been upheld and the doubts, whether
well-founded or not, as to a court lending its prestige and its authority to </span><span style="">favo</span><span style="">r</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">a congressional aspirant would not have
arisen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The decision assailed, as
well as the challenged orders and actuations of respondent Judge, was the
direct consequence of his assumption of jurisdiction over the special civil
action of prohibition with preliminary injunction, filed in his court by now
respondent <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span> <span class="SpellE">Pepito</span>,
one</span> <span style="">of the petitioners in that
case, along with a certain Luis <span class="SpellE">Porcare</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already indicated, had there been more
hesitancy and doubt as to his competence resulting in more circumspection and
less eagerness to act on the matter, respondent Judge might have reached a
contrary conclusion as to the correctness of his assumption of
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The wording of the
petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction, considering the
applicable law, ought to have warned and cautioned respondent Judge against a
determination that he could validly act on the premises.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A recital of the contents
of the petition will explain why.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners,
both of whom were municipal councilors and, according to their petition,
"local leaders and supporters of the candidacy for reelection of
Congressman <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> M. Tan, * * *," alleged
that </span>now <span style="">petitioner <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>, therein named as respondent, with a municipal </span>mayor
of another municipality, a certain Feliciano <span class="SpellE">Larrazabal</span>,
"acting in their official capacities as Municipal Mayors, are known to be
sympathetic to the candidacy of Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Rivilla</span>, and
with grave abuse of discretion have caused to appoint special policemen and
agents to be <span style="">paid </span>from public
funds and to be provided with uniforms and firearms for the sole purpose of
utilizing said special policemen and agents to terrorize and arrest electors
sympathetic to Congressman <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> M. Tan during
the elections of November 9, 1965, in the aforesaid municipalities within the
4th District of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>; * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>It was the contention of petitioners
that respondents, as municipal mayors, acted "without and in excess of
their powers as executives of their respective jurisdictions, as no authority
or sanction has been obtained from the Executive Secretary and the Commission
on Elections, and the exercise of such powers would be detrimental to the
interest of the electorate which they are bound to protect."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
From which it was their conclusion that such "consummation of the intended
acts of respondents in their respective jurisdiction would frustrate the will
of the people to vote freely for the men of their choice during the elections
of <st1:date year="1965" day="9" month="11">November 9, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
As noted earlier, respondent Judge, based on such a petition, decided that he
had jurisdiction and saw to it that an order for the issuance <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> of the preliminary injunction was handed down
to be followed by the writ itself on <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="11">November
 5, 1965</st1:date>, the very same day the action was filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">It thus admits of no doubt that the grievances, if any, of
respondent <span class="SpellE">Pepito</span>, as one of the petitioners in that
special civil action before respondent Judge, arose from an alleged abuse of
authority on the part of now petitioner, respondent therein, <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>, as municipal mayor, in appointing "special
policemen and agents" so that they could be utilized solely for the
purpose of terrorizing and arresting voters sympathetic to one of the
congressional candidates and thus frustrating "the will of the people to
vote freely for the men of their choice'' in the election to be held on
November 9, 1965.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing could be
clearer then than that such an alleged abuse of power was inextricably linked
with the poll to be held four days later.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As noted in the petition, if successful, such a scheme would be a denial
of the right of the electorate to give free expression to their
convictions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is indisputable,
therefore, that on its face, the petitioner sought the avoidance of acts that
would be <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the Election Code, which is
designed primarily to assure that the right to vote on the part of each and
every elector be respected and safeguarded to the fullest extent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the Constitution, the Commission on Elections has
“exclusive charge of the enforcement and administration of all laws relative to
the conduct of elections and shall exercise all other functions which may be
conferred upon it by law.”<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
In the implementation of the above constitutional prerogative, the Commission
on Elections is vested under the Election Code with "direct and immediate
supervision over the provincial, municipal, and city officials designated by
law to perform duties relative to the conduct of elections."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
It could even suspend “from the performance of said duties any of said
officials who shall fail to comply with its instructions, orders, decisions, or
rulings and appoint their temporary substitutes and, upon recommendation of the
Commission, the President of the Philippines may remove any or all such
officials who shall be found guilty of non-<span class="SpellE">feasance</span>,
malfeasance, or misfeasance in connection with the performance of their duties
relative to the conduct of elections."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the special civil action for prohibition before respondent
Judge, its essentially political character is manifest, the main allegation
being the alleged utilization of the power of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>,
municipal mayor named respondent therein, to avail himself of the authority of
his office to appoint special policemen or agents to terrorize voters so that
they would support the congressional candidate of his choice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both under the Constitution and the Revised
Election Code, it is not so much the power, but the duty of the Commission on
Elections to exercise <span style="">supervision over
municipal officials precisely to enforce the Election Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No other agency is better suited to preclude
abuse of authority on the part of local officials, the sanction being that it
could recommend to the President their removal if found guilty of "non-<span class="SpellE">feasance</span>, malfeasance or misfeasance in connection with the
performance of their duties relative to the conduct of elections."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, this Court,
from the creation of the Commission on Elections, has accorded full amplitude
to the wide discretion vested in the Commission</span><span style=""> on Elect</span><span style="">ions in the
performance of its constitutional functions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As early as 1941, in <span class="SpellE">Sumulong</span> v. Commission on
Elections,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> full recognition and awareness of the
crucial role to be played by the Commission in the conduct of elections was
evident, the language employed in the opinion of the then Justice <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos being quite explicit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The Commission on Elections is a constitutional body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is intended to play a distinct and important
part in our scheme of government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
discharge of its functions, it should not be hampered with restrictions that
would be fully warranted in the case of a less responsible organization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission may err, so may this court
also.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be allowed considerable
latitude in dev</span><span style="">ising means</span><span style=""> and methods that will insure the
accomplishment of the great objective for which it was created free, orderly
and honest elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We may not agree
fully with its choice of means, but unles</span><span style="">s</span><span style=""> these are clearly
illegal or constitute gross abuse of discretion this court should not
interfere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Politics is a practical
matter, and political questions must be dealt with realistically not from the
standpoint of pure theory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Commission on Elections, because of its fact-finding facilities, its contacts
with political strate­gists, and its knowledge derived from actual experience
in dealing with political controversies, is in a peculiarly advantageous
position to decide political questions."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">So it has continued up to
the present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To speak of more recent
cases, there was stress laid in Lucas v. </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Canton</span></st1:place></st1:city><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> on its "constitutional duty of
administering and enforcing the laws relative to the conduct of elections with
a view to promoting clean and honest elections the very purpose for which the
Commission on Elections was created constitutional mandate.” <span class="GramE">As
was emphatically observed by Justice <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>,
speaking for the Court:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It would
indeed be absurd to say that the Commission on Elections has a legal duty to
perform and at the same time it is denied the necessary means to perform said
duty."</span> The same trend is evident in three decisions of this Court
in December 1967, <span class="SpellE">Espino</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Demafiles</span> v.
Commission on Elections</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and Estrada v. Navarro,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> a</span><span style="">nd one in January 1968, <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> v. Commission on
Elections.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The question may be asked:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Why should not the judiciary be a co-participant in this particular
instance of enforcing the Election Code as its authority was invoked?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The obvious answer is the literal language of
the Constitution which empowers the Commission on Elections to "have
exclusive charge of the enf<span style="">orcement </span>and
administration of all laws relative to the conduct of the elections." Moreover,
as <span style="">was </span>so aptly observed by the
then Justice Frankfurter, although the situation confronting the United States
Supreme Court was of a different character:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Nothing is clearer than that this controversy concerns matters
that bring courts into immediate and active relations <span style="">with party contests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the
determination of such issues this Court has traditionally held aloof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is hostile to a democratic system to
involve the judiciary in the politics of the people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it is not less pernicious if such
judicial intervention in an essentially political contest be dressed up in the
abstract phrases of the law."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">Then
too reference by analogy may be made to the principle that sustains </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Albano</span></span></st1:place><span style=""> v. <span class="SpellE">Arranz</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For even without the express constitutional
prescription </span>that only <span style="">this
Court may review the decisions, orders and rulings of the Commission on
Elections, it </span>is <span style="">easy to
understand why no interference whatsoever with the performance of the
Commission on Elections of its functions should be allowed unless emanating
from this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The observation of
Acting Chief Justice J.B.L. Reyes in </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Albano</span></span></st1:place><span style=""> v. <span class="SpellE">Arranz</span>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> while not precisely in point, indicates the
proper approach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“It is easy to realize the chaos that would
ensue if the Court of First Instance of each and every province were to arrogate
unto itself the power to disregard, suspend, or contradict any order of the
Commission on Elections; that constitutional body would be speedily reduced to
impotence.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This conclusion finds support from a consideration of weight <span style="">and </span>influence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What happened in this case could be repeated
elsewhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not improbable that
courts of first instance would be resorted to by leaders of candidates or
political factions entertaining the belief whether rightly or wrongly <span class="GramE">that local officials</span> would employ all the power at their
command to assure the victory of their candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if greater care and circumspection, than
did exist in this case, would be employed by judges thus appealed to, it is not
unlikely that the shadow of suspicion as to alleged partisanship would fall on
their actuations, whichever way the matter before them is decided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is <span style="">imperative
that the faith in the impartiality of the judiciary be preserved
unimpaired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whenever, therefore, the
fear may be plausibly entertained that an assumption of jurisdiction would lead
to a lessening of the undi­minished trust </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">should be reposed
in the courts and the absence of authority discernible from the wording of
applicable statutory provisions and the trend of judicial decisions, even if no
constitutional mandate as that present in this case could be relied upon, there
should be no hesitancy in declining to act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">One
last point.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The north expected of a judge, expressed in
language both lucid and forceful by Justice <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>,
bears reiteration:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It has been
said, in fact, that due process of law requires a hearing before an impartial
and disinterested tribunal, and that every litigant is en­titled to nothing
less than the cold neutrality of an impartial judge * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, second only to the duty of
rendering a just decision, is the duty of doing it in a manner that will not
arouse any suspicion as to its fairness and the integrity of the Judge."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">It is difficult enough to attain the
ideal of a presiding judge being "wholly free, disinterested, impartial
and independent," as was noted in the Gutierrez decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It becomes doubly difficult for such
qualities to be in evidence whenever the matter before him is so enmeshed and
so intertwined with partisan </span>considerations <span style="">that even if he could justly lay claim to such attributes, he still
would be susceptible to the suspicion, by whichever group may </span>feel <span style="">that its just claim is rejected, that he
acted not in accordance with the cold dictates of reason, but with the
promptings and urgings of his sympathy and predilections in whatever direction
they may lie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To repeat, the conclusion
reached as to the lack of jurisdiction of the courts of first instance in
litigations of this character would go far in fortifying and bolstering the
belief in the reality of a truly independent judiciary, free from partisanship
and aloof from politics.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
