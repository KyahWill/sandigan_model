WORKERS' FEDERATION (PCWF) AND ELIGIO GALVEZ, PETITIONERS, VS. THE

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The legal issue herein involved, essentially jurisdictional,
stems from facts that follow:</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent company, <span class="SpellE">Avegon</span>,
Incorporated (<span class="SpellE">Avegon</span>), is a domestic corporation
engaged in the manufacture and distribution of television sets and
transistorized radios. Two (2) labor unions are actively operating in said
company:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the <span class="SpellE">Avegon</span>
Employees Association, and (2) the Philippine Communications, Electronics &amp;
Electricity Workers Federation - (PCWF), herein petitioner union.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="17" month="3">March 17, 1965</st1:date>,
petitioner union applied for certification election with the Court of
Industrial Relations (CIR).<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
It alleged, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span> that a majority
of <span class="SpellE">Avegon's</span> rank and file employees - around 202 in
number - are its members; that there has been no certification election during
the past twelve months; and that the appropriate bargaining unit should consist
of the rank and file workers to the exclusion of supervisors, security guards, and
other highly confidential employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the main, it is prayed that petitioner union be directly certified as the sole
and exclusive bargaining agent in the rank and file group.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent company's answer sought dismissal
of the case, grounded on the existence of a three-year collective bargaining
agreement - with the other union, <span class="SpellE">Avegon</span> Employees
Association - which has been in force only for over a year.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">CIR's</span> order of <st1:date year="1965" day="24" month="3">March 24, 1965</st1:date> directed <span class="SpellE">Avegon's</span>
president and/or manager to furnish CIR with a copy of the company's pay­rolls
for the month of February, 1965 together with an alphabetical list of employees
appearing therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">On or about <st1:date year="1965" day="28" month="4">April 28,
 1965</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Avegon</span> laid off seventy of its
employees effective as of the close of business hours on <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1965</st1:date>. Of these, twenty-seven are
members of petitioner union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reason
given for dismissal was depression in business opportunities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of the seventy dismissed employees,
sixty-three have received their separation pay.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Amongst the sixty-three so paid are twenty of the twenty-seven union
members whose dismissal is now being questioned.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1965</st1:date>,
an unfair labor practice charge was file in CIE against <span class="SpellE">Avegon</span>
(CIF Case 519-ULP).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainants were
Francisco Bernardo<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and/or petitioner union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Averment is
there made that respondent company dismissed Bernardo from his job "in
violation of Section 4(a), subparagraphs 1, 2 and 4 of Republic Act 875".</p>

<p class="BODY">This was followed on <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="5">May
 4, 1965</st1:date> with a second unfair labor practice <u>charge</u> (Case
532-ULP).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant therein is herein
petitioner union. Subject thereof is the dismissal of twenty-seven (27) members
of said union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day (May 4), <span class="SpellE">Avegon</span> received a letter from petitioner union protesting
the dismissal just adverted to.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1965</st1:date>,
petitioner union struck, picketed <span class="SpellE">Avegon's</span> premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">Came respondent company's verified complaint of <st1:date year="1965" day="10" month="5">May 10, 1965</st1:date>, in the Court of First
Instance of Manila against herein peti­tioners for damages, with a prayer for
preliminary injunction.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
It was there averred that "on May 5, 1965, at around 3 o'clock in the
morning, without notice, without justifiable cause, in gross bad faith, and
merely for the purpose of harassing plaintiff's<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>already faltering business, defendants declared a strike, imme­diately
proceeded to picket the company's premises, further inducing, enticing, and
cajoling plaintiff's other employees into joining 'them in the same"; that
"defendants prevented, through a show of force, intimidation, veiled
threats, and by barring with their picket lines the company's gates, the other
retained and non­-striking employees from entering the compound and performing
their work therein"; that "plaintiff has not committed any act
constituting unfair labor practice against defendant union or its members
because the dismissal effected by plaintiff was justified, lawful, and without
regard to union affiliations"; and that the strike staged by petitioner
union "is illegal, malicious, and unjustified because there not only
exists no unfair labor practice which might create a labor dispute, but also it
was without proper notice". <span class="SpellE">Avegon</span> prayed for
damages and attorneys' fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It asked
for pre­liminary injunction. On May 24, 1965, this complaint was amended to
include the assertion "that greater injury will be inflicted upon complainant
by the denial of relief than will be 'inflicted upon defend­ants by the
granting of the relief sought"; "that the public officers charged
with the duty to protect complainant's property are unable to furnish adequate
protection"; and' "that plaintiff has no other available adequate
remedy at law".</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="13" month="5">May 13, 1965</st1:date>,
the then vacation judge<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
issued <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> a restraining order,
thus:</p>

<blockquote>"In the meantime and until further orders from this Court,
herein defendants, their agents or representatives, are hereby restrained from
preventing plaintiff's' employees from, entering to and going out from the
company premises and per­forming their appointed labors therein,"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and setting for hearing <span class="SpellE">Avegon's</span> petition for preliminary injunction for <st1:date year="1965" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1965</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30</st1:time> in the morning.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On said date (May 18), petitioners filed an urgent motion to
dismiss and to dissolve the injunction (should be restraining order) alleging
that the trial court had no jurisdiction over the case, and that even if it
had, the injunction so issued is null and void for want of compliance with the
indispensable requisites set forth in Section 9 of the Industrial Peace Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the motion and opposition thereto, and the arguments adduced
by the parties, respondent judge on <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="7">July
 30, 1965</st1:date> directed that a writ of preliminary injunction issue upon
a P1,000-bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was followed on
August 14, 1965 with the corresponding writ directing "the said Philippine
Communications, Electronics Electricity Workers' Federation (PCWF) and all your
attorneys, representatives, agents, and any other person assisting you, [to],
refrain from preventing plaintiff's employees from entering to and going out
from the company premises and performing their appointed labors
therein".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Charging violation both
of the restraining order and injunctive writ, respondent company moved to have
petitioners cited for contempt."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners now seek redress through this present original
petition for certiorari and prohibition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They assert (1) that the Court of First Instance of. <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
has no jurisdiction over the case; and (2) that the writ of preliminary
injunction issued is void for failure to comply with the provisions of Section
9 of Republic Act 875.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court issued a cease-and-desist order upon a P1,000-bond.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners press upon us
the view that the court of first instance is without jurisdiction to entertain <span class="SpellE">Avegon's</span> complaint and to issue the preliminary injunction
writ. And this, because the allegations in the complaint - that a duly
registered labor union went on strike and that "through a show of force,
intimidation, veiled threats and by barring with their picket lines the
company's gates, the said pickets have prevented non-striking employees from
entering the compound and performing their work therein" - show the existence
of a labor dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prevention of
these acts which may be termed as unfair labor practices, so petitioners aver,
is <span class="SpellE">CIR's</span> exclusive concern.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents maintain differently.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their position is that while CIE has jurisdiction over unfair labor
practice cases; yet no unfair labor practice was committed by private
respondents, as specifically averred in the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this, respondents postulate that since
jurisdiction is determined by the allegations in the com­plaint and the
complaint avers that no unfair labor practices were committed, and since the
instant case does not fall under any of the class of cases exclusively within
CIR's jurisdiction,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
then an ordinary court - Court of First Instance of Manila - has juris­diction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Stripped of inconsequential details, averments there are in the
complaint sufficient to bear out the existence of a labor dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, alleged therein, is that petitioner
union protested the <u>dismissal</u> from <span class="SpellE">Avegon's</span>
employ of twenty-seven (27) of its members; that thereafter, it staged a
strike, picketed the com­pany's premises "inducing, enticing, and
cajoling" other employ­ees to join, the strike in the process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A question regarding tenure of employment is
thus clearly tendered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a labor
dispute.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">And, that labor dispute came about because of alleged unfair
labor practices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of record is that on <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1965</st1:date>, or a day before
petitioner union struck, said union not only protested to <span class="SpellE">Avegon</span>,
but also went to CIR, to voice out its grievance concerning the dismissal of
twenty-seven of its members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In CIR
they-charged violation of Sec. 4(a), subparagraphs 1, 2, and 4 of the
Industrial Peace Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not that the trial
court was unaware of the filing of this unfair labor practice charge, Case
532-ULP, and of the other, Case 519-ULP.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These facts were made known to the trial court, offered precisely to
deter its hand from granting preliminary injunction to <span class="SpellE">Avegon</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have laid down the rule that "[t]he criterion, to bring
the case under the jurisdiction of the industrial Court, is whether the acts
complained of in the petition for injunction arose out of or are connected or
interwoven with, the unfair labor practice case (PAFLU vs. <span class="SpellE">Caluag</span>,
G. E. L-9104, Sept. 10, 1956), a question of fact that should be brought to the
attention of the court a quo to entitle it to pass upon the issue whether it
has jurisdiction or not over the case".<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Readily to be seen then is that the acts complained of by <span class="SpellE">Avegon</span> in the court of first instance "arose out of,
or are con­nected or interwoven with" the unfair labor practice charge
herein petitioners previously filed with CIR.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This interrelation was clearly presented to the trial court thru
petitioners' "Urgent Motion To Dismiss and to Dissolve
Injunction".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case, therefore,
is well within the jurisdictional area allocated to CIR and net within the
cognizance of the Court of First Instance of Manila.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">And more, <span class="SpellE">CIR's</span> jurisdiction stays even
if no unfair labor practice case has been filed with CIR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is enough that unfair labor practice is,
involved.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
This renders irrelevant the distinction respondents would wish to make between
an unfair labor practice <u>charge</u> and an unfair labor practice <u>complaint</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In sum, unfair labor practice is the root cause of the whole
controversy now before us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The subject
matter of <span class="SpellE">Avegon's</span> complaint herein, involves acts
emanating from unfair labor practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
has been held that "[f]<span class="SpellE">rom</span> PAFLU vs. Tan to Bay
View Hotel, Inc. vs. Manila Hotel Workers Union, there has been unwavering
adherence to the principle that under the Industrial Peace Act, unfair labor
practice cases fall within the exclusive competence of the Court of Industrial
Relations".<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It thus results that the Court of First Instance of <st1:place>Manila</st1:place>
bee no jurisdiction over Civil Case No. 60864, and cannot issue therein the
ancillary writ of preliminary injunction.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither would the claim
for damages suffice to keep the case within the jurisdictional boundaries of
the court of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That claim
is interwoven with unfair labor practice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The legality or illegality, of the strike must necessarily be litigated
in the unfair labor practice case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
"the right to damages 'would still have to depend on the evidence in the
unfair labor practice case' - in the CIR".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To allow Civil Case No. 60864 to prosper would be to bring about
"split jurisdiction - which is obnoxious to the orderly administration of
justice".<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming that the Court
of First Instance of Manila acquired jurisdiction over the case, was the writ
of preliminary injunction validly issued by said court?</p>

<p class="BODY">Directing our attention first to the restraining order of <st1:date year="1965" day="13" month="5">May 13, 1965</st1:date>, we say that its defects
may no longer be inquired into Reason:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With the issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction on <st1:date year="1965" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1965</st1:date>, the May 13
restraining order has become <span class="SpellE"><u>functus</u></span> <u>officio</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Our inquiry then will be narrowed down to the validity of the
injunctive writ.</p>

<p class="BODY">The controlling statute is Section 9 of the Industrial Peace

<p class="BODY">Where a case involves a labor dispute, "the provisions of

The court here, issued the disputed writ of preliminary injunction "upon
considering said complaint and affidavit by plaintiff, on Incorporated and it
appearing to the satisfaction of the Court that this is a case where a writ of
injunction should issue, sufficient reasons having been <u>alleged</u>".</p>

<p class="BODY">Grounds there are sufficient to overturn this writ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one, there is the absence of a showing

existence or non-existence of the facts required to be shown under the afore-quoted
Section 9(d) and also under Section 9(f) of the Industrial Peace Act, Nor was
notice given "to the chief of those public officials of the x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> city x <span class="SpellE">x</span>

barren as to whether or not complainant exerted "every reasonable effort
to settle such dispute by negotia­tion or with the aid of any available
governmental machinery of mediation or by voluntary arbitration, another
condition exacted by law - this time Section 9(e) of, the Industrial Peace Act
