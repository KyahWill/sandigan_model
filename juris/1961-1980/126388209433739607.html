<p class="BODY">In retrospect, petitioner was one of the defendants in the
afore-mentioned case of "Abraham <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span> <i>vs</i>.
Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>, et al." which was filed by <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span> with the Court of First Instance of Manila<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
for the annulment of the sale made by the Land Tenure Administration (LTA) of
Lot No. 9, Block No. 12 of the <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> Estate, in
favor of Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> and to compel the
Chairman-Administrator of the LTA to execute a deed of sale of the same lot in
favor of <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The facts of the case, as recited in the decision of the trial court,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and the Court of Appeals, are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"* * * On September 30, 1949, the <span class="SpellE">Kapisanan</span>
'<span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Buhay</span>, Inc.' which was
duly authorized by the <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> Estate in Sta. Mesa,
Manila, which has been acquired by the Republic of the Philippines, executed a
contract of sale on a portion of the said estate described as Lot No. 9, Block
No. 12, in favor of the plaintiff Abraham <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the terms of the agreement, plaintiff
bound himself to pay and religiously and regularly paid the installments that
become due and payable thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The size
of the lot had been reduced from 200 square meters to only 120 square meters as
a result of the widening of the street, reducing the value of the property to
only P2<span class="GramE">,785.59</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Of this amount, the sum of P1,407.07 was paid by plaintiff to the <span class="SpellE">Kapisanan</span> '<span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Buhay</span>, Inc.' and the balance of P1,378.52 was paid to the
cashier of the Land Tenure Administration on October 3, 1957.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Having thus completed the payments constituting the purchase
price of the said lot, the Land Tenure Administration became bound to execute
the corresponding document of sale to transfer the ownership of the said lot to
the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, before the same
could be done, one Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> intervened and
claim preferential right over the said property over the plaintiff herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An investigation was conducted by the Land
Tenure Administration as a result of which the Land Tenure Administration
awarded the contract in favor of the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>An appeal from the decision of the Land Tenure Administration was taken
by defendant Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> to the Office of the
President, which Office reversed the decision of the Land Tenure Administration
thru former Executive Secretary Juan <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span> on June 12,
1958, and, subsequently, <span class="SpellE">Natalio</span> Castillo on February
12, 1960, and awarded the contract of the said property to the said defendant
Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>, reserving, however, the right of
reimbursement to the plaintiff, for the payments that he had made on the said
lot by virtue of the contract that was executed between him and the representative
of the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence,
this action."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the lower court rendered a decision dismissing the
complaint but ordering the Land Tenure Administration to refund to Abraham <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span> all the payments that he has made on they property,
as well as to reimburse him for whatever improvement he has made on the
property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon appeal, the Court of
Appeals, on <st1:date year="1967" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1967</st1:date>
reversed the judgment to the trial court, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the appealed decision is hereby reversed; the sale
of Lot No. 9, Block No. 12, of the <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> Estate in
Sta. Mesa, Manila, executed by the Land Tenure Administration in favor of
defendant Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>, as well as No. 59274
issued in the latter's name for the said lot, is hereby cancelled and declared
null and of no effect, and said defendant Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>
is hereby ordered to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> the said lot to
plaintiff-appellant Abraham <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span> with costs of this
ins­tance against defendant Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In reversing the trial court, the Appellate Court stated: </p>

<blockquote>"* * * There is something more than meets the eye or jolts
one's sense of justice and fair­ness when the lot in question, measuring no
more than 125 square meters, after having been sold to, and paid for by,
plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span> on September 30, 1948, was by the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> letter Exhibit 3-Vergara of defendant Executive
Secretary <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span> of June 12, 1958 -- or some ten years
later-- awarded to defendant <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>, who has
allegedly a better right to purchase the same than plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The first thing that we could hardly understand in the
appealed decision of the lower Court is the following portion thereof found at
page 52 of the Record on Appeal:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'It
(meaning plaintiff's complaint) is not an action to reverse, review or in any
way pass upon the merits of the decision of the Executive Secretary (referring
to said Exhibit 3-Vergara).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is an
independent action and must, therefore, be decided on the merits.' Although the
parties' recorded pleadings and evidence (especially those of plaintiff) do not
say so in so many words, their precise purpose is to inquire into the
correctness of the said Exhibit 3-Vergara because it is there that the lot in
question was awarded to defendant <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> by his
co-defendant Executive Secretary <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span>, in preference
to plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span>, hence the latter's present action
could have no other purpose than to have the said actuation of defendant
Executive Secretary <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span> reviewed and reversed –
contrary to the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> statement of the lower
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had the latter reviewed the said
Exhibit 3-Vergara, it would have found the assumptions or conclusions reached
therein not fully warranted by the facts and circumstances of record and
accordingly unfair to plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span> and overly
partial to defendant <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>, as will in a moment be
shown.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">''(</span>1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
the said Exhibit 3-Vergara, it is insinuated that there is no record that
plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span> paid the back installments for the
said lot in the amount of P1,214.80 as follows:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'Thru a letter dated May 3, 1953, <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span> was
informed by the Bureau of Lands to pay his back installments amounting to
P1,214.80 and to sign a new agreement with the said office to replace his
contract with the <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Buhay</span>,
Inc..<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The result of this request is not
of record.' The insinuation is without basis because it is now admitted on all
sides that plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span> fully paid for the said
lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, as already
above quoted, the lower Court found that 'Under the terms of the agreement,
plaintiff bound himself to pay and <u>religiously and regularly paid the
installments that became due and payable thereon</u>.' (Underscoring supplied.)
Further, the lower Court said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Having
thus completed the payments constituting the pur­chase price of said <span class="GramE">lot,</span> the Land Tenure Administration became bound to execute
the corresponding document of sale to transfer the ownership of the said lot to
the plaintiff.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another ground in
said Exhibit 3-Vergara why the lot in question was awarded to defendant <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>, in preference to plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span>,
is that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Although <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span>
was sold the lot by the <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Buhay</span>,
Inc., presumably because he was the tenant on record of the lot at the time he
purchased the same, he did not satisfy the requirements of a <i>bona fide </i>tenant
as defined in LTA Adm. Order No. 2 * * *.' We cannot <span class="GramE">subscribed</span>
to the soundness of this ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
said Exhibit 3-Vergara admits that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'The
terms and conditions of the sale were embodied in Agreement to Sell (<span class="SpellE">Kasunduan</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">sa</span></span>
<span class="SpellE">Pagbibili</span>) No. 069 executed on September 30,
1948.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Rugue</span>
bought his rights thereto from Mr. and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> <span class="SpellE">Caguiat</span>, original lessees of the lot.' If plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span> was disqualified from buying the said lot on the
alleged ground that he was not a <i>bona fide </i>tenant as defined in LTA Adm.
Order No. 2, why was the said sale made to plaintiff at all on <st1:date year="1948" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1948</st1:date>?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the date just mentioned, the validity of
the said sale had all along been assumed and never questioned, since 'Thru a
letter dated May 3, 1953, <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span> was informed by the
Bureau of Lands to pay his back installments amounting to P1,214.80 and to sign
a new agreement with the said office to replace his contract with the <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Buhay</span>, Inc..’ and 'On October
1, 1957, the Chairman of the Land Tenure Administration dismissed the claim of
both <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> and <span class="SpellE">Retoma</span> and
gave due course to the Agreement to Sell in favor of Abraham <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span>' (Exhibit 3-Vergara).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These admitted facts, to our mind, now <span class="SpellE">estop</span>
defendants from assailing the validity of the sale of the lot in question to
plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span>, especially if it is considered that
the said sale was for the first time <span class="SpellE">disauthorized</span> by
defendant Executive Secretary <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span> in said Exhibit
3-Vergara on June 12, 1958 only – that is, some ten (10) years after plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span> had fully paid for the said lot and had all along
considered himself the owner thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the said payment, the lapse of the said period of about ten (10)
years, and plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Rugue's</span> belief in good faith
that he had already acquired ownership of the lot in question – since he has
never been charged with any irregularity or bad faith in purchasing the said
lot – we cannot in all good conscience now consent that he be deprived thereof
by defendant <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>, who filed his claim to the said
lot with the Land Tenure Administration only on November 9, 1956, with full
knowledge that it was already sold to plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another ground of
defendant Executive Secretary <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span> for <span class="SpellE">disauthorizing</span> the sale of the said lot to plaintiff is
that '<span class="SpellE">Rugue</span> does not appear to have materially or
physically possessed any portion of the lot in question from the time he
purchased the same up to the time <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> filed his
claim thereto' (Exhibit 3-Vergara).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
ground, to our mind, is met and overcome by plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Rugue's</span>
<span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span> testimony summarized at page 6 of his
brief as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'After the execution
of Exhibit 'A' (<span class="SpellE">Kasunduan</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pagbibili</span>), plaintiff built a fence, barb wire on the
land which was two meters deep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
filled gradually with stones, sand and gravel and a barong-barong was erected
thereon, in which plaintiff's <span class="SpellE">encargado</span> lived (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 37, 38, 39 and 86, Oct. 3, 1961; <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., p. 7, Nov. 21, 1961).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff spent P1<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>
for filling the lot; P300 for the barong-barong; and P250.00 for the fence (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., p. 56, <st1:date year="1961" day="3" month="10">Oct.
 3, 1961</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff was
paying the taxes on the lot (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., p. 31, <st1:date year="1961" day="3" month="10">Oct. 3, 1961</st1:date>).' This testimony is
corroborated by the affidavit of plaintiff's <span class="SpellE">encargado</span>
<span class="SpellE">Escolastico</span> <span class="SpellE">Retoma</span> which is
found at pages 13-14 of the Record on Appeal, being marked Annex A of
plaintiff's complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said acts of
possession of plaintiff <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Rugue</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> exercised personally and through another on his behalf,
certainly took place long before defendant <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>
laid claim to said lot on <st1:date year="1956" day="9" month="11">November 9,
 1956</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even from the
standpoint of possession, therefore, plaintiff is better entitled to <span class="GramE">said</span> lot than defendant <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(4)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Still another reason
of defendant Executive Secretary <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span> for <span class="SpellE">disauthorizing</span> the sale of the lot in question in favor of
plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span>, and awarding the same instead to
defendant <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> is that the former (plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span>) 'has no immediate need for it as he now has a house
and lot located at <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span>,
worth P58<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> which he acquired in 1955.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He contends he still needs the lot to donate
to his landless mother-in-law, who rents a house in <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a matter of intent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That he intends to speculate on the lot in
question is not too remote a possibility.' <span class="GramE">(Exhibit
3-Vergara).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to this
point, plaintiff's explanation at page 7 of his brief is as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'In the year 1953, with plaintiff's saving of
around P8<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, he was able to buy a house and lot
in <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span>, Manila, for P58,000.00 by borrowing
P20,000.00 from the bank, more than P10,000.00 from Manila Times, and the rest
from his brother (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. pp. 77 &amp; 78, Oct. 3,
1961).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three families are living in this
house, plaintiff's son who is now married, his brother who loaned the money and
plaintiff's family (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., p. 97, <st1:date year="1961" day="3" month="10">Oct. 3, 1961</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff still needs the land in question
for his married son (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. p. 97, Oct. 1961).'
Assuming that in 1953 or 1958 plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span>
acquired this house and lot in <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span> for P58<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, this does not operate as a forfeiture of his right
to the lot in question which he brought as far back as <st1:date year="1948" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1948</st1:date>, or some seven to nine years
before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one thing, the acquisition
of the <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span> property does not show affluence on
plaintiff's part since most of the amount he used <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
was only borrowed by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For another, a
purchaser of a lot from the <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> Estate, like herein
plaintiff, cannot be prohibited from or penalized for acquiring other
properties or improving his lot in the future, especially if he is a family
man, otherwise there would be an illegal curtailment of legitimate en­terprise,
initiative and ambition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The undisputed
fact is that when plaintiff acquired the said lot on September 16, 1948, he was
poor and landless and therefore qualified to make the said purchase, so much so
that the said sale was duly made in his favor and even the Land Tenure Administration
recognized the validity thereof until some ten years later when it was <span class="SpellE">disauthorized</span> by defendant Executive Secretary <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span> for the dubious reasons stated in Exhibit 3-Vergara.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(5)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the same
Exhibit 3-Vergara, it is also stated that 'He (plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span>)
failed to construct a house thereon in violation of the terms of the Agreement
to Sell (Sec. 11, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">B).’</span>
An examination of the said Section 11 discloses that plaintiff has a period of
ten (10) years from the purchase of the said lot within which to construct a
house thereon for himself or his family.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It will be noted, however, that before the expiration of the said
period, defendant <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> filed his claim to the said
lot, hence plaintiff could not be blamed for not constructing the said house while
the said claim has not been acted upon, as it was in fact favorably acted upon
only on <st1:date year="1958" day="12" month="6">June 12, 1958</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the undisputed fact again is that, as
testified to by plaintiff, he had introduced improvements upon the said lot
consisting of a fence, barbed wire, fillings of stone, sand and gravel and a
barong-barong in which his <span class="SpellE">encargado</span> <span class="SpellE">Escolastico</span> <span class="SpellE">Retoma</span> lived, for all
of which he spent no less than P2,000.00.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(6)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only reason
given by defendant Executive Secretary <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span> in
awarding the said lot to defendant <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>, which was
concurred in by the lower Court in its decision, is that '<span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>
has shown that he is landless, and a resident of the same estate since birth.'
(Exhibit 3-Vergara) Note that <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> is allegedly a
resident of the said <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> Estate since birth – not
a <i>bona fide </i>occupant of the lot in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this statement in Exhibit 3-Vergara and in
the appealed decision is true, then why did said defendant <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>
not apply for another unoccupied lot among the many lots in that extensive estate,
instead of picking on the preserve of another, namely, the lot in question
which he knew to be already claimed by and sold to plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span> since September 16, 1948, and occupied for and on
behalf of the latter by <span class="SpellE">Escolastico</span> <span class="SpellE">Retoma</span>?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only answer
to this question could only mean that said defendant <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>
has not acted in good faith in filing his said claim to the lot in question on <st1:date year="1956" day="9" month="11">November 9, 1956</st1:date>, that is, some seven
or eight years after the said lot was sold to herein plain­tiff.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The appealed decision being entirely based on the said letter
Exhibit 3-Vergara of defendant Executive Secretary <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span>,
and as we find the grounds relied upon in the said exhibit to be insufficient
to overthrow the rights which plaintiff has acquired over the lot in question,
we are fully and strongly of the persuasion that plaintiff's appeal from the
said decision should be sustained."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="23" month="12">December 23, 1967</st1:date>,

address." He then prayed that he be relieved from the "mistakes of
counsel" on the following grounds:</p>

<blockquote>“(a)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">This</span>
case involves the award of land to the landless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The strict application of the rule refusing
relief for mistakes of counsel and imputing said mistakes of counsel to the <span class="GramE">parties</span> litigants will defeat the primordial government
policy of extending relief to the landless.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“(b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The apparent
negligence of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span> is not entirely without
suspicion that it was not procured by appellant <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records show that appellant <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span> inexplicably delayed by more than two years his
filing of a motion for execution of the judgment (as previously shown) – a
delay obviously motivated by the scheme to prevent <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
from being able to seasonably petition for relief."<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

allowance of the petition the following:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span> did not acquire any legal right

of <span class="SpellE">Rugue's</span> failure to construct a house on said lot

decision of the Chairman-Administrator of the Land Tenure Administration on

Castillo, on February 12, 1960, reversed the decision of the Land Tenure
Administration and awarded "the contract of the property to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> * * *", which decision is thus the final
administrative decision of the controversy; (3) <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>
was qualified to acquire the lot in question while <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span>
did not have the qualification of a <i>bona fide</i> tenant; and (4) there was
no ground for annulling the contract of sale to <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Supplemental reasons were also presented, all
to the effect that in rendering the questioned decision, the Court of Appeals
failed to consider the overriding policy of the Government in acquiring the <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> Estate, which was to give assistance to the
landless, and that the sale to <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span> contravened said
policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>

<p class="BODY">Apprehensive that the lower court, upon receipt of the foregoing
Resolution, would lift its order staying execution of the decision of the Court
of Appeals in CA-G. R. No. 31186-R, petitioner filed the present petition,
contending that said decision of the Court of Appeals "was rendered
through a patent grave abuse of discretion amounting to want of jurisdiction or
excess of jurisdiction" and, consequently, the decision is null and void
and its execution can be restrained by the extraordinary writ of prohibition.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his Memorandum, petitioner points out the instances wherein he
believes the Court of Appeals committed grave abuse of discretion or exceeded
its jurisdiction, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) when
"it attacked collaterally" the decision dated June 12, 1958 of the
Office of the President, thru Executive Secretary <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span>,
the correctness of which was not the sole issue raised before the Court of
First instance of Manila in the civil action for annulment of sale, specific
performance and writ of preliminary injunction (Civil Case No. 45780, Abraham <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span> vs. Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>, et
al.), after the said decision of Executive Secretary <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span>
has long become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>; (2) when it
rendered a decision based<span style="">&nbsp; </span>on "<span class="SpellE">mis</span>-restated facts" contrary to the facts of the case
on record; (3) when it "honored" the sale of the questioned Lot No.
9, Block No. 12 of the <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> Estate, Sta. Mesa,
Manila, under the deed of conditional sale (<span class="SpellE">Kasunduan</span>
<span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">Paghibili</span>) executed
between the "<span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Buhay</span>,

<p class="BODY">The function of prohibition is to prevent the unlawful and
oppressive exercise of legal authority and to provide for a fair and orderly

It is directed against proceedings that are done without or in excess of

For grave abuse of discretion to prosper as a ground for prohibition, it must
first be demonstrated that the lower court has exercised its power in an
arbitrary or despotic manner, by reason of passion or personal hostility, and
it must be so patent and gross as would amount to an evasion, or to a virtual
refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act in contemplation of law.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">With the foregoing criteria in mind, <span class="GramE">We</span>
shall now examine the instances indicated by the petitioner to support his
claim that the Court of Appeals had acted with grave abuse of discretion or in
excess of its jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is petitioner's view that when the Court of Appeals in effect
set aside the effects of the decision of Executive Secretary <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span>, dated <st1:date year="1958" day="12" month="6">June 12,
 1958</st1:date>, which according to him had long become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, it exceeded or transcended its appellate
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The thrust of his argument
is that the Court of Appeals was precluded from review­ing the decision of
Executive Secretary <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span> on the ground of <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></i> – a
principle also applicable to judicial acts of public, executive or administrative
officers and boards.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not think that this ingenious argument is legally
tenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It ignores the circumstance
that <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span>
</i>was never raised as a defense by the petitioner in the afore-mentioned
Civil Case No. 45780, the decision of which was reversed by the Appellate Court
in CA-G. <span class="GramE">R. No. 31186-R.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be remembered that in the Answer of
petitioner Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>, dated January 5, 1961, to
the complaint of Abraham <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span> for annulment of sale
and specific performance in Civil Case No. 45780, his defense was that the
resolutions of the Executive Secretary, dated June 12, 1958 and February 12,
1960, (1) <i>reversing</i> the decision of the Land Tenure Administration in
LTA Case No. 253 dismissing the claims, of <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>
and Retold over Lot No. 9, Block No. 12 of the <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>
Estate and (2) <i>awarding</i> the said property to him, "is based on law
and equity" because (a) <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span> was not a <i>bona
fide</i> tenant as defined in LTA Administrative Order No. 2; (b) <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span> has no immediate need of the land in question as he
acquired another house and lot at <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> Street, <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span>, Manila; (c) "to convey to plaintiff the lot in
question would be repugnant to the spirit of the Land Reform Act 'to distribute
as many family size farms to as many landless citizens as possible'"; and
(d) "plaintiff failed to comply with the terms of the agreement to sell
executed between him and the <span class="SpellE">Kapisanang</span> '<span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Buhay</span>, Inc.'" as he failed
to construct a house on said property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nowhere in the afore-mentioned answer has <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>
ever asserted that the decisions of Executive Secretary <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span>,
as affirmed by Executive Secretary Castillo, was a final adjudication of the
property rights of <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span>
and, therefore, the action of <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span> was barred under
the doctrine of <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither has <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>
invoked <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></i>
in his brief when the case was appealed to the Court of Appeals in CA-G. R. No.
31186-R, although extensive discussion was made thereon regarding the power of
the Executive Secretary to reverse the decision of the Chairman of the Land
Tenure Administration and the correctness and validity of the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> decision reversing that of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor has he questioned, in his petition for <i>certiorari</i>
with this Court on <st1:date year="1970" day="30" month="7">July 30, 1970</st1:date>
in G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-32309, the jurisdiction of the Court of
Appeals in reversing the trial court's judgment.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, the substance of his
petition was that the Executive Secretary did not abuse his discretion in
awarding the lot to <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> in preference to <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span> who "(a) had no new contract with the Government
as he was not a member of <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Buhay</span>,
Inc.; (b) had no previous consent of the Rural Progress Administration to buy;
(c) had never occupied the lot in question for more than 10 years by then * *
*; (d) had instead bought himself another house in <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span>
for P58,000.00." Thus, he emphasized therein not the lack of authority of
the respondent Court of Appeals to cancel and declare null and of no effect the
sale of Lot No. 9, Block No. 12, of the <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> Estate
in Sta. Mesa, Manila, executed by the Land Tenure Administration in favor of
Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>, as well as Transfer Certificate of
Title No. 59274 issued in <span class="SpellE">Vergara's</span> name, but the fact
that the Appellate Court "has so far departed from the accepted and usual
course of judicial proceedings".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was predicated on his argument that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span> did not
acquire any legal right over the "<span class="SpellE">Kasunduan</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">Pagbibili</span>" with <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Buhay</span>, Inc. because of his
failure to physically possess said lot and to construct a house therein as
required by paragraph 11 of the agreement; (2) the decision of the
Chairman-Administrator of the Land Tenure Administration on October 1, 1957
denying the claim of <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> and <span class="SpellE">Retoma</span>
and sustaining the validity of the sale to <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span> was
not final as it was reversed by the Executive Secretary; (3) <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> was quali­fied to acquire said land in question;
and (4) there is no ground for annulling the contract of sale to <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Even in the "Supplemental Reasons for Allowance of Petition
for <i>Certiorari</i>" filed by <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> with
this Court on </span><st1:date year="1970" day="14" month="8"><span class="GramE">August 14, 1970</span></st1:date><span class="GramE"> in G. R. No.</span>
<span class="GramE">L-32309, said party never raised in issue the alleged lack or
excess of jurisdiction of the Appel­late Court in rendering the afore-mentioned
judgment.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is rather too late in the day for petitioner to question now
the lack or excess of jurisdiction of the Appellate Court in rendering the said
decision on the alleged ground that said Court is precluded from reversing the
award of the lot on, the ground of <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
should be obvious to petitioner that the defense of <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i>
<span class="SpellE">judicata</span></i> when not interposed either in a motion
to dismiss or in an answer is deemed waived.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Such waiver is rendered more evident by the fact that in Civil Case No. 45780
for annulment of sale and specific performance, the Executive Secretary was not
only made a party-defendant but the validity of the decisions of Executive
Secretaries <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span> and Castillo, dated June 12, 1958
and February 12, 1960, were squarely placed in issue as having been rendered
"without legal or equitable justification whatsoever".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the decision of Executive Secretary
<span class="SpellE">Pajo</span> was presented as evidence by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> himself (Exhibit 3-Vergara).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering such circumstance and the fact
that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> had not invoked the defense
of <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i style=""> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">judicata</span></span><span style="">, </span></i>it was properly within the
appellate authority Of the Court of Appeals to pass upon said decision of the
Executive Secretary to ascertain whether or not the same was supported by
substantial evidence,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, the present petition seeks to litigate anew the
questions of both fact and law raised by the parties in the Court of First
Instance of Manila and in the Court of Appeals, and finally resolved by this
Court as explained above.</p>

aforesaid issues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctrine of <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></i> has
already set in because of the finality not only of the decision of the Court of
Appeals, the execution of which is being sought here to be prohibited, but also
of the resolution of this Court in G. R. No. L-32309, afore-mentioned,
sustaining said decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">The doctrine of <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span> </i>has two (2) aspects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first is the effect of a judgment as a
bar to the prosecution of a second action upon the same claim, demand or cause
of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second aspect is that it
precludes the <span class="SpellE">relitigation</span> of a particular fact or
issue in another action between the same parties on a different claim or cause
of action.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The general rule precluding the <span class="SpellE">relitigation</span>
of material facts or questions which were in issue and adjudicated in a former
action is commonly applied to all matters essentially connected with the
subject matter of the litigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
it extends to questions "necessarily involved in an issue, and necessarily
adjudicated, or necessarily implied in the final judgment, although no specific
finding may have been made in reference thereto, and although such matters were
directly referred to in the pleadings and were not actually or formally
presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under this rule, if the
record of the former trial shows that the judgment could not have been rendered
without deciding the particular matter, it will be considered as having settled
that matter as to all future actions between the parties, and if a judgment
necessarily presupposes certain premises, they are as conclusive as the
judgment itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reasons for the rule are
that a judgment is <span class="GramE">an adjudication</span> on all the matters
which are essential to support it, and that every proposition assumed or
decided by the court leading up to the final conclusion and upon which such
conclusion is based is as effectually passed upon as the ultimate question

(Italics supplied.)</p>

<p class="BODY">It is urged by petitioner that the facts of the case as stated in
the questioned decision of the Court Of Appeals are "<span class="SpellE">mis</span>-restated"
in that there are some portions thereof which do not reflect the true
facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, it is rather too late for
the petitioner to raise this point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In fact, having adopted the very same facts, as stated by the Court
of Appeals in its decision, in his petition for <i>certiorari</i> with this
Court in G. R. No.</span> L-32309, he is now <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>
from raising such question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any
event, no excess or want of jurisdiction is herein involved which would justify
the <span class="SpellE">availment</span> of the extraordinary legal remedy of
prohibition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The same conclusion is reached with regard to petitioner's
contention that the Court of Appeals erred when it honored the sale of the
questioned lot in favor of Abraham <span class="SpellE">Rugue</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a Matter that has to do with the
merits of the case which petitioner is now precluded from <span class="SpellE">relitigating</span>
in view of the principle of <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></i>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Certainly, such question is not a proper subject of a petition for
prohibition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The office of the extraordinary remedy of prohibition is not to
correct errors of judgment but to prevent or restrain usurpation by inferior
tribunals and to compel them to observe the limitation of their jurisdictions.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
It is a preventive remedy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its function
is to restrain the doing of some act to be done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not intended to provide a remedy for
acts already accomplished.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
This remedy will lie only to "prevent an encroachment, excess, usurpation,
or improper assumption of jurisdiction on the part of an inferior court or
tribunal, or to prevent some great outrage upon the settled principles of law
and procedure; but, if the inferior court or tribunal has jurisdiction of the
person and subject-matter of the controversy, the writ will not lie to correct
errors and irregularities in procedure, or to prevent an erroneous decision or
an enforcement of an erroneous judgment, or even in cases of encroachment,
usurpation, and abuse of judicial power or the improper assumption or
jurisdiction, where an adequate and applicable remedy by appeal, writ of error,
<i>certiorari</i>, or other prescribed methods of review are available."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
It may be safely asserted as a settled law, that "unless the court sought
to be prohibited is wanting in jurisdiction over the class of cases to which
the pending case belongs or is attempting to act in excess of its jurisdiction
in a case of which it rightfully has cognizance, the writ will be denied."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

"* * * Private right and public welfare unite in demanding that a question
once adjudicated by a. court of competent jurisdiction shall, except in direct
proceedings to review; be considered as finally settled and conclusive upon the
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Interest <span class="SpellE">reipublicoe</span>
<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">ut</span></span><span class="GramE"> sit</span>

</span>But in order to make this finality rightful it should appear that the
question was distinctly put in issue; that the parties presented their
evidence, or at least had an opportunity to present it, and that the question
was decided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cases of an alleged prior
adjudication have frequently been presented in this court and the scope of a
plea thereof fully determined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
leading case of <i>Cromwell v. Sac County</i>, 94 <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.
  S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> 351, 352, 24 L. ed. 195, 197, we said:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">'In considering the operation of
this judgment, it should be borne in mind, as stated by counsel, that there is
a differ­ence between the effect of a judgment as a bar or <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
against the prosecution of a second action upon the same claim or de­mand, and
its effect as an <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> in ano­ther action between the
same parties upon a different claim or cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the former case, the judgment, if rendered
upon the merits, constitutes an absolute bar to a subsequent action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is <span class="GramE">a finality</span> as
to the claim or demand in controversy, concluding parties and those in <span class="SpellE">privity</span> with them, not only as to every matter which was
offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but as to any
other admissible matter which might have been of­fered for that purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, for example, a judgment rendered upon a
promissory note is conclusive as to the validity of the instrument and the
amount due upon it, al­though it be subsequently alleged that perfect defenses
actually existed, of which no proof was offered, such as forgery, want of
consideration, or payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If such defen­ses
were not presented in the action, and established by competent evidence, the
sub­sequent allegation of their existence is of no legal consequence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment is as conclusive, so far as
future proceedings at law are concerned, as though the defenses never
existed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The language, therefore, which
is so often used, that a judgment <span class="SpellE">estops</span> not only as
to every ground of recovery or defense actually presented in the action, but
also as to every ground which might have been presented, is strictly accurate,
when applied to the demand or claim in contro­versy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such demand or claim, having passed into
judgment, cannot again be brought into litigation between the parties in
proceed­ings at law upon any ground whatever."'' <span class="GramE"><i>(<span class="SpellE">Fayerwather</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Ritch</span>, </i>195 </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE">U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE">
