<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
returns in the above-mentioned </span>precincts were contested as a result of
the shooting incident on November 15, 1967 in the vicinity of polling <span style="">places </span>Nos.
18, 19, 21 and 22 located in <span class="SpellE">schoolbuilding</span> at <span class="SpellE">Namuac</span> <span style="">barrio </span>where then Vice Mayor Manuel Franco <span style="">was </span>killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
inspectors had fled and left open and unsealed some <span style="">of the election </span>documents, ballot boxes
and election <span style="">paraphernalia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">discovered </span>the following day that some
election returns were either tampered or sealed or placed inside the <span class="GramE">envelopes,</span> and the <span style="">tally sheets </span>and tally boards were all
missing.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Commission on Elections (<span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>)
in the first <span class="SpellE"><u>Pacis</u></span> case had ordered that
canvassing be held at the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> office in
Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proceedings there were however
stopped as a result of the institution of the first case before this Court
which raised issues different from those to be discussed in the present
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this Court's decision in the
first <span class="SpellE"><u>Pacis</u></span>, case, we issued the following
directives to <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span> "(2) to conduct an investigation to
ascertain the true returns from Precincts 18, 19, 21 and 22 of Sanchez Mira;
and thereafter the board of canvassers [to be constituted by <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>] to use the true returns for <span style="">purposes of canvass </span>in said precincts;
and (3) to order the board <span style="">of can</span>vassers
to canvass the election returns from all the precincts of Sanchez Mira, and
thereafter, to proclaim the <u>winning</u> candidate for the office of Mayor of
said municipality".</p>

<p class="BODY">It was thus <span style="">in </span>pursuance
of the above orders that <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> initiated an
investigation - Case No. <span class="GramE">RR-607 - to ascertain the true
returns from Precincts 18, 19, 21 and 22.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Elicited during the investigation and included in <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> report of May 11, 1968, the following facts
relating to the election returns of the respective precincts are quite
revealing, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>Precinct No. 18</u>: - Here, the copies of the election
returns for the Commission on Elections, <span style="">the provincial </span>treasurer, and the municipal treasurer contain
erasures and superimpositions with respect to the votes for mayor while the
copy pertaining to the ballot box was clean and without any alteration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It
has been </span>observed that said ballots <span style="">box </span>copy was placed inside the proper envelope (CE Form 58,
bearing SN 47118), closed with paper seal No. 516360, properly signed by all
the board members; and that the election return itself (CE Form 42) <span style="">was intact </span>or
duly sealed, bearing paper seal No. 516352, and legibly signed by all the board
members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For votes of mayor, this clean
copy reads as follows:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Negre</span>, <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> - 39 (in words
and figures); and <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span>
- 110 (in wards and figures).</blockquote>

<blockquote>It was elicited from the chairman of Precinct 18, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagodon</span>, upon intensive
questioning by <span style="">all </span>the
Commissioners and counsels for both parties, that the board was able to finish
and to sign the elec­tion returns; that the copy for the ballot box was duly <span style="">sealed </span>and placed inside the envelope,
then <span style="">deposited in </span>the ballot
box; that after the shooting, the board left the other election returns
unsealed; that when they returned on the 16th of November, they placed all the
election documents inside the ballot box, and the following day they retrieved
the election returns and distributed them to the proper offices.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The foregoing testimony of the chairman explains why the ballot box
copy of the election return was not altered, whereas the three other copies
were tampered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission,
therefore, believes that said ballot box copy reflects the true result of the
election in Precinct 18, Sanchez Mira, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>, <span style="">as regards </span>the
mayoralty votes.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Precinct </u><u><span style="">No. 19:</span></u><span style=""> - </span>The election returns for this
precinct, copies for the Commission on Elections, the provincial treasurer, and
the municipal treasurer, all contain erasures and superimpositions with respect
to the mayoralty votes only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although
the ballot box copy appears to be clean, yet the entries of votes are very blurred
or illegible not only with respect to the votes for mayor but also for all
other offices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, not one of the
four copies of the election return for <span style="">Precinct
</span>19 can be <span style="">of service in the canvassing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
tally sheets<span style=""> </span>and tally boards no
longer exist.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The chairman of this precinct, <span class="SpellE">Violeta</span> <span class="SpellE">Barase</span>, declared under oath that as far as she could
remember <span class="SpellE">Negre</span> obtained 73 votes, while <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> got 89 votes; that one of the copies of the returns
they prepared was erased by an armed man who entered the polling place on <span class="SpellE">Novem</span> <span class="SpellE">ber</span> 15, 1967 and this was
placed inside the ballot box; that when shown the ballot box copy she could
hardly read the votes for mayor, claiming there are erasures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also identified a certificate of votes
issued and signed by all the board members of Precinct 19, stating that <span class="SpellE">Negre</span> obtained 73 votes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The poll clerk of this precinct, William Valdez, corroborated the
testimony of the aforesaid chairman as regards the erased copy of <span style="">the </span>election returns placed in the
ballot box, which he could not also read when shown to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also admitted having written the figure
'9' on the vote for <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> appearing in the Commission
copy; and made a conclusion that if the certificate of votes issued the board
shows that '73' votes were obtained by <span class="SpellE">Negre</span> and
because 164 voters actually voted in that precinct, then <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>
could obtain only around '89' votes and not '159' <span style="">as </span>appearing in the tampered copies of the election returns. </blockquote>

<blockquote>When all the copies of the election return for Precinct 19 were
submitted to the NBI for examina­tion, the opinion of <span style="">its </span>Questioned Documents Division <span style="">as regards </span>the entries of votes for <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>
is as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">'With regards to the entries opposite the name
reading as PACIS, <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> of <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.</span>
'HH-6', 'EE-5' and 'BB2-b', <u><span style="">the
original erased words and figures that could (be) deciphered thereon are
'eighty-nine' and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'89' correspondingly</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
now appearing words and figures are 'one fifty nine' and '159’.’</p>

<blockquote>On the strength of the testimonies of the chair­man and poll clerk of
this precinct, after rigid question­ing by the Commissioners and counsels for
both parties, plus the certificate of votes issued and signed <span style="">by all </span>the board members with respect
to the votes of <span class="SpellE">Negre</span> and also the NBI report as
regards the votes of <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>, the Commission believes
that in the absence of any service­able copy of the election return for
Precinct 19, the correct votes for the mayoralty candidates are: <span class="SpellE">Negre</span>, <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> - 73 votes; and <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> - 89 votes.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Precinct No. 21</u>: - The entries of votes for Mayor in the
different <span style="">copies </span>of the
election returns are as follows:<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>The chairman of this precinct, <span class="SpellE">Geminia</span> <span class="SpellE">Sumawang</span>, testified that after the board had completed the
entries of votes<span style=""> </span>and signed the
election returns, armed men entered the <span style="">polling
</span>place and told them to change the votes of <span class="SpellE">Negre</span>
by removing '60' votes and giving him <span style="">only
'9</span>' votes, while <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> votes were increased
from '119' to '179' votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This explains
the discrepancy of entries between the words and the figures among the
different copies of the election returns for Precinct 21.</blockquote>

<blockquote>From the foregoing election returns and declarations, the Commission
finds that the correct votes for the mayor­alty candidates <span style="">are: NEGRE, </span>ATANACIO - '69' votes; and
PACIS, PANTALECN - '119' votes.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Precinct No. 22</u>: - All the four copies of the election
returns for this precinct are clean in all respects. <span class="SpellE">Negre</span>
got '3' votes in words and figures; while <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> had
'174' in words and figures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the
board members signed it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the witness stand, the chairman of this precinct, <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Agadon</span>, declared that said
election return was prepared by the Poll Clerk but before they could finish it,
two strangers entered the polling place and told the poll clerk to change the
votes for the mayor, which are not reflected on the tally board; <span style="">that one </span>of the strangers called the
chairman and told him <span style="">to </span>sign
said election return, which <span style="">he did and </span>then
<span style="">the </span>strangers left; that he
signed the certificate of <span style="">votes </span>issued
to the LP watcher and found that it tallies with the correct votes shown by the
tally board, which is '83’ for <span class="SpellE">Negre</span>; and when they
returned on November 16, after the shooting the day before, they placed all the
documents <span style="">in </span>the
ballot box except the tally sheet which <span style="">was </span>missing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The LP inspector, Santiago <span class="SpellE">Udaundo</span>,
corroborated the testimony of the chairman <span style="">as </span>regards the votes for mayor, which
he further declared in his affidavit dated November 22, 1967, that the tally
board of said precinct shows <span style="">that </span><span class="SpellE">Negre</span> obtained 83 votes and <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>
got 94 <span style="">votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He </span>reaffirmed all the statements
appearing <span style="">in
said </span>affidavit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the other hand, the poll clerk, Juan <span class="SpellE">Holnagan</span>,
and the NP Inspector, Alberto <span class="SpellE">Lagadon</span>, disclaimed the
testimonies of the chairman and LP Inspector.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span style="">former
insisted </span>that <span class="SpellE">Negre</span> really obtained '3' <span style="">votes as it appears
in the tally sheet </span>and tally board, yet when told to explain why he
signed the certificate of votes showing that <span class="SpellE">Negre</span>
got '83' votes, he explained that they were rushing at that time end that the
entry of votes therein was not made by him but the LP watcher.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">NP Inspector, when shown </span>the same certificate
of votes, stated that he did not look at the figure for mayor when he signed
it, <span style="">as </span>they
were then rushing because of the gunfire, and further declared that he <span style="">was </span><span style="">not the one who placed the votes </span>for <span class="SpellE">Negre</span>
in said certificate, and he insisted that the election return reflects <span style="">the votes </span>on
the tally sheet and tally board.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Commission, however, finds, that there is more reason to
believe that the chairman and the LP inspector are telling the truth in that
the election return for Precinct 22 is <u>no return at all</u> with <span style="">respect to the
office of mayor, for not only </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">it prepared at the point of </span>a gun but also
other surrounding circumstances belie <span style="">its </span>authenticity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been observed that this is the <span style="">only clean copy, in
all respects, </span>among the four precincts situated in the <span class="SpellE">Namuac</span> Elementary School; that the dis­parity of votes
between the two mayoralty candidates, <span style="">i.e. '3</span>'<span style=""> </span>against '<span style="">174' </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">too </span>big and
follows the same trend of tampering as in Precincts 18, 19 <span style="">and </span>21; that the tally sheet and tally
board in this precinct are also missing although no tampering appears on the
return; that as early <span style="">as </span>November
22, 1967, the LP inspector, in a sworn statement declared, that the election
return in Precinct 22 does not reflect the result of the election as appearing
in the tally sheet and tally board; and that the certificate of votes issued in
behalf of the LP watcher, signed by all the board members, shows a different
number of votes for candidate <span class="SpellE">Negre</span>, than what
appears in the election return.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Neither would it be of any help if the ballot box will be opened
and we were to look for other election documents, since the tally sheet and
tally board are <span style="">missing and </span>the
ballot box itself was left open from the morning of November 15, 1967 up to the
afternoon of November 16, 1967".</blockquote>

averment of lack of appellate jurisdiction in this Court; that petitioner has
no cause of action because if the votes in Precincts 19, 21 and 22 were
disregarded for being falsified, it would result in a bigger margin of victory
for respondent <span class="SpellE">Negre</span>; and that judicial recount is
not proper where all the copies of the election returns are tampered with and
especially because the ballot boxes were left open for more than 24 hours.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the petition, the returns thereto, and the memoranda of the

<p class="NUM">1. <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> broad power under the
Constitution and the statutes has gained judicial approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rationale is that <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
is entrusted with the "enforcement and administration of all laws relative
to the conduct of elections" and the authority to decide "all
administrative questions, affecting elections" – all of which rest upon
the purpose of <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>: to insure free, orderly and
honest elections<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, the diversity of election frauds and anomalies that have been concocted
by rival parties, surpassing legislative anticipation and scuttling the
prescribed manner of con­<span style="">ducting
elections, </span>necessitate resort to <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span>
general power of administration and supervision.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has set down the rule that when returns are obviously
manufactured or palpably irregular, the canvassing board may reject them.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>The

made by the board.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
But, it is to be <span class="GramE">emphasized,</span> this power to reject
returns must be exercised with "extreme caution".<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Popular will must not be suppressed at the

<p class="BODY">"Clean elections", <span style="">we </span>have said in the first <span class="SpellE"><u>Pacis</u></span>
case, "control the appropriateness of the remedy".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This we will have to underscore once
again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Because acts of
terrorism or fraud the purpose of which <span style="">is
</span>to destroy the integrity of election returns must have to be
discouraged.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, they may
eventually defeat the will of the majority and, <span style="">as </span>Chief Justice <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Concepcion</span></span><span style=""> has </span>emphasized,
would "undermine the foundation of our democracy".<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>

the voters"<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">gives </span><span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
authority to <span style="">ascertain </span>whether
the genuineness of a given election return may yet be salvaged by an
examination of the said return.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, hindsight has long confirmed our view that the
unscrupulous finds illegal doctoring of election returns as an effective short
cut to prevent the proclamation of the true winner and leave him to the long
tedious task of an election protest – if the aggrieved party still has the
means to undergo the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Which, <span style="">as </span>well

<span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> then must strain every effort to ascertain
the true returns to be used in the <span style="">proclamation,
a </span>possible alternative being that the victor will be <span class="GramE">cheated</span>
of his <span style="">victory; </span>the <span style="">seat </span>that is justly his will be
occupied by one rejected at the polls; our democratic institutions will suffer
in integrity.</p>

<p class="BODY">With these thoughts to guide us, we first look into Pre­cinct 19.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> made a thorough investigation
concerning the alleged <span style="">irregularities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It even made use of the services of
the NBI to deter­mine the original erased entry for <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>
and the testimony of the chairman and poll clerk of the precinct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was there ascertained that <span class="SpellE">Negre</span> obtained 73 votes, to <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>'
89.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is no abuse of discretion on
the part of <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the true result of the voting in Precinct 19 could still be
determined, it is within <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> power to direct
that they be used in the canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
this <span style="">was </span>done.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>With respect to Precinct
21, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> directed the board to use the <span class="SpellE">untampered</span> portion of the copy for the provincial treasurer
which is <span style="">the </span>entry <u>written</u>
<u>in</u> <u>words</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The entry being
by long hand <span style="">was </span>harder to
change and any tampering here would have been easier to detect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">tamperers</span> in
their rush must have left it as it is.</p>

<p class="BODY">As deserving of serious consideration is the directive of <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> rejecting <span style="">the
</span>entries for Mayor in all election return copies for Precinct <span class="GramE">22.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will be
recalled that in <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> resolution of May 11,
1968, it was found that all the four copies of the election returns for this
precinct are clean in all respects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Negre</span> got "3" votes in words and figures, while <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> had "174”, also in words and figures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They all bear the signatures of all the board
members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But then, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
found that it was prepared "at the point of a gun" and that
"other surrounding circumstances belie <span style="">its </span>authenticity".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These circumstances we need not repeat.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Reference to the quoted portion of the resolution of May 11 heretofore
transcribed will suffice.</p>

<p class="BODY">We must now <span style="">say </span>that
an election return prepared at the point of a gun is no return at all; it is
not one notch above a falsified or spurious return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> <span style="">was </span>correct in ruling that there was no
valid return for the office of Mayor at Precinct 22 and that no vote should be
counted for said precinct in the canvass of votes for Mayor.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. One of the prayers of the petition herein is that this Court
order the board of canvassers to file a petition for the recount of votes as
far as Precincts 19, 21 and 22 are concerned.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We find this wholly unacceptable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nothing in the election code would give the court power to compel
the board of canvassers to file <span style="">a </span>petition
for recount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would seem thus that
such a petition for recount should be a voluntary act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">For indeed, Section 163 of
the Code <span style="">says </span>that such a
petition may be submitted either by the board or by "any candidate
affected”.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">But we are confronted with tampered returns from Precinct 19 and
21.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner himself here asked that
the returns for these two precincts be declared <span style="">"<u>as</u> </span><u><span style="">falsified</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>As
to Precinct 22, we have said, and so did <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> <span class="GramE">say,</span> that the return for that precinct <span style="">is </span>no return at all; all the copies
thereof were made at the point of a gun.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These are the circumstances which would deter us from stamping our
approval to the petition under Section 163 of the Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, there is no discrepancy between the
different copies of the election returns.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, we find no reason why we should break away from our <span style="">ruling in </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Espino</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">vs</span></u><span style="">. </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Z</span></u><u><span style="">aldiva</span></u><span style="">r</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>and <span class="SpellE"><u>Ong</u></span> <u>vs</u>. <u>Commission</u> <u>on</u> <u><span style="">Elections</span></u><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
that where election returns <span class="GramE">have</span> been tampered with,
the remedy is before the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> - which <span style="">was </span>done here not with the court of
first instance.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. Petitioner finally quibbles over the issue that two members of
the canvassing board, Rafael <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> and Segundo <span class="SpellE">Acdal</span>, were unable to attend the proclamation because of
improper service of notice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Surrounding facts press for recognition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They reflect in petitioner's appeal an
intention to unduly delay the proclamation his rival.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The notices were served on them by the
municipal treasurer of Sanchez Mira, in their known addresses in Manila.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
The municipal treasurer cannot be expected to do more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was <span class="GramE">a<span style="">&nbsp; </span>diligent</span> attempt to notify them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the two members of the canvassing board
aforesaid were <span style="">at able </span>to attend<span style=""> </span>the canvass, which was also held in
Manila, it is surprising that they could no longer be located for the purpose
of proclaiming <span class="SpellE">Negre</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's pose lacks credulity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the ten members were notified in the same
manner <span style="">by </span>the
municipal treasurer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Six of those who <span style="">receive </span>their notices attended the <span style="">proclamation </span>together with the
attorney for petitioner <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of the four members who were absent, one,
Carmelita <span class="SpellE">Calon</span>, refused the notice served on her
personally; and the other Jose <span class="SpellE">Cack</span>, Jr., whose
notice was received by his brother, was already inside the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
premises but deliberately stayed away from the meeting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is apparent from the actuations of the
latter two that there was an intention to delay further the proclamation
meeting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The absence of <span class="SpellE">Acdal</span> and Rafael <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> strikes
one as a similar maneuver.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Discernible
is a pattern to frustrate <span class="SpellE">Negre's</span> proclamation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Noteworthy too is that the canvass was finished on May 18, 1968
where <span class="SpellE">Negre</span> won.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><u>All</u> <u>the</u> <u>members</u> of the board were then
present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>All</u> <u>of</u> <u>them</u>
signed the statement of votes.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">The </span>absence or presence of
Rafael <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> and Segundo <span class="SpellE">Acdal</span>
during the subsequent meeting to proclaim the winner cannot change the result
of the canvass.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Negre</span>
would still be proclaimed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> and <span class="SpellE">Acdal</span> knew this.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the meeting was held with a quorum of <span style="">six members </span>out of the membership of
ten.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is elementary that a quorum may
act for the entire body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
proclamation is therefore valid.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, the proclamation is but a formal act to confirm the
canvass previously held.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is just a
ceremony which follows canvass <span style="">as </span>a matter of course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's complaint on this point -
considering the result <span style="">we </span>have heretofore reached - would lead nowhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>New proclamation would be an idle
ritual.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would not change the result;
it would only work delay in the already long delayed proclamation.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the reasons given, the resolution of the Commission on
Elections of May 11, 1968 is hereby confirmed; the preliminary mandatory
injunction heretofore issued is hereby dissolved; and the canvass of May 18,
1968, and the proclamation of May 21, 1968 declaring respondent <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Negre</span> as Mayor-elect of
the Municipality of Sanchez Mira, Province of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>,
are both declared valid and subsisting and of full force and effect.</p>
