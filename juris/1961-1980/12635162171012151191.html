				<BR><STRONG>MAKALINTAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">This is an administrative
case for disbarment instituted by Ernesto M. <span class="SpellE">Nombrado</span>
against <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> T. Hernandez, a member </span>of the
Philippine Bar, charging <span style="">to latter </span>with malpractice on two counts, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) <span style="">for having </span><span style="">appeared </span><span style="">as counsel for Crispin <span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span>
in a civil case for forcible entry against <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pansaon</span>, his former client, being the offended party </span>and
complainant, in a criminal case for serious physical injuries wherein <span class="SpellE">Eufemio</span> Velasco (<span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span>), a son
of Crispin, was the accused; and (2) for having appeared as counsel for the
accused and also for the complaining witness in Criminal Case No. 329 of the
Justice of the Peace Court <span style="">(now municipal Court) of <span class="SpellE">Baganga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> (now <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Oriental).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In
our resolution of January 14, 1963, we referred </span><span style="">this case for investigation to the Solicitor General, who in turn
endorsed it to the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> for </span><span style="">the same purpose, both complainant and
respondent being residents of <span class="SpellE">Baganga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Oriental.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When the case was set for hearing by the First Assistant Provincial
Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> respondent manifested and requested
that since the charges were the same as- those filed by the same complainant
against him in Disbarment Case No. 37 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, wherein a decision had already been rendered, the
records of said proceeding, together with the evidence adduced by the parties,
be forwarded to this Court, through the Solicitor General, for final
disposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant in turn
submitted his evidence in support of the charges against respondent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With respect to the first
count, it is undisputed that sometime in 1952 respondent was engaged by <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pansaon</span> as his counsel in
the prosecution of a criminal case for serious physical injuries entitled
"People vs. <span class="SpellE">Eufemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span>"
of the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Baganga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case
the accused was charged with having mauled <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pansaon</span> when the latter was seen within the perimeter of
the land then being disputed between said <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pansaon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eufemio's</span> father,
Crispin <span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>However</span><span style="">, </span><span style="">the case was dismissed when the complaining
witness failed to appear on the day of the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several years thereafter Crispin <span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span>, through respondent, filed a complaint for
forcible entry against <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pansaon</span>
and</span><span style=""> two </span><span style="">other persons, involving the same parcel of
land which was the root cause of the mauling incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants moved to disqualify respondent
from appearing as counsel for the plaintiff on the ground that he had
previously acted as counsel for <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pansaon</span> in the criminal case for physical injuries, but the
motion was subsequently withdrawn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the Justice of the Peace Court the plaintiff lost, but won in the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> on appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">When Disbarment Case No.
37 against respondent was heard in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pansaon</span> testified for petitioner and said that perhaps he
lost the forcible entry case because respondent had become privy to valuable
information about his claim of ownership of the parcel of land in question in
the course of their </span><span style="">attorney-and-client
relationship and must have used such information against him, including a
document obtained by respondent from notary public </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Abellanosa</span></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Respondent denied the truth of the foregoing
testimony and in turn declared that the only information he </span><span style="">obtained </span><span style="">from complainant <span class="SpellE">Pansaon</span> was about the
mauling incident itself - how it happened </span><span style="">and why he sustained the injuries; that he did not ask <span class="SpellE">Pan­saon</span> for any papers or documents in connection with
that </span>criminal case, except a medical certificate issued to him by the <span style="">attending physician; that in handling the forcible
entry case for Crispin <span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span> against </span>his
former client, he did not use against the latter any fact or information he
acquired in the course of their attorney-and-client relationship; and that if
there was any document he pre­sented in the forcible entry case it came from
Crispin <span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span> and not from notary public <span class="SpellE">Abellanosa</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Solicitor General is
of the opinion, and we </span>find no reason to disagree with him, that even if
respondent did not use against his client any information or evidence acquired
by him as counsel it cannot be denied that he did become privy to information
regarding the ownership of the parcel of land which was later litigated in the
forcible entry case, for it was the dispute over the land that triggered the
mauling incident which gave rise to the criminal action for physical
injuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court's remarks in <span class="SpellE">Hilado</span> vs. David, 84 Phil. 571, are apropos:</p>

<blockquote>"Communications between attorney and client are, in a great
number of liti­gations, a complicated affair, consisting of entangled relevant
and irrelevant, secret and well known facts:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the complexity of what is said in the course of dealings between an
attorney and client, inquiry of the nature suggested would lead to the
revelation, in advance of the trial, of other matters that might only further
prejudice the complainant's cause."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Whatever may be said as
to whether or not respondent utilized against his former client information
given to him in a professional capacity, the mere fact of their pre­vious
relationship should have precluded him from appearing as counsel for the other
side in the forcible entry case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
same case of <span class="SpellE">Hilado</span> vs. David, <u>supra</u>, this
Tribunal further said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Hence the necessity of setting down the
existence of the bare relationship of attorney and client as the yardstick for
testing incompatibility of interests.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This stern rule is designed not alone to prevent the dishonest <span class="SpellE">practicioner</span> from fraudulent conduct, but as well to <span style="">protect the honest lawyer from unfounded
suspicion of unprofessional practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> It is founded on principles
of public policy, of good taste.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As has
been said in another case, the question </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">not necessarily one
of the rights of the parties, but as to whether the attorney has adhered to
proper professional standard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With these
thoughts in mind, it behooves attorneys, like Caesar's wife, not only to keep
inviolate the client's confidence, but also to avoid the appearance of
treachery and double-dealing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only thus
can litigants be encouraged to entrust their secrets to their attorneys which
is of paramount importance in the administration of Justice."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This Court went even
further in San Jose vs. Cruz, 57 Phil. 792, wherein the respondent was charged
with mal­practice for having represented a </span><span style="">new </span><span style="">client whose interests were opposed to those of his former client in
another case:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">x</span></span><span class="GramE"> .</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>An attorney owes loyalty to his client not
only in the case in which he has represented him but also after the relation of
attorney and client has terminated and it is not good practice to permit him
afterwards to defend in another case other person against his former client
under the <span style="">pretext that the case </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">distinct from, and independent of the former
case."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under the first count,
respondent has </span><span style="">shown a </span><span style="">departure from
the strict norms of professional conduct laid down for members of the bar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under the second count,
it appears that respondent was counsel for the defendants <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pontawe</span> and <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Aumada</span> in Criminal Case No. 329 for theft of large cattle
before the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Baganga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before the sche</span>duled hearing on
September 18, 1959, upon request of complaining witness Ramon Morales,
respondent prepared a motion to dismiss on the ground that the "real
accused in this case are not the above-named persons." Notwithstanding the
motion to dismiss, the complaining witness was cited to appear on September 25,
1959 "to find out why Mr. Ramon Morales, the complainant of Criminal Case
No. 329, did not appear on September 18, 1959, the date designated for pre­liminary
investigation proper of this case, and to find out whether the manifestation of
counsel of the defense that there is such amicable settlement in this case,
Criminal Case No. 329, is true." During the hearing on <st1:date year="1959" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1959</st1:date>, a heated exchange
of argument arose between respondent and the private prosecutor, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Danao</span>, because of the latter's insistence on calling
Morales to the Witness stand despite his expressed desistance to prosecute the
criminal case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent manifested his
intention to "intervene in behalf of the complaining party in connection
with the action of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> in this particular
case."</p>

<p class="BODY">We concur with the Solicitor General's view that under the
foregoing circumstances, respondent's act of preparing the motion to dismiss
and stating in the course of the hearing thereof that he was intervening
"in behalf of the complaining party", did not constitute simultaneous
appearance in behalf of the contending parties since there was no longer any
con­flict to speak of, the complainant having desisted from prosecuting the
case against the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
there was nothing improper in respondent's conduct.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the facts established in connection with the first count the
Solicitor General has recommended that the penalty of reprimand and warning be
administered, citing the decision of this Court in a comparable case, <span class="SpellE">Caoibes</span> vs. de la Rosa, 27 Phil. 265.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">We </span>believe the recommendation <span style="">is </span>justified.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, respondent <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> T.
<span style="">Hernandez </span>is hereby reprimanded
and warned that a repetition of unprofessional conduct on his part will be
dealt with more severely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let this
decision be noted in respondent's record <span style="">as </span><span style="">a </span>member of the Bar.</p>
