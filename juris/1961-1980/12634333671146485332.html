<p class="BODY">Petitioner filed on <st1:date year="1979" day="8" month="1">January
 8, 1979</st1:date> with this Court the pre­sent petition for review on
certiorari of respondent appellate court's judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon receipt of respondents' comment as
required in its Resolution of January 17, 1979, the Court in its March 5, 1979
Reso­lution resolved "to GIVE LIMITED DUE COURSE to the petition, only as
to Item (b) of the judgment of the lower court as affirmed by the Court of
Appeals, referring to the allegedly excessive compensatory damages awarded in
the amount of P309,920.00 x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>,
" and required the parties to submit their respective memoranda on this
limited issue which were filed in due course.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent court found as "reasonable" the amount of
P309<span class="GramE">,920.00</span> awarded as compensatory damages by the
trial court, which had estimated the same in this wise:</p>

<blockquote>"When the life of Carmen Mariano was un­timely snapped she was
only 39 years of age, in good health (Exhibit 'E' - 'E-2') and gainfully employed
with the General Telephone Directory Co. receiving a monthly salary of
P1,160.00 (Exhibit 'F').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without taking
into consideration anymore the regular annual increase of salary of the deceased
(Exhibit 'F-2’), had not her untimely death supervened, in her next 26 more
years until her 65th year, she would have earned P309<span class="GramE">,920.00</span>
deducting already some P2,000.00 as taxes (Exhibit 'K') and miscellaneous from
her annual income of P13,920.00 [26 years x P11,920.00 = P309,920.00]."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent court had further rejected petitioner's objection to
the Court's estimate of the deceased's life expectancy at 26 years more,
affirming the trial <span class="GramE">court's</span> findings on the basis of
the evidence that the deceased was in good physical health, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"As regards the compensatory damages awarded, while appellant
does not dispute the findings of the court a quo that Carmen G. Mariano's
earnings per month was P1<span class="GramE">,160.00</span> with the General
Telephone Directory and she was only 39 years old when she met the untimely
death, it however assails the ruling that the victim would still live for 26
years since her death on April 5, 1975, on the ground that while the victim was
still living she did not deliver a baby normally but by Caesarian
operation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">A cursory
reading of the Medical History and Physical Examination record (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> E, E-2) of the victim submitted by Mr. Mariano
reveals that indeed the victim was in good physical health otherwise the phrase
'fit to continue present occupation' could not have been placed in the
'remarks' portion of the record by the examining doctor."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the controlling case of <u>Villa <span class="SpellE">Rey</span>
Transit, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals</u><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
(where P33,333.33 for loss of net earnings of P1,000.00 per year x 33-1/3 years
of life expectancy were awarded) as reaffirmed in <u>Davila vs. Philippine Air
Lines</u><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
(where P195,000.00 - damages were awarded based on net earnings of P7,200.00
per year x 25 years of life expectancy), the Court stressed two factors in the
award of such compensatory damages, to wit, (1) "life expectancy is not
only relevant but also an important element in fixing the amount
recoverable" and (2) "earning capacity, as an element of damages to
one's estate for his death by wrongful act is necessarily his net earning
capacity or his capacity to acquire money, 'less the necessary expense for his
own living.' Stated otherwise, the amount recoverable is not loss of the entire
earning, but rather the loss of that portion of the earnings which the
beneficiary would have received.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, only net earnings, not gross earning, are to be considered, that
is, the total of the earnings less expenses necessary in the creation of such
earnings or income and less living and other incidental expenses."</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, citing the Villa <span class="SpellE">Rey</span>
doctrine, contends in its petition that the maximum damages that should be
awarded would amount to only P103<span class="GramE">,680.00</span> based on its
contention that the victim's life expectancy should be 24 years (not 26 years)
and net earnings only at P4,320.00 a year, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The deceased Carmen G. Mariano, at the time of her death, was
39 years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of the above
formula (2/3x 80-30) the deceased's normal life expectancy would be 24 years
and not 27 years [sic]) at that age of 39 years old, x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>, in the case at bar, the amount of at least <u>P800.00</u>
should be considered as reasonable monthly deduction from the income of the
deceased or the sum of <u>P9<span class="GramE">,600.00</span></u> a year.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The deceased's yearly income was P13<span class="GramE">,920.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Less the above amount of P9<span class="GramE">,600.00</span>,
the deceased's net earning capacity would, therefore, be only <u>P4,320.00</u>
a year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Multiply this amount by 24 years
(the deceased's normal life expectancy at age 39 years old, as above computed),
the amount due private respondent, as compensatory damages, will then be
P103,680.00 x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In its memorandum, petitioner would further reduce the life
expectancy of the deceased Carmen G. Mariano to 20 years instead of 24 years,
arguing that "while it may be said that at the time of her death, Carmen
G. Mariano was in relatively good health, yet undergoing a major surgery such
as caesarian operation is a circumstance that would have affected her normal
life expectancy and this fact should be considered as further allowance and
hence, for purposes of this case, her life expectancy may be reduced further to
<u>20 years,</u>" and on this basis "(T)he deceased's yearly income
was P13,920.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Less the amount of P9<span class="GramE">,600.00</span>, the deceased's <u>net earning</u> capacity would,
therefore, be only P4,320.00 a year.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Multiply this amount by <u>20 years</u> (her normal life expectancy as
hereinbefore computed by us), the amount due private respondent, as
compensatory damages, will then be only <u>P86<span class="GramE">,400.00</span>.</u>"<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents, on the other hand, contend that in the absence of a
clear <span class="GramE">showing</span> that the determination of the amount of
compensatory damages based on life expectancy and the net earning capacity of
the deceased is manifestly arbitrary or excessive, such award should be
sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">All factors considered, the Court believes that it is fair and
reasonable to fix the deductible living and other expenses of the de­ceased at
the sum of P4<span class="GramE">,800.00</span> a year or P400.00 a month
(one-half of the amount of P9,600.00 a year or P800.00 a month urged by petitioner),
since the deceased's husband had also his own earnings and this sum would be
her fair share of the family's expenses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner has expressly conceded the deceased's life expectancy to be
at 20 to 24 years, <u>supra</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All in
all, the Court believes that an award of P200,000.00 as compensatory damages by
way of the deceased's lost earnings is completely justified, under the facts of
the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(This would be roughly
based on an annual net earning of P9<span class="GramE">,120.00</span>
[P13,920.00 gross earnings less P4,800.00 annual expenses] x 22 years of life
expectancy = P200,640.00).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such award of
P200<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> for compensatory damages incidentally
coincides with the exact amount prayed for as compensatory damages for loss of
earning capacity in respondent's complaint.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This award of P200<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as
compensatory damages shall pertain in three equal one-third shares to
respondent and the two minor children born of respondent's marriage with the
deceased, namely Sergio Mariano, Jr. and Michael Mariano.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, judgment is hereby rendered reducing the
lower court's award of compensatory damages, as affirmed by respondent court,
to respondent and his two minor children, Sergio, Jr. and Michael, both
surnamed Mariano to the sum of P200<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> in three
equal one-third shares among them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since
the other items of damages awarded to respondent (P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
- moral damages, P20,160.00 - actual damages, P10,000.00 - attorney's fees and
costs of suit) in the trial court's judgment as affirmed by respondent court have
long become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> with the Court's
denial of the petition to review these items per its Resolution of March 5,
