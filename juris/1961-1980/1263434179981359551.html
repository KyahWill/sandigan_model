				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an automatic review of the judgment of the Circuit
Criminal Court of Manila, dated April 21, 1972, finding accused-appellants,
Jessie <span class="SpellE">Tapales</span> y Vargas and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Corañez</span>
y <span class="SpellE">Tatualla</span>, guilty of the crime of Robbery with
Homicide, with the mitigating circumstance of plea of guilty offset by the
aggravating circumstances of multiple Rape, use of motor vehicle and nighttime,
and sentencing both said accused to the extreme penalty of death.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Information filed against the accused charged them with the
crime of Robbery with Homicide and Rape as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about October 28, 1971, at nighttime purpose­ly
sought to better accomplish their ends, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the
said accused, conspiring and confe­derating together with another, whose
identity and where­abouts are still unknown and helping one another, did then
and there <span class="SpellE">wil­fully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously, with
intent to gain and by means of force, violence and in­timidation to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>by boarding the taxi being then occupied by <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Calaykay</span> y <span class="SpellE">Baldonado</span> and Diana <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> y <span class="SpellE">Navales</span> while said vehicle was at a stop position at Jones
Bridge, in said City and pointing a <span class="SpellE">balisong</span> knife at
Diana <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> y <span class="SpellE">Navales</span> and a
gun at <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Calaykay</span> y <span class="SpellE">Baldo­nado</span>, take, steal and carry away against their will
and consent, one (1) men's wrist watch, "<span class="SpellE">Rado</span>"
brand, gold plated and one (1) brown wallet with cash money of undetermined
amount be­longing to said <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Calaykay</span>
y <span class="SpellE">Baldonado</span>, and Mexican money worth P2.00 and one
(1) Parker ball pen valued at P10.00 or a total value of P12.00 be­longing to
said Diana <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> y <span class="SpellE">Navales</span>,
to the damage and prejudice of said owners in the aforesaid respective amounts;
that by reason of and on the occasion of the said robbery, the said accused, in
furtherance of their conspiracy, did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>,
unlaw­fully and feloniously, with intent to kill, attack, assault and use
personal violence upon the person of <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Calaykay</span> y <span class="SpellE">Baldonado</span>, by then and
there shooting him twice with the gun and stabbing him with the <span class="SpellE">bali­song</span> knife on the chest, thereby inflicting upon him
mortal wounds which were the direct cause of his death thereafter; that by
reason of and on the occasion also of the said robbery, the said accused, in
furtherance of their conspiracy, did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>,
un­lawfully and feloniously and by means of force, vio­lence and intimidation,
to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>by threatening to stab and kill
the said Diana <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> y <span class="SpellE">Navales</span>
with said <span class="SpellE">balisong</span> knife and firearm, which they were
holding then at the time, succeed in having sexual intercourse with her, one
after the other, all against her will and consent.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Contrary to law and with the generic
aggravating circumstances of the use of motor vehicle and employment of craft
in the commission of said offense."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, appellants, through their counsel <u>de</u> <u>officio</u>,
manifested their desire to enter a plea of guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial Court duly informed them of the
gravity of the offense and the imposable penalty <span class="SpellE">there­for</span>
of life imprisonment or death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
asked by the Court whether they understood the full consequences of a plea of
guilty, both answered affirmatively.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They admitted to the Court that they robbed <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Calaykay</span> and Diana <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> and
that they killed the former when he shouted, "hold-up".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, both of them denied having raped
Diana <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> contending that she had consented to have
carnal knowledge with them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court
below, citing the case of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Mongado</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
where Rape was considered a generic aggravating circumstance to the crime of
Robbery with Homicide, considered appellants to have entered an unconditional
plea of guilty to the offense of Robbery with Homicide,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and proceeded to receive evidence to ascertain not only the existence of rape
but also of attendant modifying circumstances that could affect criminal
liability.</p>

<p class="BODY">Diana <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> narrated the incident as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On October 27, 1971 at around
11:00 o'clock in the evening, Diana <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>, 20 years
old, married but estranged from her husband, <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Katigdas</span>, was in the company of her boyfriend of six
months, <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Calaykay</span>,
32 years old, single, at the Jai Alai Bamboo Room, Taft Avenue, Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After some betting, <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>
invited Diana for a snack at the International House at <span class="SpellE">Ongpin</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Binondo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
left the Jai Alai at around <st1:time minute="45" hour="23">11:45 P.M.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp; </span>They then hailed a taxicab parked in front of
the <span style="">Keg </span>Room of Jai Alai.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both sat at the rear of the taxi, Diana
sitting at the left side and <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> sitting at the
right side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they were at the middle
of <st1:place><st1:placename>Jones</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Bridge</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
the driver stopped and said, "Pare, just a while, the right door of the
taxi is open." He opened and closed the right front door four times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this juncture, two men alighted from a
taxicab immediately behind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One armed
with a knife, identified by Diana as Pedro <span class="SpellE">Corañez</span>,
approached the taxi from the left and the other, armed with a gun, identified
by Diana as Jessie <span class="SpellE">Tapales</span>, approached the taxicab
from the right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As they entered the
taxicab they said "this is a hold-up, we only need money." Inside the
taxicab, Jessie <span class="SpellE">Tapales</span> divested <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>
of his "<span class="SpellE">Rado</span>" wrist watch, while Pedro <span class="SpellE">Corañez</span> ransacked Diana's bag and took her
"Parker" ball pen worth P10.00 and Mexican money worth P2.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While Diana and <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>
were being robbed, the taxicab driver continued driving down to the foot of
Jones <span class="GramE">bridge</span> where he made <span style="">a </span>"U" turn, proceeded up the bridge, made a right turn
on <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Drive</st1:address></st1:street>,
went straight ahead until they reached the Fire Department at <span class="SpellE">Intramuros</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this
point, <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> shouted, "hold-up, <span class="GramE">hold</span>-up".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instantly, <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> was stabbed by <span class="SpellE">Corañez</span> and shot by <span class="SpellE">Tapales</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A commotion ensued inside the taxicab
prompting the driver to tell <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>, "<span class="GramE">pare</span>, <span class="SpellE">tumalon</span> ka <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">lamang</span>." Diana then
grappled with <span class="SpellE">Corañez</span> for the possession of the knife
while <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>, already wounded, squeezed himself out
of the right window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>
fell in the middle of Del Pan <span class="GramE">bridge</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With Diana still inside the taxicab, <span class="SpellE">Tapales</span> ordered the driver to proceed to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tapales</span> then pulled
down Diana's pants and panty, mashed her breasts and inserted his fingers into
her private parts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While <span class="SpellE">Tapales</span> was abusing Diana, <span class="SpellE">Corañez</span>
was also kissing her, his right hand around Diana's shoulders and his left hand
poking a knife at her left side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Scared
and trembling, Diana pleaded that she be spared as she was pregnant but said
pleas were in vain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the way to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>, Diana noticed that
they took the <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Balintawak</span>
and Highway route.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tapales</span>
introduced himself as "Fernando" and <span class="SpellE">Corañez</span>
as "Johnny".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before reaching <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Corañez</span>
suggested to <span class="SpellE">Tapales</span> that they proceed to the place
of <span class="SpellE">Tapales</span>' "<span class="SpellE">kapatid</span>"
at <span class="SpellE">Kamuning</span> which, however, was objected to by <span class="SpellE">Tapales</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tapales</span> opted to look for a vacant lot in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they found one, they ordered the driver
to stop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Diana was ordered to alight,
followed by <span class="SpellE">Corañez</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After apparently taking instructions from <span class="SpellE">Tapales</span>,
the driver left the place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About six
meters from where they alighted, <span class="SpellE">Corañez</span> forced Diana
to lie on the wet cogon grass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tapales</span> then placed his jacket on the grass where Diana was
made to lie down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There and then <span class="SpellE">Corañez</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tapales</span> took turns in
raping her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although Diana admitted that
<span class="SpellE">Tapales</span> and <span class="SpellE">Corañez</span> did not
make use of their weapons when they reached the vacant lot, she claimed that
she submitted to their bestial acts as she was too weak and terribly scared to
resist the appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After that, Diana
asked appellants to get another taxicab but <span class="SpellE">Tapales</span>
told her that the taxi they took would return, as in fact, it did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The three of them boarded the taxi and they
cruised around the other street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Diana
was finally dropped off behind the <span class="SpellE">Carbungco</span>
restaurant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before alighting from the
taxi, appellants gave Diana P8.00 and threatened to kill her if she reported
the matter to the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite the
threats, Diana told the people around of her dread­ful experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One took pity on her and took her to a
policeman in a restaurant near the Center Theatre.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The policeman instructed them to proceed to
Precinct 8 where she reported the incident to Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Libao</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>An Advance Information or Alarm Report<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
was forthrightly issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While in the
precinct, Diana saw the shoes of <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, Diana was taken by the police to the
morgue where she identified the dead body of <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next morning Diana was physically
examined by one Dr. Lucero at Precinct 2.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After some sleuthing, the police apprehended appellants, but the
two taxicab drivers remained at large.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellants admitted culpability in their sworn statements.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In open Court, Jessie <span class="SpellE">Tapales</span> declared
that he was invited by Pedro <span class="SpellE">Corañez</span> to commit
Robbery and admitted the commission of that crime as well as Homicide and Rape.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
For his part, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Corañez</span>, while admitting the
commission of Robbery with Homi­cide, denied having raped Diana <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> contending that it was she who suggested that they look
for a vacant lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pedro <span class="SpellE">Corañez</span> even testified that he was constrained to have
carnal knowledge with Diana <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> des­pite the fact
that the place was stinking with human excreta.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On cross examination, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Corañez</span> admitted
that he and Jessie <span class="SpellE">Tapales</span> conspired with two taxi
drivers known as <span class="SpellE">Pintong</span> (driver of the taxi taken by
the victims), and Bruno <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> (driver of the taxi
used by appellants in following the taxi of the victims) in the commission of
robbery.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial Court gave full credence to the spon­taneous and
straight-forward testimony of Diana <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>, and held:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court cannot subscribe to the claim of the accused that
Diana <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> voluntarily agreed to have carnal knowledge
with them and was even the one who invited them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is indeed highly inconceivable how Diana <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>, who was already robbed and who, by reason or on the
occasion of the robbery her boyfriend died would still have the sexual
urge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">x</span></span><span class="GramE"> "</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="21" month="4">April 21, 1972</st1:date>,
the trial Court handed down its Decision, the <span class="SpellE">decretal</span>
portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, both accused are hereby found guilty beyond
reasonable doubt as principals of the crime of robbery with homicide and there
being proved the aggravating circumstances of multiple rapes, the use of motor
vehicle and nighttime offset only by the mitigating circumstance of their plea
of guilty, the court sentences each one of them to DEATH; to jointly and
severally indem­nify the heirs of the victim <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Calaykay</span> the sum of P12,000.00 for the death of the latter;
the sum of P10,000.00<span style="">&nbsp; </span>for moral damages;
the sum of P10,000.00 for exemplary damages; and to return to the heirs of vic­tim
<span class="SpellE">Calaykay</span> the <span class="SpellE">Rado</span> watch and
the black wallet with cash taken from <span class="SpellE">Calaykay</span>.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Court further orders<span style=""> </span>the said accused to jointly and severally indemnify the victim
Diana <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>, the sum of P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
for moral damages; the sum of P10,000.00 for exem­plary damages; and to return
to her the cash and articles taken from her or to jointly and severally
indemnify her in the amount of P12.00 representing the value <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> if they fail to do so and to pay the costs."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this mandatory review.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants, through counsel <u>de</u> <u>officio</u> ascribe the
following errors to the trial Court, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"I. THE TRIAL
COURT ERRED IN CONSIDERING RAPE AS AN AGGRAVATING CIRCUMS­TANCE IN THIS CASE;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"II. THE TRIAL
COURT ERRED IN CONSIDERING NIGHTTIME AS AN AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE IN THIS
CASE;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"III. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN SENTENCING APPELLANTS TO
DEATH."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find the errors assigned bereft of merit.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. This Court has consistently held that the legal definition of
the crime committed herein is Robbery with Homicide, with Rape being considered
an aggravating circumstance.</p>

<blockquote>"It is the uniform jurisprudence of the Supreme Court that
where the crime charged is robbery with homicide and rape, the le­gal
definition of the crime is robbery with homicide punishable under paragraph 1,
Article 294 of the Penal Code; and the rape committed on the occasion of that
crime is considered an aggravating circumstance (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Ganal</span>,
85 Phil. 743, 751; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Bacsa</span>, 104 Phil. 136,
142; and People vs. <span class="SpellE">Tarrayo</span>, 27 SCRA 953 (1969).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>See also:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Carillo</span>, 85 Phil. 611, 635).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of ignominy, therefore, it is the
rape itself that aggravates (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Mongado</span>, 28
SCRA 642, 651-652, (1969)).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The defense argues, however, that the foregoing doctrine should
be re-examined and abandoned considering that there is no law that makes Rape
an aggra­vating circumstance nor one that classifies it as a generic
aggravating circumstance.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 294.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Robbery
with violence against or intimida­tion of persons</u> - Penalties. - Any person
guilty of robbery with the use of violence against or intimidation of any
person shall suffer:<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The penalty of <u>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></u> to death, when by reason or on occasion of the
robbery, the crime of homicide shall have been committed.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x"</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the special complex crime contemplated in the foregoing
provision does not include Rape.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, there can be no question, and this appellant admits in his
Brief, that Rape committed on the occasion of Robbery with Homicide increases
the moral evil of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
it is incorrect to state that there is no law which considers Rape as an
aggravating cir­cumstance simply because it is not specifically enu­merated in
Article 14 of the Revised Penal Code as an aggravating circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As enunciated in the case of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Racaza</span>, 82 Phil. 623, (1949),</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>Rapes, wanton robbery for personal gain, and
other bans of cruelties are condemned and their perpetration will be regarded
as aggravating cir­cumstances of ignominy and of deliberately augmenting
unnecessary wrongs to the main criminal objective, under paragraphs 17 and 21
of Article 14 of the Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Said paragraphs read thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 14.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aggravating
circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The following are
aggravating circums­tances:<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"<span class="GramE">xxx</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"17<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That</span> means be employed or circumstances brought about which add
ignominy to the natural effects of the act.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"<span class="GramE">xxx</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"21<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That</span> the wrong done in the commission of the crime be
deliberately augmented by causing other wrong not necessary for its
commission."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This Court's consistent ruling, therefore, which holds that when
Rape and Homicide co-exist in the commission of Robbery, it is paragraph 1 of
Article 294 which applies, the Rape to be considered as an aggravating
circumstance (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Ganal</span>, et al., 85 Phil. 743
(1950); People vs. <span class="SpellE">Carillo</span>, 85 Phil. 611 (1950);
People vs. <span class="SpellE">Bacsa</span>, 104 Phil. 136 (1958); People vs. <span class="SpellE">Tarrayo</span>, 27 SCRA 953 (1969); People vs. <span class="SpellE">Mongado</span>,
28 SCRA 643 (1969)), should be upheld, for a settled judicial construction put
upon a statute has almost the same authority as the statute itself, and this
Court will not disregard or overrule it except for the most cogent reasons.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Alternatively, appellants contend that even if the ruling that
Rape is an aggravating circumstance in Robbery with Homicide be upheld, the
crime of Rape herein should be considered, by time and distance, as a separate
and distinct offense from that of Robbery with Homicide because while the
Robbery was committed at Jones Bridge, the Homicide in <span class="SpellE">Intramuros</span>,
both in Manila, the Rape was committed in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While there may have been an appreciable interval of time between
the robbery and the killing, on the one hand, and the rape, on the other, there
can be no question but that there was a direct relation, an intimate connection
between them such that it can be stated, without fear of contradiction, that it
was by reason or on occasion of the Robbery that Homicide and Rape were
committed.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2. Appellants' contention that the trial Court erred in
considering nighttime as an aggravating circumstance is neither well
taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crime was committed between
the hour of <st1:time minute="45" hour="23">11:45 P.M.</st1:time>, and <st1:time minute="0" hour="1">1:00 A.M.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As early as <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 P.M.</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1971" day="27" month="10">October 27<span class="GramE">,1971</span></st1:date>,
both accused had already planned the robbery.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is evident that they purposely sought nighttime and took advantage of
it to facilitate the commission of the offense and to avoid discovery.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
In fact, when the victim <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Calaykay</span>
shouted "hold-up, hold-up", no one responded to his call because of
the lateness of the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he
forced himself out of the taxi and fell on <st1:place><st1:placename>Del Pan</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Bridge</st1:placetype></st1:place>, no one saw or noticed
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, because of the wee hours of
the morning, appellants were able to cruise around leisurely from <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>
looking for a vacant lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
meantime, both appellants, taking advantage of the darkness of night inside the
taxicab, were able, with impunity, to take liberties with the person of Diana <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In itself nighttime is not an aggravating circumstance, and
becomes one only where it is specially sought by the offender or taken
advantage of by him to facilitate the commission of the crime or to avoid dis­covery
and thus minimize the risk of capture"<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="NUM">3. Considering, therefore, that the commission of Robbery with
Homicide was attended by the circumstances of multiple rape, use of motor
vehicle, and nighttime, in aggravation, which overwhelmingly offset the lone
circumstance of plea of guilty, in mitigation, the accused-appellants, by the
law, must be meted out the extreme penalty of death.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
