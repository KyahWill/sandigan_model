				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by the Government of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
from the order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>
dismissing its amended complaint in Civil Case No. 699 against <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> <span class="SpellE">Songcuya</span> and Isidro
Labrador, on the ground of failure to prosecute, without special pronouncement
as to costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The action filed by appellant on March 24, 1954 was for <span style="">the </span>recovery of the sum of 24,224.30,
representing the total <span style="">amount </span>of
eleven (11) War Damage checks drawn on the National <span style="">City </span>Bank of New York (Manila Branch) in favor of <span class="SpellE">Sabel</span> <span class="SpellE">Ban<span style="">kono</span></span><span style=""> </span>and
10 other persons which <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> Labrador and <span class="SpellE">Songcuya</span> "endorsed x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> to the plaintiff Government of the Philippines"
(Record on Appeal p. 12).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the
latter presented the 11 checks to the <span class="SpellE">drawee</span> bank,
the latter refused payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Whereupon appellant gave the corresponding notice of dishonor to both
<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> who refused payment.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In their separate answers <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
disclaimed liability and as special defense alleged that, as bonded postmaster
and money order clerk, respectively, they were authorized under an unnumbered
circular of the Bureau of Posts dated <st1:date year="1948" day="26" month="1">January
 26, 1948</st1:date> to pay the checks of war damage claimants, and that other <span class="SpellE">indorsers</span> of said checks were not <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was called for trial on <st1:date year="1955" day="10" month="10">October 10, 1955</st1:date> but as both
defendants asked for postponement without opposition on the part of the
provincial fiscal of <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Cotabato</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> the trial was postponed "until further
assignment".</p>

<p class="BODY">It was only on <st1:date year="1959" day="20" month="8">August
 20, 1959</st1:date> that the case was again called for trial, but as the
Director of Posts or his representative failed to appear, the provincial fiscal
of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> was constrained to move, in open court,
for postponement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same date,
however, the trial court denied the motion and dismissed the case on the ground
of appellant's failure to prosecute the case with diligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day - in fact, a few hours after
the dismissal of the case, the provincial fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>
filed a motion for reconsideration alleging that the denied motion for
postponement was his first request <span style="">for </span>postponement
and also attached to his motion for reconsideration a copy of a telegram from
the Bureau of Posts Inspector <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>, one of the witnesses for appellant, stationed in <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental
stating that he was unable to appear for lack of transportation but that he
would arrive on August 24.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Appellees</span> objected to the motion for
reconsideration alleging that sufficient time and notice had been given to
Inspector <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> to enable him to appear on the date
of the trial, and alleging furthermore that it was not shown that his testimony
was material to the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1959" day="20" month="11">November 20, 1959</st1:date>
the trial court not only denied the motion for reconsideration but in its order
stated inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span> the following:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court can not overlook the fact that the checks mentioned
in the complaint and which were paid by the defendant, were all signed by
witnesses who not only identified the payee but also guaranteed their
payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everything was done in the
ordinary course of business."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the order of dismissal the Government appealed to the Court
of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the only issue involved <span style="">is </span>a question of law, the latter
certified the <span style="">case </span>to <span class="GramE">Us</span> pursuant to <span style="">Sec. </span>31
in relation to Sec. 17 (6) of Act No. 296, as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record sufficiently shows that counsel for appellant was
constrained to ask for the postponement of the trial set for August 20, 1959,
not only because of the failure of the Director <span style="">of </span>Posts or his representative to appear and testify on that
date, but also because other witnesses for the government were not served with
the subpoenas issued by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, it appears that the failure of Post Office Inspector <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> to appear was
due to lack of transportation from the place where he was officially assigned
on duty to the place <span style="">of trial, for
which </span>reason he sent the telegram mentioned heretofore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lastly, the statement made by the trial judge
in his order denying appellant's motion for reconsideration quoted above seems
to be improper as, without due trial, he appears to have prejudged the merits
of the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">It can not be denied, of course, that there was failure on the
part of appellant to show <span style="">sufficient </span>interest
in the prosecution of its case because it allowed <span style="">four </span>years to elapse from the first date of trial before
securing another assignment of date.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering, however, the possibility that court sessions in the
jurisdiction where the case was pending were not continuous - for which reason
the Court itself seems to have forgotten <span style="">the
</span>case all together - and considering likewise the <span style="">fact </span>that <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> had also shown lack
of interest in having the case tried and disposed of, We feel that, in equity,
the order of dismissal - which by its terms would amount to a dismissal on the
merits - should not be allowed to stand to the prejudice of the claim of the
appellant entity.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b><span style="">, </span>the
appealed order is reversed and <span style="">set </span>aside,
and the case is remanded below for the corresponding proceedings.</p>
