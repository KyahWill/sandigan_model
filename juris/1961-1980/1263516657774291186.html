				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del Norte dismissing the petition for <i style="">certiorari</i> filed by Felipe <span class="SpellE">Ganob</span> and others praying for the annulment of the decision
rendered by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources in DANR Case No.
670-A in which the parties were petitioners, on the one hand, and <span class="SpellE">Leodegario</span> <span class="SpellE">Ramas</span> on the other.</p>

<p class="BODY">After an examination of the record <span class="GramE">We</span>
agree with the trial court that the following material facts were established
by the evidence:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1930" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1930</st1:date>
<span class="SpellE">Ireneo</span> <span class="SpellE">Quidato</span> filed Sales
Application No. 14185 (E-265) for Lot No. 47, PLS-35, <span class="SpellE">Kapatagan</span>
Subdivision located in <span class="SpellE">Kapatagan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1933" day="13" month="2">February
 13, 1933</st1:date> the land applied for was awarded to him as a, result of a
public auction held on October 28 of the previous year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, his application was cancelled on <st1:date year="1935" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1935</st1:date> for nonpayment of
the first to the fourth installments due under the award.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Leodegario</span> <span class="SpellE">Ramas</span>
- now deceased and substituted by his heirs, <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ramas</span> and others - having become interested in the
acquisition of the same lot No. 47, inquired from the Bureau of Lands whether
or not he could acquire whatever rights <span class="SpellE">Quidato</span> had
thereon, to which the Bureau, on September 13, 1937, replied that the sales
application of <span class="SpellE">Quidato</span> may be reinstated upon payment
of the first to the fourth installments plus the interest due thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, or more specifically, on August
2, 1937, a deed of transfer of rights was executed by <span class="SpellE">Quidato</span>
in favor of <span class="SpellE">Ramas</span> (Exhibit 12 and 15 for the
Secretary and Director of Lands; Exhibit 4 for <span class="SpellE">Ramas</span>
and Exhibit <span style="">J </span>for petitioners),
and on the 12th of the same month <span class="SpellE">Ramas</span> paid the
total amount of P937.82 to the Bureau of Lands (Exhibit 29 for the Di­rector of
Lands and Exhibit L for petitioners).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
January 6, 1938 the Director of Lands reinstated the sales appli­cation of <span class="SpellE">Quidato</span> (Exhibit 14 for the Secretary and 17 for the
Director; Exhibit 6 for <span class="SpellE">Ramas</span> and Exhibit M for peti­tioners)
and an order was issued on the same date directing the District Land Officer
concerned to conduct an investi­gation in connection with the transfer of
rights aforesaid (Exhibit 3 and 16 for the Secretary and Director respectively;
Exhibit 5 for <span class="SpellE">Ramas</span> and Exhibit B-2 for
petitioners).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pur­suant thereto, Public
Land Inspector Benito M. <span class="SpellE">Napoles</span> con­ducted the
corresponding investigation and subsequently sub­mitted his report dated June
29, 1939 (Exhibit 32 for the Director of Lands and Exhibit P-1 for petitioners)
wherein he stated, among other things, that <span class="SpellE">Ireneo</span> <span class="SpellE">Quidato</span> had al­ready complied with the cultivation
requirements of the lot and that his application was free from adverse <span style="">claims </span>and conflicts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1939" day="14" month="9">September
 14, 1939</st1:date>, the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources
approved said transfer of rights (Exhibit 15 and 18 for the Secretary and
Director of Lands respectively, and Exhibit 7 for <span class="SpellE">Ramas</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Immediately after the transfer of rights, <span class="SpellE">Ramas</span>
occupied the land and introduced improvements thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the Cadas­tral Survey of Lands located in <span class="SpellE">Kapatagan</span>, the land in question was surveyed and designated
<span style="">as </span>Lot No. 47, and the only
survey claimant thereto was <span class="SpellE">Leodegario</span> <span class="SpellE">Ramas</span> (Exhibit 1 and 1-A for the Director).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result of his occupation, at the
outbreak of the Second World War more than fifty hectares of the area of the
land had already been cultivated by him (Exhibits 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, and 30 for the
Director), and on June 26, 1941, he paid the Bureau of Lands the amount of
P432.12 to complete the payment of the purchase price (Exhibit 19 and 16 for
the Director and Secretary respectively, and Exhibit 8, <span class="SpellE">Ramas</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">It seems that during the <span style="">war
</span>years, due to the prevailing confusion and disorder, <span class="SpellE">Ramas</span>’
possession of the land was not complete.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This enabled petitioners to enter and take possession thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the war, however, as <span class="SpellE">Leodegario</span> <span class="SpellE">Ramas</span> had already
died, his heirs went to the land in question to resume its occupation and
cultivation, but they found petitioners in occupancy.</p>

<p class="BODY">If the basic petition filed below is to prosper, it is clear that
petitioners are in duty bound to make out <span style="">a </span>clear <span style="">case </span>to
this effect: either that the Director of the Bureau of Lands and the Secretary
of Agriculture and Natural Re­sources had no jurisdiction over the subject
matter of the decisions or orders sought to be annulled, or that, in rendering
or issuing them, they acted in excess of their jurisdiction or with grave abuse
of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the facts <span class="SpellE">setforth</span> above which, as
already stated, are completely borne out by the evidence of record, <span class="GramE">We</span> are of the opinion, and so hold, that said officials
acted within the scope of their respective jurisdiction under the law and
committed no error nor grave abuse of discretion in rendering or issuing the
decisions or orders aforesaid.</p>

<p class="BODY">That the lot in question was applied for and subsequently awarded
in accordance with law to <span class="SpellE">Ireneo</span> <span class="SpellE">Quidato</span>,
and that thereafter he entered into possession thereof and had already
cultivated an area of more than fifty hectares when the last World War broke
out, is a finding of fact made by the respondent officials, and this <span style="">is </span>fully supported by the evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that for nonpayment of the first four install­ments
which <span class="SpellE">Quidato</span> was under obligation to pay to the
Government, his application was cancelled on October 31, 1935, but it is
nonetheless true that, subsequently, or more specifical­ly on January 6, 1938,
said application was reinstated by the Director of Lands and that even prior to
that date, the sum of P937.82 was paid to the government on account of the
installments in arrears by <span class="SpellE">Leodegario</span> <span class="SpellE">Ramas</span> to whom <span class="SpellE">Quidato</span> had
transferred his rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That said
transfer was subse­quently approved is unmistakably shown by the fact that
after its execution and the payment of the arrearages, the Bureau of Lands,
through Public Land Inspector <span class="SpellE">Napoles</span>, investigated
the propriety thereof, and after said investigation he recommended its approval
in a report dated <st1:date year="1939" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1939</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span style="">a
</span>result, on <st1:date year="1939" day="14" month="9">September 14, 1939</st1:date>
the Secretary of Agri­culture and Natural Resources approved it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These events were followed by <span class="SpellE">Ramas</span> occupying the land applied for and cultivating the
same up to <span style="">an area </span>of more than
fifty hectares before the outbreak of the last World War.</p>

<p class="BODY">That the Bureau of Lands had authority to reinstate the cancelled
application of <span class="SpellE">Quidato</span> - as it did by its order of
January 6, 1938, that is, more than one year before the herein petitioners had
intruded into the land in question - can not be doubted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Public lands are placed under the
administration of said Bureau for final disposition in favor of citizens who
apply for them in accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It can not be doubted that the reinstatement of a cancelled sales
application, which cancellation was due exclusively to non-payment of the
installments due under the award, is undoubted­ly a matter within the sound
discretion of the Director of the Bureau of Lands, and if his action thereon
was subsequent­ly approved, expressly or impliedly, by the Department Head, it <span style="">is </span>clear that it becomes unassailable
if all the proceed­ings were - as in this case - in accordance with law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, from the decision of the Secretary of Agriculture and
Natural Resources complained of, petitioners had a plain, speedy and adequate
remedy by appealing <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> to the Chief
Executive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, before filing
the present action for <i style="">certiorari</i> in
the court below, they should have availed of this administrative remedy and
their failure to do so must be deemed fatal to their case (<span class="SpellE">Calo</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Fuertes</span> et al., G. R. No. L-16537, <st1:date year="1962" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1962</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To place petitioners’ case, beyond the pale
of this rule, they must show that their case falls - which it does not - within
the cases where, in accordance with our decisions, the aggrieved party need not
exhaust administrative remedies within his reach in the ordinary course of the
law (<span class="SpellE">Tapales</span> vs. the President and the Board of
